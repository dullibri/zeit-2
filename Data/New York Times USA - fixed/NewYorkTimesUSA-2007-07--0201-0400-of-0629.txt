HEADLINE: China Quick To Execute Drug Official

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 10 

 BODY:
China executed its former top food and drug regulator on Tuesday for taking bribes to approve untested medicine, as the Beijing leadership scrambled to show that it was serious about improving the safety of Chinese products.
 The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court carried out the death sentence against Zheng Xiaoyu, 62, the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, shortly after the country's Supreme Court rejected his final appeal.
 Mr. Zheng, who had appealed his May 29 sentence on the grounds that it was too severe and that he had confessed to the bribery charges against him, became the first ministerial-level official put to death since 2000 and the fourth since China opened its doors to the outside world nearly 30 years ago.
 The official Xinhua news agency announced the execution, but did not say how Mr. Zheng was killed. In most cases, the court police execute prisoners by shooting them in the back of the head, though recently the police have also used lethal injections. 
 China carries out more court-ordered executions than the rest of the world combined, according to human rights groups. But the sentence against Mr. Zheng was unusually harsh and its execution uncommonly swift.
 The country's Supreme Court has recently made a highly publicized effort to show that it carefully reviews all death sentences and that it has restricted the power of local courts to impose them.
 But Mr. Zheng's case appears to have served a political purpose, allowing senior leaders to show that they have begun confronting the country's poor product-safety record. Shoddy or dangerous goods, including drugs, pet food and car tires, have damaged its reputation abroad, especially in the United States.
 China is the world's largest exporter of consumer products, and tainted goods represent a small fraction of the country's more than $1 trillion in annual exports. But officials clearly worry that protectionist forces in the United States could use the spate of quality problems to restrict trade.
 On the same day that Mr. Zheng was executed, representatives of the country's leading food and drug regulatory bodies held a joint news conference to emphasize their determination to crack down on fake and counterfeit food and medicine.
 After weeks of denying serious problems or blaming foreign forces for exaggerating the issue, officials have recently begun to strike a less defensive tone. One senior official acknowledged that the food and drug safety network still allowed too many unsafe goods to slip through, and said that at the moment the trend was ''not promising.''
 ''As a developing country, China's current food and drug safety situation is not very satisfactory because supervision of food and drug safety started late,'' said that official, Yan Jiangying, deputy policy director of the State Food and Drug Administration, the agency Mr. Zheng headed. ''Its foundation is weak, so the supervision of food and drug safety is not easy.'' 
 Asked about the death sentence, Ms. Yan said: ''Corruption in the food and drug authority has brought shame to the nation. What we will have to learn from the experience is to improve our work and emphasize public safety.''
 Regulators said their ability to monitor food and drug purity would greatly increase by 2010, when they expect to have enhanced their ability to respond to accidents and to have established a national product recall system.
 The authorities said that inspectors would start shifting posts more often to prevent corruption, and that they would check a wide range of goods more frequently to ferret out fakes.
 But they acknowledged that they faced challenges in eliminating unsafe products. China has 200 million farms, many of them less than an acre in size. It has nearly 450,000 food processing companies, nearly 80 percent with 10 employees or fewer, said Lin Wei, a senior official at the National Administration of Quality, Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. 
 ''This is our national condition,'' Mr. Lin said. ''It is our hope that by 2010 we can reduce the number of small food workshops by 50 percent and effectively curb law breaking and counterfeiting.''
 Officials acknowledge that responsibility for food and drug safety involves as many as 17 government agencies, ranging from the Health Ministry, which sets hygienic standards, to the Public Security Bureau, which has the power to investigate criminal cases.
 This fragmented authority has led to a proliferation of licensing fees and fines. But it has also allowed local officials to protect factories in their domain and has created overlapping jurisdictions in which no single agency exercises ultimate responsibility, Chinese regulatory experts say.
 On Tuesday, officials said the five agencies with the most direct, front-line responsibility for food and drug safety had stepped up their coordination.
 Officials also appeared worried that the safety scare could reduce attendance or otherwise limit the economic development and global prestige it hoped to gain from being the site of next summer's Olympic Games. On Tuesday, authorities outlined measures they had taken to guarantee clean food and water supplies for athletes and spectators at the Games.
 Fears abroad over Chinese-made products were aroused last year by the deaths of dozens of people in Panama who took cough syrup that contained diethylene glycol, a poisonous chemical, that was imported from China. The Chinese manufacturer had labeled the chemical as glycerin, a common and harmless ingredient in drugs.
 Chinese-made pet food tainted with the chemical melamine caused the deaths of cats and dogs in the United States this year. American regulators have since turned away drug-tainted seafood products, juice containing unsafe additives and toy trains colored with lead paint.
 The United States and several other countries have banned Chinese-made toothpaste that contains diethylene glycol. No reports of health problems stemming from the product have emerged, however, and China allows the use of diethylene glycol in toothpaste in small quantities.
 Mr. Zheng became China's top drug regulator in 1994, when he was named to head what was then called the State Pharmaceutical Administration. In 2003, the agency became the State Food and Drug Administration, and acquired responsibility for overseeing the nation's food supply as well.
 He was removed in June 2005, for reasons that were not specified at the time. His ouster came after a period of bureaucratic infighting over the powers of the food and drug regulator, whose expanded responsibilities encroached on the purview and revenue sources of rival departments.
 Late last year he was charged with accepting $850,000 in bribes to grant approval for hundreds of medicines. State media said his agency had approved 137 drugs that had not submitted proper applications, and that six of those turned out to be entirely fake.
 Continuing the crackdown, a Beijing court on Friday meted out a capital sentence to Mr. Zheng's deputy, Cao Wenzhuang. Mr. Cao was given a two-year stay of execution, however, which often results in commutation to life in prison.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Wednesday about China's execution of a former food and drug regulator for taking bribes referred incorrectly to pet food that led to the deaths of cats and dogs in the United States. The ingredients came from China; the pet food itself was not ''Chinese-made.'' (It was produced in the United States.)

HEADLINE: Heaven on Wheels, and in Leg Warmers

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Can a musical be simultaneously indefensible and irresistible? Why, yes it can. Witness ''Xanadu,'' the outlandishly enjoyable stage spoof of the outrageously bad movie from 1980 about a painter and his muse who find love at a roller disco in Los Angeles.
 The title doesn't ring a bell? Let me refresh your memory. In ''Xanadu'' did Newton-John a blooming film career destroy. (Sorry, Mr. Coleridge, I couldn't resist.)
 You probably remember how Olivia Newton-John, the pert, wholesome pop thrush, rocketed to film stardom opposite John Travolta in the Hollywood version of the musical ''Grease.'' That was in 1978. A mere two years later she roller-skated into oblivion -- or at least back to Australia -- in a fabulously insipid turkey called ''Xanadu,'' which didn't do much for Gene Kelly's career, either. ''Xanadu'' also helped kill the ''Grease''-born movie musical revival right quick, and the film now resides, I trust, under toxic lockdown at Netflix shipping centers across the country. Watch it at your peril. 
 Why, you may wonder, would anyone deem it necessary, or even worthwhile, to pay lavish mock homage to a dreadful movie by exhuming it for exhibition onstage? Has Broadway nothing better to do? Has the American musical theater reached such a nadir of inspiration? 
 Well, yeah. I guess. Whatever. Why pester me with silly questions when there's so much silly bliss to be had at the Helen Hayes Theater, where the new, improved ''Xanadu'' opened last night? In any case, Douglas Carter Beane, the impish playwright who has ingeniously adapted the screenplay for the stage (while wearing a Hazmat suit, I hope), trumps such hectoring queries by acknowledging the inanity of the enterprise himself. In his adorably ditzy new book for the musical, Mr. Beane posits 1980, the year ''Xanadu'' dawned and the year in which the stage version is set, as a cultural turning point. ''The muses are in retreat,'' muses the god Zeus, played by Tony Roberts, in the musical's poignant climax. (Kidding!) ''Creativity shall remain stymied for decades. The theater? They'll just take some stinkeroo movie or some songwriter's catalog, throw it onstage and call it a show.'' 
 Prophetic words, mighty Zeus, but the creators and performers of ''Xanadu'' desecrate the theatah with such sharp good humor and magnetic high spirits that you won't have much time to weep for the cultural blight that too much of Broadway has become. And in fact, there is enough first-rate stage talent rolling around in ''Xanadu'' to power a season of wholly new, old-school, non-jukebox musicals, if someone would get around to writing a few good ones.
 Kerry Butler, as the Greek demi-goddess Clio, who also roams Venice Beach as the Australian mortal Kira, is simply heaven on eight little polyurethane wheels. Or heaven in leg warmers. (Actually she's both: the skates and woolens are Ms. Newton-John's memorably ghastly signature look from the movie, though the costume designer David Zinn chose not to drape her in those fetching peasant blouses.)
 Ms. Butler is the rare Broadway ingenue who is as funny as she is pretty, and she sings gloriously, too, both in her own tangy Broadway belt and in a devastatingly funny impersonation of Ms. Newton-John's sweetly sighing soprano. (When Ms. Butler is speaking Australian, she's actually a ringer for a fresher import from Down Under, Nicole Kidman.) She's got a lovely line in arabesque on those skates, too! Can Audra McDonald or Kristin Chenoweth do that? 
 Clio-Kira sheds her inspirational light on a frustrated young would-be artist named Sonny, who spends his time making chalk murals on the sidewalk by the shore. Sonny has chalk for brains, too, and Cheyenne Jackson, the star of ''All Shook Up,'' the forgettable Elvis jukebox musical, plays him beautifully as a big slab of prime beefcake in tube socks and denim cutoffs. Sonny's twinkling blue eyes have all the depth of a kiddie pool, his earnest effusions the hilarious aridity of soap-opera acting. (Mr. Jackson is a last-minute and temporary substitute for James Carpinello, star of the forgettable stage ripoff of ''Saturday Night Fever,'' who was injured in a skating accident and will return to the role when he heals.)
 Working from a screenplay consisting of atrocious musical numbers Scotch-taped together with doltish dialogue, Mr. Beane filled the gaps by dreaming up tasty shtick for two of Clio's wicked sister muses, Calliope and Melpomene, who are played by the stage-devouring comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa, respectively. Their theme song, ''Evil Woman,'' is a highlight, as Ms. Hoffman, in her cat eyeglasses looking like a Roz Chast cartoon sprung to life, scats the shrieky guitar riffs while Ms. Testa bellows the chorus in chesty tones. Together or separately, they are both criminally funny.
 Perhaps you remember ''Evil Woman,'' a hit for the not-quite- immortal '70s synth-rock outfit Electric Light Orchestra. (A clue: Sing the first syllable twice.) If you were at least tween-age in 1980 and in possession of a radio, you will probably recognize a big chunk of the pop score for ''Xanadu,'' which includes the sultry ballad ''Magic'' and the pulsating title tune, written (like ''Evil Woman'') by Jeff Lynne, the songwriter for E.L.O. 
 Back in the day, these were the kind of songs that you'd scoff at in public but crank up and sing along with in the privacy of your Camaro. Now, thanks to our metastasizing cultural affection for the drek of yesteryear (one day theses will be written about that seminal work ''Mamma Mia!''), we are free to celebrate them in collective public rituals, as long as everyone agrees to keep tongues in cheeks. 
 ''Xanadu,'' which has mostly been directed at roller-derby speed by Christopher Ashley, does have a few dead spots in its brisk 90-minute running time. In addition to Zeus, Mr. Roberts plays the Gene Kelly role from the movie, a magnate named Danny Maguire who bankrolls Sonny's disco dreams. 
 Mr. Roberts possesses a polished deadpan style, but Mr. Beane's inspiration seems to have failed him when it came to minting fresh fun from the subplot involving flashbacks to Danny's 1940s romance. The stage ''Xanadu'' can't really muster much in the way of an extravaganza, either, despite Dan Knechtges's mercilessly cheesy choreography and the music director Eric Stern's zesty pop arrangements. (For those attuned to higher musical planes, yes, he is that Eric Stern.) The production is skimpy on both the casting and design fronts.
 A few dozen audience members are seated onstage, but this device, used effectively in ''Spring Awakening,'' seems less an aesthetic choice than an economic one here. With a cast of just 10 and minimal sets (the designer David Gallo seems to have blown much of the budget on disco balls), ''Xanadu'' uses these onstage viewers as unpaid extras and space-filling, mildly animated scenery.
 I can imagine, though, that members of the movie's cult following, amateur cultural archaeologists of all things '80s, would thrill to the prospect of being magically spirited into the swirling center of a beloved period artifact. 
 ''This is like children's theater for 40-year-old gay people!'' cracks Ms. Hoffman's Calliope at one point, and she (or rather Mr. Beane) is only half-kidding. But that acidic epithet could be used to describe far too many more earnest Broadway duds of recent vintage. At least ''Xanadu'' is in on the joke. The show's winking attitude toward its own aesthetic abjectness can be summed up thus: If you can't beat 'em, slap on some roller skates and join 'em.

HEADLINE: Can't Sell Your Home? Maybe It's Priced Too Low

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Email: Leonhardt@nytimes.com Ron Nixon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Given that the real estate market is supposed to be in free fall, some strange things have been happening recently in Mill Valley. 
 It is one of the expensive suburbs of San Francisco just over the Golden Gate Bridge, and much of the housing market there seems to be doing just fine. One three-bedroom house sold for $1.4 million last month without ever being officially put on the market. The seller accepted a pre-emptive bid -- $20,000 above the asking price -- from somebody who had heard that the house was about to be listed for sale. 
 ''The homes that are having a hard time selling are the average-priced homes,'' said Vanessa Justice, a real estate agent with Pacific Union GMAC in the Bay Area, where the median house price is about $750,000. For upper-end homes, she said, ''it's actually pretty crazy right now.'' 
 It has been a while since real estate agents used the word ''crazy'' in a positive way, but Ms. Justice is onto something here: the high end of the market is surviving the slump much better than any other segment. Even as foreclosures keep rising and overall sales continue to plummet, more expensive homes have staged a bit of a comeback in recent months. They're spending less time languishing on the market than others, and their prices appear to be holding up better.
 This split in the market helps explain why the sales of Manhattan apartments, some of the priciest homes in the country, have remained fairly strong. The national trend has gone largely unnoticed, though, because neither the federal government nor the National Association of Realtors -- the main sources of housing data -- report statistics for different price segments. 
 But after just about every home sale, documents must be filed with a local government office. A research firm called DataQuick Information Systems gathers these records, and a New York Times analysis of them shows that the story of today's real estate market is really two different stories. 
 In the Boston area, for instance, the number of homes selling for at least $1 million plummeted to 619 in the first five months of 2006, from 773 in the period in 2005, according to DataQuick. But the number jumped to 711 in the first five months of this year. 
 In the New York region, sales at the top end -- that is, homes in the most expensive 5 percent of the market -- have also been rising, while they have been falling in the middle and bottom of the market. The same is true in the San Jose, Calif.; Seattle; Denver; and Houston areas. In San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Miami, high-end sales are down but not by nearly as much as sales in other price segments.
 Separate statistics from the California Association of Realtors also show million-dollar-plus homes to be selling better than others in that state.
 The high-end market is far from booming, to be sure. Many houses would still sell for less today than they would have a year ago. But the market has stayed strong enough to catch a lot of buyers and sellers off guard. They keep hearing about a real estate meltdown and then finding a different reality when they go to make a deal.
 A three-bedroom apartment around the corner from the Guggenheim Museum, on 88th Street near Fifth Avenue, was recently put on the market for $2.8 million, and the first bid came in slightly lower than that. Ten days -- and nine bids -- later, the seller accepted an offer about $500,000 above the asking price.
 In Brookline, Mass., near Coolidge Corner, a big Victorian house went on the market for $1.4 million this spring -- just as it had in 2006, without selling. ''I thought it was still overpriced,'' said Chobee Hoy, the seller's real estate agent. Yet the house ended up selling for about $30,000 more than the asking price. 
 There seem to be three main causes of the split in the market. The first is that affluent families continue to do better than others, thanks to healthy income gains and a rising stock market. ''To some extent, it is the rich getting richer,'' Andrew LePage, an analyst at DataQuick, explained. ''The folks who don't rely solely on a weekly or monthly paycheck seem to be doing better.''
 The upper end of the market has also been helped by an influx of well-off foreign investors whose buying power has grown with the recent decline of the dollar. Hard as this may be for an American to imagine, New York, San Francisco or Miami can now seem like a bargain, compared with London, Moscow or Sydney. Jason Haber, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, said he had recently taught himself how to convert square feet into square meters -- you divide by 10.8 -- because of all of the international buyers traipsing through New York apartments. 
 Finally, both the recent rise in interest rates and the problems in the mortgage market have had a much bigger effect on low-income and middle-class buyers than affluent ones. It's become harder to get a subprime mortgage, while the uptick in interest rates this year has added about $100 to the monthly payment on an average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage.
 As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, summed up the market: ''The low end is getting creamed. The middle is struggling. The high end is running on its own dynamic.''
 It's tempting to conclude, then, that the top of the housing market has somehow become bubble-proof. And some real estate agents will doubtless make this pitch to buyers who are on the fence. But it is almost certainly wrong. 
 In fact, the very top of the housing market -- the sprawling vacation homes and 10,000-square-foot mansions -- seems to be doing considerably worse than merely expensive homes. Ines Hegedus-Garcia, an agent in Miami, recently looked at sales volumes there and found the market for homes that cost $1.2 million to $2.5 million to be holding up decently. The situation was much worse for those priced above $2.5 million.
 There are also a couple of areas, like Washington and San Diego, where the high end of the market, broadly defined, is already doing about as badly as everything else. So perhaps the recent comeback won't last long in other cities. 
 Remember, it's not as if the wealthy are immune to irrational exuberance. Just think back to the 1990s -- or the 1920s. Any asset can end up becoming overvalued. Right now, though, there is a bit more of a rational explanation for home values at the high end of the market.

HEADLINE: Grand Rapids Lays Foundations for a Health Mecca

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 

 BODY:
In the last decade or so, this city has been the beneficiary of investments in new academic campuses, a civic arena, a convention center, new parks, a transit center and more than 1,500 new units of downtown housing. 
 Even so, Grand Rapids has never experienced anything near the concentrated magnitude of the medical research, training and patient facility construction now occurring on Health Hill.
 From the summit of the hill, on this city's north end, and stretching roughly half a mile in both directions along Michigan Street, a stunning array of buildings is under construction, reflecting a commitment of nearly $1 billion by the area's prominent families and medical institutions. There are a new medical school, a children's hospital, a biomedical research center, a cancer treatment center, and two medical treatment and office buildings. Also under construction is a seven-level underground parking garage; it will hold 2,300 cars and cost $30 million. 
 All told, construction managers say, the buildings will cover 1.2 million square feet. By 2010, when construction is completed, those buildings, several designed by world-renowned architects, will provide enough space to treat thousands of people a day and employ 5,000 people, 2,500 more jobs than exist now on Health Hill. 
 The hill, also called Pill Hill here, earned its nicknames a few years ago when a medical research institute opened there.
 Construction executives here and in other regions say that just a handful of similar medical development projects rival Health Hill in scope and cost. The University of Kentucky is building a $450 million hospital at its campus in Lexington, part of a $2.5 billion 20-year project to build what the university calls ''the medical campus of the future.'' Oregon Health and Sciences University just opened the 16-story $160 million Research Clinic Building, the first of three large buildings it is planning for the new South Waterfront district of Portland.
 In Grand Rapids, health executives and city officials say, the focused investment involves one neighborhood and two disciplines: cancer research and patient care. This approach essentially forms the next big concept for sustaining the economy and culture of a rebounding city of more than 193,000 residents. 
 ''We've been through all kinds of transition,'' said Eric DeLong, the deputy manager of the 181-year-old city, Michigan's second largest after Detroit. ''We started here with lumbering and ran out of trees. We developed furniture and then manufacturing. With that came finance, real estate and banking.'' 
 Indeed, during the 20th century, Grand Rapids fostered the development of enormous family fortunes: furniture manufacturing at Steelcase and Herman Miller; Amway home products; oil and gas development; insurance and banking; and Meijer Inc., a major grocer and general merchandise retailer. 
 Almost all of the venerable families chose to stay in this midsize cosmopolitan city less than a three-hour drive from Chicago and Detroit, and where the fishing in the Grand River and nearby Lake Michigan is excellent.
 Led by Rich and Helen DeVos and Jay and Betty Van Andel, who founded Amway; Fred Meijer of Meijer Inc.; and Peter M. Wege, an heir to one of the families that started Steelcase, the city's wealthy invested more than $1 billion since 1990 in various urban projects, including the $77 million Van Andel sports and entertainment arena in 1996, the $56.5 million downtown DeVos campus for Grand Valley State University in 2000, the $220 million DeVos convention center in 2003, and a $55 million art museum that opened this year. 
 Grand Rapids was one of just two major Michigan cities (Ann Arbor being the other) to gain population in the 1990s. In the last decade, its income tax revenues more than doubled, to $59 million annually. 
 ''Now we're claiming our place in the new economy with applied research, medical care, patient treatment,'' Mr. DeLong said. ''These are new, intellectually driven sectors. Health Hill is a concentration of intellectual capacity, and that is what we need in this era.''
 On a recent July afternoon, Bill Rietscha, the vice president of facilities at Spectrum Health, a regional system of hospitals and clinics that specializes in cancer treatment and is involved in financing and building three of the five structures, pointed east and west along Michigan Street. ''This,'' he said, ''is where we are creating the next 50 years of health care infrastructure for west Michigan.''
 On the south side of Michigan Street, Spectrum Health is spending $250 million to build the 14-story, 440,000-square-foot Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, designed by Jonathan Bailey Associates, which is based in London. It is to be finished by December 2010. 
 A block away on Division Street, the Van Andel Institute, an increasingly prominent biomedical research organization, is adding a $178 million, 240,000-square-foot, five-level addition to the imposing $77 million 140,000-square-foot research building it opened in 2000, designed by Rafael Vinoly. The new wing is to open in December 2009.
 On the north side of Michigan Street, the foundation of Michigan State University's $70 million 125,000-square-foot medical school is taking shape, financed in part with gifts from Spectrum Health and the Van Andel Institute. It will open in August 2010.
 Next door, Michigan Street Development -- a collaboration between the DeVos family and Christman Construction -- is building a $78 million 125,000-square-foot medical office building, hotel and research laboratory. It is to open in April 2008. An existing office building will be torn down next summer and replaced with a second 125,000-square-foot office tower. 
 And next to that, Michigan Street Development and Spectrum Health are building the Lemmen-Holton Cancer Pavilion, a $100 million 284,000-square-foot patient treatment center that includes an unusual junglelike atrium. It is to open in June 2008. 
 Though the Health Hill construction program is immense, its major financiers and broad scope are familiar to residents. ''We're fortunate to have the kind of people who care about this stuff,'' said Rick Chapla, vice president of the Right Place, a nonprofit economic development agency. 
 Even before the latest burst of construction, Health Hill had been the focus of investment by the city's families.
 Mr. DeVos and Peter Cook, another important financier, helped Grand Valley State University build a $57 million Center for Health Sciences on Michigan Street in 2003. Fred and Lena Meijer helped Spectrum Health build a $137 million nine-story cardiac care center that opened in November 2004. And Jay and Betty Van Andel built the medical research institute that bears their name. 
 On a recent tour of the laboratory, Arthur S. Alberts, a cell biologist and senior scientific investigator at the Van Andel Institute, said he had been reared and educated in San Diego and remembers when the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the Burnham Institute for Medical Research there were not nearly as well regarded or as central to the city's economy and reputation as they are today. 
 ''You can feel that same potential here,'' said Dr. Alberts, who oversees the Laboratory of Cell Structure and Signal Integration, one of the institute's most productive teams. ''This city is building world-class research programs and facilities. People come from 19 countries to work here. When I interviewed here in 1999, my familiarity with Grand Rapids was nonexistent. Today, people know. And when they come here, they feel like pioneers.''

HEADLINE: A Bronx Retailing Hub Is Getting Offices, Too

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
As a borough without a well-defined business district like those in Manhattan or even Brooklyn or Queens, the Bronx has traditionally not experienced heavy development of Class A office space. But that is changing, with the expansion of the Hutchinson Metro Center, an office complex near a heavily traveled highway, and the conversion of a prominent site on Fordham Road used for decades almost exclusively for retailing. 
 The second site will cost $120 million to develop and will combine new offices with modernized store space at the corner of East Fordham Road and Webster Avenue, a well-known intersection on the popular Fordham Road shopping corridor. 
 The 285,000-square-foot project is called Fordham Place, and it is geared to renovating and expanding the large wedge-shaped building that has long been a fixture at the corner. It sits next to the Fordham stop for the Metro-North New Haven line and diagonally across the street from Rose Hill, the main campus of Fordham University.
 Once home to the Rogers department store, the building for years housed a four-story 86,000-square-foot Sears store that sat beneath two floors of office tenants. 
 In 2004, the building was bought by a development partnership made up of Acadia Realty Trust of White Plains and Aaron Malinsky and Paul Slayton, who head the Manhattan-based P/A Associates.
 Reports at the time emphasized the plans to upgrade the retailing at the site. But last week, Kenneth F. Bernstein, president and chief executive of Acadia Realty, said that all along his company and its partners were ''cautiously optimistic'' the site might also be used for offices.
 The owners eventually decided to expand the scope of the project, based on both growing demand for shopping within the Bronx and interest they were seeing in a 223,000-square-foot office building that Acadia Realty bought in 2005 on East 161st Street, opposite the Bronx Courthouse complex, which had recently been completed. 
 At the site of the Fordham Place project, Mr. Bernstein said, ''since the days of Rogers, this building has been the easternmost anchor of what is a dynamic open-air shopping mall, with tremendous sales per square foot and tremendous productivity,'' referring to the entire Fordham Road shopping corridor.
 He added that while his company's building on 161st Street is fully leased, it is continuing to generate interest from potential tenants like law firms that ''want all the benefits of being in New York City while still paying significantly less'' than what they might pay in Manhattan. 
 When it is fully built out, Fordham Place will use the site of the old Sears building as well as two small parking lots that sat next door, and, according to its developers, will offer some 150,000 square feet of modern Class A office space and modern retail space elsewhere. 
 Plans call for reopening a Sears store and also for building a 14-story office tower immediately adjacent to it. Retailers will be in the bottom three floors of the tower building as well as on its basement concourse level. Shoppers will enter the building through a covered entrance at the corner of East Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.
 Prospective office tenants, meanwhile, will have access to spaces covering as much as 36,000 square feet on either the fifth or sixth floor or 12,000 to 14,000 square feet of space on each floor in the tower. 
 In putting up Class A office space in the Bronx, the developers are following the example of Hutchinson Metro Center, a large office complex off the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Pelham Bay section, being built by the Simone Development Companies of New Rochelle, N.Y.
 The developers of Fordham Place expect their site to prove popular with office tenants who want high-quality space in the Bronx, but who also want to provide employees with good commuting options that do not require them to drive. 
 ''When you look at Hutchinson Metro Center, it's truly suburban,'' Mr. Malinsky said. ''This project sits right on top of a Metro-North station, and we have every single bus line coming to this location, as well as two nearby subway lines.'' 
 Still, Hutchinson Metro Center has produced strong leasing numbers lately. Brokers at Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company that is the leasing agent for the center, say the first building at the complex offered 460,000 square feet of Class A office space that was fully leased in a little more than two years after construction began, and now negotiations are taking place for about 25 percent of the space at a new 260,000 square-foot tower that is under construction.
 Tara I. Stacom, a Cushman & Wakefield vice chairman, estimated that about a quarter of the companies ''seriously interested'' in space at the new Hutchinson tower are businesses in Manhattan. 
 Acadia and P/A Associates, not new to urban redevelopment, are working on 10 projects in New York City and Westchester County. Mr. Malinsky was one of three partners who helped develop River Plaza, a 9.5-acre shopping complex in the Marble Hill section of the Bronx, which opened in August 2004. It is home to national retailers like Target, Marshall's, and Starbucks.
 Developers have not always had it easy luring big-box tenants to the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood that surrounds East Fordham Road, but that may be changing. 
 Cheryl Chase, the general counsel and executive vice president at Chase Enterprises, the longtime owners of One Fordham Plaza, a 557,000-square-foot office and retail building a block away from the old Sears Building, said her company, together with two partners, is about to upgrade 100,000 square feet of retail space at the property to meet growing interest from retailers in the area. Her company, she said, hopes to have two spaces of about 30,000 space feet on the building's second floor for big-box tenants.
 Any retail space that is scheduled to be offered at Fordham Place is already either leased or in negotiations, its developers say. According to Mr. Malinsky, tenants include Sears, which will have a 35,000-square-foot store in the basement; Walgreens, which will have an 11,000-square-foot drugstore on the ground floor; and Best Buy, which signed a lease at the end of June for 35,000 square feet on the building's second floor. Construction is to be completed next year.
 He added that negotiations are under way with three other prospective tenants: a restaurant, a bank and a health club that is interested in the entire third floor, which measures about 36,000 square feet.

HEADLINE: Wholesaler Sales Rise Faster Than Inventories

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Sales at wholesalers rose faster than inventories in May, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, making it more likely that companies will place more orders and that factories will increase production. 
 Wholesale sales jumped 1.3 percent, after a 1.5 percent increase in April. Stockpiles rose 0.5 percent, greater than forecast.
 The ratio of inventories to sales dropped to a record low, which may encourage wholesalers to replenish depleted stocks to ensure they can meet demand. Inventory-building and production increases would help the economy accelerate after posting the slowest rate of growth in four years in the first quarter.
 ''Inventory levels are inadequate, and inventory accumulation going forward is likely to support growth,'' said John Ryding, chief United States economist at Bear Stearns in New York.
 Wholesalers had a 1.11 months' supply of goods on hand at the current sales pace, the lowest ever and down from 1.12 months in April.
 Economists had forecast an increase of 0.4 percent in wholesale inventories, after a 0.3 percent gain in April, according to the median of 41 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.
 Wholesalers account for about 25 percent of all business stockpiles. Factory inventories rose 0.3 percent in May, after rising 0.4 percent in April earlier, the Commerce Department said on July 3. Retail inventories will be included in the business stockpiles report to be released on Friday.
 The jump in sales was led by gains at computer and furniture wholesalers, which each increased almost 4 percent. The inventory-to-sales ratio at furniture distributors also reached a record low.
 Purchases of nondurable goods, including farm products and petroleum, increased 2.9 percent.
 Automakers and producers of metals and electrical equipment led the increase in inventories last month, the report said.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman's Talk Further Dims Hope for a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is not satisfied with the current rate of inflation. And it is apparently not satisfied with the public's expectations about inflation either.
 In a speech yesterday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that Americans had less erratic expectations about inflation than they used to but were still likely to let short-term events shape their long-term perceptions about price increases.
 His remarks were taken as yet another sign that the Fed was not likely to lower interest rates anytime soon. 
 ''Although inflation expectations seem much better anchored today than they were a few decades ago, they appear to remain imperfectly anchored,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to an economics conference in Cambridge, Mass.
 The notion that the public's expectation about future inflation helps determine prices is an important one for the Fed and Mr. Bernanke. He and other Fed officials have said that to achieve a slower rate of inflation, Americans need to be reassured about the stability of prices in the future.
 ''Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation and thus the central bank's ability to achieve price stability,'' he said yesterday. 
 By repeating the message that inflation is still too high, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials hope that Americans will not accept the current trend of price increases as the norm. That would help foster lower inflation expectations -- and thus lower inflation -- in the future.
 ''There's a tendency for people to settle into a range of inflation that they expect, and it's very hard to change their minds about it,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''If I expect 2 percent inflation, I'll raise my prices 2 percent a year. It's like everybody is matching what they think everybody else is doing.''
 The stock market tumbled after Mr. Bernanke's remarks, but investors seemed more focused on other financial news, including a warning from Standard & Poor's that it could lower its rating of more than $12 billion in mortgage-related debt. Mr. Bernanke's remarks said almost nothing about the current level of inflation or economic growth -- the type of information that would typically get a rise from Wall Street.
 For the last year, the Fed has left its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged even as many economists and investors had bet that slower economic growth would force it to cut rates by this point. But when it issued its most recent decision in late June, the Fed signaled that a rate cut was still some time away.
 In its statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said that while inflation had improved modestly, ''a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.''
 Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist for Bank of America, said that anchoring inflation expectations was an issue that cut directly to the credibility of the Fed: if it can firmly set inflation expectations low, it can better control inflation in the future. 
 ''This Fed much more so than prior Feds puts a very heavy emphasis on the role of inflationary expectations,'' he said. ''They believe, and research shows, that inflation expectations and the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility has a large impact on private sector wage- and price-setting behavior.''

HEADLINE: Longtime Advocate for Immigrants Now Faces Deportation

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
For Victor Toro, last week seemed like any other week in his life as one of the best-known advocates for immigrants and other dispossessed people in New York City. He met with other activists in Rochester to discuss what they should do about the recent collapse of the immigration bill in Congress.
 On Friday, his meetings completed, Mr. Toro boarded an Amtrak train to return to his home in the Bronx. But Mr. Toro is an illegal immigrant. And it was on that train that he was discovered. He was arrested, jailed and then released early Monday morning after posting bond. 
 He now faces deportation.
 Yesterday he was home with his wife and daughter, awaiting what is next in his odyssey. It began in the 1970s when he was a political prisoner in the jails of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile, veered for a time into Europe and Mexico, then into New York City, where he became known for more than two decades of community and political activism.
 Belatedly, Mr. Toro now plans to seek political asylum, but where he once feared only Chile, he said he now fears the United States as well.
 Mr. Toro, a striking figure who wears his long white hair in a ponytail and has a luxuriant white mustache, foresaw none of this when he boarded the train in Rochester.
 Suddenly, United States border patrol agents entered Mr. Toro's car and went from seat to seat, asking passengers whether they were citizens, residents or visitors. Mr. Toro answered, in Spanish, that he was not an American citizen. 
 Did he have any identification? the agents asked. Mr. Toro showed them a Chilean passport, which had expired in 2005 and had no entry stamps for the United States. Can you explain the lack of entry stamps? the agents asked.
 ''I am here illegally,'' Mr. Toro said in Spanish, according to his daughter, Rosa Toro, who acted as interpreter during a phone interview. 
 Mr. Toro was handcuffed, placed in a van with other immigrants who could not provide papers, given an orange jumpsuit, and imprisoned at Cayuga County Jail in Auburn, N.Y.
 Ramon Rivera, a spokesman for United States Customs and Border Protection, said such random checks were becoming increasingly routine at train stations, bus stops and airports since the terror attacks of 9/11.
 Detainees like Mr. Toro are asked during processing whether they seek political asylum, Agent Rivera said, and there is no record that Mr. Toro sought such asylum last week.
 For Mr. Toro, 65, interactions with governments are filled with dread. When he was a left-wing political activist, General Pinochet's regime tortured him after the coup that toppled Salvador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973, he said. 
 Both he and Nieves Ayress, now 56, who later became his wife, have said they had electrodes attached to their genitals in Chilean jails.
 In 1976, he fled Chile for Sweden, Norway and other European countries, but he did not seek asylum anywhere there, said Carlos Moreno, Mr. Toro's lawyer. For years, Mr. Toro went from country to country, finding himself at last in Mexico. 
 In 1984, he illegally crossed the border into the United States at El Paso, settling later in the Bronx, Mr. Moreno said.
 Mr. Toro and Ms. Ayress, both political activists, started Vamos a la Pena del Bronx in 1987, a storefront group that provided clothing and food for poor people, help with immigrants' problems, shelter for battered women and health education for those who were H.I.V. positive.
 In 1998, the group won an award and a $50,000 grant from Union Square Awards in Manhattan for community service. ''We were looking for groups that were operating on pure passion but who had no economic resources,'' said Iris Morales, director of the philanthropy.
 During more than two decades in the public eye, Mr. Toro was hiding his immigration status in plain sight, his lawyer said. Mr. Toro was arrested three times in the 1990s for nonviolent offenses: once for a political demonstration, a second time for a noise complaint, and a third for a building permit dispute. 
 Mr. Toro was never asked about his immigration status after his arrests, Mr. Moreno said. In addition, his home is opposite the 40th Precinct police station. 
 General Pinochet died last year, his regime replaced by a freely elected government, so why doesn't Mr. Toro simply return to his homeland?
 Rosa Toro said that the Chilean government declared him officially dead, a fact that chills her father.
 ''In Chile, the dictatorship would declare a person dead,'' Ms. Toro said, ''so that if you came back and something should happen to you, no one would know because you were already dead, officially.'' 
 Ms. Toro, 27, was born in Havana and is a legal resident. Her mother is an American citizen. Mr. Toro had hesitated seeking asylum, in part, because the recent failed immigration bill seemed to promise amnesty for illegal immigrants like himself, Ms. Toro said. He had sought a new Chilean passport, but both times Mr. Toro was told that he was dead.
 ''Now, in both places, no one is very concerned about my father,'' said Ms. Toro, a schoolteacher. ''In the U.S. he could be deported, and in Chile he doesn't exist.'' 
 Mr. Moreno acknowledges that he faces substantial hurdles when Mr. Toro appears before an immigration court. No court date has been set.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Toro has a strong case for political asylum because he has contemporary witnesses and photographs documenting physical abuse in Chile, Mr. Moreno said.
 ''Yes, he has some explaining to do,'' Mr. Moreno said.

HEADLINE: Starrett City Tenants Fear Paradise Will Still Be Lost

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The tenants at Starrett City, the sprawling middle-income housing development wedged between Canarsie and East New York in Brooklyn, say they know one thing for certain: their fate and that of the 33-year-old complex are still up in the air.
 On Monday, federal housing authorities dealt what appeared to be a mortal blow to plans by a real estate investor, David Bistricer, to buy the 46 buildings, with 5,881 apartments, at Starrett City for $1.3 billion, formally rejecting his plan for a second time. 
 But many tenants and politicians said that decision was only a temporary reprieve. The longtime owner of the complex, a group led by Disque D. Deane, has made clear its desire to sell, or to pull out of the state's Mitchell-Lama program, which subsidizes middle-class housing, as a prelude to creating a more upscale project.
 Indeed, some of the same investment firms and developers that have gobbled up everything from real estate trophies in Manhattan to brick tenements in the Bronx are still circling Starrett City.
 ''I think we should acknowledge that a sale is inevitable,'' Marie Purnell, president of the Starrett Tenants Association, said at a Congressional hearing at the complex yesterday. ''However, retention of all subsidy programs should be a priority.''
 For more than seven months, the 14,000 tenants at Starrett City have been racked by rumors and fears that a potential new owner would raise the rents, oust residents and cut services at the 140-acre complex, which is an economically and racially mixed community.
 The battle against the sale quickly became a cause celebre among politicians of all stripes, who were well aware of the growing public dismay over a real estate boom pushing housing prices beyond the pocketbooks of many New Yorkers.
 In a statement submitted at the hearing yesterday, Mr. Deane said that his group had invested $33 million in the 1970s and created a highly rated complex. It was now time, he said, for his 250 investors to profit from their investment. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Deane, Martin J. McLaughlin, declined to comment further.
 Deborah Van Amerongen, the state housing commissioner, who opposed the deal with Mr. Bistricer, said she recently contacted Mr. Deane's group, suggesting a meeting with federal, state and city officials before making any decision on the future. She said she thought there were a variety of ways to ensure that Starrett City remains affordable for teachers, firefighters, retirees and other middle-income residents.
 One possible option under discussion would allow the Deane group to get a larger mortgage and take out some cash, while staying within the affordable-housing programs. Mr. Deane, or another owner, would also have the option of building additional housing and stores on the property.
 Starrett City, with its manicured lawns and towers with balconies, was designed in the 1970s as a subsidized middle class co-op, not a rental building. But it initially had difficulty attracting residents. Over time, the complex acquired an array of rent subsidies for poor and moderate-income tenants.
 Mr. Deane and his group, Starrett City Associates, provided the financial backing for the project. In return for a series of tax breaks, the owners agreed to maintain affordable rents and limit their profit to 6 percent.
 ''They did better than any other tax shelter in the history of America,'' said Robert C. Rosenberg, who oversaw construction and management of Starrett City for years.
 With rapidly escalating real estate prices, Mr. Deane's group decided to sell the complex last year to benefit his aging investors. Mr. Bistricer, from Brooklyn, won the auction with a $1.3 billion offer. But state and federal officials, who must approve a sale, said the price was too high because it would require a substantial rent hike or cuts in services. Starrett City already gets roughly $75 million a year in rent subsidies and tax breaks; Mr. Bistricer's proposal would have required another $10 million annually.
 Mr. Bistricer's contract to buy Starrett City expires next month and no one expects him to try again.
 Yesterday, Senator Charles E. Schumer sent a letter to Mr. Deane asking him to lower his sights from $1.3 billion. He said he did not object to the owners making a profit. But, Mr. Schumer wrote, ''it cannot be done at the expense of middle class New Yorkers,'' nor should the seller's profit from the sale be reaped from a new infusion of government money.''
 In his comments yesterday, Mr. Deane said: ''The receipt of those subsidies by the tenants or the project did not transform Starrett City from a privately owned asset to a public work.''
 After more than three decades, Mr. Deane's group now has the right to buy its way out of the Mitchell-Lama program. He could file a notice of his intention to repay his $234.4 million, no-interest mortgage and begin the yearlong process of leaving the program. Government officials could impose a number of conditions, but many housing experts say that it would be hard to block Mr. Deane.
 Since 1990, the owners of more than a quarter of the 119,785 subsidized apartments in New York City have left the programs and another 18 percent may soon follow, according to a report by the Community Service Society, an advocacy group for low-income New Yorkers. 
 Property taxes at Starrett City would jump from about $3.7 million a year to at least $16 million if the Deane group left the program, according to city officials. But the group would then have the freedom to raise rents as high as the market would bear, or to sell to someone else, who would then not have to run the gantlet of government agencies. There are also a number of real estate groups interested in buying the complex, real estate executives said, including the Related Companies and Apollo Real Estate Advisors.

HEADLINE: In Economics Departments, A Growing Will to Debate Fundamental Assumptions

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
For many economists, questioning free-market orthodoxy is akin to expressing a belief in intelligent design at a Darwin convention: Those who doubt the naturally beneficial workings of the market are considered either deluded or crazy. 
 But in recent months, economists have engaged in an impassioned debate over the way their specialty is taught in universities around the country, and practiced in Washington, questioning the profession's most cherished ideas about not interfering in the economy. 
 ''There is much too much ideology,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a professor at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Economics, he added, is ''often a triumph of theory over fact.'' Mr. Blinder helped kindle the discussion by publicly warning in speeches and articles this year that as many as 30 million to 40 million Americans could lose their jobs to lower-paid workers abroad. Just by raising doubts about the unmitigated benefits of free trade, he made headlines and had colleagues rubbing their eyes in astonishment. 
 ''What I've learned is anyone who says anything even obliquely that sounds hostile to free trade is treated as an apostate,'' Mr. Blinder said. 
 And free trade is not the only sacred subject, Mr. Blinder and other like-minded economists say. Most efforts to intervene in the markets -- like setting a minimum wage, instituting industrial policy or regulating prices -- are viewed askance by mainstream economists, as are analyses that do not rely on mathematical modeling.
 That attitude, the critics argue, has seriously harmed the discipline, suppressing original, creative thinking and distorting policy debates. ''You lose your ticket as a certified economist if you don't say any kind of price regulation is bad and free trade is good,'' said David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has done groundbreaking research on the effect of the minimum wage.
 Most economists are still devoted to what is known as the neoclassical model. Philip J. Reny, chairman of the economics department at the University of Chicago -- the temple of free-market economics -- said the theory and methods were ''taught to avoid personal biases and conclusions that aren't found in the data.'' Like any science, he said, the field changes course slowly: ''It requires evidence, and if evidence is there, it will accumulate and positions will move.'' He added, ''I personally have a lot of faith in the discipline.''
 But as issues like income inequality, free trade and protectionism have become part of the presidential candidates' stump speeches, more thinkers have joined the debate. In addition to Mr. Blinder, other eminent economists like Lawrence H. Summers and the Nobel Prize-winner George A. Akerlof have pointed out what they see as the failings of laissez-faire economics.
 ''Economists can't pretend that the consensus for free markets and free trade that existed 30 years ago is still here,'' said Robert B. Reich, a public policy professor at Berkeley who served in President Bill Clinton's cabinet. 
 Part of the reason is the growing income inequality and dislocation that global markets and a revolution in communications have helped create. Economists who question the free-market theories ''want to speak to the reality of our time,'' Mr. Reich said.
 Meanwhile, critics have also pointed out the limits of standard cost-benefit accounting to measure items like the cost of inequality or damage to the ecosystem. 
 The degree to which economists wander from the mainstream varies widely. 
 Dani Rodrik, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, for instance, said, ''I fall into the methods of the mainstream, but not the faith,'' which he defines as the belief that more markets and free trade are always good and government regulation is always bad. Thinkers like these may come up with controversial ideas but are hardly marginalized. Other economists, however, go much further, and try to chip away at the field's underlying theoretical foundations. So while Mr. Blinder, Mr. Card and Mr. Rodrik might be considered mere heretics, this second group has earned the label ''heterodox.'' 
 Although the meaning of the term is slippery, Frederic S. Lee, an economist at the University of Missouri-Kansas City who edits the Heterodox Economics Newsletter, says it refers to those who reject the neoclassical model, which Milton Friedman helped create, and which Ronald Reagan championed when he took over the White House. 
 Mr. Reny and others point out that the increasing popularity in the mainstream of behavioral economics, which looks at people's complex psychological reactions to events, has offered a fuller picture of how consumers operate in the marketplace. Still, Mr. Lee criticizes neoclassical economics for maintaining that the market, if left alone, would ultimately find a happy balance. He also takes the discipline to task for relying on abstract theories and mathematical modeling instead of observation and sociological analysis. 
 In Mr. Lee's view, for example, oil companies -- not the natural workings of the market -- determine gas prices, and the federal deficit is a meaningless term because the federal government prints money in the first place.
 According to his estimates, 5 to 10 percent of America's 15,000 economists are heterodox, which includes an array of professors on the right and the left (post-Keynesians, Marxists, feminists and social economists). 
 Heterodox economists complain that they are almost completely shut out by their more influential neoclassical colleagues who dominate most American university departments and prestigious peer-reviewed journals that are essential to gaining tenure. There are a few university departments where these iconoclasts are welcome, like Amherst in Massachusetts, the New School in New York and Professor Lee's home, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, but these are exceptions. 
 The experience of Mr. Card's graduate students suggests how the process can work. Mr. Card is by no means on the fringe, but he said his research on the minimum wage in New Jersey ''caused a huge amount of trouble.'' He and Alan B. Krueger, an economist at Princeton, found that contrary to what free-market theory predicts, employment actually rose after an increase in the minimum wage. 
 When Mr. Card's graduate students went on job interviews, he said other economists would ask questions like ''What's wrong with your adviser? Has he started drinking?''
 This is why Mr. Blinder said he advises graduate students ''not to do what I do'' when it comes to challenging the standard model. 
 Criticizing the approach that currently dominates the field, Mr. Blinder said economists must look more closely at the real world instead of modeling it in the lab. ''Economics is insufficiently scientific,'' he said. ''Mathematics may be useful, but mathematics is not scientific. It doesn't generate refutable hypotheses.'' In a recent issue of The Nation, Christopher Hayes spurred an energetic debate on the Web by suggesting that some precepts of heterodoxy were being incorporated into the mainstream -- even if many heterodox economists were not.
 Max B. Sawicky at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a nonprofit research organization that is a bulwark of heterodoxy, wrote in a discussion on tpmcafe.com that, ''The duty of orthodoxy is clear: deny departmental positions and resources to inferior research programs and purify the top journals of incorrect thinking, all understood as maintaining high standards.'' 
 This is the point where Mr. Rodrik, who has written extensively on the downside of globalization, departs from both Mr. Sawicky and Mr. Blinder. Although he acknowledged that inflexible rules about how one makes an argument and what counts as evidence can create blind spots, but insisted that once those rules were accepted, there was tremendous openness inside the academy. 
 The problem is outside, where economists are expected to ''regurgitate ideas'' about the glories of the free market. Most mainstream economists think that voicing any skepticism or doubt provides ''ammunition to the barbarians,'' he said, and allows narrow-minded people to ''hijack any argument to suit their purpose.'' 
 Mr. Rodrik said he used to worry about this until he realized that ''on any issue, there are barbarians on both sides,'' so there was no point in shading an argument to ''suit one set of barbarians over the other.''
 ''And I've slept a lot better since.''

HEADLINE: At a Showcase of Fancy Foods, the World Seems to Expand

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
PERI-PERI fires up the food of Malawi. The Malawians hope it can do the same here. 
 Nali-brand sauces made from peri-peri -- bird's-eye chilies -- are among the first products exported from the small nation near South Africa. This week they were offered in varying degrees of heat at a booth at the Fancy Food Show, one of 27 sub-Saharan displays at the exhibition.
 Last year, there were seven displays from that region. 
 The geography of the show, a trade exhibition of specialized food products that ended a three-day run yesterday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, has been changing significantly. 
 The show had products from 73 countries and territories this year, including some newcomers: Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Syria, Palestine, Russia, Benin, Rwanda, Uganda and Swaziland. 
 ''A lot of new countries are participating in this year's show,'' said Ron Tanner, the vice president for communication and education of the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade, which runs the event. ''And many of them, especially from Africa, are doing it with help from American agencies that work in international development. The interest in African products is a fairly new thing, and it's growing. Americans are into trying new flavors.''
 Ingrid Wright, program manager of Africa Fast Track Trade, which uses money from the United States Agency for International Development to help companies from countries including Malawi, Ethiopia and Kenya develop and market products, said exporting to the United States is more daunting than exporting to Europe. ''Packaging, labeling and other rules are different,'' Ms. Wright said. ''More hand-holding is needed.''
 Veronica Malama, who was working at the Malawi booth yesterday, agreed.
 ''New York is a big step for us,'' she said.
 South Africa, which also comes under Ms. Wright's umbrella, seemed more than ready for prime time, with sophisticated products like Nomu's vanilla paste in a squeeze bottle, and Verlaque balsamic reductions flavored with pomegranate.
 Countries from the former Soviet Union were also a growing presence. 
 Georgia, a former Soviet republic, was here for the first time. Agriculture represents 22 percent of its gross domestic product, but it has lost its biggest market, Russia, which imposed an embargo on Georgian food in 2006. With help from U.S.A.I.D., Georgian bottled water, hazelnuts and condiments were displayed at the show, along with brandies and wines. 
 The country has long been a major wine producer, and its wines, some made in joint ventures with Italian companies, and most using traditional red grapes like saperavi, were available for tasting. But they might prove to be a hard sell here. 
 Mr. Tanner said that countries in Central and South America have been coming to the show for a decade. This year many of them brought local products packaged to cater to American expectations.
 Peru's booths included a light, herbaceous nut oil, sacha inchi, touted for its omega-3 content, and gluten-free amaranth biscuits from Cuzco Foods, as well as a collection of crisp skewer-thin breadsticks, Palitos, in 10 flavors. 
 Asian countries have also been an established presence. But China's booths, even those like Fuxin Native Produce, with apricot-pumpkin and bitter melon-spinach noodles on display, did not seem very popular. Recent news reports of contaminated Chinese products may have been a factor. 
 Imported food has been a major part of the show since its inception 53 years ago. In the early days, foods from France, England, Germany and Italy were dominant. American-made goat cheeses, olive oils and salsas did not exist until the 1980s. Imported products defined ''gourmet.'' 
 In addition to the 900 or so international booths, there were many American importers of foreign products, like Cheeseworks and Atalanta, with enormous displays.
 A major trend, even from established sources like England, France, Italy and Greece, were foods from small-scale regional producers. Calabria, a southern Italian region that is far less known for its cuisine than Tuscany, had nine booths. 
 This year, in the 2,400 booths, along with the usual, expected proliferation of flavors and gimmicks -- like licorice drinking straws from Italy, Temmy's kosher cornflakes from Egypt, cute chocolate frogs from V Chocolates of Salt Lake City, and the chef David Burke's alabaster-like slabs of Himalayan salt -- there was a new natural and organic foods pavilion with 650 products. Gluten-free, organic, natural and alternative proteins (like flax) were the buzzwords. 
 Ginger-flavored foods, pumpkin-seed items, salts, new spice combinations in their own grinders and honeys of all kinds were among the 550 new products at the show. 
 But sometimes old can be new and worthy of attention. Lush old-fashioned Cream-Nut Peanut Butter, from Koeze, a family-run company in Grand Rapids, Mich., was at the show for its second year. The company has been making the product since 1910.

HEADLINE: World Bank Report on Governing Finds Level Playing Field

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Africa, often stereotyped as a place of epic corruption and misrule, emerges in a World Bank report as a continent of great variety, with some countries -- Tanzania, Liberia, Rwanda, Ghana and Niger -- making notable progress over the past decade, and others -- Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast and Eritrea -- moving backward.
 The report, released yesterday and based on the most comprehensive data on governance in more than 200 countries, found that not just poor countries struggled with corruption and flawed government. 
 The report's rating of corruption in the United States, for example, has significantly worsened in the last decade, and last year Chile, a developing country, performed as well on this measure as the United States. A dozen emerging economies, including those in Chile, Botswana, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Latvia and Lithuania, scored higher on the rule of law and corruption than two industrialized countries, Italy and Greece. 
 ''It shows the power of data,'' said Daniel Kaufmann, an author of the report and director of global programs at the World Bank Institute, a knowledge-sharing and training arm of the bank. ''It begins to challenge these long-held popular notions -- that the rich world has reached nirvana in governance.''
 The World Bank was mired in a governance scandal of its own this year when its president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, faced charges of favoritism for his companion, who worked at the bank. Mr. Kaufmann was one of a handful of bank officials who wrote a tough letter in April saying that the crisis was a test of the bank's commitment to high standards of governance. About 800 of the bank's 13,000 staff members signed it. Mr. Wolfowitz, who had made corruption his signature issue, resigned in May.
 Mr. Kaufmann said countries rightly asked the bank: ''What right do you have of rating the world when you first have to rate yourselves? It has to start at home.''
 The database, compiled from information provided by 30 organizations, is itself a measure of the bank's evolution on the centrality of governing -- not just in its most obvious dimensions of corruption and electoral democracy, but in respect for civil liberties, press freedom, human rights and government transparency, among others.
 Mr. Kaufmann, a Chilean citizen, became a leader of the decade-long endeavor to document the effects of bad governance on economic development and the well-being of poor people. The effort began with the support of James D. Wolfensohn, a former bank president, who in 1996 condemned what he called the ''cancer of corruption,'' then a largely forbidden subject at the World Bank.
 The report, ''Governance Matters, 2007: Worldwide Governance Indicators 1996-2006,'' was written by Mr. Kaufmann and the World Bank researchers Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi. It was posted on the Internet at www.govindicators.org. Data came from an ideologically diverse array of groups that included Freedom House, Transparency International, the Heritage Foundation, Reporters Without Borders and the State Department.
 ''This is the best data source on governance now,'' said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington research group. ''It is of huge importance in development. Ten years ago, there was no data. Fifteen years ago, we didn't talk about this stuff.''
 Such information fuels debate in the field of development, and includes arguments over the chicken-or-egg question of whether prosperity leads to good governing or vice versa. Some of the indicators developed by the bank have been vital to the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a federal agency created in 2004 that dispenses American aid to poor countries based on how well they are governed.
 A booklet that accompanied the report said that the data undermined what it called ''Afro-pessimism.'' 
 ''The governance indicators can be used to challenge simplistic, and often negative, generalizations about a whole continent, revealing instead a rich variation across countries,'' it said.
 Beyond Africa, the report documents how other countries have progressed or regressed. Those making significant gains included Indonesia, Ukraine, Colombia, Turkey and Afghanistan. The backsliders included Bangladesh, Poland, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Pakistan.
 The report found that the gains and losses balanced out such that the average quality of governance worldwide over the past decade was little improved.

HEADLINE: A Mellower Spitzer Emerges, Playing Down Bruno Feud

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 10 

 BODY:
It was not quite the display of a kinder, gentler governor. But Eliot Spitzer continued to show something faintly resembling a softer side on Tuesday. 
 In what appeared to be an effort to lower the temperature of his feud with Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, Mr. Spitzer radiated sunniness and optimism at his public appearances, sounding a note of deference to his partners in government. Even Dean G. Skelos -- the occasionally acerbic Long Island senator who is Mr. Bruno's deputy -- seemed half-convinced after listening to complimentary words from the governor during an appearance at Jones Beach early Tuesday morning.
 ''This is truly Kumbaya today,'' Mr. Skelos boomed. 
 As on Monday, when Mr. Spitzer showed up to read ''If You Give a Pig a Pancake'' to a classroom of Albany preschoolers, he put on a sunny mien during his travels. He played down his dispute with Mr. Bruno over the senator's use of state trooper escorts. He also soft-pedaled a comment he had made about the dispute -- and news media coverage of it -- being a drain on his family.
 ''It was meant to suggest only that there are moments when this type of business is not as easy as other lines of business might be,'' he said at one news conference. ''And that's fine.''
 He also spoke of how he wanted to ''invite'' the legislators to pursue an agenda, and stepped gingerly around the question of ordering lawmakers to return to Albany for a special session, saying he did not want to do so ''unnecessarily.'' And when he listed his legislative priorities, he led with those items most likely to find favor with the Senate: his initiative for healthful school food, new capital projects, and a bill to expand the state's DNA registry. Tucked in toward the bottom of the list was campaign finance reform, which was the focus of disputes that dragged the end of the legislative session into gridlock back in June.
 ''I'm encouraged that we will get there in a bipartisan spirit and in a bipartisan way,'' Mr. Spitzer said during a noon appearance at an Albany summer program, where he chatted lightheartedly and played kickball with a group of children.
 Mr. Bruno spent the day in Washington, meeting with federal officials regarding financing for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan. But a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, John E. McArdle, noted that the Senate had already made plans to convene in Albany next Monday, suggesting that Mr. Spitzer should focus his pleas on the Assembly, which has no return scheduled.
 ''We are going to deal with priorities of this state, which is the upstate economy, which is needed capital investments, the senior rebates,'' Mr. McArdle said, referring to a Senate proposal to give property tax rebates to the elderly. 
 But Mr. Spitzer continued to be pressed on questions related to Mr. Bruno's travels with state troopers, which the governor's aides last week asked the state attorney general and Albany district attorney to investigate. Mr. Bruno has accused the governor of having the state police monitor his travel schedule in an effort to uncover politically damaging information, and has called for a counterinvestigation of the Spitzer administration.
 In a morning appearance, Mr. Spitzer was asked about an article that appeared in The New York Times on Tuesday suggesting that concerns about Mr. Bruno's use of a state police escort had first been raised during the Pataki administration. 
 Mr. Spitzer said he did not want to comment on whether or not he had been personally aware of those concerns, but added, ''The facts as alleged in that story are absolutely, unquestionably, beyond anybody's ability to not only disprove, but they are the case.''

HEADLINE: An Ebbing of Coverage With '08 on the Horizon

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Back when he was riding high in the polls, when his every utterance made headlines and the press planes trailing him around the country were still full, President Bush had little need to indulge reporters with ceremonial pleasantries.
 But that is what Mr. Bush intends to do Wednesday, when he cuts the ribbon for the renovated White House briefing room. It is the latest sign of how times have changed for a president who now must work to hold the attention of a press corps that often seems to have lost interest in him.
 The reopening of the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, named for the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who took a gunman's bullet intended for his boss, marks another chapter in the always fraught relationship between this president and the news media. With the 2008 presidential campaign in full swing, Democrats running Congress and his domestic agenda in tatters after the defeat of his immigration bill, Mr. Bush is confronting the fact that he can no longer drive the news agenda as he once could. 
 ''The president is struggling to assert himself as president and as a powerful figure,'' said John M. Elliot, a professor at Kenyon College in Ohio who studies the media in American politics. ''It's harder for him to make news. The American public isn't really listening to him.''
 S. Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University, analyzed network news broadcasts and found Mr. Bush was featured just 82 times in March and April, down from 151 times during the same period in 2006. Mr. Lichter said he was reminded of President Bill Clinton who, after Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, declared, ''The president is relevant here.''
 Mr. Bush, of course, is still relevant; he is commander in chief of a military at war and the leader of a global superpower, and he retains enough political strength to sustain a veto, as he demonstrated recently in his fights with Congressional Democrats over embryonic stem cell research and his troop buildup in Iraq. As Andy Alexander, Washington bureau chief for Cox Newspapers, said, ''He's still the most powerful man on the world stage.''
 Even so, some news organizations are pulling back on their White House coverage. Network television correspondents are a relatively rare sight on presidential trips. Big newspapers in cities like Chicago, Dallas and Boston no longer travel regularly with the president. Just three newspapers -- The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and The New York Times -- accompany him on every domestic trip. A fourth, The Washington Times, sent a reporter with him to Cleveland on Tuesday, not to hear Mr. Bush expound on energy and health care, his main agenda, but in case he talked about Iraq. He did.
 The trend is partly a reflection of economics; the trips are expensive and the news industry is in rough shape. But reporters and editors also say there are more compelling stories elsewhere.
 ''It's the story in every newsroom that people are transitioning from the White House to the campaign,'' said Ron Hutcheson of McClatchy Newspapers, who has covered the entire Bush presidency but is leaving for a job in public relations. ''The truth is that the president is not making the kind of news he made in the first term or even in the start of the second term, especially now that immigration has gone down.''
 Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, disputed that assessment. ''Last time I checked,'' he said, ''the White House ends up on the front page every day.'' 
 But Mr. Bush's communications team, trying to gin up coverage, has gotten more creative. Last summer, he held a news conference in Chicago intended to attract regional coverage. In April, he used high-tech electronic graphics in Grand Rapids, Mich., to promote his troop buildup in Iraq. He held one town-hall-style meeting in Tipp City, Ohio, in April, and another Tuesday in Cleveland -- a departure for a White House that prefers controlled events.
 ''They have to dig a little bit deeper into their toolkit at this point in the presidency to get the front-page coverage,'' said Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University in Maryland who studies the White House communications operation.
 Wednesday's ribbon-cutting is unlikely to merit front-page treatment, but it will bring the press corps, which has been operating in temporary quarters on Lafayette Square, back into the White House proper. The $8 million renovation ($6 million paid by taxpayers, the rest by news organizations) was not Mr. Bush's idea. It was that of his wife, Laura, who put her foot down after seeing the decrepit old briefing room, with wiring dangerously out of date.
 ''She said: 'This won't do. Fix it,' '' Mr. Snow said.
 Mrs. Bush will help cut the ribbon. Yet with the White House press corps under attack from liberal bloggers as being too cozy with the Bush administration, some reporters say they feel a little bit queasy about attending. Mr. Snow said the president would not take questions, which poses a quandary for journalists uneasy about being seen with him at a purely ceremonial affair. 
 Still, Mark McKinnon, a former Bush media strategist, senses ''an opportunity for detente'' in the awkward affair. ''But,'' Mr. McKinnon said, ''I wouldn't advise any member of the White House press to get too close to the ribbon.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Kravis Goes To Washington (Capra Rolls Over)

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and JENNY ANDERSON. 
Stephen Labaton reported from Washington and Jenny Anderson from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Henry R. Kravis, the billionaire founder of the corporate buyout movement, was working the hallways of Capitol Hill, hoping to kill legislation that would raise his taxes and those of other investment fund executives. 
 While known to powerful people in Washington through longstanding personal and social ties, Mr. Kravis is an unfamiliar figure in many suites of Congress and typically leaves the glad-handing of lobbying to lesser functionaries. 
 Meeting two weeks ago with Representative Sander M. Levin, a senior Democrat who is proposing to more than double the amount of tax that Mr. Kravis now pays, the buyout titan mustered his best arguments. He said that firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts play a central role in the economy, participants recalled, citing the example of how his firm had produced many jobs in Mr. Levin's home state when it turned around a troubled electricity company in Michigan. He asserted that the lower tax rate benefited all Americans. And he said that an increase in tax rates would harm American competitiveness abroad. 
 Mr. Levin and his staff were unswayed. One aide asked Mr. Kravis to explain whether the measure would hurt workers and middle-income families by lowering the returns for pension funds that invest in Kohlberg Kravis funds, two aides at the meeting recalled. They said Mr. Kravis agreed with an answer by a partner that the proposal would not hurt returns, and the meeting ended soon afterward. 
 (An adviser to Kohlberg Kravis on Tuesday described the meeting slightly differently and said that Mr. Kravis said he believed the legislation could have an adverse effect on pension fund returns.) 
 On the eve of Congressional hearings, managers of private equity firms and hedge funds, who for years remained aloof to Washington's concerns about their growing financial power, have been caught flat-footed. Fighting a fierce lobbying battle over one of the most contentious and consequential tax proposals in the last decade, they have quickly assembled a huge lobbying machine, formed alliances with other industries, and quietly worked the hallways of Congress. 
 In recent weeks, lawmakers have had visits from industry leaders including Stephen A. Schwartzman, the head of the Blackstone Group, and David M. Rubenstein, a senior executive and co-founder of the Carlyle Group who served in the Carter administration as a domestic policy adviser.
 But Mr. Kravis's encounter illustrated the difficulties that private equity firm executives and their lobbyists face as lawmakers question their sky-high salaries and tax brackets that are lower than those of many less-affluent Americans. And it foreshadowed an uphill political battle, even as the industry pulls out the stops to wage an intense lobbying campaign. 
 Democrats are hoping that billions of additional dollars in tax revenue from the private equity industry, as well as some players in the hedge fund arena, could help to finance education tax credits, broader health programs for lower-income families, and new limits on the growing reach of the alternative minimum tax. 
 On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee will hold its first hearing on one of the proposals, and the House Financial Services Committee will look at the risks that hedge funds pose to the overall financial system. But the next big political moment will come when the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates how much money the proposals would raise if they became law. 
 Since shortly after the Blackstone Group announced plans to go public, its lawyers began to receive a steady stream of tax questions from the staff of the Senate Finance Committee, although there was little anticipation among other companies of the widespread political support for a tax increase. 
 The industry's leaders include a variety of seasoned political hands. The senior chairman and co-founder of the Blackstone Group, for instance, is Peter G. Peterson, a former White House official and commerce secretary. Mr. Kravis's ties to the Bush family go back decades, to the time when his father was friends with Senator Prescott Bush, the president's grandfather. Another major player in the debate, the Carlyle Group, is based in Washington and led by a group of well-connected former top government officials. 
 The private equity firms have formed alliances with other industries, like real estate, energy and venture capital, and retained a battery of lobbyists with strong connections in both parties. They have showered presidential and Congressional campaigns with millions of dollars in contributions. Industry executives are also counting on the support of powerful Democratic lawmakers who happen to rely on Wall Street as a major source of political contributions. They include Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, and Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois. They have not taken a public position on the bills.
 Opponents of the tax rate increases, framing the debate in broad strokes, say that raising rates could be the first step in increasing rates for more than just equity funds and their managers.
 ''This will not be a political fight about the definition of what is a capital gain,'' said Wayne L. Berman, managing director at Ogilvy Government Relations and a major Republican fund-raiser. The firm represents Blackstone and Carlyle. ''It will be a broader fight about the fairness of capital gains having a lower tax rate. It will be about rewarding risk and recognizing that when you reward risk you create economic growth.''
 ''This is pure politics,'' he said. ''This is about the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s longstanding policy objective of ending the beneficial tax treatment of risk versus the treatment of wages from work.''
 ''It is not about Steve Schwartzman's birthday party,'' he added, referring to the lavish 60th birthday celebration for Blackstone's co-founder in February. 
 The newly founded Private Equity Council, which represents the largest industry players, has retained a battery of lobbyists from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld; Capitol Tax Partners; Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; and Johnson, Madigan, Peck, Boland & Stewart. Kohlberg has several well-positioned lobbyists, including Kenneth B. Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, who is a partner at Akin Gump. 
 The pay-as-you-go rules adopted by lawmakers require Congress to offset any tax cuts with new revenue. Senior lawmakers, hoping to limit the encroaching alternative minimum tax and adopt other measures that benefit middle-income families, view the highly prosperous private equity funds as a golden goose. They see the industry, which has been secretive in its business practices but bathed in recent publicity of $1 billion paychecks and opulent lifestyles, as a juicy and largely unpopular target. The industry is set up so that owners pay a capital gains tax rate of only 15 percent on much of their partnership income, versus the 35 percent rate that they could otherwise pay on ordinary income.
 ''The tax subsidy to the wealthiest Americans created by these lower rates on equity funds is a significant drain on the ability to do important things for the good of the country,'' said Damon A. Silvers, associate general counsel at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has been lobbying in support of increasing the rates. ''The top 25 individuals in the industry got paid over $10 billion, taxed at a rate of 15 percent. Those 25 people got paid three times the amount that was paid to all 80,000 people who teach in the New York City schools, and they paid roughly one-half to one-third of taxes on a percentage basis.''
 Last month, Senators Max S. Baucus of Montana and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman and ranking Republican of the Senate Finance Committee, introduced a bill that would raise the 15 percent tax rate on certain partnerships that go public, like Blackstone, to the top rate of 35 percent. 
 A week later, Representative Levin, joined by such senior Democrats as Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, offered a bill that would raise taxes on the investment gains of partnerships, including fund managers, to the ordinary income rate of as much as 35 percent, from the capital gains rate of 15 percent.
 ''Many in the industry have been politically active for their own political beliefs and are now starting to understand political activism on behalf of their business,'' said Lisa S. McGreevy, executive vice president of the Managed Funds Association.

HEADLINE: Lenders Turn to Democrats Amid Calls for Subsidy Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
With the House set to take up legislation this week that would sharply cut subsidies to student loan companies by about $19 billion, lenders are trying to do something they have barely had to bother with in recent years: appeal to Democrats.
 The companies have been scouring for partners in the Democratic base to help them make their case against the bill and a companion one in the Senate. 
 Sallie Mae, the nation's largest lender, has met with representatives of historically black colleges; with Michael L. Lomax, chief executive of the United Negro College Fund; and with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, arguing that cuts in lender subsidies could make it harder for black students to borrow. 
 Tom Joyce, a spokesman for Sallie Mae, said the company was talking to other institutions, too. ''We're certainly letting schools know that now is the time to weigh in with their views,'' Mr. Joyce said.
 The Consumer Bankers Association, for its part, reached out to organized labor, directly contacting union locals around the country. In one case, union officials were asked to sign a letter to Democratic lawmakers, warning that changes to the loan program could make it harder for students to pay for college. 
 The lenders have assembled an armada of Democratic lobbyists and communications specialists. Sallie Mae, for example, hired former Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, as well as Mark Schuermann, a former senior aide to former Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Tennessee Democrat who lost his bid for a Senate seat last year. 
 And J. C. Flowers & Company, a private equity firm in the process of buying Sallie Mae, has retained Stephanie Cutter, a former press secretary to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.
 The tactics are new for an industry that for years relied on its close ties to Republicans. But President Bush broke with lenders with his budget this year when he proposed cutting subsidies to loan companies by nearly $16 billion over five years. 
 Moving to advance Democratic plans to overhaul the student loan system, the House plans to vote this week on legislation that, in addition to cutting subsidies by about $19 billion, would increase the size of Pell grants to poor students, cut the interest rates paid by student borrowers and cap students' monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their discretionary income.
 The bill would also require the Education Department to test the possibility of auctioning off the right to make student loans, giving that business to the lender that proposed to charge the least. Such an auction could end the system of subsidies to student loan companies. 
 The Senate plans to follow later this month with its own bill that would cut subsidies by $18 billion and increase Pell grants but not cut interest rates for borrowers. Because of special language inserted in the budget, the legislation is not subject to a Senate filibuster and needs only a simple majority vote to pass. 
 The White House revealed its preference yesterday, stating that if the House bill were the one to win final approval, advisers would recommend that the president veto it for not directing enough new money to the Pell grants for low-income students. 
 The lenders say they are fighting for survival. ''Our view is that the combination of these cuts could destabilize the program significantly,'' said Kevin Bruns, executive director of America's Student Loan Providers, a Washington group. ''Some companies are going to exit.'' 
 The sponsors of the bills were dismissive of the accusations that black students would suffer. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Education Committee, said, ''If Sallie Mae really wants to help minority students, it should support our bill to provide the largest increase in student aid since the G.I. Bill.''
 But some of the lobbying appears to be paying off. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, wrote in May to the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, echoing loan industry talking points. 
 ''Some of the changes being discussed could have a very harmful impact on students, parents, colleges and universities in Louisiana, particularly those students attending the many historically black colleges and universities in our state,'' Ms. Landrieu wrote.
 Ms. Landrieu's press secretary, Adam Sharp, said her letter was prompted by a letter from the president of Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans. Mr. Sharp added that the senator was still studying the legislation and had not taken a final position. A spokeswoman for Dillard, Karen Celestan, said lenders had not communicated with the university.
 Another Democrat, Representative Lincoln Davis of Tennessee, wrote a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, expressing worry that cuts to the guaranteed loan program could hurt students. Mr. Davis's press secretary did not return calls for comment yesterday. 
 Supporters of the legislation say they are being forced to work harder than they expected to shore up support, given recent revelations of conflicts of interest in the student loan industry.
 ''It's made us increasingly busy in explaining why some level of subsidy cuts is really appropriate,'' said Luke Swarthout, of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington. 
 The unions have also swung into action to counter lenders' efforts to make inroads with their members. 
 ''The student loan program has been subject to abuses that harm, not help, students and their families,'' Richard L. Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., wrote to national and state union officials and the organization's executive council. 
 Harrison Wadsworth, special counsel to the Consumer Bankers Association, said the organization had contacted chambers of commerce, as well as unions. ''We didn't target union leaders,'' Mr. Wadsworth said.
 At the United Negro College Fund, Dr. Lomax said he had listened carefully to the arguments of Sallie Mae and was unconvinced. ''I was not prepared to support their position,'' Dr. Lomax said.

HEADLINE: Compromise Measure Aims To Limit Global Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Influential senators from both parties, backed by unions and some large electrical utilities, will unveil a new global warming proposal on Wednesday that could form the basis of a climate change compromise that has so far eluded Congress.
 The complex measure, sponsored by Senators Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, would put in place a firm limit on emissions of heat-trapping gases that most scientists say are causing the warming of the planet. Like other so-called cap-and-trade schemes, it would allow companies to buy and sell the right to emit carbon dioxide, which is seen as the chief culprit in global warming.
 But to secure labor and corporate support, the measure also places a limit on the price industry would have to pay for such permits. And to win the endorsement of Alaska's two Republican senators, the bill contains billions of dollars in new money to help their state cope with the effects of climate change on roads, bridges and coastal areas. 
 The Bingaman-Specter bill faces opposition from some environmental groups who say it does not go far enough. The White House, which so far has opposed any mandatory system of caps on carbon emissions, is also expected to resist the measure. 
 A half-dozen other climate change measures are now pending before Congress, many of which include more ambitious targets for reducing gas emissions. But supporters of the new proposal say it offers many new ideas endorsed by important players in the debate and presents the best chance of getting some form of carbon-control regime in place by the end of next year. It was written in conjunction with the National Commission on Energy Policy, a privately financed group formed in 2002 to try to find a bipartisan solution to climate change.
 ''The goal was to put forward a proposal that takes into account the current science and encourages the technology that will be needed to address this problem,'' Mr. Bingaman said in an interview. ''We also think this proposal can get broad enough bipartisan support that we can actually enact it in this Congress.''
 The bill won the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the United Auto Workers, the United Mine Workers and several other unions, who have all been reluctant to support any far-reaching climate change legislation because of fear that it would drive up the price of energy and force manufacturers to move operations outside the United States. Union officials said they were satisfied that the Bingaman-Specter plan would make costs bearable for carbon emitters and penalize foreign countries that did not take adequate measures to control carbon emissions.
 ''We've never even stood up and said yes to one of these things,'' said Bob Baugh, coordinator of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s energy task force. ''This one we have. We think it's an important step forward.'' Utility executives who will participate in the unveiling of the plan on Wednesday called it a workable alternative to more draconian measures now before Congress.
 James Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest electric utilities, said the bill, while not perfect, offered a bridge to a low-carbon future without dealing a crushing blow to the American economy in the short term. 
 Mr. Rogers said his company, which provides electricity to four million customers in the Carolinas and the Ohio Valley chiefly by burning coal, would benefit by having a predictable price for the right to emit carbon dioxide. Other plans before Congress impose far steeper compliance costs, he said.
 The Bingaman-Specter proposal, dubbed the ''Low Carbon Economy Act,'' would set a target emissions cap for 2020 at 2006 levels and for 2030 at 1990 levels. Other bills set more stringent targets, but none so far have won majority support.
 The new proposal would grant permits to all emitting industries, including oil refineries, natural gas processing plants, manufacturing facilities and coal-burning power plants. Cars, trucks and airplanes are not covered, but owners would face significantly higher fuel prices passed on by oil and gas companies.
 Additional emissions permits could be bought at $12 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions in the first year, rising by 5 percent above the rate of inflation each year after that. The money from the permits would be widely spread to finance research into clean energy, mitigate the effects of global warming, compensate farmers for higher fuel costs and help low-income families pay their heating and gasoline bills. Under the bill, the United States would market green technology to China, India, Brazil and other developing nations whose economies are growing to help them bring their carbon emissions under control. But it would also impose tariff-like fees on imports of carbon-intensive products like steel and automobiles from those countries if the president deemed their cleanup efforts inadequate.
 Environmentalists gave the bill a mixed reaction. Dan Becker, global warming director at the Sierra Club, said it was worse than nothing.
 ''It's too weak,'' Mr. Becker said. He added, ''It would be better to wait until more members of Congress understand that the heat is on them to act, and that may have to wait until the next Congress and the next president.''
 But David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the new bill was evidence that Congress had gotten the message on global warming. Mr. Doniger said that it probably would not pass this year or next, but that the starting point for legislation was moving steadily in the direction of more assertive regulation of heat-trapping gases.
 ''The bills you can't pass this year are a lot better than the bills you couldn't pass a year ago,'' Mr. Doniger said.

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and JAVAID KHAN


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students will research the geographical histories of various musical genres and make maps that note important places in music history. 

 BODY:
Overview: In this lesson, students will research the geographical histories of various musical genres and make maps that note important places in music history.
Author(s):
Sarah Kavanagh, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour.
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Examine their favorite genres of music and discuss what makes them unique and appealing.
2. Explore the different perspectives on the birth of rock by reading and discussing "Cradle of Rock? Two Towns Stake Their Claims."
3. Research different genres of music and create a map that marks important places in the histories of these genres.
4. Write geographical biographies about one of their favorite musical artists.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils
-paper
-student journals
-classroom board
-index cards
-highlighters
-yarn
-push pins
-stereo or computer with music-playing capabilities
-map of the United States or of the world
-computers with Internet access
-copies of the article "Article Title," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070711wednesday.html (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
1. Warm-Up/Do-Now: In a previous class, ask students to bring in a recording of a song that represents one of their favorite genres of music. Encourage them to choose genres that other students may be unfamiliar with. When students arrive in class with their recordings, have them respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class: "What is your favorite genre of music (hip-hop, country, folk, pop, indie, r&b, classical, alternative, blues, jazz, salsa, meringue, rock, musical theater, etc.). What sets this music apart from other genres? Why is it your favorite? List the geographical places in the United States and abroad that are important to this genre." When students have finished writing, have them share their responses with the class. Ask volunteers to play clips of their respective recordings. Are there variations or are tastes similar? What might account for these differences or similarities? Do students know when and where the genres they listen to originated? Are there cities or countries that are important to more than one genre?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Cradle of Rock? Two Towns Stake Their Claims" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070711wednesday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. Who is Dick Richards?
b. Why does Richards believe that the night of Memorial Day, 1954 was "the first real night of rock 'n' roll"?
c. How have residents of Wildwood capitalized on their claim to be the "birthplace of rock 'n' roll"?
d. Why is there competition between Gloucester City and Wildwood?
e. Which town would you consider to be the "birthplace of rock 'n' roll"?
f. What other cities lay claim to this title?
g. What does Bob Santelli mean when he says "I don't know that rock was born - more that it evolved"? Do you agree?
h. How has the Twin Bar "evolved"?
i. Why does Paul Russo believe that South Jersey was "an innovator of a great part of American culture"?
3. Inform students that they will be creating a map of important places in music history. To begin, ask students to refer to the list of musical genres generated at the beginning of class. Ask them if there are any musical genres or styles that have been left out. Allow them a moment to add choices to the list. Next, split the class into small groups and have each choose one musical genre to research. Make sure each group is assigned a different genre.
Have each group conduct Internet research to respond to the following directions/questions:
- Define your chosen genre of music. What makes it unique? When and where did production begin? What musical genres are responsible for its origination?
- Name at least five important artists who produced music in this genre. When and where were they born? When and where did they begin performing? When and where did they produce the majority of their music? Who were their musical influences?
- What events were most important in the history of your chosen musical style? Where did these events occur? Which artists were involved?

Once each group has completed the research, provide students with stacks of index cards. Use different index cards for each group or use different colored highlighters and mark each group's cards with a different color. Instruct groups to pick between five and ten of the most important places they found in their research. These can be places where important events occurred, birthplaces of important artists, cities where most of the music of this genre was recorded and performed, etc. For each, groups should create an index card that includes: the name of the place, an origination date, the name of the musical genre to which it is most important, and an explanation for why this place is important to the genre. When possible, have students include quotes from songs that mention their respective places. If desired, provide students with an example of map annotation, found online at The New York Times' "literary map of Manhattan" at http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/20050605_BOOKMAP_GRAPHIC/
Once groups have completed their work, have the class come together to pin their cards on the map. Depending on which musical genres your students have researched and the focus of your class, you can use a map of the United States, a world map, or a map of your choosing.
Once the map is complete, have groups present their findings to the rest of the class. Make sure they use the map itself in their presentations. Following each, ask groups which genres influenced the birth and/or evolution of their respective genres. If any of these genres are represented on the map, use yarn to draw a line between the places where the most index cards for each are represented. For example, if country music influenced rock music and country music has many index cards in Nashville, draw a line from Nashville to where the most rock index cards are located. When putting up the yarn, have students who researched these genres explain to the class what the yarn represents.
Once all of the index cards and pieces of yarn have been pinned, ask students what they notice when looking at the map. Are there "hotspots" on the map? What might account for this? What is missing from this map? Are there genres or artists that should be represented that are not?
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Choose an important artist from your favorite musical genre and write a geographical biography. Where was this person born? Where did he or she live during his or her musical career? Why did he or she choose this location? Give a brief history of music in each town or city that you mention. Include a picture of this artist and place your biography on the map in an future class.
Further Questions for Discussion:
- What musical genres are being created today?
- Why do young people and adults generally listen to different types of music?
- If you could combine two genres of music to create a new genre, what would you create?
- Do you think musicians have a lot of influence over young people?
- Which musical artists act as good role models? How and why?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on their initial journal entries, participation in small group and class discussions, completion of research, creation of index cards and group presentations, and the creative completion of biographies.
Vocabulary:
Memorial, officials, residents, kitsch, promote, tourism, headline, commemorate, span, traditional, rhythm, jockey, evolved, former, executive, significantly, hybrid, exterior, intersection, feature, version, parlor, promoter, backwater, innovator.
Extension Activities:
1. Research musical styles from around the world and explore how each style has influenced music in other parts of the world. Create a timeline that combines immigration history with music history. Mark all moments of heavy migration and show how migrations have influenced the evolution of music around the globe.
2. Pick one country and write a profile of its traditional music. Make sure to note important musical artists and important musical instruments. Also give a brief description of how this type of music has changed over time.
3. Create a podcast (or the script of a podcast and playlist where recording is not available) in which you discuss the origins of one genre of music, play clips of related songs, discuss influences, artists, regions and history.
4. Organize a music themed festival or luncheon in which you invite kids groups, bands, or singers to perform.
5. Compose a piece of music in which you combine two genres of music.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Economics -- Research how the music industry has changed since the introduction of the Internet. Create a series of charts that show how profits have been affected since music started being sold on the Web instead of in stores. Include in your analysis a proposal for how to maximize profit in this new selling environment.
Journalism -- Interview a musician in your community and write an article about musical opportunities and challenges in your area.
Media Studies -- Watch several clips from Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" and/or "Wait Until Dark" both with and without sound. Write a paper about how music can manipulate audiences' emotional responses.
Technology -- Create a presentation in which you discuss how technology influenced the course or direction of a specific genre of music (the phonographic record, the electric guitar, the digital sampler, etc.)
Teaching with The Times -- Read the arts section daily for stories about the music industry as well as CD and concert reviews. Start your own column for the school paper in which you review, write historically or simply comment on an aspect of music. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

HEADLINE: A Nuclear Ruse Uncovers Holes In U.S. Security

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
Undercover Congressional investigators set up a bogus company and obtained a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March that would have allowed them to buy the radioactive materials needed for a so-called dirty bomb.
 The investigators, from the Government Accountability Office, demonstrated once again that the security measures put in place since the 2001 terrorist attacks to prevent radioactive materials from getting into the wrong hands are insufficient, according to a G.A.O. report, which is scheduled to be released at a Senate hearing Thursday.
 ''Given that terrorists have expressed an interest in obtaining nuclear material, the Congress and the American people expect licensing programs for these materials to be secure,'' said Gregory D. Kutz, an investigator at the accountability office, in testimony prepared for the hearing. 
 The bomb the investigators could have built would not have caused widespread damage or even high- level contamination. But it still could have had serious consequences, particularly economic ones, in any city where it was set off.
 The undercover operation involved an application from a fake construction company, supposedly based in West Virginia, that the investigators had incorporated even though it had no offices, Internet site or employees. Its only asset was a postal box. 
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials did not visit the company or try to interview its executives in person. Instead, within 28 days, they mailed the license to the West Virginia postal box, the report says.
 That license, on a standard-size piece of paper, also had so few security measures incorporated into it that the investigators, using commercially available equipment, were able to modify it easily, removing a limit on the amount of radioactive material they could buy, the report says.
 With that forged document, the auditors approached two industrial equipment companies to arrange to buy dozens of portable moisture density gauges, which cost about $5,000 each and are used to read the density of soil and pavement when building highways. The machines include americium-241 and cesium-137, radioactive substances commonly used in industrial equipment. Auditors, convinced they had enough evidence to prove their point, called off the ruse before the devices were delivered.
 But if they had gone ahead with the plot -- which would have required extracting the radioactive materials from the machines and combining them, a job that could harm anyone in close contact -- they could have built a bomb that would have contaminated an area about the length of a city block, according to the regulatory commission.
 As with any dirty bomb, the resulting low-level contamination would not have presented an immediate health hazard. Still, the area would have to have been evacuated and decontaminated.
 Edward McGaffigan Jr., a member of the regulatory commission's governing board, said the agency had taken steps to improve safeguards immediately after learning about the security lapses from auditors. The commission now requires members of its staff to visit any company it is not familiar with before approving a license application. It is also looking for ways to change the license to make it harder to modify or counterfeit, Mr. McGaffigan said.
 But he said the danger associated with the amount of radioactive material the auditors were trying to buy should not be overstated. And the operation would have been much more expensive and complicated than pulling off a more conventional attack involving a truck bomb or a chemical tanker truck.
 ''Why would I not blow up a chemical tanker on a train with chlorine in it or other toxic materials, at a tiny fraction of the cost before doing this very elaborate exercise?'' Mr. McGaffigan said.
 A nuclear commission spokesman, David McIntyre, said the agency had not inspected the offices of the bogus company before issuing a license because the portable devices the Congressional auditors were trying to buy are considered a lower-level threat than that posed by more dangerous radioactive materials, which it regulates more strictly.
 But Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, who has pushed Congressional auditors to investigate nuclear threats since 2003, said the commission was guilty of playing down the threat. 
 ''The economic and psychological effects of a dirty bomb detonating on American soil would be devastating,'' Mr. Coleman said in a statement Wednesday. ''The N.R.C. has a pre 9-11 mindset in a post 9-11 world focusing just on preventing another Chernobyl.''
 The findings by the Congressional auditors are the latest in a series of reports about management and procedural weaknesses at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that investigators have argued make the nation more vulnerable to a dirty bomb attack. In 2003, auditors first recommended that licenses for radioactive materials not be granted without inspections or other means of verifying that the applicant was legitimate. 
 In 2006, it recommended that the agency take steps to make sure its documents cannot be forged.
 The use of undercover tactics is not a new one for the auditors. They used a similar approach last year when trying to smuggle radioactive materials across the border and investigating how effective the government's protections were against fraudulent efforts to get cash assistance after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
 The most recent investigation did turn up some reassuring news: a second ploy by the auditors to acquire radioactive material was thwarted. 
 In 34 states, local regulatory authorities handle license applications. In Maryland, the Congressional investigators sent a similar application for a license to buy construction equipment that relied on a radioactive source. But Maryland officials said they wanted to inspect the bogus company's offices and storage yard, so the auditors withdrew their application.

HEADLINE: Attacks in Britain Worry India Muslims

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS. 
Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 11 

 BODY:
The foiled terrorist attacks in Britain last month have prompted anxiety and soul searching in India, a country whose economy is bolstered by its citizens' ability to work overseas. 
 Some of those arrested in connection with the thwarted attacks in London and Glasgow are Indian Muslims. It is the first time since 1985, when a bomb destroyed Air India Flight 182 near the coast of Ireland, that Indian citizens have been implicated in a major international terrorist event. 
 The arrests have prompted fears that Indians, Muslim or otherwise, will face increasing difficulty finding employment overseas. 
 Concerns that relatives already working abroad will also face recriminations have been heightened. Some Indians remember that the first hate-crime victim in the United States in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 2001 was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh who owned a gas station in Arizona. He was shot to death by a man who apparently saw Mr. Sodhi's turban as a symbol of terrorism and anti-Americanism. 
 A pledge by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain last week to review policies for screening foreigners working in the National Health Service in turn elicited a plea from the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, not to single out citizens of any country for scrutiny. 
 ''A terrorist is a terrorist and has no religion or community,'' Mr. Singh said he told Mr. Brown. 
 India relies heavily on remittances from its workers abroad, and the notion of excellence on the part of its expatriate professionals is a source of pride at home. 
 Kafeel Ahmed, an Indian engineer who the police say drove a flaming Jeep Cherokee into the Glasgow airport terminal, is a main suspect in the British car-bomb plot. His brother Sabeel, a doctor, has also been arrested in Britain. Their cousin Mohammed Haneef, a doctor from India, is being held in Australia in connection with the attacks, and five other Indian doctors were questioned and released in Australia. 
 Any curtailment on Indian nationals traveling abroad for work could have a powerful effect at home, economists say. Indian expatriates sent home $25 billion in 2006, according to a World Bank estimate, or about 3 percent of the country's total output. Expatriate groups estimate that nearly 30 million Indian citizens or people of Indian origin live overseas.
 Money sent from abroad ''provides a huge amount of support to the currency and to the deficit,'' Abheek Barua, chief economist of HDFC Bank, said. ''In the absence of remittances, the dynamic of the exchange rate would be very different.'' 
 The bulk of India's overseas population, though, are not professionals. About two-thirds of the $25 billion sent home comes from blue-collar workers, whose money provides spending power for families in small towns and villages. 
 ''Rural economies have boomed on the basis of these remittances,'' Mr. Barua said. 
 Indian professionals have helped to plump up stock and real estate prices by sending cash home to relatives and by investing themselves. The Reserve Bank of India estimated last year that money from remittances accounted for 12 percent of the growth in the booming real estate market. 
 The Indian diaspora has its roots in the British colonial era. Indentured servants from India were shipped to the West Indies to work on plantations as early as the 18th century. Later, Indians were recruited by the British to be policemen and midlevel civil servants in the West Indies and Hong Kong. 
 The modern mobility of Indian professionals reflects a combination of high education standards in engineering, medicine and finance, fluency in English and, until recently, limited earning opportunities at home. 
 In the United States, there has been scant suggestion from politicians or policy makers that the events in Britain would affect the ability of Indians to travel there. But Indian professionals working in the United States under professional H-1B visas are already facing long delays converting these visas to permanent residents' green cards. The H-1B visa program itself is under review in Congress, which is mired in conflict over immigration policy.
 Some economists and analysts dismiss concerns about the ability of Indians to work overseas, noting that industries across the world rely on Indian professionals, making it difficult to discriminate against them.
 Up to 40 percent of doctors in the British National Health Service are of foreign origin, for example, and a majority of those are from India or Pakistan.
 R. Vaidyanthan, a professor of finance at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, who has studied the Indian reliance on remittances, said Britain ''requires these doctors more than these doctors require'' Britain. 
 There are 40,000 doctors from India in the United States, according to the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, and 300,000 Indian-Americans work in the American high-technology industries, according to the Census Bureau.
 Like many of the overseas professionals, Dr. Haneef, who has been held in Australia for more than a week for questioning in the thwarted attacks, played an important role for his extended family as breadwinner. Dr. Haneef, who worked at the Gold Coast Hospital south of Brisbane, has not been charged with any wrongdoing. ''Haneef is the source of money to us,'' said his younger brother, Shuaib Mohamed, an engineering student, in a telephone interview from Bangalore. 
 Dr. Haneef is the oldest of three children, whose father, a teacher, died in a road accident. He also supports a wife and daughter in Bangalore, his brother said. 
 The foiled attacks in Britain have emboldened calls in India, particularly by Hindus and Sikhs, for a crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism. ''Tremendous political and emotional capital had long been invested in the asinine argument that there was something radically different about Indian Muslims that had prevented their engagement in any act of international terrorism,'' said a columnist, Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, a former police chief with a reputation of being tough on terrorism. 
 ''Islamist terrorism is, and has for some time now been, a reality in India,'' he added, ''and it is no use saying 'don't label Indians.' '' 
 Some terrorism experts contend that Indian Muslims may be more attractive as recruits for jihadist activities abroad than Muslims from other countries. 
 They are ''less of a suspect in comparison to a Pakistani or Iraqi national,'' said Ajit Kumar Doval, former chief of India's Intelligence Bureau. Indians working overseas, he said, are plentiful and are ''good raw material for the Islamic hard-liner recruiters, as happened in the case of Kafeel.''

HEADLINE: Bush Official Opposes Raising Taxes on Private Equity

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration warned lawmakers on Wednesday not to raise the tax rate of private equity and hedge funds or their managers, maintaining that it would injure the economy and discourage risk-taking.
 Appearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Eric Solomon, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, testified that the lawmakers should ''be cautious about making significant changes'' to partnership tax rules and capital gains rules, as some lawmakers have proposed, because they have ''worked successfully to promote and support entrepreneurship for many decades.''
 Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana who heads the committee, and the ranking Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, introduced legislation last month that would raise the 15 percent tax rate on certain partnerships that go public, like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to a top corporate rate of 35 percent. 
 Senior Democrats in the House have separately proposed raising the taxes on the investment gains of fund managers -- known as ''carried interest'' -- from the capital gains rate of 15 percent to the ordinary income rate of as much as 35 percent. If adopted, the House proposal would more than double the tax rate for most of the compensation received by the partners at private equity and hedge funds and would raise billions of dollars annually in new taxes. 
 The legislation was introduced as a growing number of lawmakers have come to see the outsize pay of fund managers as a ripe target for tax revenue to offset tax cuts or new spending, including a reduction in the alternative minimum tax and increases in federal health programs and education tax credits. 
 Sponsors of the legislation gained some support Wednesday from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, when its director, Peter R. Orszag, testified that most economists view some, if not all, of the carried interest compensation as performance-based, rather than a return on financial capital. It therefore would make sense to tax at least some of it as ordinary income rather than capital gains, he said.
 But the hearing Wednesday, the first on the subject, suggested that the critics of the measures had important Democratic and Republican allies in the Senate. 
 As expected, many of the committee's Republicans spoke against the legislation. Among the Democrats, support seemed little more than lukewarm. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts expressed reservations about changing the rules, and as he has in the past, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon criticized the proposals, preferring as he has in the past that Congress adopt a flat tax. 
 In his most detailed statement to date on the proposals, Senator Charles E. Schumer also appeared lukewarm. Mr. Schumer, the senior senator from New York and a top fund-raiser for the Democrats, has long enjoyed close ties to Wall Street. But Mr. Schumer has also long been critical of growing wage disparities and of Bush administration tax policies that he says he believes favor the wealthy over the middle class.
 He said that it was laudable to look for new sources of revenue to pay for new programs in education, infrastructure and energy and that it was ''logical'' to be looking at ''the very highest end of the income scale, where average tax rates have actually been declining.''
 But then he quickly added that the tax code needed to ''provide incentives for risk-taking and entrepreneurship, because new ideas and new businesses create good jobs.'' And he raised concerns that the legislation could hurt New York's capital markets.
 ''I am also concerned that we make sure that all forms of business and partnerships are treated fairly, and that we don't single out one type of business simply because people in that line of work are making a lot of money or have their names in the newspaper,'' he said.
 Edwards Supports Hedge Fund Tax
 John Edwards, the only Democratic presidential candidate to have worked for a hedge fund, signaled his support yesterday for legislation that would allow hedge fund gains to be taxed at a higher rate.
 Mr. Edwards had been a paid adviser to the Fortress Investment Group, a New York-based hedge fund that recently went public. He earned $479,512 and was hired to help the firm develop new business. 
 While he resigned as an adviser to Fortress once he decided to run for president, he still has $11 million to $24 million of his personal wealth invested in Fortress. This represents the bulk of his financial assets. 
 In addition, employees of Fortress are leading contributors to Mr. Edwards's campaign.
 In a statement yesterday, Mr. Edwards said that ''a tax code that lets hedge fund and private equity managers making hundreds of millions a year pay taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries is wrong.''
 The issue is a delicate one for the Democrats, as hedge funds have emerged as among the largest contributors to their campaigns, and they have been steering most of their political donations to Democrats this year.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Earnings With Mild Optimism

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street bounced back yesterday from its sharp decline a day earlier, lifted by takeover activity ahead of a majority of second-quarter earnings reports.
 Investors shaken by profit warnings earlier in the week appeared to be cautiously optimistic as they awaited quarterly earnings reports. Meanwhile, new buyout activity encouraged investors. 
 Giving the stock market a further lift, Federal Reserve officials alleviated some jitters about problems involving subprime lending. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said the financial system was well equipped to handle home loan risks. A Fed governor, Kevin M. Warsh, said that while subprime troubles may not be over, they were not spilling into the broader economy.
 Market watchers found it auspicious that Wall Street managed to recover some ground from its tumble on Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 148.27 points, but they said investors may not be out of the woods yet.
 ''There's still, I sense, some caution, and I think the principal reason for the caution is that we have the heart of the earnings season ahead of us,'' said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. ''No one wants to make a major commitment to the market until we see the earnings reports.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 76.17 points, or 0.56 percent, to 13,577.87. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.64 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,518.76, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 12.63 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,651.79. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.09 percent, from 5.02 percent on Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 15/32, to 95 16/32.
 The dollar fell to a record low against the euro and a 26-year low versus the British pound, but rose versus the yen. The euro traded as high as $1.3784 before settling at $1.3761 in late New York trading. The pound rose to $2.0362 -- its highest level since June 1981 -- before retreating to $2.0334. The dollar inched up to 122.04 yen, from 122.03 yen late Tuesday.
 After the closing bell Tuesday, the stock market, which has been positioning itself for next week's onslaught of earnings reports, got some promising news. The oil company Chevron said it expected its quarterly financial results would be raised by higher commodity prices and stronger refining margins. Chevron jumped $1.75, to $90.75.
 A steel maker, Gerdau Ameristeel, said late Tuesday that it was buying Chaparral Steel for $4.22 billion, while speculation mounted yesterday that Colgate-Palmolive was interested in buying all or part of Unilever.
 Chaparral Steel gained $7.98, or 10.5 percent, to $83.67, and Gerdau fell $1.18, or 7.5 percent, to $14.51. Unilever rose $1.06, or 3.3 percent, to $32.97 on the Colgate takeover rumors, while Colgate increased $1.12, to $66.80. 
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 25 cents, to $72.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after the Energy Department reported that gasoline inventories had risen more than anticipated.
 Today will bring the Commerce Department's reading on the international trade balance, and sales reports from various retailers.

HEADLINE: House Passes Overhaul Plan On Student Aid

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
The House on Wednesday approved far-reaching changes in student aid programs, voting to cut $19 billion in federal subsidies to student lenders over five years, while increasing grants for needy students and halving interest rates on federally backed loans with the savings.
 The bill passed 273 to 149 in a sometimes raucous debate, with 47 Republicans joining Democrats, who took control of Congress this year on promises to help the middle class with the escalating costs of higher education. 
 The bill marks a stark reversal of fortune for the student loan industry, which for over 10 years had largely enjoyed unflagging support under the Republican majority. Investigations by Congress, the news media and the New York attorney general bruised the standing of lenders, exposing systems of paying colleges commissions to win business, offering college officials free trips and other perks.
 While President Bush opposes some elements of the bill, it is widely expected that a broad overhaul of student aid will become law this year. Mr. Bush himself has proposed cutting government subsidies to lenders by $16 billion. And the Senate is expected to pass legislation later this month that would reduce these subsidies by $18.3 billion, while increasing the maximum Pell grant, the nation's major assistance program for low- and middle-income students, more swiftly than the House bill does. 
 Pointing to increases in college costs that have outpaced inflation by nearly 40 percent over the last five years, Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the Education Committee, likened the legislation to the G.I. Bill, which began government financing of higher education in exchange for military service in 1944.
 ''That took us to the first place in the world, and we've been there for 50 years,'' Mr. Miller said. ''This is about a new investment for the next generation.''
 House Republicans criticized the bill as creating a panoply of nine entitlement programs, which they branded ''welfare programs.'' They offered a substitute that would have largely focused on increasing Pell grants, without cutting interest rates. The substitute was defeated 231 to 189, in a largely party-line vote.
 Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, the ranking Republican on the Education Committee, said the bill approved on Wednesday ''overreaches by creating new entitlement spending for every conceivable constituency in higher education.'' Mr. McKeon also criticized it as ''extracting too much blood'' out of the federally backed student loan program, which he called ''a success by all measures.'' 
 But Representative Tom Petri, Republican of Wisconsin, who voted for the bill, called the federal loan program ''fundamentally and structurally flawed.''
 ''Congress has no business setting lender returns,'' Mr. Petri said. 
 Student lenders, who had lobbied heavily against the bill, predicted that it would drive some lenders out of business, and reduce services and discounts offered to borrowers. A group of private bidders planning to buy Sallie Mae, a publicly traded company that is the nation's largest student lender, warned the loan company that both the House and Senate bills might cause the $25 billion deal to fall through, according to a press release from Sallie Mae.
 The release also said that Sallie Mae ''strongly disagrees with this assertion'' and would move to close the deal as rapidly as possible. 
 But a report by the Congressional Research Service found that small and medium-sized lenders would probably be hardest hit, and would face difficulties competing with industry giants like Sallie Mae. The report said Sallie Mae would likely be able to handle the cuts unscathed.
 As well as cutting lender subsidies, the bill reduces the share the government would guarantee in the event of student default. It halves the interest rate on federally backed loans gradually over the next five years, to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent, and would limit monthly payments to 15 percent of the borrower's discretionary income. 
 The bill raises the maximum Pell grants by $500 over the next four years, to a total of $5,200 by 2011. It also grants $5,000 in loan forgiveness for police, firefighters, prosecutors and other public servants, and a complete release from student loans for public servants after 10 years. It would also provide for complete forgiveness of federal student loans after 20 years for economic hardship.
 Mr. Bush has threatened a veto over the loan-forgiveness provisions as creating new entitlement programs, and said more of the savings from the cuts in lender subsidies should go to increasing the size of Pell grants.
 The Senate version of the legislation is similar to the House bill, but includes more generous increases in Pell grants. Senate aides on both sides of the aisle said they doubted that Mr. Bush would follow through with a veto after the two bills have been reconciled. 
 Both measures also require the federal Education Department to set up a pilot program to auction off the right to make student loans, giving the business to the lender that would charge the least. 
 Advocacy groups for student borrowers praised the legislation. Michael Dannenberg, director of the New America Foundation's education policy program, called Wednesday's bill ''an important first step toward getting politicians out of the business of writing subsidized lender profit rates into law.'' The group was the first to pitch auctions as a way to set lender subsidy rates.

HEADLINE: Mileage Bill Draws Fire From Buyer Of Chrysler

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Mich., July 11 

 BODY:
John W. Snow, the chairman of the private equity firm that is buying Chrysler, said Wednesday that a Senate bill to significantly raise fuel economy standards could devastate the American auto industry. 
 Mr. Snow said he was optimistic, though, that lawmakers would ultimately agree on a less stringent way to reduce dependence on imported oil. He said his company, Cerberus Capital Management, would fight the Senate measure because it intended to own Chrysler long term. Chrysler lost $1.5 billion last year and is cutting 13,000 jobs in efforts to reverse a long decline in its share of the United States vehicle market.
 ''We're committed to Chrysler; we're committed to making it an enormous success,'' he told a Detroit Economic Club audience here. He also said that Cerberus had no plans to sell Chrysler or to take it public after making it profitable again. 
 Mr. Snow, who was President Bush's Treasury secretary for three years before joining Cerberus last fall, said his firm, based in New York, planned to complete its purchase of Chrysler this quarter. He dismissed market speculation in Europe that Cerberus was having difficulty lining up the financing necessary to buy 80.1 percent of Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler for $7.4 billion. Shares of Daimler fell 1.5 percent Wednesday in Germany on those rumors.
 In his first appearance in the Detroit area since his firm said it would buy Chrysler, Mr. Snow said Cerberus had expected Congress to enact a mild increase in fuel economy standards, but ''not a set of standards that are so one-sided that they can't be met and which have the risk of sinking the U.S. auto industry.''
 The Senate bill, approved on June 21 by 65 to 27, would be the first major increase in fuel mileage requirements for passenger cars in more than two decades. It calls for the average mileage of new cars and light trucks to be at least 35 miles a gallon by 2020. Current standards are 27.5 miles a gallon for passenger cars and 21.3 miles a gallon, rising to 24 next year, for trucks and sport utility vehicles.
 Carmakers, which have fought such regulations, had lobbied for a requirement of 36 miles a gallon for cars and 30 miles a gallon for light trucks by 2022 and 2025.
 Mr. Snow acknowledged that the industry's longstanding resistance to environment-linked tough standards had eroded much of its credibility with lawmakers.
 Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming program, noted that Chrysler's vehicle lineup was the one most heavily weighted toward pickup trucks and S.U.V.s. Sales of such vehicles have fallen amid high gasoline prices and greater demand for environmentally friendly vehicles, yet light trucks accounted for 74 percent of those Chrysler sold in the first half of 2007.
 ''They're now whining because Chrysler made poor business judgments,'' Mr. Becker said. ''Cerberus bought Chrysler knowing of those poor business judgments.''
 Mr. Snow said he supported better fuel economy but opposed the Senate's approach on the ground that it gave the auto industry a disproportionate share of responsibility for greenhouse gases and oil consumption. 
 Before Cerberus was announced as the successful bidder, many at Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union had expressed fear that a private equity buyer would use the carmaker only for quick gains. The union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, initially warned members that an equity firm would ''strip and flip'' Chrysler, although he has since endorsed the sale to Cerberus.
 Cerberus has been rapidly enlarging its auto business. It also owns a 51 percent stake in the financing arm of General Motors and the supplier GDX Automotive. A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved the company's planned $1 billion purchase of Tower Automotive, a supplier operating under bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: Long Island Schools Consider Pooling Resources and Investments

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
School and government officials on Long Island want to pool their resources and financial investments to operate more efficiently and tap into higher interest rates in what they say could become a model for the rest of New York State. 
 Under the proposal, which is scheduled to be announced at a news conference today by the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, the county would encourage individual school districts to consolidate their cash on hand and long-term investments with the county in a pool managed by the New York State comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees the state's pension funds.
 Called the Shared Services Initiative, the plan would require approval of the State Legislature.
 While such an investment consortium of schools and government would be a new experiment in New York, it has been undertaken elsewhere, to mixed results. In Orange County, Calif., the treasurer for years managed money for dozens of school districts and cities, yielding higher rates of return than they could have achieved individually. But the fund's excessive borrowing and risky investments caused its value to plummet, leading in 1994 to the largest municipal bankruptcy in the country's history.
 ''There are a number of issues to work out, but this is a good idea that could potentially save taxpayers millions of dollars,'' Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement last night. ''I'll continue working with Steve to make this proposal a reality.''
 The proposal would also seek to reduce health insurance costs by combining school districts, and possibly the county and municipal governments, into a single group to buy and administer health benefits. Mr. Levy estimated that leveraging benefits for a larger number of employees -- potentially as many as 90,000 -- could save taxpayers $20 million to $30 million a year.
 In addition, the proposed consortium would seek to allow school districts to benefit from county contracts for skilled labor and public works projects. School officials said that a unified procurement process would eliminate duplicative administrative and consulting costs.
 The consortium could also share information technology, maintenance and operations services and energy and environmental resources.
 The proposal was developed by representatives from Suffolk County, Suffolk County Community College, the Eastern Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Services, the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association and the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association.

HEADLINE: The Money's In the Mattress

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
ONE hot morning in late June, I was lying flat on my back on a bed in lower SoHo, my eyelids struggling to stay aloft, when Henry Burney, a gentle guy with a borscht belt sense of humor, leaned over and asked, ''So, would you rather sleep with an Italian or Mr. Ed?''
 Mr. Burney is the United States sales representative for Magniflex, the Italian mattress company that makes the $24,000 foam mattress I was lying on in the Casa Poggesi bedding store on Crosby Street. His little dig was aimed at a Swedish mattress maker, Hastens, which stuffs its versions with horsehair and charges as much as $60,000 for them. But his focus in this seduction scene was less on trashing the competition than on winning me over, not just to his product but to the seemingly absurd notion of the multithousand-dollar mattress. And he was not alone. 
 All spring and summer, Hastens has been running an ad in magazines like Elle Decor: a photograph of the blue-and-white-checked Vividus bed topped with a puffy white down comforter, one corner pulled back invitingly, with a pair of sharp-toed stiletto shoes on the floor beside it. The come-on reads: ''Who would spend $59,750 on a bed?'' 
 Who indeed? And what is the calculus -- economic or otherwise -- that brings a mattress to that particular figure? Or to $24,000, in Magniflex's case? Or $50,000, which is the sticker price of a bed being made by Hollandia, an Israeli company that opened a showroom in the Marketplace Design Center in Philadelphia last fall and a flagship store in the Mall at Short Hills, N.J., last Thursday. I mean, what the heck? Why would anybody pay that much for a mattress?
 ''What did that guy say when he was asked why he climbed Mount Everest?'' said Pamela N. Danziger, a marketing consultant and the author of ''Let Them Eat Cake: Marketing Luxury to the Masses -- as Well as the Classes'' and ''Why People Buy Things They Don't Need.'' 
 '' 'Because it's there!' '' she exclaimed. ''I would be very interested in how many they sell at that price. I would suggest the price is more of a positioning tool, though it is true that there are a lot of rich folks. Those making over $250,000 a year are the fastest-growing households by income in the country. We know that from our survey.'' (Ms. Danziger's company, Unity Marketing, tracks the luxury market in an annual survey of the spending habits and behaviors of affluent Americans.)
 Like nature, the luxury market abhors a vacuum. But certain luxury items are selling better these days than others, Ms. Danziger said. Driven, still, by inexorably aging baby boomers, all 78 million or so of them, the luxury market is most active right now, she said, with things that can be described as ''experiential'' and restorative, like a huge new spa bathroom or an exotic vacation. Further, some boomers are suffering the aftereffects of those exotic vacations -- some may even have mounted Everest themselves. Their rotator cuffs are torn, their knees and hips are shot. They are, in fact, more achy and tired than ever -- and are sleeping less, as a raft of sleep studies will attest.
 ''They don't want to put their money on a new handbag anymore,'' Ms. Danziger continued. ''They aren't buying that Kelly bag. A mattress really does deliver an experience to the consumer. And as you get older, sleep doesn't come like it used to.''
 After the craze over Ambien, the boomers' last deep love, was derailed by a flurry of bad press about its potentially bizarre side effects, including sleep-eating and sleep-driving (a state that Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, may have experienced late one night in Washington last year), the mattress industry is cheerfully hurling itself into the breach, marketing mattresses to cure every ill, claiming even to put the brakes on time itself.
 The narrator of a Hastens promotional video states, in a charming Swedish accent, that its beds, which start at $4,375, will give you fewer wrinkles and can slow aging.
 (Hollandia turns out to be a maker of adjustable ''sleep systems, '' priced from about $15,000 to $50,000, that look and feel like nothing so much as high-end hospital beds. With their German motors and 12 massage programs, they seem to acknowledge that a body ravaged by time can be only soothed, not remade. Its marketers also claim its beds cure snoring.)
 Tempur-Pedic, the foam-mattress maker whose beds range from $1,200 to $7,299 (chump change on planet Hastens), sponsored a study recently that claimed, straight-faced, that Americans would rather sleep than exercise as part of their ''wellness regimen,'' that three out of four Americans say a good night's sleep makes them feel younger and that a good pillow is a better ''sleep accessory'' -- nine times better -- than a ''sleep partner.'' More than a third of them spend as much money on their mattresses as they do on their sofas or their televisions, and 17 percent as much as on their vacations.
 At the low end of the luxury mattress market, at least, things have been heating up. Six years ago, barely 2 percent of the mattresses sold cost more than $2,000, according to the International Sleep Products Association, a trade group for the industry, which had $6.7 billion in sales last year. By 2006 about 5 percent of purchases had crossed the $2,000 line. (The median price of a queen-size mattress was $650 last year, according to a survey by Furniture Today, a trade magazine.)
 ''I think it's about time that Americans place the value on sleep that they place on other aspects of their life,'' said Rick Anderson, president of Tempur-Pedic North America, adding, as every good mattress executive is wont to do, that ''after all, we spend a third of our lives in bed.''
 Mr. Anderson's company has just rolled out a television campaign -- with dreamy little spots of tropical islands, misty fjords and glistening jungles -- that positions Tempur-Pedic as a ''wellness brand'' and its mattresses as ''nighttime renewal aids.''
 ''If you asked someone 10 years ago what their mattress is for,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''they'd say it's where I sleep. Now they expect it to relieve their stress, to relieve their aches and pains, to provide comfort. It's emotional, it's physical and it's a status thing, too. You know what they say: sleep is the new black. Sleep is in style.'' Gone are the days, Mr. Anderson suggested, when captains of industry bragged about sleeping just three hours a night. The power nap, he said, is gaining currency.
 As proof, Mr. Anderson pointed to nap centers like the two that MetroNaps and Yelo operate in Manhattan, charging $12 to $14 for 20 minutes of shut-eye, and recent studies by the National Institutes of Health and Harvard about napping and productivity. (There is even a nap how-to book, out since January from Workman: ''Take a Nap! Change Your Life'' by Sara C. Mednick, a napping-research scientist at the Salk Institute.)
 Ty Wenger, editor of Trader Monthly, a lifestyle magazine for a select segment of the self-made superrich, like hedge fund managers, agreed with this paradigm shift: a good night's sleep isn't a sign of weakness, but something to boast about.
 ''My readers are almost like athletes in the way they perceive themselves and pamper themselves,'' Mr. Wenger said. ''A good night's sleep can mean millions for them the next day. How they prepare themselves for their job is the difference between brilliant and wealthy and going completely belly up. They aren't hedonist playboys like those '80s guys. They work out like crazy; they eat the finest food. It's all about honing their instrument.''
 Will they spend tens of thousands on mattresses?
 ''Absolutely,'' he said. ''The high end exists because there is somebody who wants to spend that kind of money. It's like a consumer dare.''
 Casa Poggesi has been offering the $24,000 Magniflex Gold for a month and a half, and as of yesterday afternoon, Mr. Burney said, no New Yorker had bought one. He added that on average, Magniflex mattresses go for $1,200 to $3,000. ''But the Gold gets people in the door.''
 Mr. Burney said his company had sold 53 Gold mattresses to individuals in Russia, and one to a hotel in Dubai. Its cost, he said, is largely a result of the fact that its cover is woven with 22-karat gold thread -- ''gold is a natural antimicrobial,'' he said, as well as a barrier against dust mites and bedbugs -- and has a cashmere underlayer. What's inside the mattress is, as in most mattresses, a mysterious layer cake of stuff. Like every mattress sales agent, Mr. Burney has cross sections at the ready, along with diagrams and schematics and a pocketful of scientific-sounding terms.
 ''I know, none of it means anything to anyone,'' said Mr. Burney, who explained that in plainer terms the Magniflex mattress is foam with holes drilled through it. So it breathes, as opposed to, say, a Tempur-Pedic mattress, he said, which has ridges so the air flows around the foam, but not through it. ''People complain that the Tempur-Pedic is too warm,'' he asserted. 
 ''If you consider the average person sweats about a pint each night,'' he said, pausing to let his words sink in.
 WARREN SHOULBERG, the editor of Home Furnishings News, a trade publication for the furniture industry, reckons that a mattress purchase is the most ''blind'' purchase anybody ever makes.
 ''You only buy it once every 10 or 20 years,'' he said, ''so you are woefully unprepared and uneducated. You are confronted with this police lineup of white boxes that all look remarkably similar. The one that's $500 doesn't look all that different from the one that's $5,000, or, now, $50,000, the way a Hyundai looks different from a Ferrari. The attributes that distinguish this product you can't see. 
 ''So you do the obligatory five-minute lie-down, but you're incredibly self-conscious. Whatever very personal way that you sleep, you can't do it on the floor of Sleepy's. It's not a product you can shop smart for, and that's allowed the mattress companies to be all over the place. They kind of went crazy, and you've got to hand it to them. 
 ''Now, there are a lot of affluent people who will pay a lot of money for a good night's sleep. Or the perception of a good night's sleep. I think the mattress guys are the smartest people in the whole home furnishings business. They have managed to attach an emotional element to your mattress. It's not just layers of foam and padding.''
 The Hastens store, in a classic SoHoian cast-iron building on Greene Street, is huge and white. This whiteness sets off the fetching blue and white plaid ticking that covers nearly every mattress. (The alternative is a white and taupe plaid.) Lina Schleenvoigt, the store's young manager, listed the layers in a Hasten's mattress: flax, wool and cotton, as well as horsehair, which has been not only cleaned but permed. 
 ''Horsehair is hollow tubes,'' she said proudly. ''Nature's air-conditioner. If you consider that you sweat one liter a night, and all that stays in the bed, unless the bed can breathe.''
 Here we go again.
 If the foam mattresses promise, as Mr. Burney said, better living through chemistry, Hastens, with its horse-and-fjord imagery, is the antifoam -- the free-range bed. Its show pony, the Vividus, lives behind a velvet rope. With permission, I clambered aboard, and Ms. Schleenvoigt pushed down on my shoulder. 
 ''You want to feel that the bed accepts you,'' she said. ''You have to open yourself to a new experience.''
 ''This,'' she said, answering the $60,000 question, ''is something without compromises. It takes 160 man-hours to make this bed. The horsehair is hand-selected, for example, and longer and straighter than what we use in the other beds. It has a deep feel, a bottomless feel.''
 Not only that, she said, it comes with a brass plate engraved with your name.
 I spent an hour here, rolling from bed to bed. It is true that the Vividus is very, very comfortable, but all the mattresses there are -- beyond anything you can imagine, which is as it should be, considering that most of them cost more than a car. They even need maintenance like a car, specifically a massage and a flip every month for a year. ''We call you and remind you,'' Ms. Schleenvoigt said. 
 I flopped down next to Beth Fussell, who was splayed out on the Excelsior mattress ($15,500), her clogged feet hanging over the edge. 
 Ms. Fussell, 41, works at an architectural firm around the corner. She said she and her husband, who is also an architect, have been visiting this bed once a month for a year, and they plan to buy it in 18 months.
 ''What do you need in the city?'' she said. ''You don't need a car. We sold our car last year. I think you need a good bed. It's so stressful here.
 ''We were subletting an apartment and sleeping on a futon. I like the idea of something that lasts. The feeling of this bed is almost primal. You feel safe on this bed. You can't forget this bed.''
 It took two years of research and bed-testing for Suzanne Durand, 57, and her husband, Everett Ferri, 62, to circle in on their Hastens, the $22,950 2000T, which they bought in December. (''Lina let us take a nap one Sunday,'' Ms. Durand said. ''She turned up the air-conditioning, turned down the lights and gave us a comforter.''). 
 Her husband has had rotator cuff issues, she has sore hips and they had been buying mattresses every four or five years, they said. ''I was still waking up as stiff as a board,'' Ms. Durand said. ''The way I rationalized the cost was that this was something that was going to last us for the rest of our lives. And I think that you wake up and feel better is worth it. And I do feel better.''
 Mr. Ferri said he did ask Ms. Schleenvoigt if she would take their '05 BMW X3 in trade.
 The 2000T is the company's best seller, said Erick Svensson, Hasten's sales manager in the United States. As for Vividus sales, he said guardedly that ''more than 15'' have sold since the introduction last fall. 
 THERE is something about a hospital bed that works, said Sharon Kaplan, 59, who bought a $23,000 Hollandia with her husband, Arthur, 62, a few months ago. Or dueling hospital beds, which is what a Hollandia looks and works like: two single adjustable beds that sit side by side but operate independently. 
 The Kaplans, real estate developers who live in Philadelphia, weren't looking for a new bed, but a friend invited them to Hollandia's grand opening last spring, and one thing led to another. ''You get to a certain age,'' Ms. Kaplan said, ''and it's the one thing you can do, give yourself a good night's sleep. I haven't slept this well in years.''
 I asked Mr. Kaplan how he rationalized the cost.
 ''You don't,'' he said. ''It's not possible.'' And then he tried to, a bit: ''I used to sleep on a $6,000 mattress. Now I sleep on one that cost $23,000. I sit on a sofa that costs as much, and I'm only on that for about 20 minutes a day.''
 On a recent Monday, David Ashe, who is marketing Hollandia's beds in the United States, was presiding over the company's showroom in Philadelphia.
 ''Let me get you on a bed,'' he said soothingly, leading me to a red velvet number in the showroom window. He drove the remote, elevating both my feet and my head, and Maria Rohe, another marketing manager, tucked a sarcophagus-shaped blanket around me.It had a pocket to slip the feet into and two pockets up top, for the hands. It was wicked comfy.
 ''Do you like the way that feels?'' Mr. Ashe asked. ''All our fabrics are coated with aloe vera.''
 The obligatory cross section was hauled out, a stunning array of layers and mystery substances. The curly stuff was coconut fibers; the pink and cream-colored stuff, drilled with holes like a Magniflex, was a foam. ''A natural foam,'' Mr. Ashe hastened to say. 
 What's in it?
 ''A bunch of stuff ---- ''
 Ms. Rohe broke in: ''A proprietary blend of material.''
 And then, like Mr. Burney, Mr. Ashe began tearing into Tempur-Pedic. ''Take Memory Foam,'' he began. ''It's synthetic, it's dense, it doesn't breathe, it's hot, you end up lying in a pool of your own perspiration.''
 The sweat again. How much did Mr. Ashe reckon the average person dropped in a bed each night? Was it, and I quoted Ms. Schleenvoigt, a liter?
 ''That's disgusting,'' he said. ''I'm not sleeping with you. I'd say a cup, max.''
 Fine. Now where was the $50,000 bed? We'd discussed it on the phone -- its mohair cover, its built-in iPod jacks and television. I was ready.
 ''It's not here,'' Mr. Ashe said. ''It's in Israel. It will be here in a year. I do have a $35,000 that's coming next week ...''
 This is what's known as the old switch-eroo.
 Mr. Ashe said, in a mollifying tone, ''You know, I can get you a great night's sleep on a $17,000 bed.''

HEADLINE: In Re-election Bid, a Mayor Versus a Cast of Characters

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 7 

 BODY:
Most of the candidates for mayor of San Francisco, a city of 720,000 people and untold numbers of political opinions, have no money, no staffs and no campaign buttons. 
 What they do have is nicknames. 
 Like Kenny the Clown, a professional bozo born Kenneth Kahn. Or John Rinaldi, a k a Chicken John, a self-described showman and ''experimental candidate,'' who says he is not allowed to drink caffeine. (He's a wee bit high-strung.) Or the mysterious Captain Democracy, whose Web site advocates a strong military. (Not that San Francisco has an army.)
 Four months before the election, about the only well-known candidate for mayor is the mayor himself, Gavin Newsom. Mr. Newsom, 39, is running high in the polls -- his approval rating is higher than 70 percent -- and low on rivals, with a campaign bankroll of more than $1.5 million and not a lot to spend it on. 
 San Francisco political veterans say there is no mystery to the lack of competition. 
 ''I think the bottom line is that they look at the same poll numbers as I do,'' said David Binder, a pollster who has tracked the city's voting habits since the early 1980s. ''They say 'Why do I want to campaign for a couple of months and get my hat handed to me?' '' 
 Mr. Newsom's popularity is all the more remarkable considering that in the last six months he has endured a sex scandal (involving an affair with the wife of the man who was his campaign manager), an admitted alcohol problem (for which he attended rehab) and publicly circulated whispers of past drug use (which he strongly denied). 
 Eric Jaye, the mayor's new campaign manager -- not the cuckolded one, who resigned after the mayor confessed to the affair -- said Mr. Newsom's swift apology for his behavior had helped mollify San Francisco voters, who tend to be a little live-and-let-live, anyway. 
 ''The voters saw someone who was genuinely and sincerely contrite for what he had done, and resolved to be a better person and be a better mayor,'' Mr. Jaye said.
 Still, the lack of a major contender is surprising considering the nature of the San Francisco electorate. Twenty percent of voters here consider themselves progressives who feel that regular old Democrats -- like Mr. Newsom -- are simply too conservative. In 2003, for example, the progressives came close to winning the mayor's office with Matt Gonzalez, 42, a former president of the city's Board of Supervisors and a member of the Green Party. (He is also a part-time collage artist.) 
 This time around, though, Mr. Gonzalez has not declared himself a candidate, and progressives have struggled to find a replacement. A June 2 convention -- nicknamed the ''hippie hootenanny'' -- failed to lure anyone. 
 ''This is very, very difficult campaign,'' said Chris Daly, a city supervisor and a critic of Mr. Newsom.
 There are, to be sure, a few brave souls. The city's election bureau has registered about two dozen ''potential candidates,'' each of whom is required to file formal papers -- and pay a $4,930 fee or collect nearly 10,000 signatures -- by next month to appear on the ballot. 
 That fee makes it difficult for people like Gerald L. Damiano, 58, an unemployed truck driver who wants to take the doors off the mayor's office -- literally -- and Lonnie Holmes, a juvenile probation manager. Mr. Holmes, a Democrat, is trying to run on a platform of representing the city's poorer people. 
 ''I think that what happens in San Francisco is that people beneath a certain income level cease to exist in the eyes of the political establishment,'' said Mr. Holmes, 47, and the father of five. 
 The prominent locals who have said they are not running include Mr. Daly, who cited the impending birth of his second child; former Mayor Art Agnos, who cited his humanitarian work; and the actor and activist Danny Glover, who said he had never even considered it. (Mr. Glover was briefly being drafted by hopeful bloggers.) All of which Mr. Newsom's opponents chalk up to good timing rather than good leadership.
 ''I think it converges on a point where it's better to be lucky than good,'' said Mr. Agnos, who held the job from 1988 to 1992. ''And so far Mr. Newsom has had a run of very good luck.''
 Mr. Newsom's supporters say his accomplishments more than justify a second term, including his work on the city's chronic homeless problem, his push for universal health care and a decision to make the city's waste completely recyclable by 2020. 
 His most notable feat, however, may have been his decision in 2004 to allow same-sex marriages in the city, a move that helped cement his appeal with many progressives.
 ''It may have hurt him statewide or nationwide, but it helped him in the city immeasurably,'' said Mr. Binder, the pollster.
 That said, Mr. Newsom does not appear to be taking the race lightly, holding a series of community meetings with voters and engaging in typical election-year activities like filling potholes. ''Just because you don't have an opponent yet doesn't mean you're not going to get an opponent,'' Mr. Jaye said.
 That is exactly what progressives are hoping for. In the meantime, the vacuum will have to be filled by people like Mr. Rinaldi, the talkative former club proprietor known as Chicken John. Mr. Rinaldi said he had decided to run in late June as ''an experiment'' in electoral politics. 
 ''I don't even think he's a bad mayor,'' Mr. Rinaldi, 39, said of Mr. Newsom. ''But it seems undemocratic not to have a candidate.''

HEADLINE: Authorities Wonder What Drew Suspects From Brooklyn to the Poconos

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE and ETHAN WILENSKY-LANFORD

 BODY:
Only a decade or two ago, the relationship between Brooklyn and a far-flung resort area about 80 miles and two states away would have been tenuous except for weekend or vacation getaways. But since then, New York City has developed intimate connections -- through legions of workers who endure two-hour commutes -- with the Poconos community where a huge manhunt for two suspects wanted in the shooting of two policemen on Monday took place yesterday. 
 One of the suspects, Dexter Bostic, was taken into custody about 6 p.m. yesterday as he ran along a wooded median on Interstate 80 near Stroudsburg in Monroe County, where tips had helped the police in the search for him and the other suspect, Robert Ellis. Mr. Ellis was still at large last night.
 Monroe County has become one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, in large part because of thousands of working-class New Yorkers seeking an affordable slice of the American dream. ''Truly the commute to New York City has extended to this area,'' said James Murtin, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State police. He added that they confirmed that the men had been in the area before, and they were investigating if they had family in the area. 
 Some residents say that the area is attractive as a refuge for people with criminal pasts, either to get a new start or to elude law enforcement.
 ''This is like the country hideout, the getaway,'' said Orville S. Clendenen, 38, who moved to the Poconos 11 years ago from the Bronx to get away from the noise and traffic of New York. ''A lot of the refugees from New York come down here.''
 Affordable homes, many priced comfortably below the $150,000 range as recently as 2004, have drawn many residents to the area. 
 As a result, what was once Pennsylvania forest and farmland has been transformed into sprawling subdivisions of look-alike vinyl-sided homes in dense warrens. They are populated by the bus drivers, teachers, city workers and executive secretaries who rely on and prop up the New York City economy. But the tradeoff for affordable housing is a bleary-eyed daily trip and stress on family life. Each day, dozens of buses leave Monroe County starting before dawn and head along Interstate 80 toward New York City. At night, the waves move in reverse, meaning that parents often do not get home until 8 or 9.
 ''When I was going to college here, there were two police cars in the area,'' said Bill Cancotta, a 48-year-old chef who went to college in the area starting in the late 1970s. ''Now they have a big police force. They got their hands full, too.''
 After all, this is a community where the word ''guns'' traditionally refers to rifles, and where on an official school holiday called Buck Day, teenagers don camouflage for the first day of rifle season. ''Guns'' did not refer to a 9-millimeter pistol, a .45-caliber handgun and a Tec-9 machine pistol, the guns the authorities believe were involved in the shooting of Officers Herman Yan and Russel Timoshenko.

HEADLINE: Some Chronically Ill Adults Wait for Medicare to Arrive

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
When uninsured adults with common chronic illnesses became eligible for Medicare, they saw doctors and were hospitalized more often and reported greater medical expenses than people who had had insurance. And their increased use of medical services continued at least until at least age 72, researchers are reporting today.
 Their study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, is one of the first to follow a large group of people through that crucial time of transition from being ineligible for Medicare to receiving Medicare benefits. 
 Its researchers, led by Dr. John Z. Ayanian, an associate professor of medicine and health care policy at Harvard Medical School, used data from the Health and Retirement Study, a federally financed study that included 9,760 adults who were 51 to 61 in 1992. Dr. Ayanian and his colleagues focused on 5,158 of them who survived to age 65 by 2004 and who either had private insurance or no insurance at all before receiving Medicare. 
 The participants were interviewed and surveyed about their health and medical care every two years until 2004. That allowed the Harvard researchers to ask what happened when people who had not had insurance suddenly could have their health care paid for by the federal government.
 The effect that emerged -- a surge in the use of health care by those who were previously uninsured -- was concentrated in people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Those are conditions, the investigators noted, in which treatment can prevent serious consequences that can require extra doctor visits, hospitalizations and expense. In the study, 2,951 of the 5,158 participants had one of those conditions.
 When such previously uninsured people became eligible for Medicare, they had 13 percent more doctor visits, 20 percent more hospitalizations, and reported 51 percent greater medical expenditures than those with the same diseases who had had insurance all along.
 Although the findings made sense, said Jonathan Skinner, an economist at Dartmouth College, they were not a foregone conclusion. 
 ''You might expect that if you fall into habits of not using much health care, you might continue not to use it,'' Dr. Skinner said. Instead, the study found a sort of pent-up demand among the uninsured.
 ''It shows how unfair our system is,'' said Louise Russell, a research professor at the Institute for Health at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. ''These people were not getting care, and they were at least as in need of it as the people who were insured.''
 The study also shows that it may be less expensive than expected to provide universal health insurance, Dr. Ayanian and his colleagues concluded. Medicare is bearing the brunt when uninsured people put off seeing doctors or seeking medical care until they turn 65. 
 ''A lot of the prior research focused on the health benefits of extending insurance coverage,'' Dr. Ayanian said. ''Our study suggested that it may be cost effective.''
 But, economists note, it has to cost more to insure everyone than it does to leave some people out.
 ''The quick interpretation is, 'Well this saves money,' but it's a partial savings,'' said Mark Pauly, a health economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''You get some money back, but it's still going to cost money.''
 Dr. Mark McClellan, the former head of Medicare who is now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the study had limitations. 
 The uninsured, he said, were very different from the insured people in the study. They had much less education, their incomes were lower, they were more likely to smoke and to be depressed.
 The researchers accounted for differences with statistical adjustment. But, Dr. McClellan said, statistics can never completely solve the problem of large differences between groups.
 For example, he said, the characteristics of the uninsured are also correlated with caring more about the present than the future. A trait like that, he added, ''may lead to the need for more medical services down the road.''
 That does not mean that the uninsured do not need health insurance, he said, but it does raise the question of what is the most effective way to provide it. For example, instead of just paying for doctor visits and leaving it to patients to find doctors and seek care, it may be better to also provide case managers who will contact patients and prompt them to take medications like drugs for high blood pressure or to report on their blood sugar levels if they have diabetes.
 ''Health insurance is supposed to not just prevent the complications of chronic diseases but also to keep you healthier,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''And Medicare historically has not done a very good job of that.''
 Even now, he said, with expanded screening services, only about half of Medicare beneficiaries avail themselves of them.
 Dr. Alan Garber, a health economist at Stanford, also raised the question of how best to expand medical services. Reducing costs, he added, should not be the driving factor.
 ''There are many good reasons to advocate coverage of the uninsured,'' Dr. Garber said. ''At the top of the list, though, is a belief that coverage expansions can improve health. If they also reduce costs, that is icing on the cake.''

HEADLINE: Study Predicts Floods in City If the Climate Gets Warmer

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
By the end of this century, 100-year floods could hit New York City every 10 years, Long Island lobsters could disappear and New York apples could be hard to come by if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report released yesterday by a group of scientists and economists.
 ''The Northeast can anticipate substantial -- and often unwelcome or dangerous -- changes during the rest of this century,'' concluded the report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which examined the impact of global warming on the region. ''The very character of the Northeast is at stake.'' 
 The report, which covers nine states, is the product of a two-year collaboration between the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, and a team of several dozen independent scientists and economists.
 Speaking at a news conference at the New York Botanical Garden, one of the authors of the report, James L. McCarthy, professor of biological oceanography at Harvard University and president-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said there could be droughts every summer in the Catskill Mountains, which supply drinking water for 9 million New Yorkers. At the same time, there could be heavy downpours that could turn the city's water more turbid and cause flooding.
 With higher temperatures, smog would increase and air quality in the region would decline, significantly worsening conditions for people with asthma, and the amount of pollen produced would soar, making life miserable for people with allergies.
 In a similar report released last year, the Union of Concerned Scientists laid out the regional climate changes that global warming could bring. Average temperatures could rise by more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit in both winter and summer by the end of the century, and New York City might have to swelter through 25 days a year with temperatures over 100 degrees. 
 In the report released yesterday, the group focused on the possible impact of those changes. 
 Earlier springs, longer summers and less snowy winters are already being felt in part because of heat-trapping gases that were released over the last 50 years. The region will have to adapt to those changes, the scientists said. But things could become far worse, and much more costly, they said, unless steps are taken now to mitigate the impact. 
 Two alternative futures are laid out in the study, which was reviewed by other scientists before being released. One projects what the future would look like if steps were taken to lower emissions; the other looks at what would happen if emissions continued to grow.
 Without reductions in emissions, sea levels could rise, inundating coastal areas on southern Long Island and pushing water into parts of Lower Manhattan, flooding the financial district and swamping the subways, making them inoperable. Atlantic City could be flooded every other year by late century. 
 The impact on New York State's $3.5 billion-a-year agricultural industry could be devastating, said David W. Wolfe, a professor of plant ecology in the Department of Horticulture at Cornell University and one of the scientists who contributed to the report. 
 While higher temperatures might at first be welcomed because they would extend the growing season, they would bring new plant and insect pests like the corn earworm that could ravage crops. 
 Unless emissions are reduced, the scientists warned, Long Island lobsters would disappear or move to cooler waters up north. Without a hard frost to set buds, New York apple trees would not produce as much fruit as before. Under stress from invasive species, maple, beech and birch trees could disappear from certain regions of the state, including the Adirondacks. 
 And since it would often be hotter than dairy cows like, milk production could decline by 15 percent or more in late summer months. 
 Professor McCarthy said those future effects could be eased substantially by efforts just now being put into place to curb emissions.
 Those efforts include the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, in which all the northeastern states agreed to reduce power plant emissions and establish a carbon trading program. And New Jersey's global warming law, which Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed last Friday, commits the state to reducing all greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 80 percent by midcentury. 
 A separate news conference was held in Trenton yesterday, focusing on global warming's potential impact on New Jersey.
 Mr. Corzine said that state and local efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are important, but controlling global warming requires a commitment on the national level, something the current administration has been reluctant to pursue. 
 ''In absence of leadership on the federal level, the fight to reduce greenhouse gases has now fallen upon the states,'' Mr. Corzine said. The governor also called on individuals to do their share with simple acts like driving less and using mass transit. 
 The report did not include an analysis of the potential cost to business and consumers of the efforts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But Rohit T. Aggarwala, New York City's director of long-term planning and stability, said at the New York news conference that cutting carbon emissions would not necessarily have a negative cost.
 Mr. Aggarwala said that steps New York had already taken would improve the quality of life in the city and make New York more competitive. He said those efforts ranged from the relatively simple, like promoting the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs, to long-range strategic initiatives like congestion pricing.
 The full report on climate change in the Northeast is available at the Union of Concerned Scientists' Web site, www.ucsusa.org.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a report predicting dire flooding and other weather changes in the Northeast if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions misstated part of the title of Rohit T. Aggarwala, who said at a news conference accompanying the report's release that cutting emissions would not necessarily have a negative cost to business and consumers. He is New York City's director of long-term planning and sustainability, not stability. (Go to Article)

HEADLINE: The C.I.A.'s Missteps, From Past to Present

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BESCHLOSS. 
Michael Beschloss wrote the recently published ''Presidential Courage: Brave Leaders and How They Changed America, 1789-1989'' (Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
There have been angry C.I.A. books before. In the mid-1970s, with the revelation of ugly secrets about death plots, illegal openings of domestic mail and use of drugs for mind control came a rash of volumes decrying the notion that Americans could ever have countenanced ''so immoral'' an agency. 
 ''Legacy of Ashes,'' a deeply researched new chronicle of the Central Intelligence Agency by Tim Weiner, who covered intelligence issues for many years for The New York Times, is impassioned too. He is just as indignant about the offenses that Congress and other parts of our government investigated three decades ago -- and others have exposed since then. 
 The chief target of Mr. Weiner's anger, however, is not C.I.A. immorality but C.I.A. incompetence. ''The most powerful country in the history of Western civilization has failed to create a first-rate spy service,'' he complains. ''That failure constitutes a danger to the national security of the United States.''
 In this sense ''Legacy of Ashes'' is conspicuously a book of its time. In 2007 many Americans who think of the C.I.A. -- when they consider the now-diminished agency at all -- wonder bitterly why it could not help us avoid the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and why it claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction so dangerous that we had to fight a costly war in Iraq. 
 The C.I.A.'s loudest champions have traditionally insisted that its successes were classified and its failures heralded, and that anyone with full access to the secret record would venerate its role in United States national security since its founding under President Harry S. Truman. With Iraq as the end point, Mr. Weiner's thesis is instead that from the 1940s on, intelligence gaffes, sloppy covert action and bootlicking in the Oval Office have kept the agency from making the kind of grandiose contributions often claimed for it and, at crucial times, have done this country damage. 
 Anyone tempted to write this book off as an anti-C.I.A. screed had better look at Mr. Weiner's sources. The author has impressively studied the archival record, teased out newly declassified primary documents and done numerous interviews to glean as much as can be publicly known about the agency's history. Some of the most damning criticism of the C.I.A.'s past performance in this book comes not from gadflies or ideologues but from ex-officials and long-secret authorized accounts by C.I.A. historians. 
 For example Mr. Weiner quotes from a classified agency history of Korean War paramilitary operations: ''not only ineffective but probably morally reprehensible.'' And from a secret oversight report to Dwight D. Eisenhower at the end of his presidency that ''all of the covert action programs undertaken by C.I.A. up to this time'' had not been worth ''the risk of the great expenditure of manpower, money and other resources.''
 Mr. Weiner provides new insights and details on famous intelligence failures involving Fidel Castro's Cuba, chances for victory in Vietnam and the Soviet Union's staying power during the latter days of the cold war. Though Mr. Weiner's book hardly accentuates the positive, he does not fail to note what he calls the agency's ''rare bull's-eye,'' like an advance warning to President Lyndon B. Johnson on the probable shape and length of the Six-Day War in the Middle East in 1967. Another was the use in the 1980s of ''almost every weapon at the C.I.A.'s command -- psychological warfare, sabotage, economic warfare, strategic deception, counterintelligence, cyberwarfare'' -- in a campaign that ''destroyed a vigorous Soviet espionage team, damaged the Soviet economy, and destabilized the Soviet state.'' 
 Mr. Weiner argues that a bad C.I.A. track record has encouraged many of our gravest contemporary problems: Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, terrorism. For instance he lauds the agency's ''epic success'' against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. But he complains that the C.I.A. ''failed to see that the Islamic warriors it supported would soon take aim at the United States, and when that understanding came, the agency failed to act.'' 
 As he tells it, part of the problem has been misguided orders from presidents, like Eisenhower's demand in 1953 that the shah of Iran be restored to his throne. ''A generation of Iranians grew up knowing that the C.I.A. had installed the shah,'' Mr. Weiner notes. ''In time, the chaos that the agency had created in the streets of Tehran would return to haunt the United States.''
 Another difficulty has been the agency's periodic refusal to be in full sync with the presidents it serves. Reporting to John F. Kennedy on its planned invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, C.I.A. men like Allen W. Dulles and Richard Bissell exaggerated the chances for success and soft-pedaled the need for United States air cover when the anti-Castro exiles hit the beaches. Director William Casey's freelancing under Ronald Reagan led to the Iran-contra scandal, which, as Mr. Weiner rightly notes, ''came dangerously close'' to ruining the president and the agency. 
 Mr. Weiner is scathing about the current state of the agency, writing that George W. Bush has turned the institution ''once proudly run by his father'' into ''a paramilitary police force abroad and a paralyzed bureaucracy at headquarters.'' He says that President Bush ''casually pronounced a political death sentence'' on the C.I.A. in 2004 by dismissively explaining that the agency had been ''just guessing'' about the future of the Iraq war. 
 The most notorious muckraking C.I.A. books of the 1970s aspired to shatter the agency and make sure Americans never tried to create one again. Mr. Weiner's goal is just the opposite. He hopes that his book will ''serve as a warning,'' insisting that ''this nation may not long endure as a great power unless it finds the eyes to see things as they are in the world.''

HEADLINE: Bush Points to Tax Cuts as Budget Deficit Dips

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
Strong tax revenue has helped shave the federal budget deficit to its lowest level in five years, President Bush said Wednesday, seizing on the news as an opportunity to go on the offensive against Democrats for refusing to make permanent the tax cuts he said were working. 
 New estimates from the Treasury Department projected the deficit for this fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, at $205 billion, down from $248 billion last year and half the peak of $413 billion that it reached in 2004. Administration officials said the better number was due to stronger than expected personal paychecks, corporate earnings and capital gains.
 The new figure was still above estimates of the Congressional Budget Office and some private firms, which have reported that the deficit could be in the range of $150 billion this year. The Treasury's assumptions in projecting the deficit tend to be conservative, a practice that in the past has allowed Mr. Bush to claim that budget expectations have been surpassed.
 ''The policies of low taxes and spending restraint have produced a clear and measurable record of success,'' Mr. Bush said in a budget talk Wednesday at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. 
 ''Yet, in the face of all the evidence, Democrats in Congress still want to take us down a different path,'' he said, citing plans including what he described as ''the largest tax increase in history,'' a reference to Democratic intentions to let some of his tax cuts, themselves the largest in history, expire at the end of 2010.
 Mr. Bush said the nation was on track toward his goal of eliminating the deficit by 2012, when, he said, there will be a surplus of $33 billion. But that assumes in part that there are no unexpected costs related to military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 One set of figures from the Congressional Budget Office also predicts a 2012 surplus, in part under the assumption that the tax cuts expire as scheduled. But another set, which assumes a continuation of the tax cuts as Mr. Bush is calling for, projects a deficit.
 Mr. Bush and his political aides have long struggled to promote any positive economic data, an inclination that officials have partly attributed to a sort of referred pain from the war in Iraq, which has fed an overall feeling of public negativity, according to pollsters.
 The president's announcement on Wednesday gave fellow Republicans, who are as thirsty for good news as he is, something to herald, with Republican allies like Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona calling it ''yet more evidence that Republican tax relief has been good for our economy.''

HEADLINE: Abbas Plays On Hamas Boycott to Keep His Cabinet in Place

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Khaled Abu Aker contributed reporting from Ramallah.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 11 

 BODY:
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, convened the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday, but a Hamas boycott meant there was no quorum, which was clearly what Mr. Abbas wanted. With parliament unable to meet, he can extend the life of the emergency cabinet he appointed after Hamas took over Gaza.
 Hamas legislators boycotted the session, contending that it was illegal. Salah al-Bardawil, a Hamas legislator, said in Gaza that convening the legislature ''without arrangements with the biggest bloc, and with the Israeli arrest of Hamas legislators, was an attack on Palestinian legitimacy.'' 
 The term of the emergency government, led by an independent economist, Salaam Fayyad, is set to expire next week, after 30 days. Some Palestinian legal authorities say that Mr. Abbas, though he had the power to fire the old government under the Palestinian Basic Law, had no power to name a new government without legislative approval. Hamas won 74 seats in the 132-member parliament in elections in January 2006, but 39 Hamas legislators from the West Bank are in Israeli jails without charges. So with only the 35 Hamas legislators not in jail and the 45 seats held by its rival, Fatah, Hamas would have been in the minority if a quorum had been attained. 
 If the legislature is unable to convene, Mr. Abbas may be able to declare the government a ''caretaker'' until new elections can be held. Hamas has said it will not allow new elections to take place before the four-year term is over, and Mr. Abbas already backed down last December on new elections.
 A senior Fatah legislator, Azzam al-Ahmed, said that Mr. Abbas could invoke Article 43 of the Basic Law, which gives him the right to issue decrees in exceptional cases. But the legislature is supposed to review them eventually, and in any event, in Fatah's struggle with Hamas, legal niceties are not being observed by either side, and the debate over what the flawed Basic Law allows is seen as essentially academic.
 One Hamas deputy, Hatem Qafeisheh of Hebron, recently released from an Israeli jail, was in the parliament building but did not take part in the session. He went, he said, ''to send a message'' calling for ''an end to confrontation and a renewal of dialogue behind closed doors.''
 An independent legislator, Hanan Ashrawi, said: ''We are in deep crisis. We cannot continue in this manner. Elections are the only way out of this dangerous constitutional crisis.''
 Mr. Abbas met in Ramallah on Wednesday with a senior American diplomat, David Welch, before a visit beginning next Tuesday by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Before Ms. Rice arrives, Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel are expected to meet, possibly on Monday. 
 Also on Wednesday, Israel allowed fruits and vegetables to be delivered to Gaza, the Israeli Army said. Trucks carrying 300 tons of fruits and vegetables entered through the Sufa border crossing. The main goods crossing point, Karni, has been shut since June 12.
 Late Tuesday, Egypt began deploying hundreds of additional police officers on its side of Rafah, the main crossing point for people, to prevent Palestinian gunmen from storming through. 
 Rafah has been closed since June 9, and 6,000 Palestinians are stranded in Egypt, which has agreed with Israel not to open the crossing. Israel has offered to bring the Palestinians to Gaza through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, but Hamas has objected, saying that violates an agreement to allow people to cross directly from Egypt to Gaza through Rafah with Israeli video monitoring.
 Israel prefers Kerem Shalom because it can control who enters and exits and presumably can stop the smuggling of cash into Gaza by Hamas.

 Museums
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. 
(Grace Glueck)COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling -- more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Roberta Smith)GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. 
 (Martha Schwendener)
 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS, ' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Smith)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 AUTOMATIC Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by agiant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, through July 28. (Smith)
 Galleries: SoHo
 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semigeometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. 
 (Holland Cotter) 
 Galleries: Chelsea
 ROLE EXCHANGE This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy's fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS BILDER' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) 
 Last Chance
 DARBY BANNARD: MINIMAL PAINTINGS,1959-1965 While Darby Bannard tends to be associated with Color Field painting, these little-known early works reveal that he once played for the other team, Minimalism, and may even have helped start it. With their hard-edge, centered squares and circles, the paintings show Mr. Bannard streamlining aspects of Abstract Expressionism in step with artists like Donald Judd and Robert Irwin. The smallest works that hover between Minimalism and Color Field are best, but the show expands the history of a very expansive time. Jacobson Howard, 22 East 72nd Street, (212) 570-2362; closes on Thursday. (Smith) 
 PETER FISCHLI AND DAVIS WEISS: BOOKS, EDITIONS AND THE LIKE Drawn primarily from the artists' archives, and including posters, multiples, books and layouts of books as well as videos -- among them ''The Way Things Go,'' their great chain-reaction-in-a-studio -- this exhibition amounts to a rather complete if highly distilled retrospective of their consistently down-to-earth Duchampian view of life and art. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 GREY ART GALLERY: 'BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O'DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND' Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O'Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings. It's a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today's most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; closes tomorrow.

HEADLINE: The Land of Opportunity?

 BODY:
When questioned about the enormous income inequality in the United States, the cheerleaders of America's unfettered markets counter that everybody has a shot at becoming rich here. The distribution of income might be skewed, but America's economic mobility is second to none. 
 That image is wrong, and these days it abets far too many unfair policies, including cuts in essential programs like Head Start or Medicaid. The poor, we are told, can use their own bootstraps. President Bush got away with huge tax cuts for the rich in part because nonrich Americans, who make up most of the population, believe everybody has a chance of making it into the club. Unfortunately, the American dream is not that broadly accessible. 
 Recent research surveyed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a governmental think tank for the rich nations, found that mobility in the United States is lower than in other industrial countries. One study found that mobility between generations -- people doing better or worse than their parents -- is weaker in America than in Denmark, Austria, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France. In America, there is more than a 40 percent chance that if a father is in the bottom fifth of the earnings' distribution, his son will end up there, too. In Denmark, the equivalent odds are under 25 percent, and they are less than 30 percent in Britain. 
 America's sluggish mobility is ultimately unsurprising. Wealthy parents not only pass on that wealth in inheritances, they can pay for better education, nutrition and health care for their children. The poor cannot afford this investment in their children's development -- and the government doesn't provide nearly enough help. In a speech earlier this year, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, argued that while the inequality of rewards fuels the economy by making people exert themselves, opportunity should be ''as widely distributed and as equal as possible.'' The problem is that the have-nots don't have many opportunities either.

HEADLINE: Shares Soar On Reports By Retailers

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Wall Street shot past two milestones yesterday as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average hit records.
 Investors, who earlier this week were anxious about fallout from the subprime mortgage market meltdown and a possible slump in consumer spending, seemed to set aside those concerns for now and take a more optimistic view of the long-term economic outlook.
 They found comfort in a number of developments yesterday, including reports from retailers that were stronger than expected and a $38.1 billion bid for Alcan, the Canadian aluminum producer. 
 The Dow climbed 283.86 points, or 2.1 percent, to 13,861.73. The S.& P. 500 rose 28.94 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,547.70. The Nasdaq composite index increased 49.94 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,701.73.
 The rally was broadly based. All 30 stocks that make up the Dow average rose. In terms of points, it was the biggest gain for the Dow since October 2002. In percentage terms, it was the biggest gain since October 2003.
 ''I can't help but fall back to the F.D.R. line, 'There's nothing to fear but fear itself,' '' said Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. ''We were getting ourselves into a tizzy, but some of this stuff is just fear. It's not based in anything other than a psychological shift.''
 Just last month, stock prices suffered some of their worst losses of the year as interest rates on government Treasuries unexpectedly spiked. 
 But many investment strategists said they believe the stock market remains fundamentally strong, despite the recent volatility in prices. They saw yesterday as evidence of that underlying soundness. 
 ''You just can't keep a good market down,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist with Wells Capital Management. ''Clearly there's been this deep concern weighing over the market saying, 'Where is the consumer?' But we know now the consumer is alive and well.''
 To be sure, the retail store results were mixed. But they came in the same week as two huge retailers -- Home Depot and Sears -- said their results this year would be lower than expected as the weak housing market continued to depress sales. In light of those more pessimistic predictions, investors saw an upside to the numbers yesterday.
 One surprise for investors was the bellwether Wal-Mart Stores, which posted surprisingly strong sales at stores open at least a year, the industry standard for measuring business. Wal-Mart shares rose $1.15, to $48.83. The retail giants Costco and Target also had solid gains. Shares of Costco rose $1.02, to $61.74; Target gained $4.44, to $70.04. 
 But results were not as bright at department stores like J. C. Penney and Kohl's, which both saw declines.
 The aluminum deal, which was endorsed by Alcan's board yesterday over a competing but less lucrative offer from Alcoa, was reassuring for investors because it helped relieve concerns that merger activity was falling off. The deal would create the world's largest aluminum producer once Alcan and Rio Tinto combine. Shares of Alcan hit a record close yesterday of $98.45.
 Also playing a significant role in pushing stock prices higher, experts said, was a growing sense that the bond market had stabilized. After spiking to nearly 5.3 percent in mid-June, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, has fallen back to around 5.1 percent. 
 ''Our biggest concern was that interest rates were starting to move higher,'' said David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist for UBS. ''They seem to have found some relative stability compared to where they were in June, and this is really an important issue.''
 Interest rates on long term United States Treasury notes are not only stable, but they are above 5 percent -- a rate of return that is more acceptable to investors than the 4.5 to 4.9 percent range that held for the first half of this year. Yesterday, the 10-year note fell 10/32 to 95 6/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.13 percent from 5.09 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities.

HEADLINE: Indictment Says Ex-Mayor James Cheated Newark

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 12 

 BODY:
Sharpe James, the former mayor who towered over politics in this city for two decades and was a charismatic if combative cheerleader as it struggled to regain businesses and middle-class residents, was indicted on Thursday on charges of using city credit cards for personal expenses and letting a companion buy municipal property for a fraction of its worth.
 Mr. James, who built a patronage machine largely through cult of personality, is accused of illegally charging more than $58,000 on two city credit cards for Jacuzzi dips, alcohol, movies, meals and weekend getaways for tennis tournaments with friends.
 The United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, said the case against Mr. James contained ''stark examples of the greed and arrogance of unchecked power.'' 
 Mr. James also faces a charge of conspiring with one of his frequent travel partners, Tamika Riley, to defraud the city by selling her nine parcels of city land for $46,000 that she quickly resold for $665,000.
 Mr. James, 71, was led in handcuffs and leg shackles into a courtroom just two blocks from the City Hall where he held power. Released later on $250,000 bail, he told reporters that his wrists were a bit sore from the cuffs, but that he was happy to be freed. 
 ''I'm innocent of all these charges,'' he said. ''And I look forward to my day in court when the truth will come out.'' 
 The investigation, named ''Operation Cornered Lot,'' began three years ago, when federal agents received a telephone call from a Newark resident who said that the James administration was funneling city property to the mayor's friends and political associates, according to Weysan Dunn, special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s Newark office. 
 The case expanded last spring, when the United States attorney's office began reviewing Mr. James's use of his city credit cards during his last five years in office.
 It culminated on Thursday in a 33-count indictment that included claims that he defrauded the city in ways both extravagant and venal: $1,440 for a trip to a beachfront resort in the Dominican Republic, where Mr. James claimed he wanted to assess the tropical gardens to see if they could be replicated at the Newark train station.
 There was also, according to the indictment, $3,500 for a trip to Martha's Vineyard (plus $207 for an advance ferry reservation for his Rolls-Royce); $167.22 at clubs in Rio de Janeiro's red-light district; $297 to inspect a yacht he wanted to buy in Maryland; and $2,989 for a penthouse suite on a cruise that began six weeks after he left City Hall.
 He also ran up more than $1,600 in frequent trips to Applebee's restaurants and movie theaters outside Newark -- and resulting in a $39 fine for exceeding the credit limit on the city card.
 Then there was a $2,976 charge to rent a storage unit, the indictment charges, where Mr. James hid records pertaining to the city's land sales to Ms. Riley and had a contract stating, ''Authorized Users: None.''
 Ms. Riley, 38, whom prosecutors described as a failed clothier lacking experience in real estate or redevelopment, was also indicted on Thursday and released on $100,000 bond. 
 Mr. James is accused of helping steer city property to her at severely discounted prices on nine occasions from 2001 to 2006. In February 2005, for instance, the city sold Ms. Riley land with an assessed value of $212,600 for $4,000; she resold it for $100,000 a month later. 
 While the indictment does not present evidence that Mr. James directly benefited, it said Ms. Riley gave him thousands of dollars in campaign donations, often shortly after buying or reselling the properties.
 ''When Sharpe James had a choice between enriching himself or helping the people of Newark, he chose self-enrichment,'' Mr. Christie said in a statement as Mr. James and Ms. Riley pleaded not guilty in a 15-minute hearing in federal court here.
 ''When he had the choice between impartially serving the citizens of Newark and the state of New Jersey or rewarding female companions, supporters and himself with taxpayer money, he chose to cheat the people of Newark and the citizens of New Jersey.''
 Mr. Christie said Mr. James could face up to eight years in prison. 
 But it is one thing to indict such a popular politician in this town, another to convict him. Mr. James's immediate predecessor, Kenneth A. Gibson, was indicted in 2000, years after he stepped down from the mayoralty, on bribery, fraud and tax evasion charges involving his dealings with a suburban school board. Mr. Gibson's trial ended in a hung jury, but he later pleaded guilty to one minor count.
 Though Mr. James's indictment was long anticipated, its official announcement was nonetheless a startling moment in Newark politics, magnified by its occurrence on the day the city commemorated the 40th anniversary of the riots that decimated its core. 
 ''This is happening at a time when the entire city is involved in a retrospective of the riots, which is also the impact over the last 40 years of black political power here and elsewhere,'' said Larry Hamm, the founder of the Peoples Organization for Progress, a community group that protested everything from police brutality to eminent domain proceedings during Mr. James's tenure. 
 ''We have had two black mayors in Newark since then and now both of them have been indicted by federal prosecutors. Those of us who have been in the struggle can't help but believe that the larger society is trying to send some signals.''
 Mr. Christie brushed aside suggestions that race played any role in the prosecution, and said that the timing, in relation to the commemoration of the riots, was coincidental. 
 In Trenton, where Mr. James is retiring this fall after four terms as a state senator, Republicans said the charges seemed like an overdue comeuppance for a man who had lived an extravagant lifestyle -- he owned a Rolls-Royce, yacht and a home on the Jersey Shore -- that many considered beyond the reach of his government salaries. Senate President Richard J. Codey, a Democrat, said only that it was a sad day for the city of Newark and for Mr. James's family.
 It is unclear what may happen to the three government pensions Mr. James collects; on Thursday, the state suspended withdrawals from the two accounts it controls.
 According to the state treasurer's office, he withdrew more than $500,000 from his $1.1 million retirement account at Essex County College, where he was athletic director before becoming mayor in 1986.
 Mayor Cory A. Booker, whose administration is trying to reclaim some of the properties sold under Mr. James, declined to comment.
 Mr. James's defenders have said the property sales were part of a broader effort to boost the economy and reduce blight. 
 But Mr. Christie said on Thursday that for all the redevelopment Mr. James had orchestrated during his 20 years in office, his legacy ''is forever scarred by the allegations contained in this indictment.''

 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 'UTOPIA IN NEW YORK' Utopia, an Aboriginal-owned desert reservation the size of Rhode Island, was named in the 1920s by optimistic German immigrants in outback Australia hoping for a prosperous new life. A lively women's batik group was established there in the early 1980s among the Aboriginal population, but the settlement's fame peaked in the 1990s with the success of the protean painter Emily Kngwarreye. Known as the desert Monet, she took up painting at the age of 78 and produced an estimated 6,000 paintings in 10 years. In May, in Sydney, one of her paintings became the first work by an Aboriginal artist to exceed $1 million Australian at auction. Unfortunately, none of her paintings are showing in ''Utopia in New York,'' an otherwise tasty summer sampler of paintings at the Robert Steele Gallery by a dozen artists from the Utopia region, including well-known figures like Gloria Petyarre, Barbara Weir and Minnie Pwerle, whose 2001 acrylic on canvas, inspired by the territory, is at right. 
Most depict traditional motifs and designs for native flowers and vegetation, like the root pattern of a yam, a staple food. But others are more abstract and bear a visual resemblance to international art movements like optical art and 1970s painterly abstraction. But what jumps out most about these paintings is the color, radiant and intense. People think of the desert as all sandhills and rocks, but it rains out there, and when the desert comes into bloom, you see the most astonishing colors, just as in the paintings. (Through July 21, Robert Steele Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, 212-243-0165, robertsteelegallery.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling -- more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cezanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Glueck)
 THE MET: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met's esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) 
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: 'PARADISE IN PRINT,' through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed ''green gold'') are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby's 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon's ''Birds of America''; images of African slaves and colonialists; ; selections from 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse's book ''Flora of America;'' and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin's extraordinary ''Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,'' published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS, ' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Smith)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman) 
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ,' through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging, and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART:'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 Galleries: 57th Street
 AUTOMATIC Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann, William and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, through July 28. (Smith)
 Galleries: SoHo
 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semigeometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'CONCRETE WORKS' What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the works create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie's gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty's photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a ''discussion'' of Pollock's drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through July 27. (Schwendener)
 ROLE EXCHANGE This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy's fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)
 EZRA STOLLER : BUILDINGS OF NEW YORK Ezra Stoller (1915-2004) made a living photographing architecture, but he didn't consider himself an artist. ''I can draw out the strengths in a work that has strength,'' he once said, ''but I never claimed my work is art. The art is the architecture.'' You feel inclined to disagree when looking at his stunning black-and-white photographs of mid-20th-century buildings. For one thing, Stoller fits nicely into a trajectory of architecturally centered photography that wasn't always considered ''art'' (and includes the work of luminaries like Eugene Atget and Margaret Bourke-White). Stoller's photographs are also filled with sly details that emphasize the inevitable trudge of history and the modern overtaking the traditional and antique. Danziger Projects, 521 West 26th Street, danzigerprojects.com, through July 20. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS BILDER' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) 
 SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ... If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: 'ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) 
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio) 
 Last Chance
 DARBY BANNARD: MINIMAL PAINTINGS, 1959-1965 While Darby Bannard tends to be associated with Color Field painting, these little-known early works reveal that he once played for the other team, Minimalism, and may even have helped start it. With their hard-edge, centered squares and circles, the paintings show Mr. Bannard streamlining aspects of Abstract Expressionism in step with artists like Donald Judd and Robert Irwin. The smallest works that hover between Minimalism and Color Field are best, but the show expands the history of a very expansive time. Jacobson Howard, 22 East 72nd Street, (212) 570-2362; closes on Thursday. (Smith) 
 PETER FISCHLI AND DAVIS WEISS: BOOKS, EDITIONS AND THE LIKE Drawn primarily from the artists' archives, and including posters, multiples, books and layouts of books as well as videos -- among them ''The Way Things Go,'' their great chain-reaction-in-a-studio -- this exhibition amounts to a rather complete if highly distilled retrospective of their consistently down-to-earth Duchampian view of life and art. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035; closes tomorrow.(Smith)
 GREY ART GALLERY: 'BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O'DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND' Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O'Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It's a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today's most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; closes tomorrow. (Goodbody)
 DAN TOROP: SNOWBOUND Last summer Dan Torop and Justine Kurland organized an exhibition of photographs, ''A Rabbit as King of the Ghosts,'' which described the photographer as ''a seeker of mystery'' and photography as an act that ''casts a spell that turns the banal into the supernatural.'' This summer Mr. Torop delivers a similar manifesto with his own photographs. Many were taken in northern Iceland and depict a fairy-tale landscape of glaciers, water, mist and celestial effects. A few are like greeting-card images that counter the irony-laden and conceptually rigorous forms of photography that have dominated in the last few decades. Mr. Torop's dreamy visions register more like a challenge: What, you don't believe in magic? Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, derekeller.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rose in May, But the Pace Was Slower

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Imported oil became more expensive in May, and Americans bought more of it, helping to nudge the trade deficit higher.
 But when adjusted for inflation, May's $60 billion deficit looks less swollen -- a sign that the outlook for trade may continue to improve. 
 The Census Bureau said yesterday that the gap between what Americans import and export grew 2.3 percent in May from $58.7 billion in April. Compared with a year earlier, however, the imbalance grew at a slower rate. Imports surpassed exports by $295.5 billion for the first five months of 2007, compared with $317.8 billion for the period last year.
 Despite the rise in May, economists said they saw no change to the underlying fundamentals that seem to point to a narrowing trade imbalance this year. The dollar is weaker against major foreign currencies like the euro, making American exports cheaper. Growth overseas should remain robust this year, creating demand for American goods and services. At the same time, the United States economy is forecast to grow below its full potential, which would slow demand for imports.
 ''The trend is clear,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. ''This is a substantially improved environment now and for the foreseeable future. I'd hesitate to say we'd return to a trade surplus, but I think over the next few years, it will reduce.''
 Oil prices played a big role in the trade deficit's rise from April to May. The Census Bureau said Americans imported 320 million barrels of crude oil in May at $59.36 a barrel. In April, 305 million barrels were imported at $57.28 a barrel.
 The growing imbalance of trade with China was also a big factor. A third, or $20 billion, of the trade deficit in May was with China. It grew from $19.4 billion, in unadjusted terms, in April.
 ''The situation with China keeps worsening,'' Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, wrote in a research report. ''While sales to China are up somewhat, imports are increasing faster. As a consequence, for the first five months of the year, the deficit with China has increased by nearly 17 percent.''
 There were indications in the May numbers that businesses are rebuilding their inventories after letting them fall in the first quarter. Purchases of imported telecommunications equipment, clothing and pharmaceuticals grew significantly.
 The total value of imports in May rose $4.2 billion, or 2.3 percent. But the rise was not uniform. Imports of vehicles, engines and auto parts fell $508 million. Imports of toys declined $412 million.
 Over all, exports rose $2.9 billion, or 2.2 percent. Civilian aircraft made up the biggest chunk, $839 million. Exports of electrical equipment and computers were also strong. 
 ''This all bodes well ultimately for U.S. manufacturers,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist with Argus Research. ''We have global economic activity on the rise, and we have a weak American dollar. So now we're the attraction. And I think that's going to boost manufacturing activity.''

HEADLINE: A Voice of Developing Nations Asks the West for Compromise on Trade

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS. 
Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 12 

 BODY:
As the unofficial voice of developing countries in the deadlocked World Trade Organization talks, Kamal Nath has been called a lot of names in recent weeks -- including stubborn and irresponsible.
 The latest round of talks among a group known as the G4 nations -- India, Brazil, the United States and a representative of the European Union -- ground to a halt late last month after Mr. Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry, and Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, walked out. The United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, described their actions as ''inflexible'' and ''low ambition,'' and said they could harm emerging nations. 
 The stalled talks are emphasizing a deeper issue: In some ways, the balance of power between advanced and developing countries is shifting, politicians outside the West, including Mr. Nath, say. ''The reality is that there is a new economic architecture,'' Mr. Nath said in an interview this week in his New Delhi office. ''This new economic architecture is going to have new windows and new doors. It can't be wished away.'' 
 India and Brazil are refusing to open their markets further to goods from Western countries without a substantial reduction in subsidies provided to Western farmers. 
 On Thursday, Brazil filed a complaint with the W.T.O. about American farm subsidies. ''This complaint attacks the entire U.S. farming policy,'' Donizeti Beraldo, head of trade and international affairs at Brazil's National Agriculture Confederation, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying. Then, referring to the trade talks, Mr. Beraldo added, ''If the U.S. fails to advance on talks, they will be at risk of more complaints.''
 W.T.O. members are preparing for what is expected to be a decisive round of negotiations at the group's headquarters in Geneva. On Monday, the presiding officers will release draft agreements that could form the basis of a compromise or, depending on the view of countries like India, give a firm indication that the current round of trade talks begun in 2001 is on its last legs.
 Mr. Nath, whose office includes a shelf of thick W.T.O.-related publications, was quick to brush off questions about his flexibility, but still left no room for compromise. 
 The issue is not flexibility, he said: ''It is removal of subsidies, which are a distortion of global trade.'' Unless they are removed or substantially reduced, he continued, there will be no way to go forward with the talks. ''Is anyone saying that fair trade means the continuation of subsidies?''
 India and Brazil are asking the United States to reduce the estimated $22 billion in subsidies that it allots to farmers, and the European Union to trim its farm aid from 55 billion euros ($75.8 billion), saying the subsidies keep food prices on world markets artificially low and make it difficult for farmers from developing countries to compete. 
 Advanced industrial nations would like to see a substantial reduction in the taxes on exports to countries like India and Brazil to give their manufacturers access to those fast-growing economies. 
 Mr. Nath said he is seeking some understanding from the United States. Despite the growth of outsourcing and high-technology jobs in India in recent years, agriculture still supports about two-thirds of the country's citizens. 
 ''In the end, it is going to rely on a comprehension of the ground realities of India, and a sensitivity to that,'' Mr. Nath said. ''I have been pleading with Susan Schwab, please respect India's sensitivities when it comes to sustenance farmers.'' 
 India is in the midst of an economic boom that has driven up stock market indexes, wages and real estate prices to near record highs. Still, Mr. Nath was quick to distance the country from developed- nation economies. 
 India ''is so far away from the United States and the European Union,'' he said.
 ''We have 300 million people that live on $1 a day. We're talking about 100 years before India hopes to get anywhere close to the United States or the European Union.''
 Mr. Nath's hard line in the W.T.O. talks was in marked contrast to his three-year stretch as commerce minister. There, his tenure has been characterized by an increasing openness to foreign investment and partnership at home. He has sometimes faced criticism that he is too business-friendly. 
 Mr. Nath said his growing role as spokesman for developing nations is not deliberate. ''I am doing what I am required to do and what is appropriate for me to do for India and for other developing countries,'' he said. 
 In his view, the trade talks, which were intended to break through bottlenecks that have halted worldwide agreements, have been a failure. 
 ''The G4 process has not led anywhere,'' he said, ''so I think that the G4 process will be forgotten. We should expand this into a larger process that will be more inclusive.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Are Better Than Analysts Expected

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Retailers, including the industry leader, Wal-Mart Stores, yesterday reported June sales that topped Wall Street's lowered expectations.
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, posted a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent gain in June sales at its United States stores that were open at least a year and said its previous forecast for higher second-quarter earnings was attainable.
 In June, sales at 50 United States retailers rose a combined 2.4 percent, according to a tally by the International Council of Shopping Centers. The results beat its most recent forecast of a 1.5 to 2 percent rise, but trailed the advance of 3 percent in June 2006. 
 The Goldman Sachs retail composite index rose 2.1 percent for June.
 ''While they were by no means stellar results this month, they certainly were better than the gloom that was expected,'' Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc., a retail tracking company, said of the monthly sales figures.
 Retail sales have been trending lower this year as weakness in the housing market ripples through the economy and high fuel prices take a larger bite out of shoppers' wallets. Retailers have struggled to persuade shoppers to spend despite a dearth of popular fashion items.
 The trend has raised concerns about whether the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of national economic activity, would hold up.
 That concern was magnified this week when Sears Holdings and Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain, issued profit warnings.
 The final June sales results may have beat diminished expectations, but there were notes of caution, with Wal-Mart saying that gas prices were a top concern for shoppers.
 ''Consumers continue to be challenged financially, with more pressure on discretionary spending,'' Eduardo Castro-Wright, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart in the United States, said in a statement.
 With gasoline prices remaining high, consumers were concentrating on ''commuter shopping'' -- doing their shopping on the way to and from work, eliminating extra trips to the mall, said Craig Johnson, president of a retail consulting company, Customer Growth Partners.
 That was evident in the June sales results, with discount retailers and warehouse clubs posting strong results, but certain mall-based retailers, like department stores and some specialty apparel stores, lagging.
 Wal-Mart's domestic same-store sales in June rose 2.4 percent -- topping an average forecast of 0.9 percent among analysts polled by Reuters. The company had forecast sales would be flat to up 2 percent. June same-store sales at its namesake stores rose 1.6 percent, while sales at its Sam's Club warehouse division jumped 6.9 percent.
 A Wal-Mart rival, Target, said its June same-store sales rose 3.3 percent, near the low end of its forecast for a gain of 3 to 5 percent.
 Costco Wholesale, the No. 1 United States warehouse operator, and BJ's Wholesale Club, the No. 3 warehouse operator behind Sam's Club, also posted June results that beat analysts' view.
 But AnnTaylor Stores, the women's apparel retailer, reported a larger-than-expected 8.4 percent decline in June same-store sales, citing slow customer traffic and continued weakness at its Loft chain.
 The department store operator Macy's also struggled, reporting a bigger-than-expected 2.7 percent decline in June same-store sales, and it reduced its quarterly profit outlook.
 Also posting disappointing sales were the clothing retailer Gap and the department store operator Bon-Ton Stores. Gap said its same-store sales fell 5 percent in June, hurt by weakness at its Old Navy and Gap chains.

HEADLINE: Fitch May Downgrade Bonds Tied to Subprime Mortgages

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings, the credit ratings agency, said yesterday that it might downgrade bonds valued at $7.1 billion because of rising delinquencies and defaults on subprime mortgages.
 The company put 170 subprime transactions ''under analysis,'' indicating that they may be cut. Ratings of 19 collateralized debt obligations were placed on review for a downgrade, Fitch, a unit of Fimilac, said. 
 Fitch and two rivals -- Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's -- have been under pressure from investors who contend the credit ratings do not reflect the current default rates, the highest in a decade by people with poor credit. A Fitch analyst, Robert Curran, said yesterday that the housing slump was deepening.
 S.& P. placed 612 classes of subprime on watch for downgrade on Tuesday, a step involving $7.4 billion, or 1.2 percent of the $565.3 billion of subprime bonds issued from the fourth quarter of 2005 through 2006. Moody's downgraded 399 subprime-mortgage securities and said it might cut an additional 32 securities, representing 6.8 percent of the subprime bonds rated by Moody's in 2006. 
 Moody's also said that units of Washington Mutual and General Electric were among four subprime lenders whose loans helped prompt Moody's Investors Service to downgrade mortgage securities this week.
 Long Beach Mortgage, which is owned by Washington Mutual, and WMC Mortgage, part of G.E., along with two other lenders, the New Century Financial Corporation and the Fremont General Corporation, made loans that backed about 60 percent of the $5 billion in bonds that the rating agency downgraded, Moody's chief credit officer for asset finance, Nicolas Weill, said. Their loans accounted for about 30 percent of the subprime-mortgage bonds issued last year, Mr. Weill said.
 Many of the bonds that S.& P. is reviewing are made up of loans originated by New Century of Irvine, Calif., which filed for bankruptcy protection in April, and Fremont of Santa Monica, Calif., which federal regulators forced from the subprime-loan business in March.
 Mr. Weill said that loans from Wells Fargo, the San Francisco bank, and Option One Mortgage, which H&R Block is selling to the hedge fund manager Cerberus Capital Management, are performing better than average.
 A spokeswoman for Washington Mutual, Sara Gaugl, declined to comment because the company plans to report earnings next week. A spokesman for G.E., Michael Ettlemyer, did not return a call. Jim Lucas, a spokesman for Fremont General, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Tax Loopholes Sweeten a Deal For Blackstone

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The Blackstone Group, the big buyout firm, has devised a way for its partners to effectively avoid paying taxes on $3.7 billion, the bulk of what it raised last month from selling shares to the public.
 Although they will initially pay $553 million in taxes, the partners will get that back, and about $200 million more, from the government over the long term.
 The plan, laid out in the fine print of Blackstone's financial documents, comes as Congress debates how much managers at private equity firms like Blackstone and hedge funds should pay in taxes on their compensation. 
 Lee Sheppard, a tax lawyer who critiques deals for Tax Notes magazine and has studied the Blackstone arrangement, said it was a reminder of the disconnect between the tax debate in Congress and how the tax system actually operates at the highest levels of the economy. 
 ''These guys have figured out how to turn paying taxes into an annuity,'' Ms. Sheppard said. ''What people don't realize is that the private equity managers, the investment bankers, all the financial intermediaries, are in control of their own taxation and so the debate in Washington about what tax rate to pay misses the big picture.''
 The debate in Congress is about whether most of the compensation that fund managers earn should be taxed at the 35 percent rate that applies to other highly paid Americans, or at the 15 percent rate for capital gains. 
 Questions in Congress about possibly raising taxes on such compensation were prompted in part by publicity about the rich rewards for people who run these firms. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group, made nearly $400 million last year, for example.
 The Blackstone partners' tax deal, however, is for the sale of part of their stake in the management firm, which is why their profits were taxed at the usual 15 percent tax rate for capital gains. Over all, the company raised $4.75 billion in the initial public offering, but the benefits of the tax structure involve just $3.7 billion of that.
 Other private equity firms and hedge funds that have gone public, or plan to, make use of similar techniques, their documents show.
 The Fortress Investment Group, which went public in February, uses a form of this tax structure. Two funds that plan to go public soon, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Och-Ziff Capital Management, describe similar tax strategies in their preliminary disclosure documents. 
 All three firms declined to comment. However, several tax lawyers, who could not be quoted by name because their firms had restricted them from making public comments on these issues, agreed in principle with the analysis of the tax structure's implications.
 No Blackstone official would speak for attribution. A spokesman, who insisted on not being identified, said only that such an analysis of the tax implications of Blackstone's deal was ''totally flawed.''
 A report issued this week by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation indicated that such deals had been done at other companies. 
 Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of Illinois, came to a similar conclusion as Ms. Sheppard after studying the Blackstone deal.
 Blackstone's tax maneuver hinges on its use of good will, an accounting term for the value of the intangible assets, like a well-known brand name, that are built up by a company over time. That value is part of the reason a company is worth more than the sum of its physical parts, like buildings and equipment.
 Individuals who create good will cannot deduct it. But when good will is sold the new owners can because its value is assumed to erode. The Blackstone partners sold the good will from their left pocket to their right.
 In simplest terms, the Blackstone partners paid a 15 percent capital gains rate on the shares they sold last month in the initial stock offering to outside investors (those shares represented a stake in the Blackstone management company, not its funds). 
 Blackstone then arranged to get deductions for itself for the $3.7 billion worth of good will at a 35 percent rate. This is a twist on the ''buy low, sell high'' stock market adage; in this case it would be ''tax low, deduct high.''
 The deductions must be spread out over 15 years. And the original Blackstone partners are getting just 85 percent of the tax savings, leaving the other 15 percent to outside investors. The deductions on the $3.7 billion to the partners are $1.1 billion over 15 years.
 If these tax savings were paid as a lump sum this year, the partners would get about $751 million, which is $198 million more than the taxes the partners will pay on the $3.7 billion of good will.
 The lump-sum value was done using the rate set by the Internal Revenue Service for deals lasting 15 years.
 Officials at one hedge fund suggested that a rate three times that set by the government should be used to calculate the long-term economics because many hedge funds and private equity firms earn high rates of return. Applying this interest rate, 15 percent, still results in a net tax of $175 million for the Blackstone partners, or less than 5 percent.
 How can those deductions be worth almost as much, or more, than the taxes paid?
 The ability to provide answers to such questions is why tax lawyers can typically charge $700 an hour or more. Just as fashion designers blend textures, colors and shapes, tax experts mix and match elements of partnerships and corporations, and bits and pieces of the tax code, securities laws, accounting rules and economics principles.
 The tax maneuver starts with Blackstone partners selling to a newly created subsidiary corporation $3.7 billion worth of good will. Such entities are known within the tax trade as blocker corporations, because they help block taxes from reaching the Treasury. 
 Here is how the structure works: Blackstone can deduct 35 percent, based on the corporate tax rate for depreciation, of the value of $3.7 billion in good will, or $1.3 billion. Because the partners told investors they have the right to 85 percent of that amount, that means they have $1.1 billion worth of deductions.
 That amount would be saved over 15 years. But for an apples-to-apples comparison with the taxes it pays on the proceeds this year, the value of $1.1 billion in today's dollars is $751 million.
 Compared with the $553 million tax paid, the Blackstone partners will get back $198 million more than they paid in taxes.
 To reap those savings from the deductions, Blackstone needs to funnel income into that blocker corporation. 
 So Blackstone directs to the corporation the annual fees it receives from investors for managing their money, which is 2 percent of the assets they manage. Those fees totaled more than $850 million last year, far more than the amount needed to write off the good will.

HEADLINE: An Unjustified Privilege

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
During the 2000 presidential campaign, Ralph Nader mocked politicians of both parties as ''Republicrats,'' equally subservient to corporations and the wealthy. It was nonsense, of course: the modern G.O.P. is so devoted to the cause of making the rich richer that it makes even the most business-friendly Democrats look like F.D.R.
 But right now, as I watch Senate Democrats waffle over what should be a clear issue of justice and sound tax policy -- namely, whether managers of private equity funds and hedge funds should be subject to the same taxes as ordinary working Americans -- I'm starting to feel that Mr. Nader wasn't all wrong. 
 What's at stake here is a proposal by House Democrats to tax ''carried interest'' as regular income. This would close a tax loophole that is complicated in detail, but basically lets fund managers take a large part of the fees they earn for handling other peoples' money and redefine those fees, for tax purposes, as capital gains.
 The effect of this redefinition is that income that should be considered by normal standards to be ordinary income taxed at a 35 percent rate is treated as capital gains, taxed at only 15 percent instead. So fund managers get to pay a low tax rate that is supposed to provide incentives to risk-taking investors, even though they aren't investors and they aren't taking risks. 
 For example, the typical hedge-fund manager has a 2-and-20 contract -- that is, he gets a fee equal to 2 percent of the funds under management, plus 20 percent of whatever his fund earns. It's not exactly straight salary, but none of this income comes from putting his own wealth at risk. Except for the fact that he might make a billion dollars a year, he resembles a waitress whose income depends on a mix of wages and tips, or a salesman who lives on a mix of salary and commissions, more than he resembles an entrepreneur who sinks his life savings into a new business. 
 So why does he get the same tax breaks as that entrepreneur? Not to put too fine a point on it, why does Henry Kravis pay a lower tax rate on his management fees than I pay on my book royalties?
 There's a larger question one could ask: should we even be giving preferential tax treatment to true capital gains? I'd say no, because there's very little evidence that taxing capital gains as ordinary income would actually hurt the economy. Meanwhile, the low tax rate on capital gains is one main reason the truly rich often pay lower tax rates than the middle class. 
 A couple of weeks ago, Warren Buffett pointed out that he pays an average federal income tax rate of 17.7 percent, while his receptionist pays about 30 percent. 
 But even those who disagree with me on the larger point, who think the special treatment of capital gains is justified, should be able to agree that treating the income of fund managers differently from the way we treat the income of everyone else who works for a living makes no sense. And that's why it's very disheartening to read that prominent Democratic senators are taking seriously the claims of fund managers that making them pay taxes like regular people would discourage risk-taking. 
 The immediate response should be: what risk-taking? To repeat: the fund managers aren't entrepreneurs; they aren't putting their own assets on the line.
 Look, this isn't about envy, about punishing success. No doubt many fund managers earn their pay. Some of them also give generously to worthy causes. 
 But closing the carried interest loophole should be a simple question of fairness: other Americans also earn their pay, but they don't get special tax breaks. Plus, we're talking about a lot of lost revenue due to that loophole -- revenue that could, for example, be paying for the health care of tens if not hundreds of thousands of children. 
 And since we're living in the real world of politics, there's also the Republicrat issue: the hesitation of the Senate Democrats is terrible for the party's image. It conveys the impression that they're as beholden to hedge funds, one of the few types of businesses whose campaign contributions strongly favor Democrats, as Republicans are to the oil and drug industries. 
 So here's a plea to Democratic senators on the fence: do the right thing and close this unjustified tax loophole.

HEADLINE: A Firm Bush Tells Congress Not to Dictate Policy on War

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFF ZELENY; David S. Cloud contributed reporting from Washington, and James Glanz from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12 

 BODY:
President Bush struck an aggressive new tone on Thursday in his clash with Congress over Iraq, telling lawmakers they had no business trying to manage the war, portraying the conflict as a showdown with Al Qaeda and warning that moving toward withdrawal now would risk ''mass killings on a horrific scale.''
 Hours later, the Democratic-controlled House responded by voting almost totally along party lines to require that the United States withdraw most combat troops from Iraq by April 1.
 The 223-to-201 House vote, in which just four Republicans broke with their party, came as the White House continued its intense effort to stem a growing tide of Republican defections on the war. Officials from the White House -- beginning with the president himself -- have been reaching out to party members all week, trying to persuade them to wait until September to pass judgment on Mr. Bush's current military strategy of sending more troops to quell the sectarian fighting and pursue insurgents. 
 The Senate has so far fallen well short of the 60 votes needed to approve a troop withdrawal, but more votes are expected there next week. And while Democrats have failed to win enough Republican votes to force a change in policy, Democratic leaders say they remain hopeful. Even some Republicans conceded Thursday that it could be difficult for Mr. Bush to hold the party together for much longer.
 At a morning news conference where he released a mixed progress report on his troop buildup, Mr. Bush repeatedly invoked the threat of Al Qaeda as a reason to stick with his strategy, saying the group he referred to as Al Qaeda in Iraq ''has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden.'' 
 The president acknowledged that public opinion might be against him -- he said that ''sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don't enable you to be loved'' -- but suggested that Congress was overstepping its constitutional role by trying to force a change of policy on him. 
 ''I don't think Congress ought to be running the war,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think they ought to be funding the troops.''
 It is the first time since the Vietnam War that the legislative and executive branches have fought so bitterly over the president's authority as commander in chief. Around the Capitol on Thursday morning, televisions were tuned into the White House news conference, as lawmakers and their aides passed around the White House's status report on Iraq. 
 Lawmakers in both parties bristled at the president's suggestion that Congress was overstepping its role in the war debate. Among them was Senator George V. Voinovich, a Republican from Ohio who has called for a change of direction in Iraq.
 ''We have a role to express our opinion in regards to the way he does anything,'' Mr. Voinovich said in an interview. ''He should welcome our point of view because it does reflect the point of view of the people who elected us to office.''
 Mr. Bush wants Congress to wait until September, when the top military commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and the top civilian official, Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, deliver a fuller assessment of progress of the troop buildup. But the president also said he was not ''going to speculate on what my frame of mind will be,'' at that time, and he would not say how he might react if the September report is as mixed as the one delivered Thursday.
 The report assessed the Iraqi government's progress in meeting 18 benchmarks set by Congress on military, economic and political matters. It found the Iraqis had made satisfactory progress in meeting eight benchmarks, including committing three brigades for operations in and around Baghdad, and spending nearly $7.3 billion in Iraqi money to train, equip and modernize its forces.
 But the Iraqis made unsatisfactory progress in meeting another eight benchmarks, including passing an oil revenue-sharing law and preparing for local elections that could help reconcile the country's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish factions. On two benchmarks, progress was too mixed to be characterized.
 The report bluntly criticized the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, saying the government continued to permit political interference in some military decisions. Though the report claimed that Mr. Maliki was not involved, it singled out the Iraqi Office of the Commander in Chief, which reports directly to Mr. Maliki, saying there was evidence that the office formulated ''target lists,'' primarily of Sunnis.
 And Mr. Bush himself offered only lukewarm support for Mr. Maliki at Thursday's news conference, declining to echo the praise he put forth in Jordan last November, when he proclaimed Mr. Maliki ''the right guy for Iraq.'' Asked if he still felt that way, the president responded, ''I believe that he understands that there needs to be serious reconciliation, and they need to get law passed.'' 
 As Mr. Bush offered his interpretation of the report, administration officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, were working behind the scenes, offering to interpret the document for Republican senators. Among those called was Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, who is working with Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, to draft a proposal calling for a change in the military mission in Iraq. 
 Mr. Warner said the report was disappointing. ''That government is simply not providing leadership worthy of the considerable sacrifice of our forces,'' he said of the Iraqis, ''and this has to change immediately.''
 Despite such warnings, administration officials, who just two weeks ago feared Republican support for the troop buildup might collapse, say they think they will be able to hold the party together until September. One senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the feeling inside the White House was that while Americans want to get out of the war, they have enough doubts about withdrawing to give Mr. Bush leeway to pursue his strategy at least for another two months.
 ''There's something in the American psyche that says this is important,'' the official said, ''and for all the criticism about how we got into it, we'd better be careful about where we go from here.''
 Mr. Bush has been making the case, as he did again Thursday, that the troop buildup, which was completed only last month, cannot be fully evaluated until September. He said Congress itself had dictated that schedule in an emergency spending bill passed earlier this year, and he urged lawmakers to stick to it. Mr. Bush said the military gains cited in the report would ease the way for progress in creating a viable, effective Iraqi government.
 But even among Republicans, patience is wearing thin, and the White House has not spelled out why it believes that Iraq will look substantially different in just eight weeks.
 At the news conference, Mr. Bush was asked why -- after failing to anticipate the sectarian divisions that would tear the country apart after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government -- Americans should believe he has the vision for victory in Iraq. The president responded by appearing to lay blame for mistakes in the war directly on one of his military commanders at the beginning of the war, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, who led the invasion more than four years ago.
 ''Those are all legitimate question that I'm sure historians will analyze,'' he said, adding that he had asked at the outset of the war whether his military commanders needed more troops. ''My primary question to General Franks was: 'Do you have what it takes to succeed, and do you have what it takes to succeed after you succeed in removing Saddam Hussein?' And his answer was, 'Yeah.' ''
 Critics of Thursday's White House report said it overstated the Iraqis' progress. In sections of the report dealing with efforts to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, for example, two different benchmarks were given satisfactory grades while offering little evidence that reconstruction was anywhere close to improving the delivery of electricity, water, sanitation or other services.
 In 2006, for example, the Iraqi ministries were criticized for failing to spend all but a small fraction of the billions in oil revenues the Iraqi government had set aside for reconstruction. But American officials said in an interview on Thursday that spending had only modestly accelerated toward the end of 2006 and into early 2007, and that the Iraqi government had not provided precise figures for this year.

HEADLINE: President Discusses Points Contained in His Report to Congress Concerning Iraq War

 BODY:
Excerpts from President Bush's opening statement at a news conference on the release of a report to Congress on the war in Iraq, as transcribed by Federal News Service Inc. 
 Since America began military operations in Iraq, the conflict there has gone through four major phases. The first phase was the liberation of Iraq from Saddam Hussein. The second phase was the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people and the holding of free elections. The third phase was the tragic escalation of sectarian violence, sparked by the bombing of the golden mosque in Samarra.
 We've entered a fourth phase, deploying reinforcements and launching new operations to help Iraqis bring security to their people. .... 
 Sometimes the debate over Iraq is cast as a disagreement between those who want to keep our troops in Iraq and those who want to bring our troops home, and this is not the real debate. I don't know anyone who doesn't want to see the day when our brave service men and women can start coming home. ...The real debate over Iraq is between those who think the fight is lost or not worth the cost and those who believe the fight can be won, and that as difficult as the fight is, the cost of defeat would be far higher.
 I believe we can succeed in Iraq, and I know we must.
 So we're working to defeat Al Qaeda and other extremists and aid the rise of an Iraqi government that can protect its people, deliver basic services and be an ally in the war against these extremists and radicals. By doing this, we'll create the conditions that would allow our troops to begin coming home while securing our long-term national interests in Iraq and in the region.
 When we start drawing down our forces in Iraq, it will be because our military commanders say the conditions on the ground are right, not because pollsters say it'll be good politics. The strategy I announced in January is designed to seize the initiative and create those conditions. It's aimed at helping the Iraqis strengthen their government so that it can function even amid violence. It seeks to open space for Iraq's political leaders to advance the difficult process of national reconciliation, which is essential to lasting security and stability. It is focused on applying sustained military pressure to route out terrorist networks in Baghdad and surrounding areas. It is committed to using diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraqi's democratic government. Doing all these things, it is intended to make possible a more limited role in Iraq for the United States. ... 
 Our top priority is to help the Iraqis protect their population. So we've launched an offensive in and around Baghdad to go after extremists, to buy more time for Iraqi forces to develop and to help normal life and civil society take root in communities and neighborhoods throughout the country. ...
 Two months ago in the supplemental appropriations bill funding our troops, Congress established 18 benchmarks to gauge the progress of the Iraqi government. ... Of the 18 benchmarks Congress asked us to measure, we can report that satisfactory progress is being made in eight areas. For example, Iraqis have provided the three brigades they promised for operations in and around Baghdad, and the Iraqi government is spending nearly $7.3 billion from its own funds this year to train, equip and modernize its forces. In eight other areas, the Iraqis have much more work to do. For example, they have not done enough to prepare for local elections or pass a law to share oil revenues. And in two remaining areas, progress is too mixed to be characterized one way or the other.
 Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost will likely point to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the political benchmarks. Those of us who believe the battle in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for optimism. Our strategy is built on the premise that progress on security will pave the way for political progress, so it's not surprising that political progress is lagging behind the security gains we are seeing. Economic development funds are critical to helping Iraq make this political progress. Today I'm exercising the waiver authority granted me by Congress to release a substantial portion of those funds. ...
 This September, as Congress has required, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will return to Washington to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
 By that time, we hope to see further improvement in the positive areas, the beginning of improvement in the negative areas. We also have a clearer picture of how the new strategy is unfolding and be in a better position to judge where we need to make any adjustments.
 I will rely on General Petraeus to give me his recommendations for the appropriate troop levels in Iraq. I will discuss the recommendation with the secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I will continue consultations with members of the United States Congress from both sides of the aisle. And then I'll make a decision.

HEADLINE: Business Casual

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
As an environment for access to business information, Allen & Company's annual summit meeting this week in Sun Valley, Idaho, leaves a little to be desired. 
 Yes, high-net-worth individuals, many of whom have their hands on the levers of the media and entertainment economy, gather in one place, and business is undoubtedly being conducted. But anything noteworthy takes place out of view.
 In fact, much is out of view. There is a significant presence on the part of journalists. But we are not invited to the social gatherings or the gold-plate presentations -- a media and technology event with old and new royalty -- Sergey Brin of Google, Howard Stringer of Sony, Barry Diller of IAC/InterActiveCorp, and Jeff Bezos of Amazon -- sitting side by side. 
 Reporters here -- The New York Times sent a reporter to blog for DealBook -- are far overmatched by the burly, owly security crew. We are tolerated, but more or less invited to stand in the bushes and observe. The ground rules in place bring to mind a presidential campaign: Significant adjacency to important events and people but little in the way of access or insight. 
 Still, there are a lot of press at a nonpress event, and it all takes place in Sun Valley, the kind of toy town where wealth is part of the civic culture. Everybody, it seems, is rich and happy here, and the temporary addition of a few hundred people at the vanguard of business has only elevated the median income. 
 But the ambient business and political wattage, some arrayed in shorts and flip-flops like the former C.I.A. director George Tenet, make it too tantalizing to miss. News has been known to have been made here -- the marriage of ABC and Capital Cities was arranged in Sun Valley and the courting of YouTube last year ended with Google stepping up to the plate a few months later -- but there is a huge emphasis on informality and a sincere effort to include the families of those attending.
 The programming is hardly onerous -- a couple of hours in the morning and then it's off for golf or whitewater kayaking. But while moguls may come to frolic, there is very little profiling or preening, in part because of Allen & Company's mellow management of the event. 
 ''You could randomly pick any event and it would be far more pretentious than this one,'' said Blake Krikorian, a founder of Sling Media, which makes a device that allows consumers to shift content from home to wherever they are, and one of this year's potential beanie babies in terms of acquisitions.
 The informality hides a kabuki where business and finance folks pivot from table to table, and reporters, standing at a distance, try and conjure something, anything out of juxtapositions. Most of the speed dating about potential deals takes place out on the paths, away from prying eyes. Reporters are tolerated as optional amenities.
 Harvey Weinstein, normally a garrulous type had little to say to reporters. 
 A few of those in attendance will stop and drop an aphorism or two about the proceedings, mostly it seems, out of pity. Rupert Murdoch, who is here with his wife, Wendi Deng, will have none of it, smiling in glee as he slipped out while reporters were busy listening to Mr. Brin. 
 Still, there Mr. Murdoch stood yesterday afternoon, far out in the parking lot near the Inn with David F. DeVoe, the chief financial officer of his company, the News Corporation. Given the drama over his company's possible purchase of Dow Jones & Company -- Mr. Murdoch told The Associated Press that the Bancoft family ''keep changing their minds'' -- it was striking to see the two men in khakis, their tennis shoes bumping the asphalt as they spoke. Their conversation was probably as significant as it is unknowable. The Sun Valley conference has been like that: full of portent and empty of current content. Here's a few peeks from a distance:
 The media, an asymmetric threat that will worm into any available space, have overtaken the bar at the Inn, one of the few places that is not cordoned off with a full-stop sign, one that says, ''Private Event.'' Yesterday, Mr. Stringer ambled in with a clutch of newspapers for a quiet afternoon read, seemingly unaware that he had stepped into a den of hungry jackals. Most left him alone. With a deadline looming, I did not feel I had that luxury. 
 In general, Sony is well situated at a time when deals have given way to efforts to remain relevant on all types of platforms. With its hands in content, devices and software, Sony is one of the more converged companies in the game and has the share price to show for it.
 Mr. Stringer said that there was no question that this conference, with its blend of the old and the new, the young and the old, represented a new kind of melting pot for technology and business.
 ''The events of the last two years have gotten everyone's attention so that no one is complacent,'' he said. ''I think the overlaps between software, hardware and content are now so significant, that people are rushing to understand the new distributions forms.''
 ''The hostility toward people that are perceived as pirates has evaporated in the face of changes that are so profound it is difficult to predict what may happen even in the very near future,'' he said. ''Synergy is back with a vengeance and I don't have to defend myself anymore because the ability to access content any time, any where on any kind of device is now accepted.''
 Having made a reporter's day, he went back to his papers.
 ''You guys,'' Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, indicating a nearby gaggle of reporters, ''have to think that there is more going on here than there is.'' He continued: ''The plain fact is that you have to look at how the conference has changed. We are dealing in a lot bigger issues than we used to -- flat earth, terrorism, war -- than just deals.''
 ''This is what it looks like, which is some socializing, some schmoozing, and yes, some learning. I've had some interesting conversations and some time to relax. It's been a great event.''
 Mr. Brin, sitting atop the zeitgeist at Google, is hardly a press hound. But as one of the people of the moment, he was willing to show a little leg on the way out of yesterday morning's conferences. Standing in the lobby of the Inn, he took questions after a morning panel.
 What about Facebook? That's the social networking start-up that has Silicon Valley in blogging overdrive these days -- partly because of the site's growth spurt, but also because of its new ''Facebook Platform'' that lets developers build shareable applications. Yahoo offered to buy Facebook for nearly $1 billion last year but its overtures were turned down.
 ''Facebook? I really like the Facebook guys,'' Mr. Brin said, pausing as if to consider what might be the right thing to say. ''We don't really look at companies for acquisitions unless they are really interested. If they come to us, we'd certainly be open to talking. But I think they're building a great company of their own.'' 
 All indications, including that one, seem to suggest that Facebook will make its own way to the market. 
 Mr. Brin was asked if he was worried that all of the hype around social networks will take some of the heat out of the Google phenomenon. Naw, he said -- content is content. ''It only added to it,'' he said. ''Social networks are creating lots and lots of content, which was the subject of the panel and that means more for us to search.''
 I slinked back to a table in the Inn after the noon break and was typing a few items for the DealBook blog -- and then suddenly heard an avuncular, folksy voice -- the voice of God, only less scary, from the next table over.
 Warren E. Buffett, modestly holding forth, for a group of folks. Paydirt. ''Content has many ways of getting to the world, we've learned that,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''But the problem is, you still have only two eyeballs to take it in ...'' 
 Just then, a gigantic security guard came over to the table where DealBook had been sitting on and off, and said, ''Are you going to make us move them,'' gesturing toward Mr. Buffett and his group, ''by sitting here and writing down everything he says?'' 
 I guess not. I grabbed my stuff and slinked away.

HEADLINE: At N.A.A.C.P. Forum, Greeting Is Warm for All (Warmer for 2)

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 12 

 BODY:
Although the welcome was warm for all the presidential candidates who spoke here Thursday at an N.A.A.C.P. forum, no one else was greeted with as much enthusiasm as Senator Barack Obama, whose mere presence on the stage shot adrenalin through the mostly African-American audience of thousands.
 Although this was not a debate -- the event was billed as a forum for ideas -- it was as if Mr. Obama, the only black candidate, enjoyed the home field advantage over the seven other Democrats and one Republican who had accepted invitations. And he performed as if he knew it. 
 ''I know what you know,'' Mr. Obama said, ''which is that, despite all the progress that has been made, we still have more work to do.'' 
 The senator noted that more poor black men go to prison than to college, and, to roaring applause, contrasted that with the treatment of those with privilege: ''We have more work to do when Scooter Libby gets no prison time.''
 (I. Lewis Libby Jr., known as Scooter, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice, but President Bush commuted his 30-month prison sentence.)
 But Mr. Obama, of Illinois, cannot take the black vote for granted. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, has a deep reservoir of support on this front, particularly among elected officials and others with fond memories of her husband.
 And judging by the audience's reaction, Mrs. Clinton also struck chords with the crowd. By luck of the draw, she spoke first and was able to make some of the most powerful early statements about the plight of poor blacks during and after Hurricane Katrina and about disparities in the quality of health care and education. 
 ''We have a president who does not see what you and I see,'' she said. ''Over the next two hours, I think we'll talk about more issues of importance to African-Americans than the Bush administration has in six and a half years.'' 
 Before the Democrats took the stage, the Republican candidates were supposed to speak. But only one responded to the invitation from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, who got an enthusiastic standing ovation just for showing up. 
 As he stood alone on the stage, Mr. Tancredo said, ''This is my kind of debate.'' 
 Mike Gravel, a former Democratic senator from Alaska, provided some fireworks to what was an otherwise cordial event. He was the only candidate repeatedly to criticize the others and his party as not having taken strong enough action to end American involvement in Iraq. A moderator chided Mr. Gravel for not adhering to the forum rules. 
 But Iraq was on the minds of the other candidates, too. Earlier in the day and after the event, Mr. Obama criticized the Bush administration over the war, and particularly what he called the misleading report released by the White House on Thursday suggesting that progress was being made in Iraq. 
 ''Does this White House think that we don't know how to turn on our televisions?'' he said. ''Don't tell us we're making progress in Iraq when the last three months have been some of the deadliest since this war began.''
 But at the forum, economic issues took center stage, with former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina speaking of a lifelong commitment to helping the poor. Mr. Edwards also tailored his economic message to the audience, saying, ''We also need to create hope for so many young black men who think they're either going to die or go to prison.''
 Mr. Edwards on Wednesday indicated his support for legislation before Congress to raise the tax rate on hedge funds or their managers. On Thursday, Mr. Obama's campaign took that position, too, confirming that the senator would co-sponsor legislation to raise the 15 percent tax rate on certain private equity and hedge fund partnerships that go public to a top corporate rate of 35 percent.
 Aides to Mrs. Clinton said she would give her position on the issue in the next few days.

HEADLINE: The Night the Lights Went Out

BYLINE: SEWELL CHAN


HIGHLIGHT: City Room commemorates the 1977 blackout with a package that includes multimedia, reminiscences, readers' memories and a conversation with authors. 

 BODY:
Thirty years ago tonight, the lights went out: building by building, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood. Officially, the 1977 blackout lasted only 25 hours. But it left devastated neighborhoods and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. It quickly became a symbol of New York's malaise, arriving as it did when the city was just starting to climb out of near-bankruptcy. 
Our commemoration of this anniversary includes: 

        
A video, slideshow and podcast on the blackout;
        
A forum for readers' memories;
        
Reminiscences by Times reporters Robert D. McFadden, Joyce Purnick, Ralph Blumenthal, James Barron and photographer Chester Higgins Jr.; 
        
Answers by the authors James Goodman and Jonathan Mahler to questions from readers.
On Monday, we asked City Room readers for their reminiscences of the 1977 blackout. You responded with richly detailed stories, an urban tapestry of those two hot and hectic days.
Everyone seemed to remember where they were when the blackout started. Steve Moses was at a Broadway musical and took a bus back home to New Jersey, emerging from the Lincoln Tunnel to find he had nothing to look back at: "In those pre-9/11 days that was the only time I ever envisioned not seeing the city there." Brad was a 13-year-old riding the Staten Island Ferry; his uncle drove him to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where he saw shuckers in the clam bars, working by candlelight. Howard Herman was in the basement of Columbia University's law library and had to break the glass on an emergency door to get out. 
A number of readers worried for a moment that they had accidentally started the blackout -- single-handedly. Lisa Chang had just turned the switch on a lamp; Louise Schloss had just plugged in a television; and Keelin had just tripped over a power cord.
The blackout was particularly stressful for those who had to help and care for others. Richard Bochner was a medical student at North Central Bronx Hospital, where he spent the night caring for victims of violence. Marianne was a clinical nursing instructor at Lenox Hill Hospital, in the middle of performing a Caesarean section with her students. (The emergency generator turned on within a minute.) Vito Maggiolo was an auxiliary firefighter, driving with a friend in the South Bronx, when the power failed and the looting started; he and his friend "spent the rest of the night rushing from blaze to blaze, providing refreshments" to exhausted firefighters.
The looting and rioting that afflicted a wide swath of neighborhoods left indelible memories. D. Dolphin was a 7-year-old watching "Star Wars" at an Upper East Side movie theater with employees of his father's Harlem bicycle shop when the screen faded to black; the group rushed back uptown to deter robbers from breaking into the store. Brenda Perryman, who had just traveled from Detroit with family members to visit her brother in Brooklyn, watched the looting: "Out the window we witnessed young and old running to the stores on the corner. The gates protected the doors for only a little while. Folks hooked chains to the bumpers of their cars and pulled those gates down. A free-for-all ensued." Nancy, who was 17 at the time, recalls shop owners sitting in their stores on Flatbush Avenue, armed. 
For the city's children, the blackout left memories to last a lifetime. Richard M., who was 11 years old and watching television when the blackout hit, remembers the moment his father, a subway motorman, came back home with his mother. He said his family "was never more relieved in our lives, and I was never more proud of father than at that moment." Robert, who was 13, remembers how his family's dog slept on the cool tile floor of the hallway, rather than the carpeted floor of the bedrooms. Stacey Simmons was 9 years old and waited in fear: 
It was the first time in my life that I was afraid of something. I just wanted to know that my mother was safe. We lived in the North Bronx and had already heard about the looting and other destructive crimes occurring in other areas. I understood why people would find this a most opportune time, but I wanted one thing, my mother. I conjured up thoughts that the Son of Sam would find her and she would be gone forever.
Others drew inspiration from the cooperation and support of their neighbors. Jason had just finished playing basketball on Roosevelt Island, which he saw as a new experiment in diversity: "The blackout seemed to open everyone up to one another in a way I had not quite seen before. It was a beautiful evening."
The blackout's effects reached far beyond the five boroughs -- literally and otherwise. Marc was 19, home for college and rehearsing as a musical director for a summer theater production in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., when the lights shut off in the middle of a number. Warren Meislin was in London, where some of the newspapers warned that New York might "NEVER RECOVER." Mark Stallard -- who did not visit New York for the first time until 22 years later -- has remembered the blackout through the photo on the front page of The New York Times the next day. 
Let us close with the words of Keelin, who was a 20-year-old from Seattle, living in an artist's loft on Jay Street in Brooklyn, when the lights went out: 
What with the heat, the fire hydrants fanning out big sprays across the streets full of sweaty people, the looting, no subways, little work, no elevators, no refrigerators, Son of Sam roaming around, boyfriend sick, and punk rock as the sound track in my young head, Blackout '77 was a surreal, fun, scary holiday in New York City near its glorious nadir.

HEADLINE: Emptying Nest Eggs, Not the Nests

BYLINE: By ANGEL JENNINGS

 BODY:
Sue and Bob Riccardi put their two children through school, and then some.
 Their son, Michael, 23, just moved back home and is looking for a job. Their daughter, Alison, 20, will start graduate school at Columbia University next month, and they are paying her rent.
 In contrast to previous generations, when young people generally took control of their finances -- and their lives -- after graduating from college, more parents are supporting their offspring well into adulthood. 
 In part, it is a matter of economic necessity. College graduates face enormous loan debt. Their entry-level salaries do not come close to covering high housing costs in many parts of the country. And their parents, fearing the worst, agree to pitch in. Then there is the emotional attachment. 
 ''It's a gift we can give them now,'' said Mrs. Riccardi of Hillsdale, N.J. ''If we can bite the bullet now, it will help them later.'' 
 This gift is not a couple of $20 bills tucked into a holiday or birthday card. It is more like an allowance that extends past adolescence, often into the 30s. It pays for housing, bills and other expenses. In fact, research shows that financial strings to the parents' wallets are never really severed. 
 And this has financial specialists, researchers and sociologists on the fence. Some people argue that repeated parental handouts cause children to reach financial maturity later in life than they should. Others say that in the long run, parents actually give their children a leg up.
 But this head start could cause a setback for many parents. Though paying a child's rent might not break the bank, over time, it can slowly chip away at the parents' retirement fund or leisure money.
 ''The sooner parents cut off ties, the sooner they learn to do it on their own,'' said Suze Orman, financial columnist and author of the book ''Young, Fabulous and Broke.''
 The common practice of ending financial obligation after their children graduate from high school or college is gone. Parents are carrying their children longer, pouring in thousands of dollars a year -- if not tens of thousands -- to their college graduates. 
 Thirty-four percent of adults 18 to 34 receive financial assistance from their parents, according to a study by the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan and published in ''On the Frontier of Adulthood.''
 During this time parents can expect to pay on average $38,340 helping their children transition to adulthood. That is roughly $2,200 a year.
 ''While parents are more able, than in the past, to provide assistance -- some are overextending themselves,'' said Robert F. Schoeni, an associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-author of the study. 
 Parents provide more than just financial help. Sometimes just having a place to stay is more than enough for the college graduate. 
 At 22, Adedayo Kosoko had a psychology degree and very little money. He decided to move back home to save. He traded privacy for free rent and gave up house parties for family dinners. For two years he lived under the watchful eye of his mother.
 While doing so, he put away the money he earned as an admission counselor at Creighton University, his alma mater. Two weeks ago he moved into his own place in downtown Omaha. 
 ''My mom paved the way,'' said Mr. Kosoko, now 24. ''Her help allowed me to help myself.''
 Other parents provide cold hard cash. 
 The Riccardis pay $1,300 a month for the Manhattan apartment their daughter, Alison, shares with her fiance. That takes care of the rent, electricity, cable TV and Internet. 
 Their son, Michael, just earned his master's degree at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. He returned to his childhood home in New Jersey to warm meals and open arms. He plans to look for a teaching position in the area. Then he will look for a place of his own. 
 ''It's not forever,'' said Mrs. Riccardi, who works for a software company while her husband works the late shift as a computer operator at a bank. ''In a couple of years they will both be self-sufficient.''
 Young people today face a different economic situation than their baby boomer parents did. It used to be that grants and scholarship covered tuition. Now college students take out loans to pay for tuition costs that continue to rise even as financial aid falls. It is not unusual to see graduates with loan debt exceeding $40,000. And students are graduating with an average credit card balance of $3,400, according to the 2002 National Student Loan Survey collected by Sallie Mae, a national provider of student loans. 
 In addition, graduates enter into a difficult job market. And housing costs continue to soar. 
 Twentysomething, a market researcher that tracks youth trends, estimates that graduates need $4,295 upfront for a new apartment, deposits, furniture and supplies. 
 Alison Riccardi zipped through her studies at New York University, completing her undergraduate degree in three years, to save money. Still, she graduated with $50,000 in loan debt. 
 For months, she struggled to find a summer job that used her psychology degree. She applied to more than 15 hospitals and clinics. All the jobs in her field wanted more education than the bachelor's degree. Alison ended up taking a part-time job as an assistant. 
 Her parents knew Alison and her fiance could not afford their apartment on their small salaries. So they agreed to continue paying for it so the couple could save for a home and a wedding.
 ''I am really lucky to have their support,'' she said. ''I know friends that parents cut them off when they graduate and they flounder really hard for a while.''
 Financial specialists are quick to point out that while this ''boomerang effect'' is a recent phenomenon in the United States, other countries have long had this practice. In Italy and Spain, adults live at home until they are married. And parents often provide financial support even after the children leave the home.
 The lasting effects here might not be on the adult children, but rather, their parents. Financial advisers find these baby boomers are depleting their resources to give their children support they never received from their own parents. 
 Instead of preparing for retirement, the parents are dipping into their savings, taking out loans and working extra years past retirement age.
 ''Parents are financially squeezed, which is why many of the boomers can't leave the work force,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''In turn, college graduates can't move up in their career.''
 Mrs. Riccardi remembers working a full-time job and juggling school. Her mother always told her she wished she could do more for her. So Mrs. Riccardi promised she would do whatever she could to help her children.
 The Riccardis cut back on vacations and let some of the home improvements go undone. Though the Riccardis have to make sacrifices, she said, they enjoy watching their children enjoy life. 
 ''I wish I could do more for my daughter, like give her an apartment in the Village,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Public Defenders Get Better Marks When on Salary

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Some poor people accused of federal crimes are represented by full-time federal public defenders who earn salaries, others by court-appointed lawyers who bill by the hour. A new study from an economist at Harvard says there is a surprisingly wide gap in how well the two groups perform.
 Both kinds of lawyers are paid by the government, and they were long thought to perform about equally. But the study concludes that lawyers paid by the hour are less qualified and let cases drag on and achieve worse results for their clients, including sentences that average eight months longer. 
 Appointed lawyers also cost taxpayers $61 million a year more than salaried public defenders would have cost.
 There are many possible reasons for the differences in performance. Salaried public defenders generally handle more cases and have more interactions with prosecutors, so they may have a better sense of what they can negotiate for their clients. Salaried lawyers also tend to have superior credentials and more legal experience, the study found. 
 The study will add a new layer to the debate over the nation's indigent defense systems. In 1963, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that poor people accused of serious crimes were entitled to legal representation paid for by the government.
 The federal system handles about 5 percent of all criminal prosecutions and is relatively well financed. The implications of the new study for the states may therefore be limited.
 But more than half the states use a combination of public defenders and appointed lawyers, and most indigent defendants are not represented by staff public defenders at the trial level.
 In the federal courts, roughly three-quarters of all defendants rely on lawyers paid for by the government, about evenly divided between salaried public defenders and appointed lawyers paid by the hour. Most of the rest hire their own lawyers, with about 2 percent representing themselves. 
 Before the new study, the debate over how best to provide poor defendants with adequate representation had largely concerned whether lawyers for indigent defendants were paid enough to ensure a fair fight with prosecutors. The debate did not much consider how the lawyers were paid, and whether that made a difference.
 The new study looked at federal prosecutions from 1997 to 2001. It was performed by Radha Iyengar, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard, and presented as a working paper of the National Bureau of Economic Research last month.
 Judge Morris B. Hoffman, a Colorado district court judge and a co-author of a 2005 study on the representation of indigent defendants, said the new study's innovation was in its noticing that public defenders and appointed lawyers were assigned randomly in many federal judicial districts. 
 That meant, Ms. Iyengar wrote, that the two sorts of lawyers had ''the same underlying distribution of guilt in the cases they represent and thus are equally likely to lose at trial.''
 Court-appointed lawyers -- known in federal judicial jargon as Criminal Justice Act panel lawyers -- are needed when public defenders' offices have conflicts of interest in cases involving multiple defendants. They can also fill in as the volume of prosecutions requires.
 The vast majority of federal prosecutions end in plea bargains, and only about 5 percent of them reach trial. Ms. Iyengar found that court-appointed lawyers were slightly more likely to take cases to trial and slightly more likely to lose.
 But her most important finding, given all the plea bargains, was that defendants represented by court-appointed lawyers received substantially longer sentences. That suggests that appointed lawyers are less adept at assessing which cases to pursue through trial and at negotiating with prosecutors.
 Over all, defendants represented by court-appointed lawyers received sentences averaging about eight months longer. People convicted of violent crimes were given five more months, while those convicted on weapons charges received nearly a year and half more. But those convicted of immigration offenses received sentences that averaged 2.5 months less if represented by appointed lawyers. 
 Appointed lawyers took longer to resolve cases through plea bargains -- 20 days on average, a 10 percent difference.
 ''These results appear consistent with the hourly wage structure,'' Ms. Iyengar wrote, as that structure creates incentives for appointed lawyers to take longer to resolve cases.
 She concluded that appointed lawyers impose an additional $5,800 in costs to the system for every case they handle.
 Analyzing data from California and Arizona, the study found that appointed lawyers were less experienced and had less impressive credentials.
 ''The court-appointed lawyers tend to be quite young, tend to be from small practices and also they tend to be from lower-ranked law schools,'' Ms. Iyengar said in an interview. ''They have a smaller client base and fewer interactions with prosecutors.'' 
 Judge Hoffman said a number of the study's conclusions were unsurprising given that finding. However they represent their clients, less experienced lawyers tend to do less well in plea negotiations, in deciding which cases to take to trial and in trial outcomes, he said.
 Jon M. Sands, the federal public defender in Arizona, said he did not recognize the picture painted in the study. Court-appointed lawyers, Mr. Sands said, ''are seasoned and committed, and their sentences on the whole don't vary that much from those obtained by public defenders.''
 David Carroll, the research director for the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, said the study's most important point was economic. ''There is,'' Mr. Carroll said, ''a cost savings in establishing staff public defender offices.''

HEADLINE: Dow and S.&P. 500 Set Record Highs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a record-setting week yesterday by surging again, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index past a trading high set in March 2000 and thrusting the Dow Jones industrial average past 13,900 for the first time.
 Both the S.& P. and the Dow logged record closes for the second straight day. The blue-chip index gained 295.57 points for the week. But the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index lagged in yesterday's session as it has in the broader recovery from the dot-com collapse at the start of the decade. 
 In a week in which the Dow swung more than 450 points and rose 283 points in Thursday's session alone, investors grappled with unease over soured subprime loans and the broader economy before casting off such concerns and bidding stocks higher amid signs the consumer might yet again pull through and give Wall Street reason to climb.
 Investors still seemed upbeat yesterday about earnings and takeover activity and appeared only slightly disappointed by the Commerce Department's report that retail sales fell 0.9 percent last month, after a revised 1.5 percent jump in May. The June figure was weaker than expected, with the decline being the steepest in nearly two years.
 ''I think investors are overstating their moves on a day-to-day basis but over the long term, we continue to trend upward,'' said Brian Levitt, corporate economist at OppenheimerFunds Inc. ''I think that is reasonable given the strong global quality picture and the strong global growth picture.''
 The Dow rose 45.52 points, or 0.33 percent, to 13,907.25 yesterday. 
 Relief that Alcoa will not pursue a deal with Alcan helped the Dow yesterday, as did solid quarterly results from General Electric, which sent its stock above the $40 mark and to a five-year high.
 Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.80 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,552.50. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.27 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,707.00 after spending much of the session moderately lower. Though the Nasdaq was trading at levels not seen since early 2001, the index remains well short of its closing record of 5,048.62, set in March 2000 when it was bloated by the late 1990s tech boom.
 An upbeat report yesterday on the mood of consumers released after trading began seemed to inject the market with additional confidence. The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment increased to 92.4 for mid-July from 85.3 in June.
 Treasury bond prices rose, with the benchmark 10-year note up 8/32, at 95 14/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, falling to 5.09 percent from 5.13 percent late Thursday.
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies and still trading at a record low versus the euro and 26-year low against the British pound. Gold prices fell.
 Light crude oil rose $1.43, to $73.93 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 A Standard & Poor's analyst said that after Rio Tinto's bid for the aluminum producer Alcan beat out Alcoa's offer, Alcoa became a more attractive takeover target.
 Alcan slipped 95 cents to $97.50, while Alcoa jumped $2.06, or 4.6 percent, to $47.35, making it the best performer among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials.

HEADLINE: A Verdict, a Deal and an Online Masquerade Exposed

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
THE Conrad Black jury came to a decision, while the Whole Foods chief executive fell under scrutiny for online postings, and Alcan agreed to a rich takeover offer.
 STOCKS CLIMB Wall Street shook itself out of an expensive paranoia fit this week. Worries about rising interest rates, tightfisted American consumers and even more fallout from the bust in the subprime mortgage market sank stock prices early in the week. 
 But by Thursday, as a $38 billion deal for the aluminum manufacturer Alcan neared approval and Wal-Mart Stores reported better-than-expected sales in June, those worries vanished. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at their highest levels ever. The S.& P. rose 22.06 points for the week, or 1.44 percent, to 1,552.50. The Dow average climbed to 13,907.25, up 295.57 points, or 2.17 percent. 
 Investors will have plenty of potential market-moving events to watch next week, including earnings announcements of blue-chip companies like Google, Microsoft, Citigroup and Coca-Cola, along with the government's monthly inflation report and testimony on Capitol Hill by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman. JEREMY W. PETERS
 BLACK VERDICT A Chicago jury cleared Conrad M. Black, the media tycoon, of nine counts, including racketeering, in a federal fraud investigation, but it found him guilty of four lesser charges yesterday. 
 The verdict came nearly four months after Mr. Black and three associates were put on trial together after being charged in 2005 with looting more than $80 million from Hollinger International, the Chicago-based company that Mr. Black led. At the trial, the amount was reduced to $60 million. 
 The jury found Mr. Black guilty of three counts of mail fraud and one count of obstruction of justice. The associates were each found guilty of three counts of mail fraud.
 Mr. Black, who faces a long prison sentence, is expected to appeal. Besides his potential incarceration, Mr. Black also faces more civil lawsuits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from former shareholders of Hollinger International as well as from the company itself and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 ANONYMOUS POSTSJohn P. Mackey's online alter ego may get him into trouble. Mr. Mackey, the co-founder and chief executive of Whole Foods Market, used his online persona Rahodeb, based on his wife's name, Deborah, to praise his company's stock anonymously.
 The pseudonym surfaced in a sealed court document that was filed last month by the Federal Trade Commission but became public Wednesday evening. The agency is trying to block Whole Foods' $565 million buyout of Wild Oats Markets on the ground that it would limit competition.
 Whole Foods declined to comment, and Mr. Mackey was not available for comment, but the disclosure surprised legal and stock-market analysts, who suggested that the postings on Yahoo message boards could be illegal. A spokesman at the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.

 TOP THIS The Canadian aluminum producer Alcan endorsed a $38.1 billion takeover offer from the mining company Rio Tinto on Thursday.
 The $101-a-share bid represents a 32.8 percent premium over an earlier hostile offer from Alcoa. Alcan also agreed to pay a hefty $1.24 billion fee if it does not finish a deal with Rio Tinto, which is based in London.
 The transaction would create the world's largest aluminum producer and the largest miner of bauxite, a crucial material in producing aluminum.
 Rio Tinto's bid for all of Alcan's outstanding shares may face a hurdle. While Alcan and Rio Tinto executives took pains at a news conference to play down any nationalist objections, the combination would mean yet another large Canadian resource company falls under foreign control. 
 IAN AUSTEN
 DOWNGRADES AHEAD Two big credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, said Tuesday that they would downgrade certain bonds backed by subprime mortgages. 
 Investors and policy makers have been asking whether Standard & Poor's, Moody's and a third agency -- Fitch Ratings -- have been lax in their evaluations of the mortgage bonds that Wall Street banks have sold to investors like pension funds, insurance companies and endowments. Fitch followed suit on Thursday, saying it may downgrade bonds because of rising delinquencies and defaults on subprime mortgages.
 The moves, including a suggestion from S.& P. that it would tighten the standards it uses to rate such mortgage bonds, were an acknowledgment that the agencies might have been too optimistic about the housing market. 
 Investors are worried that if expectations deteriorate further, the highest rated portion of subprime securities could also be downgraded, forcing pension funds and other big institutional investors to liquidate their holdings. So far, the highest rated bonds have not been downgraded.
 VIKAS BAJAJ 
 GUILTY PLEA David J. Bershad, a former partner at the securities class-action law firm of Milberg Weiss, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors who are investigating accusations that the firm paid secret kickbacks to plaintiffs.
 Mr. Bershad was indicted last year with the law firm and another named partner, Steven G. Schulman. The 20-count indictment, which included conspiracy and other charges, detailed what was said to be a scheme that began in the 1970s and continued until as recently as 2005.
 Representatives for the firm have been holding settlement talks with prosecutors. The guilty plea put renewed pressure on William S. Lerach and Melvyn I. Weiss, the firm's founders, who have been the focus of the federal investigation. Neither Mr. Lerach nor Mr. Weiss has been indicted. JULIE CRESWELL

HEADLINE: A Treaty That Lifts All Boats

BYLINE: By VERN CLARK and THOMAS R. PICKERING. 
Vern Clark, a retired admiral, was the chief of naval operations from 2000 to 2005. Thomas R. Pickering was the chief United States delegate to the United Nations from 1989 to 1992.

 BODY:
AS the world's most significant maritime power, the United States protects its national security interests by full freedom of navigation around the globe. The seas make up about 70 percent of the surface of the earth. Yet we have not ratified an international treaty that would enable our armed forces to defend us at home and abroad with legal certainty, and would vastly increase our sovereign rights off the coasts of the United States.
 That treaty is the Convention of the Law of the Sea, and the Senate should ratify it during this session of Congress as President Bush has requested. Joining the treaty is a national security action that would protect our country and its interests. 
 The treaty provides our military the rights of navigation, by water and by air, to take our forces wherever they must go, whenever it is necessary to do so. Our ships -- including vessels that carry more than 90 percent of the logistic and other support for our troops overseas -- are given the right of innocent passage through the territorial seas of other states. In addition, the treaty permits American warships to board stateless vessels on the high seas.
 The treaty also provides an absolute right of passage through, over and under international straits and through archipelagoes like Indonesia. These rights -- the crown jewels of the treaty -- did not exist before 1982, when the Convention was concluded. Our security and economic interests are tied directly to these rights. 
 Another provision in the treaty establishes the breadth of the territorial sea -- the area within which a state may exercise sovereignty -- at 12 miles. This allows the United States to extend its territorial sea from three miles to 12 miles, while making several other nations reduce their excessive claims.
 Our national security interests alone should be sufficient to persuade the Senate to act now. But the Convention also advances the economic interests of our country. It gives us an exclusive economic zone out to 200 miles, with sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the living and non-living natural resources of the zone. Coastal states are given sovereign rights over the continental shelf beyond 200 miles if the shelf meets specific geological and other scientific criteria. Under the Convention, our Arctic continental shelf could extend out to 600 miles. 
 Our nation will be in a much stronger position to advance its military and economic interests if we ratify the treaty. We can guide and influence the interpretation of rules, protecting our interests and deflecting inconsistent interpretations. The agreement is being interpreted, applied and developed right now and we need to be part of it to protect our vital interests in the area of security and beyond.
 The treaty is more favorable to our security interests now than we could achieve if we started all over again today. Yet as the debate over ratification takes place, you will see and hear arguments against it that are confected of half-truths and imagination.
 The treaty does not authorize a ''United Nations navy'' or ''United Nations taxes.'' We are not giving away American sovereignty by ratifying it, nor would joining it hinder our intelligence activities. An international institution would not control the world's oceans.
 The Reagan administration objected to certain treaty provisions related to seabed mining. But a 1994 agreement fixed all flaws in the original Convention. The treaty now guarantees appropriate American influence with a permanent seat on the decision-making body. It eliminates earlier provisions that would have required countries to share technology. And it generally facilitates access to mining on reasonable commercial terms. With the modifications enacted in 1994, the treaty now meets all the criteria established by President Reagan in 1982 to make the treaty in the interest of the United States.
 Twelve years ago we missed the opportunity to ratify the treaty in its present form. Our national security, if anything, is more reliant on worldwide access to the sea and the air on an open and undisputed basis than it was then. 
 The Convention of the Law of the Sea is by all lights in our national interest and has earned bipartisan support. President Bush and his administration have spoken out favorably. The Clinton administration also fully supported ratification. 
 We need to convert this important consensus into that simple action of advice and consent in the Senate, thereby preserving and protecting our national security and other interests embodied in this important treaty.

HEADLINE: Panel Accord On Increasing Cigarette Tax To $1 a Pack

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee reached agreement Friday on a bipartisan plan calling for a big increase in the cigarette tax to pay for a $35 billion expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program over the next five years.
 The agreement, probably to be approved next week by the committee, sets the stage for a confrontation with President Bush, who proposed a much smaller increase, $5 billion over five years. House Democrats favor a much larger increase, $50 billion over five years.. 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, said, ''This plan will get coverage to three million more low-income children -- more than a third of the kids who are uninsured today.''
 Under the proposal, the federal excise tax on cigarettes would be abruptly increased by 61 cents a pack, to $1 a pack. The plan calls for proportional increases for other tobacco products.
 Renewal of the children's insurance program, which is set to expire on Sept. 30, is the most important health care issue facing Congress this year, lawmakers of both parties say. 
 Debate on the program provides a foretaste of a much larger struggle over the future of the nation's health care system, as Mr. Bush and Democrats argue about the proper role of government and private insurance.
 The Senate plan was negotiated by Mr. Baucus and Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee; John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia; and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. 
 Mr. Grassley said the agreement would refocus the program on low-income children. It would reduce payments to the states for coverage of children with family incomes exceeding three times the poverty level. (The poverty level is $20,650 for a family of four.)
 Under current law, the federal government provides $5 billion a year to states for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covered 7.4 million people at some time in the last year. The bipartisan Senate plan would add $35 billion, bringing the five-year total to $60 billion. House Democrats, by adding $50 billion to the current level of spending, would increase the total to $75 billion.
 Mr. Bush, by contrast, has proposed an increase of $5 billion and has denounced the Democratic proposals as a step toward ''government-run health care'' for all.
 For several weeks, the White House has been predicting a showdown with Congress over the program, which was created in 1997 with broad bipartisan support to insure children in families who have too much income to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance.
 Under the Senate agreement, states could use information from food stamps and other assistance programs to locate and enroll youngsters eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program. States could also use the child health program to cover the costs of prenatal care for pregnant women.
 But federal officials could not grant additional waivers to the states for coverage of adults. About 670,000 adults were covered last year as a result of such waivers, some of which were granted or renewed by the Bush administration.
 Earlier this week, before seeing details of the Senate plan, some White House officials were hinting at the possibility of a veto. 
 In a joint statement, Senators Grassley and Hatch said such threats were ''disappointing, even a little unbelievable.''
 Mr. Grassley said the Republicans had done a good job by limiting the increase in spending to $35 billion. The 2008 budget resolution -- a blueprint for spending approved by both houses of Congress -- allowed an increase up to $50 billion, he noted.
 Supporters of a higher cigarette tax said it would discourage smoking, particularly among young people. But economists say the tax is highly regressive and falls more heavily on lower-income people, among whom smoking is more prevalent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Backs Higher Taxes for Investment Firm Managers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Michael Luo contributed reporting from Keene, N.H.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday became the latest Democratic presidential candidate to support efforts to raise tax rates for private equity and hedge fund managers.
 Two other leading Democratic candidates, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator, have already called for an increase in the tax rate for partners of investment funds.
 Mr. Edwards, who outlined his support for an increase this week, had been a paid adviser to a hedge fund and still has a substantial part of his wealth at that company. 
 But the issue has divided the Democratic Party's populists and pragmatists, particularly as the party has courted Wall Street for campaign contributions. Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, for instance, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has not taken a position on the proposals. Nor has Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the top fund-raiser for the Democrats in the Senate. 
 The Bush administration has come out against changes to the tax rules, as have many Republicans in Congress. They have said that increasing the rates could reduce the entrepreneurial risk taken by the equity funds, damage the economy and make American investment firms less competitive abroad. Among Republican presidential contenders, Rudolph W. Giuliani has said he opposes increasing the rates. 
 At a rally in Keene, N.H., Mrs. Clinton said the current tax rules, which enable most of the investment income of partners at equity funds, known as carried interest, to be taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 percent, rather than the ordinary income rate of as much as 35 percent, presented a ''glaring inequity.''
 ''Our tax code should be valuing hard work and helping middle-class and working families get ahead,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''It offends our values as a nation when an investment manager making $50 million can pay a lower tax rate on her earned income than a teacher making $50,000 pays on her income. 
 ''As president I will reform our tax code to ensure that the carried interest earned by some multimillionaire Wall Street managers is recognized for what it is: ordinary income that should be taxed at ordinary income tax rates.''
 In both her Senate and presidential campaigns, Mrs. Clinton has raised a considerable amount of money from Wall Street, including hedge funds and equity funds. While many in the industry have lobbied heavily against the changes, some notable executives, including former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, have endorsed the concept of raising the tax rates for equity fund partners. 
 Mr. Rubin said last month that fund managers should pay taxes on carried interest -- often the bulk of their compensation -- at ordinary income tax rates rather than at the lower capital gains rate because they perform services more than risk their own capital.
 Mrs. Clinton in her speech defended the equity fund and venture fund industries, saying that they ''play important roles in our economy, and we should continue to support the entrepreneurial spirit that makes America great.''
 ''We can close this loophole that unfairly benefits some of the best- paid people in America, while continuing to encourage investment in innovative, young companies.''
 Mrs. Clinton said she would seek to use the $4 billion to $6 billion a year in anticipated new revenue for tax relief for the middle class and new education programs. Other Democrats have said the money could be used to reduce the reach of the alternative minimum tax.
 Congress is considering two measures that would increase taxes for some executives and funds. In the House, Democrats led by Sander Levin of Michigan, Charles B. Rangel of New York and Barney Frank of Massachusetts have introduced a bill that would raise the taxes on the investment gains of fund managers from the capital gains rate of 15 percent to the ordinary income rate of as much as 35 percent.
 Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, and the ranking Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are sponsoring a bill that would raise the 15 percent tax rate on certain partnerships that go public, like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to a top corporate rate of 35 percent.

HEADLINE: Gaps in Training Iraqi Forces Worry Top U.S. Commanders

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD and THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
American commanders said Friday that the effort to train Iraqi Army and police units had slowed in recent months and would need to be expanded to enable any large-scale reduction in American force levels. 
 The problem has arisen, several senior officers said Friday, in large part because preparing Iraqi units to operate without American backing had become a secondary goal under the current war strategy, which has emphasized protecting Iraqis and the heavy use of American combat power.
 The acknowledgment of gaps in the program to train Iraqis came a day after President Bush's own interim assessment found that two central pillars of the current strategy, including training, were coming up short. 
 The other main shortcoming was in the program to increase the number of provincial reconstruction teams, an effort described as a ''civilian surge'' by the White House, which is only halfway to its goal.
 The interim report issued by the White House concluded that there had been ''unsatisfactory progress'' at building more Iraqi units capable of operating independently. The White House document also argued that revisions to the strategy were not necessary because ''we have significantly enhanced our training and mentoring commitment.'' 
 But some senior officers argued Friday that the current effort might not be adequate.
 ''We do need to do more training with the Iraqis, we do need more opportunities to have embedded units with them,'' Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon news conference. The number of Iraqi battalions rated as capable of operating without American assistance fell to 6 this month, from 10 in March, soon after the start of the American security push, he said.
 The current American strategy, presented by Mr. Bush in January, relies on more than 20,000 additional American troops who have been dispatched to Iraq to carry out intensive security operations. A less-prominent part of the strategy was a pledge to double, to 20, the number of provincial reconstruction teams, or P.R.T.'s.
 But the progress report released Thursday conceded that ''expansion of the P.R.T. program is not yet complete, with only about half of the approximately 300 additional P.R.T. personnel deployed to date.'' 
 ''The full complement of 'civilian surge' personnel will be completed by December 2007.''
 State Department officials have said the lengthy schedule for deploying all of the civilian team members is due to the time required to hire civilian experts for some of the more technical agricultural and economic development positions, as well as delays in identifying and then training Foreign Service officers for Iraq's hazardous environment.
 Despite the lag in filling the teams, President Bush sought Friday to highlight the effort at increasing economic and political development at the local level, speaking with team members in Iraq during a video teleconference from the White House.
 The effort, however, has drawn some skeptical responses, including from a prominent former development expert for the State Department, Carlos Pascual. 
 Mr. Pascual, who was the State Department's coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization, said the impact of the provincial reconstruction effort has been ''almost negligible.''
 Because of the level of violence, the reconstruction teams ''don't have a secure environment to begin with, so they don't have the latitude to move about, to make investments, to understand how projects are going and to generate employment,'' said Mr. Pascual, now a vice president at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research center. 
 General Pace said Friday that recommendations for attaching more American troops as advisers to Iraqi units would also be considered as part of a strategy review in September.
 Despite the decline in the number of Iraqi battalions rated as capable of operating independently, General Pace called attention to what he called another measure of progress: that the number of Iraqi battalions rated as capable of operating ''in the lead'' with American assistance had increased to nearly 100, from 88 in March.
 Pentagon officials explained that the discrepancy reflected the limitations of the categories. Iraqi units are gaining tactical experience and improving through their contribution to the new security effort, officials said, but they remain plagued by logistical problems, troop shortfalls, and sectarian interference from senior Iraqi politicians. 
 Those problems have in some cases gotten worse as Iraqi units have been called on to move around the country and take on more challenging combat roles.
 In recent months, the training effort has focused on building up the Ministries of Defense and Interior and on improving training centers, logistics depots, budgeting and contracting, one senior American officer said. General Pace said 6,000 American soldiers were involved in the training effort.
 Other Pentagon officials and senior officers who agreed to discuss their concerns about training insisted on anonymity so they would not be seen as upstaging the White House report.
 To permit a large reduction in American forces, some officers argue, programs linking American advisers to Iraqi battalions will once again have to become the focus of the training, one senior officer said. That will require increasing the size of American adviser teams attached by adding American combat troops as well as specialists in administration, logistics and other support functions, the officer said.
 That approach would make the teams better able to operate without American combat units nearby, permitting withdrawals and a shift in the American mission.
 But several officers acknowledge that this approach has been tried before and has foundered because of concerns that Iraqi units remains incapable of supporting and handling security on their own.

HEADLINE: Intel, in Shift, Joins Project On Education

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 13 

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation reversed ground Friday and joined the board of the One Laptop Per Child Foundation, an ambitious effort to seed the developing world with inexpensive portable computers.
 The about-face by the world's largest chip maker is significant because the leader of the effort, Nicholas Negroponte, the former M.I.T. Media Laboratory director, sparred frequently with Intel's chairman, Craig R. Barrett, over technology and educational issues. 
 The two men clashed as recently as January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, over competing educational philosophies.
 They have spoken bitterly about each other, and Mr. Negroponte on several occasions suggested that Intel was leading a campaign to sabotage the organization's computer with governments around the world.
 Mr. Negroponte has vigorously campaigned around the globe to persuade governments to invest in wireless-connected laptops complete with open-source software for each schoolchild in their nation.
 Intel in recent years has pursued a competing plan focused on training teachers to use somewhat more expensive computers equipped with Microsoft Windows software and applications.
 Mr. Barrett and Mr. Negroponte favored radically different educational approaches. The M.I.T. professor evoked a vision of self-teaching in which schoolchildren would teach each other both to use their computers and to learn. 
 There is no plan yet to use Intel chips in future versions of the group's laptop, which now uses an Advanced Micro Devices microprocessor.
 The organization, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., is still testing its laptop, which will have a price expected to fall to $100 by the end of 2008. 
 The foundation said Friday that it intended to begin full-scale manufacturing at the end of September or early October.
 On Friday, executives at the organization, which has until now worked with Advanced Micro, declared that the organization had a big tent open to all comers.
 ''By aligning here we are just going to help more kids,'' said William A. Swope, an Intel vice president and the director of the company's corporate affairs group. He said that in working through the issues between the organizations, executives had realized that the issues were not black and white.
 Intel contributes about $100 million to educational activities annually, he said, and the company now views the new partnership as a simple way to expand its impact.
 As part of the partnership, Mr. Swope will take a position on the One Laptop Per Child board and the group will use the chip maker's server technology as a component in the educational systems that are deployed in countries abroad.
 Intel has also made a substantial contribution to the organization, but the dollar figure was not disclosed because the group is negotiating with several other companies to join the effort.
 Advanced Micro issued a statement welcoming Intel's participation in the organization. In addition to supplying a version of its Geode microprocessor to the project, Advanced Micro has contributed $2 million to the effort since joining the organization in 2005.

15% STAKE IN RUSSIA FIELD Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive of Total, said his company would book for accounting purposes 25 percent of the reserves of Russia's giant Shtokman natural gas deposit, after signing an agreement with Russia's Gazprom to develop the field. Gazprom, however, has stated that the license to the field and control over all future gas sales will remain 100 percent Russian owned. Mr. Margerie, above, told reporters in Moscow that because his company was taking financial risks in the development phase, it would be appropriate to book the reserves. ANDREW KRAMER
 VIACOM IN TALKS WITH CHINA Viacom has held exploratory discussions to develop theme parks in two regions in China that could also include movie co-production ventures. Sumner Redstone, Viacom's executive chairman, said he was in ''very tentative'' talks with Chinese officials to build theme parks in China's richest city, Shanghai, and Changsha. The structure would be similar to a theme park deal in South Korea whereby Viacom licensed its brand to projects, which are financed largely locally. 
 Viacom, which creates such shows as ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and owns the Paramount movie studios, has aggressively expanded its operations overseas in the past several years, but has recently sought to restructure some of its operations to boost profit margins. (REUTERS) 
 MACROVISION PROFIT LOWER Shares in Macrovision, the maker of copy-protection software for digital music and DVDs, fell as much as 10 percent after the company said second-quarter profit was lower than forecast, citing a contract dispute and an unfinished transaction. Profit excluding some costs was 19 cents to 22 cents a share, the company said in a preliminary earnings report filed with regulators. The company had forecast 24 cents to 27 cents; the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was 27 cents. Macrovision, based in Santa Clara, Calif., did not finish a transaction with a software customer and is in negotiations in a contract dispute over a customer's unpaid use of the company's technology, according to the statement. The shares dropped nearly 12 percent, closing at $26.22 a share. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) 
 SAMSUNG REPORTS DROP IN PROFIT Samsung Electronics said that second-quarter net profit fell 5 percent from a year ago on price declines for its mainstay computer memory chips, but expressed confidence that a rebound in the market would bolster earnings. The company's shares surged 6.4 percent amid expectations among investors for stronger business performance later in the year as well as on a news report that the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn may be considering a bid for the company.Samsung, the world's largest computer memory chip manufacturer, earned 1.42 trillion won ($1.55 billion) in the three months ended June 30, the company. Sales rose 3.7 percent during the quarter from the same period last year.
 Meanwhile, Samsung executives said the company was mapping out defensive measures against potential hostile takeover bids by Mr. Icahn. A South Korea newspaper, citing an unnamed high-ranking Samsung official, had reported that Mr. Icahn may be planning a hostile takeover over the company. The company said it was unaware of any takeover attempt, and Mr. Icahn did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. (AP)
 ARCELOR AND NIPPON AGREEMENT Nippon Steel and Europe's ArcelorMittal said they had signed a memorandum of understanding to form a global alliance and to expand upon existing joint ventures in North America. Nippon, Japan's biggest steelmaker, said in a statement that the two companies are studying expansion of their automotive sheet steel business in North America. A previous alliance between Nippon Steel and Arcelor will be replaced with an alliance between Nippon and ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel said. ArcelorMittal confirmed the agreement in a separate release. Mittal Steel acquired Luxembourg's Arcelor last year in a hostile takeover worth around $41 billion. (AP) 
 CHINA LOOKING TO U.S. FOR PORK Smithfield Foods, the hog and pork producer, said that China has shown more interest in buying its pork, which probably was the reason the company's shares sped to a two-year high. ''I do not know anything about size or timing, but I can say we are in talks with them,'' Jerry Hostetter, a spokesman for Smithfield, said of China. The largest United States meat producer, Tyson Foods, said it also has received interest from China to buy pork. Some Chicago hog contracts rose the maximum daily price limit on Thursday amid widespread talk in livestock markets that China was seeking to buy 20,000 metric tons of pork on the world market, some of which could come from the United States. Smithfield shares jumped to $34.42, their highest level since March 2005, before closing at $33.36 a share (REUTERS)
 CONTROLLING THAILAND'S CURRENCY Thailand's interim Prime Minister, Surayud Chulanont, said the government would take measures to curb volatility in the baht, which is near 10-year highs, but said that the overall economic impact has been limited. The baht's steady appreciation over the last 18 months has raised concerns among Thailand's exporters, whose foreign income is eroded by the strong baht. The baht has risen 7 percent against the dollar this year. ''The strengthening of the baht is unlikely to affect the country's economic growth,'' Mr. Surayud told reporters. He did not elaborate on what actions would be taken to curb currency volatility, but the Bank of Thailand has been buying dollars recently. (AP)
 CONSTELLATION BUYS AMVEST UNIT Constellation Energy , an energy producer that had its initial share sale in November, agreed to buy an oil and gas unit of Amvest for $240 million to expand output in Oklahoma. The purchase of closely held Amvest Osage will include producing and undeveloped oil and natural-gas properties in Oklahoma's Cherokee Basin, Baltimore-based Constellation said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HEADLINE: Even in a Dark Hour, The City's Rebirth Awaited

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For a 20-year-old, the end of the world can often be annoying. The evening of July 13, 1977, I stood in the vestibule of an apartment building on the East Side of Manhattan, ready to swing open the doors, to accept deliveries of dry cleaning, to announce guests: a college student working as a fill-in doorman.
 The woman from the sixth floor got off the elevator -- always friendly, and tonight, for the first time, dazzling, snugly wrapped in a black cocktail dress and cantilevered fore and aft on high heels. As she was much older than me -- probably 26 or 27 -- she would have been thoroughly intimidating, had she not been so ready with a smile. 
 ''Wow,'' I said, very needlessly. ''You look great.''
 She winked, and slipped into the warm dusk.
 That was the night the city went dark, then was lit with fires; that was the summer a shadow named Son of Sam, a serial killer who turned out to be David Berkowitz, stalked the young and killed them. And that was the era when responsible adults openly spoke of closing half-filled schools and shutting down subway lines, of shrinking the city to keep it from vanishing altogether.
 Only the deranged or visionary could have imagined on that summer night in 1977 that New York in 2007 would be fat, happy and standing-room only; perched here in 2007, many would find it hard to believe that 2,000 stores were burned or looted inside of 24 hours.
 Yet history throws its own light. It is possible now to see that the restoration of New York had already started, even 30 years ago. By the late 1970s, 75,000 immigrants a year were arriving in New York; twice as many people were moving out of the city, but by 1980, the surge of new people from foreign countries, and the birth of their children, had shifted ground. New York started to grow after the blackout. Not only was the city not dead, it was beginning to thrive. 
 But that night was scalding. People tied chains to cars and ripped away the pull-down gates on stores. On Fordham Road, the guards at the Crazy Eddie electronics store protected it by parking trucks on the sidewalk and climbing on top with rifles. Until a few years ago, the charred hulls of stores that were ruined that night could be seen along dead commercial strips in the Bronx and Brooklyn. 
 At a movie theater on Queens Boulevard, people screamed and thought of Son of Sam, who had killed not far away. In fact, he did not go out that night; the blackout was too scary for even a serial killer. Meanwhile, doctors performed emergency surgery in the parking lot of Brooklyn Jewish Hospital; 600 people ate dinner by candlelight at Windows on the World; a crew filming ''Superman'' outside the old Daily News building on 42nd Street lent their klieg lights to the editors so they could see the pages they were laying out.
 Before the lights went out, I stood at my post in that East Side building. The woman in the black cocktail dress came back with her arm hooked in that of a man wearing a business suit. I pulled open the door, and she smiled, then whispered something in his ear. 
 He nodded, and immediately dug into his pocket and handed me $5.
 She tugged down on his arm, shook her head, and whispered in his ear.
 He gave me $5 more.
 What was this for? I tried to refuse. She brushed me off, and led the man forward to the elevator. 
 Not long afterward, the street light flickered. Then it vanished. The lobby went dark. I climbed to the top floor -- 15 or 20 stories -- then walked down, calling at each floor to see if the elevators had trapped anyone. Luckily, no one was in them.
 By the time I got back to the lobby, the man who had been visiting the woman on the sixth floor was leaving, alone and paying no more tolls. A few minutes later, the woman arrived in the lobby. She was back in a half-hour, with someone else, a half smile on her face. It slowly dawned on my 20-year-old brain what her line of work was. Life was going on.

HEADLINE: Hoping to Lure Visitors By Recalling Departures

BYLINE: By ANDREAS TZORTZIS

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany 

 BODY:
Edith Kolb was shuffling through some papers recently when a few postcards dropped out. On the front were paintings of turn-of-the-century steamships chugging through oceans full of whitecaps. On the back of one, in smudged handwriting, was a note from her uncle to her father in Kiel, Germany, informing him of his safe arrival in Buenos Aires. 
 ''It seemed such a shame to throw them away,'' said Ms. Kolb, who is in her 70s. So she stopped by Hamburg's newest museum, the BallinStadt, which opened on July 5, and gave them to a historian there, Jorge Birkner. There they will be added to a paper and digital archive of letters, clippings and passenger lists: the cornerstone of this museum, which is dedicated to the five million Europeans who passed through Hamburg on their way to North and South America. 
 The museum is named after Albert Ballin, who built a ''city within the city'' to house emigrants who converged on Hamburg from all over Europe to take his Hapag shipping company's liners bound for the New World. Making their way through three replica buildings, BallinStadt visitors will not only get to peruse an exhibition of period artifacts and documents; they will also get to search original Hamburg passenger lists on computers. 
 ''We didn't want to stick to a traditional museum concept,'' said Mr. Birkner, a German historian who, with Brazilian roots and extended stays in the United States, embodies the image of the modern immigrant. ''We consider the whole interactive aspect innovative. Our angle is that people should be able to relate to these exhibits.'' 
 The interactive message extends throughout the museum, in the eerie voices of mannequins in period garb that begin reciting recorded immigrants' stories when people step near them, or the flat computer screens showing archival footage set into picture frames or stacked crates. The exhibits cover every stage of immigrants' journeys -- from the conditions that led them to flee their homelands to arrival on Ellis Island and beyond. 
 Though Mr. Birkner said the museum was not aimed at any particular audience, the colorful and unorthodox presentation styles, which sometimes border on kitsch, should appeal to younger museumgoers. This approach is likely to please historians like Christiane Harzig, a specialist in immigration at Arizona State University, who see museums like BallinStadt as further confirmation that Germany is showing more interest in a relatively neglected part of its history. 
 In contrast to Ireland or even Sweden or Italy, the attention paid to immigrant history in Germany is very low, she said, adding, ''This is what these places can change.'' 
 Mr. Ballin, who entered the emigration agency started by his father in the 19th century, became general director of the Hamburg America line, or Hapag, and opened BallinStadt in 1901. The original ''city'' comprised 30 one-story buildings and included a synagogue, a church, a hospital and cafeterias as well as a playground. Historians estimate that around five million people passed through BallinStadt. Eastern European Jews fleeing economic and religious hardship were especially attracted to Hamburg. 
 ''For a Jewish immigrant it would be a good place to go to, because it had a synagogue and you could get kosher food,'' Mr. Birkner said. 
 BallinStadt is not the first museum to tackle this topic. About two million more people moved through nearby Bremerhaven, and it continued to operate as a port of migration until the early 1970s. The German Emigration Center opened its doors in Bremerhaven in 2005. It has since become a major tourist attraction for a small city of 116,000, and this year it won the European Museum of the Year Award. 
 Now Hamburg is following with its own museum, and the potential competition between the two is the cause of much eye-rolling among academics, said Ms. Harzig, added that she would prefer the two to share their resources. 
 ''For any scholar it's totally ridiculous,'' she said, referring to the lack of cooperation, ''but when it comes to tourist marketing tools or city egos, it's important.'' 
 BallinStadt's competitive advantage is in the passenger lists kept in Hamburg, which are among the most comprehensive in the world. Name, city of origin and port of embarkation, as well as the passengers' destination port and planned final destination, are in the passenger archives. 
 Hamburg began digitizing the lists in 1999, starting with the period from 1890 to 1912, when many Eastern European Jews passed through the city. Mr. Birkner said that up to half of America's Jewish population might have ancestors that passed through Hamburg on their way to America. 
 In the museum's entry building, visitors can scan through passenger lists with the help of Ancestry.com, a Web site that allows people to search their family trees with census databases and other resources. 
 ''Of course you can conduct research from home,'' Mr. Birkner said, ''but here you'll be in the authentic place, and know that your ancestors actually came here 100 years ago.'' 
 Because of this, BallinStadt officials hope to attract visitors from across the Atlantic. The 12 million euros ($16.3 million) that it took to open the museum, two-thirds of which came from public funds, is seen by Hamburg officials as an important contribution to the city's expanding tourism industry. Next to the gloss of its Michelin-starred restaurants, its quaint canal boat tours and the charm of its Sunday morning fish market, the immigration history of the port of Hamburg has been underexploited, said Nina Siepmann, BallinStadt's spokeswoman. 
 ''I think the awareness of this topic is growing rapidly,'' Ms. Siepmann said. ''These days emigration is a very modern and current topic.'' 
 It's hard to scan letters and documents at BallinStadt and not think of the current wave of emigration from Germany -- with everyone from skilled craftsmen to Ph.D.'s moving away because of a sluggish economy and the possibilities enabled by globalization. 
 For Edith Kolb and many others, BallinStadt provides a timely reminder of the past. 
 ''We live in a time when our lives have been made pretty easy,'' she said. ''And look what those people put themselves through just in order to start a new life.''

HEADLINE: Nonprofits Are Strained By Impasse

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
A political impasse in Albany has cut off a critical source of low-cost financing for nonprofit organizations in New York City, ranging from operators of small homes for the developmentally disabled to the builder of large parking garages for the new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.
 Since July 1, the city's Industrial Development Agency, like its counterparts around the state, has had no authority to sell tax-exempt bonds on behalf of nonprofit organizations. That lapse is crimping the expansion plans of schools, hospitals and social-services providers, causing them to postpone projects or borrow at significantly higher interest rates, their officials said. 
 The same lapse could also hold up plans for the Yankee Stadium project because the organization that was selected to build the parking garages is nonprofit, a status that allows it to borrow through the agency at interest rates as low as 5 percent. That entity, the Bronx Community Initiatives Development Company, wanted to sell $190 million worth of bonds this month to cover much of the project's estimated cost of $281 million, according to an application it filed with the agency.
 City officials and nonprofit groups are pressing legislators, including members of the Senate, which will reconvene Monday, to approve a measure to end the borrowing freeze. 
 The power of the development agencies to borrow on behalf of nonprofit organizations expired on June 30, after legislators failed to agree on how long to extend that authority. The Republican-controlled Senate decided to extend it for two years, but the Assembly, controlled by Democrats, voted for only a seven-month extension. 
 Prospective borrowers are complaining that their spending plans are being held hostage in a political standoff that has little to do with them. The real issue is a disagreement about the need to tighten the rules on how the state's 115 industrial development agencies operate.
 ''None of the arguments going on have anything to do with the nonprofits,'' said Margery E. Ames, executive director of the Interagency Council of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Agencies in Manhattan.
 Most of the money raised through the industrial development agencies goes to corporations and public projects that are supposed to add or retain jobs and help local economies. Under state law, however, the agencies' ability to borrow for those purposes was not frozen. 
 Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Democrat from Buffalo who is chairman of the Local Governments Committee, said he opposed extending the agencies' authority for another year, as the last few legislative sessions did, because he wanted to press for change sooner. Critics of his approach said seven months was not enough time for nonprofit groups to draw up projects and arrange financing for them.
 ''We support a two-year extension,'' said Brian T. McMahon, president of the New York State Economic Development Council, which represents industrial development agencies in Albany. ''We're not going to backpedal on our position.''
 Still, officials of some of the agencies said they would settle for a quick compromise so that their clients could complete their projects. ''We prefer the longer, but we would take any extensions now,'' said Kei Hayashi, executive director of the New York City Industrial Development Agency. The city agency had planned to raise money for about two dozen projects in the next 6 to 12 months, a city spokesman said.
 Ms. Ames said that organizations in her group, like Heaven's Hand in Brooklyn, borrow through the city agency to finance the purchase and renovation of homes, apartments and schools for their developmentally disabled clients. Without access to the agency's ability to borrow at rates as low as 4 percent, she said, her members could be stuck paying as much as 11 percent on short-term loans. 
 Among the other organizations whose plans are in limbo are Touro College, which has been approved to raise $43 million through tax exempt bonds, and Bnos Zion of Bobov, which planned to borrow $9 million to build one school for girls in Brooklyn and to renovate another.
 But none of the pending projects are as politically sensitive as the stadium garages. City officials have been working for several months on a plan to build three garages around the site of the new stadium, which is under construction in the South Bronx.
 The city solicited bids for construction of the garages, which it said could charge no more than $25 a car in their first year of operation. But all of the bidders said the project would not be viable unless the city tossed in a large subsidy on top of the $70 million the state had already pledged.
 Instead, city officials decided to seek a federal subsidy in the form of tax-exempt financing through the industrial development agency. All they needed was a nonprofit organization to manage the project and a public benefit to justify the tax break.
 The organization they found was the Community Initiatives Development Corporation, a 15-year-old entity that says its mission is to ''lessen the burdens of government associated with economic development projects and low-income housing development.'' In turn, it created the Bronx Community Initiatives Development Company, whose sole purpose is to serve as the tax-exempt borrower for the parking garages. 
 City officials said they hoped the borrowing freeze would be lifted in time for the garage developer to seek final approval at the industrial development agency's board meeting on July 23.
 They also said they still must come up with a way in which the South Bronx community will benefit from this project. They said they were considering giving some of the surplus cash generated by the garages -- if any --to Bronx Park.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Draft Bill to Enact Plan for Manhattan Driving Fee

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 13 

 BODY:
State Senate Republicans prepared a bill on Friday that would enact Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to charge drivers a fee for entering and exiting most parts of Manhattan, but create a commission to decide how to administer the plan.
 The bill appeared to be a last-ditch effort both to draw support from Senate Democrats and entice the State Assembly to return to Albany on Monday, which federal officials have said is the deadline for New York City to have a congestion-pricing plan that would be eligible for federal financing. The Assembly has no session scheduled for Monday. 
 Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, said the Senate would vote on the new bill on Monday, and he urged Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who has voiced support for congestion pricing, to ask Senate Democrats to back it. He also asked Mr. Spitzer to call on the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, to convene the Assembly on Monday.
 ''This is a bold, creative measure to alleviate a major problem, and the governor, the Senate minority and the Assembly must step up and get it done,'' Mr. Bruno said in a statement.
 Some details of the new bill are similar to proposals that have been raised for weeks during the congestion pricing debate, without obvious affect on the Assembly's skepticism. 
 The legislation would authorize the city to develop a congestion plan within Manhattan, which Senate officials say would give the city a chance of winning some $500 million in federal financing for the effort. A 12-member commission would be chosen equally by the governor, Mr. Bruno, Mr. Silver and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and it would then develop recommendations for putting the plan in effect. 
 The commission would tackle several issues that have come up during Assembly hearings on the plan, including how revenue from the congestion fees would be spent and whether the city should create a permit system to ensure parking for city residents living just outside the congestion zone.
 In a significant concession to the Assembly, the Legislature would have until Dec. 31 to approve the overall plan, effectively giving lawmakers a final veto over the proposal, and any authorization would have to be renewed three years later. 
 The basics of the plan, which would charge drivers a fee for entering and leaving most parts of Manhattan, would still need to be approved by Monday, however.
 ''We need to know the zone, the fee and the technology that will be used by the deadline,'' said Farrell Sklerov, a mayoral spokesman in Albany. ''Everything else goes to the commission.'' Mr. Bloomberg's proposal and the Senate bill both provide that cars would be charged $8 to enter Manhattan south of 86th Street during peak traffic hours. Cameras would be used to track movement. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Silver, Dan Weiller, said the speaker was not yet ready to comment on the new bill but was in ''ongoing discussions with the mayor, the governor, and Senator Bruno in an attempt to resolve issues relating to congestion and mass transit in New York City.''
 Christine Anderson, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, said the governor had not yet seen the legislation but hoped for a compromise that would pass both the Senate and Assembly. ''At this point, the goal is to get something that can become law,'' she said.
 It is unclear how many Senate Republicans will support the measure. Earlier this week, Mr. Bruno said congestion pricing would require Democratic support to pass; it was a rare admission for the majority leader, who rarely permits bills to be voted on unless they can be approved with Republican votes alone.
 Senator Malcolm A. Smith of Queens, the Democratic minority leader, said his conference had agreed to act unanimously on any congestion pricing measure but had not decided whether they would support it. 
 ''The thing is so dynamic and so fluid, it doesn't pay for us to say who is in favor of it and who is not,'' Mr. Smith said. He also said it was very unlikely that his conference would vote for a bill if the Assembly declined to come into session on Monday.
 ''You don't want to get into that old, dysfunctional Albany where there are only one-house bills,'' he said.
 The Senate also hopes to tackle other legislation on Monday, such as legislation that would grant an additional $200 million in property tax cuts to elderly citizens.
 It will be the first return to legislative business since Mr. Bruno and Mr. Spitzer began feuding over reports last week of the senator's travels with state troopers. Even before that battle, Mr. Spitzer had assailed Senate Republicans for leaving Albany at the end of the regular legislative session in June without acting on several of his priorities, including campaign finance reform and the approval of dozens of his nominees to key state posts.
 According to the governor's office, more than 60 of Mr. Spitzer's nominees sent to the Senate from February to July have yet to be confirmed, including key economic development officials, members of various oversight and advisory boards, and state commissioners.
 Mark Hansen, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said the Senate had not yet decided whether to approve any of the nominees.
 ''Senator Bruno has said that we will take up any that make sense,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The '77 Blackout: Authors Take Questions, Part 3

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Authors James Goodman and Jonathan Mahler answer a final round of readers' questions about the 1977 blackout. 

 BODY:
James Goodman and Jonathan Mahler took questions from City Room readers this week. Mr. Goodman is the author of "Blackout" (North Point, 2003), a history of the 1977 blackout in New York City, and a professor of history and creative writing at Rutgers University in Newark. Mr. Mahler is the author of "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics, and the Battle for the Soul of a City" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005), and a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. This is their third and final set of responses; their first and second set were published earlier this week.
Brian Hasbrouck:
Mr. Goodman: Compensation and relief came in several forms, including insurance, grants, and loans. Insurance, as always, was complicated. Not every merchant could afford insurance, and not every merchant who could afford it could find a company willing to write a policy that covered burglary in New York City. In fact, insurance for burglary had been unavailable in many high crime neighborhoods for years. In its place, the federal government offered its own insurance, but the limit was $1,000 per incident, which was not going to help much in the wake of the blackout. The easiest insurance to get was fire insurance, and many fire policies carried a riot rider. But many insurance underwriters insisted that the blackout looting was theft, not riot, and so at first it seemed that the only merchants were who going to be to collect insurance on their riot riders were those whose stores had been set on fire. Later, under pressure from the city and insurance industry executives, underwriters stopped quibbling about the difference between a burglary and a riot. 
The Small Business Association declared the city a small business disaster area, making merchants eligible for substantial loans with relatively low interest. And, together with business leaders, labor leaders, and philanthropists, the mayor established an emergency relief fund, making small grants available that didn't have to be paid back. 
Six weeks after the blackout three quarters of the looted stores were back open. But that didn't mean three quarters of the stores in every looted neighborhood. There was tremendous variety. A year after the blackout, nine out-of ten stores on Broadway in Bushwick were still closed. Twenty years later, when I did research in Bushwick for my book, there were still many visible signs of the blackout looting and arson. It has taken that community, and several others, decades to recover. Yet for complicated economic, social, and political reasons, other neighborhoods bounced right back, as if somehow nourished, like a forest, by the flames and ashes.
Mr. Mahler: I would just add a couple of things. After the blackout, President Carter very pointedly refused to declare the city a major disaster area, a designation that would have given it access to badly needed federal funds. It was a sort of redux of President Ford's famous refusal to bail the city out of its financial crisis two years earlier -- memorialized, of course, in the Daily News headline, "FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD" -- and it seemed especially harsh because while campaigning in New York, Carter had vowed never to tell New York to drop dead. (He also had no problem bailing out some shrimping towns off the coast of his beloved Georgia that had endured an especially harsh winter.) For that matter, Carter didn't even visit New York after the blackout. It wasn't until the fall, when he was in the city for a meeting at the U.N., that he was finally pressured into paying a visit to the city's most infamous ghetto, the South Bronx.
In terms of Bushwick, by the summer of 1977, a lot of the merchants there had long since fled the neighborhood in the face of its rising crime. So on the night of the blackout, a lot of them arrived at their stores too late to do anything about the looting; and at that point, even if they had the money to do so, they certainly had no desire to re-open in such a blighted neighborhood.
The New York Times:
Mr. Mahler: The blackout did indeed become a racially divisive issue. At the root of this dispute were two very different perspectives on the looting -- in short, whether one saw it as a form of political protest, a cry for help from the ghettos, or simply a case of criminals running wild under the cover of darkness. Much of the debate was, in fact, touched off by an op-ed in The Times by a professor of history at CUNY, Herbert G. Gutman, who compared the blackout looting to the 1902 rioting by Lower East Side Jewish housewives protesting the artificially inflated prices of kosher meat. Angry -- and in some cases nakedly racist -- letters poured in, including one from a Times reader who wrote: "The Puerto Ricans can go back to P.R. They belong there anyway, and if the blacks do not shape up they can go back to the South." This was the blackout backlash at its worst. There was a middle ground, though. It was possible to see the blackout as an urgent signal to address the needs of New York's most desperate neighborhoods, to find ways to create jobs and promote urban renewal from the ground up, without excusing looters for their actions. The fact that there was no looting in Bushwick during the 2003 blackout was, I think, a testament to the city's success in doing so.
It's important to note, too, that the looting wasn't really racially fueled. Black-owned stores were hit just as hard as white-owned ones. Many of the toughest post-blackout commentary came from local minority politicians such as Woodrow T. Lewis, a black assemblyman from Brooklyn, who said: "When you see a black florist on Nostrand Avenue wiped out, and a supermarket on the same street suffer the same fate, both black-owned, how can I buy excuses that no jobs and poverty motivated this mob action?"
One interesting side note: The racial undertones of the blackout all but killed the mayoral candidacy of Percy E. Sutton, who was in many ways perfectly situated to become New York's first black mayor. It was an especially cruel and ironic twist for him because he had always been a master builder of color-blind alliances.
Mr. Goodman: Just a couple of things to add here. The fierce debate about the causes of the looting that Jonathan rightly characterizes as racially charged began on the streets in the middle of the blackout looting and continued on the streets for weeks. The behavior of tens of thousands of people in more than a dozen neighborhoods over the course of a long night and then a day was reduced to a simple dichotomy: blackout looters were poor people or piranha, unemployed (in need of jobs) or animals (in need of jail). Sadly, the debate didn't get any more sophisticated than that when it moved the pages of the newspapers, newsweeklies, and journals of public opinion--not even when the history professors stepped in. It was still a dichotomy, still missed the variety of behavior, in time and over time. Conservatives turned a blind eye to the truly poor people carting pampers and baby food. Poverty might not justify their behavior, but it certainly helped to explain it. They also failed to notice that though poor black people became the public face of crime in the United States in the late 1960s and 1970s, the break down of law and order was hardly limited to the black poor. Many poor people said that they were tired of being the only people expected to obey the law and the only people punished when they didn't. Liberals somehow failed to notice the evidence of career criminality in the blackout looting, especially in the crucial early hours. More consequently, they failed to see that in the decade since the long hot 1960s summers a huge number of New Yorkers (including a significant number of black New Yorkers) had come to hear liberal explanations of urban crime as justifications and apologies. People -- including many people who had cared deeply in the 1960s -- stopped caring about the causes of crime. They just wanted crime stopped. 
As Jonathan rightly notes, the debate between right and left left a huge middle ground, but there were not a whole lot of people occupying it. Among those who did occupy it were many African Americans, ordinary people, editors, clergymen, and politicians, including Percy E. Sutton, who called the looters "marauders and criminals" but whose often nuanced race-blind views were no match for Koch's color-coded calls the National Guard and the death penalty.
The New York Times:
Mr. Goodman: Con Edison's critics -- including city, state, and federal investigators -- pointed to "a complex managerial failure" as the root cause of the blackout. They faulted the design and maintenance of the generators, network, and protective devices. They faulted its operating procedures, its operator training, its ties to other utilities, its communication system, it emergency backup system and its restoration system. Con Edison preferred to talk about immediate causes: lightning, untrimmed trees, equipment failure, and human error. If there was a root cause, Con Edison executives insisted, it was the hostile climate in which Con Edison operated, a climate in which legislators, regulators, and environmentalists had impeded the utilities efforts to deliver safe, reliable, affordable electricity.
Regulators replied with two simple lines: The generating capacity was there. The ability to maintain and deliver it was not.
Con Edison set out to fix what it, not its critics, thought broken: it repaired a tie line to New Jersey that was out at the time of the blackout; it upgraded, modernized, and redesigned its control center, its computer system, its load shedding equipment, emergency planning and procedures, and the training of its operators. And that was just the first year.
Thirty years, several small blackouts, and one big blackout later, there may be no greater sign of change than the ongoing and probably perpetual debate about load shedding. Before 1977, Con Edison's first commandment was, "Thou shall not shed load." Since then it has become accepted and in some cases preferred practice to shut down parts of the system to protect the whole system when there is a danger that operators might well lose the whole system. But for men and women whose job it is to supply electricity the decision to cut off power to customers is never an easy one to make. Especially not in the middle of a heat wave. Nor is it ever uncontroversial afterwards, when hindsight is nowhere near 20-20. When the utility shed Washington Heights and Inwood in the summer of 1999, several hundred thousand people complained bitterly and suffered in blistering heat. But the blackout last just a few days; full restoration came quickly. Faced with a similar choice in Queens in 2006, operators were about to shed load, then decided not to, thinking the crisis -- resulting from the failure of nearly a dozen feeder cables--was over. But it wasn't, and when the blackout struck, several neighborhoods went without power for more than a week. Voluntary loading shedding guarantees major inconvenience, but it protects all kinds of crucial equipment and makes the restoration
of power much smoother and quicker.
A dozen things went wrong on the evening of July 13, 1977, from multiple lightning strikes to circuit breaker failure to backup generator failure. But even after all that, intentionally load shedding could probably have saved the system. But by the time operators realized that they had to do it -- communications were horrible -- and figured out how to do it -- they didn't know -- it was too late.
Randy Dotinga:
Mr. Goodman: For those who are too young to remember or know, in the old days of 1977, telephones were at least as large as size 8 shoes, and they were tethered to telephone wall jacks by telephone cables. (Thankfully for those of us who can't sit still, those cables came in many different lengths.) The vast majority of those phones got their power (Direct Current) through that telephone cable, and the telephone company had its own backup power. To this day, emergency preparedness people recommend that we all keep one old-fashioned phone on hand (no frills, without a cordless phone docking station or answering machine or who knows that requires its own AC power) in preparation for the next blackout.

HEADLINE: A Patent Is Worth Having, Right? Well, Maybe Not

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FITZGERALD. 
Michael Fitzgerald is a Boston-area writer on business, technology and culture. E-mail: mfitz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PATENTS are supposed to give inventors an incentive to create things that spur economic growth. For some companies, especially in the pharmaceutical business, patents do just that by allowing them to pull in billions in profits from brand-name, blockbuster drugs. But for most public companies, patents don't pay off, say a couple of researchers who have crunched the numbers.
 ''Today, over all, patents don't work; for the information technology industry especially, they don't work,'' said James Bessen, who became a lecturer at Boston University's law school after a career in business. In 1983, he created the first computer publishing software with Wysiwyg (an acronym for ''what you see is what you get'') printing abilities. He also founded a desktop publishing company, Bestinfo, later acquired by Intergraph. 
 Neither Mr. Bessen nor his company patented anything, in part because his lawyers told him that software couldn't be patented at the time. He ultimately became interested in whether patents spurred innovation, since the software industry for years innovated steadily without using many patents. He and a colleague, Michael J. Meurer, are readying a book on the topic, ''Do Patents Work?,'' due in 2008. (A synopsis and sample chapters are at researchoninnovation.org/dopatentswork/.) 
 The two researchers have analyzed data from 1976 to 1999, the most recent year with complete data. They found that starting in the late 1990s, publicly traded companies saw patent litigation costs outstrip patent profits. Specifically, they estimate that about $8.4 billion in global profits came directly from patents held by publicly traded United States companies in 1997, rising to about $9.3 billion in 1999, with two-thirds of the profits going to chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Domestic litigation costs alone, meanwhile, soared to $16 billion in 1999 from $8 billion in 1997.
 Things have probably become worse since then. For instance, patent litigation is up: there were 2,318 patent-related suits in 1999, and 2,830 in fiscal 2006 (though that's down from the peak year, 2004, when 3,075 were filed). Mr. Bessen said awards in patent cases also seemed to be up, though he was less confident in that data. Worse, he says, companies doing the most research and development are sued the most.
 Mr. Bessen's critique of the patent system does not go so far as that of economists like Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine, who argue that the patent system should be abolished ( http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstnew.htm). Mr. Bessen said that besides girding the pharmaceutical industry, the system did seem to work reasonably well for small companies and individual inventors. Still, he said that ''our finding is that the risk of patent litigation is creating a disincentive for R&D,'' especially for information technology companies, and that the system urgently needs change.
 Mr. Bessen's data is controversial. John F. Duffy, a law professor at George Washington University, thinks that Mr. Bessen and Mr. Meurer have undervalued the profits made from patented items, though he acknowledged that a vast majority of patents are worthless.
 Mr. Duffy, who thinks that the patent system remains a powerful innovation engine for the economy, also noted that the data covers only the private value of patents -- it does not try to measure the social value of patents, that is, the impact an invention has for society at large. How, for example, might one measure the value of the stability of an airplane, which can be traced to an invention patented by the Wright Brothers?
 Still, Mr. Duffy does not discount the research. In fact, he has invited Mr. Meurer to present it at a conference later this summer. ''The numbers are serious, and they are provocative,'' Mr. Duffy said.
 The data don't seem out of line to R. Polk Wagner, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He said that other research has established that patents typically are worth less than $10,000. ''It's not any secret that on a cash basis, it doesn't make sense to file patents, and yet companies do it,'' Mr. Wagner said. 
 Some companies are still spending billions on research programs despite the increase in litigation costs. ''Whether or not the R&D efforts you make invite litigation in no way relates to whether you do them,'' said Bernard S. Meyerson, an I.B.M. fellow who is named on more than 40 patents and is currently chief technologist at its systems and technology group. I.B.M. has one of the corporate world's largest research budgets, spending some $6 billion a year. And it does make money from its patents, at least on a licensing basis. 
 Of course, I.B.M. also employs 370 corporate patent lawyers who Mr. Meyerson said work ''hand in hand'' with the company's inventors, trying to make sure that the company is aware of patent pitfalls that might affect its work. 
 I.B.M. and many other large high-tech companies have hefty patent portfolios, which Mr. Meyerson said deters the companies from suing one another. He said the industry operates under a large intellectual-property umbrella: ''you are licensed under mine, I'm licensed under yours, and by declaring peace as opposed to war, you have freedom of action,'' Mr. Meyerson said. 
 Even so, he said I.B.M. is concerned that innovation could be choked by patent litigation and would like to see the system reformed.
 Congress could step in, and there are patent reform bills in the House and the Senate, with many of the provisions aimed at reining in litigation and damage awards. But this marks the third consecutive year that Congress has considered patent reform, and there is enough opposition from large companies to suggest that it will again have to wait until next year. 
 There are other paths to change: the United States Patent and Trademark Office could open patent applications to public comment, which could help patent examiners find applicable previous inventions. The office in June began a yearlong experiment allowing open comment on 250 patent applications (www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/speeches/07-21.htm). The Web is already ahead of the patent office: a site called wikipatents (www.wikipatents.com) has created an open comment process for several years' worth of patent applications.
 ANOTHER might be to increase the number of appeals courts that handle patent cases. Right now, there is only one, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, may have helped the system immensely with a ruling in June that should stiffen the standard of ''obviousness,'' the key criterion in granting a patent. Tougher standards may weed out many bad patents and reduce litigation.
 But technological inventions are often not obvious, especially when it comes to the esoteric world of software, where it can be unclear even to the inventor what the patent will be good for. 
 Mr. Bessen, for one, is not optimistic. ''Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better for the technology industry,'' he said. If he's correct, it will become harder to question his economic analysis of the current patent system.

HEADLINE: A Million Faxes Later, a Little-Known Group Claims a Victory on Immigration

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
When a comprehensive immigration bill collapsed last month on the Senate floor, it was a victory for a small group that had been lobbying Congress for a decade to reduce the number of immigrants -- legal and illegal -- in the United States.
 The group, Numbers USA, tracked every twist and turn of the bill. Its members flooded the Senate with more than a million faxes, sent through the organization's Web site. It supplied arguments and information to senators opposing the bill. 
 ''It was a David-and-Goliath struggle,'' said Roy H. Beck, the president of Numbers USA, who had been preparing for this moment since 1996, when he wrote a book titled ''The Case Against Immigration.''
 Supporters of the bill included President Bush, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the high-tech industry, the Roman Catholic Church, many Hispanic organizations, farmers, restaurants, hotels and the construction industry. 
 ''The bill had support from the opinion elite in this country,'' Mr. Beck said. ''But we built a grass-roots army, consumed with passion for a cause, and used the power of the Internet to go around the elites and defeat a disastrous amnesty bill.''
 The measure, which died on June 28, would have offered legal status and a path to citizenship to millions of illegal immigrants and created a new temporary worker program while increasing border security.
 ''Numbers USA initiated and turbocharged the populist revolt against the immigration reform package,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigrant advocacy group. ''Roy Beck takes people who are upset about illegal immigration for different reasons, including hostility to Latino immigrants, and disciplines them so their message is based on policy rather than race-based arguments or xenophobia.''
 Representative Brian P. Bilbray, Republican of California and chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus, said, ''We're involved in weekly discussions with Numbers USA and other immigration-control groups as part of a team effort.''
 Numbers USA had fewer than 50,000 members at the end of 2004, but now counts more than 447,000, with an increase of 83 percent since January alone.
 Turning to the next phase of the debate, those members will push for enforcement of existing laws and new measures to curb the employment of illegal immigrants.
 ''Our No. 1 legislative goal is to begin a system of mandatory workplace verification, to confirm that every employee is a United States citizen or an alien authorized to work in this country,'' said Rosemary E. Jenks, director of government relations at Numbers USA.
 The organization wants to reduce immigration -- as Mr. Beck says in the subtitle of his book -- for ''moral, economic, social and environmental reasons.''
 He contends that immigrants and their children are driving population growth, which he says is gobbling up open space, causing urban sprawl and creating more traffic congestion.
 Moreover, Mr. Beck asserts that immigrants and temporary workers, by increasing the supply of labor, have depressed wages in industries from meatpacking to information technology. Numbers USA has worked most closely with conservative Republicans, but in recent weeks has built alliances with Democrats who share the concern.
 Numbers USA keeps a scorecard showing every vote by every member of Congress on immigration-related issues since 1989. The group assigns a letter grade to each member.
 Lawmakers who received an A-plus were all Republicans and included Representatives J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, a presidential candidate. The lowest grades -- F-minuses -- went to Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Joe Baca of California, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
 Numbers USA objects to proposals that increase the number of legal or illegal immigrants. It steers clear of debates over the allocation of visas.
 ''It does not matter to us whether a visa goes to a high-tech worker, a farm worker or the sibling of a U.S. citizen,'' Mr. Beck said.
 Numbers USA is one of many organizations fostered by John H. Tanton, an ophthalmologist from Michigan who has also championed efforts to protect the environment, limit population growth and promote English as an official language.
 Critics like the Southern Poverty Law Center and Representative Chris Cannon, Republican of Utah, have described Dr. Tanton as a father of the anti-immigration movement. Mark A. Potok, a senior researcher at the law center, called Numbers USA the ''kinder, gentler side of that movement.'' 
 Mr. Beck said Numbers USA had been independent of Dr. Tanton since 2002. On the group's Web site, Mr. Beck cautions against ''immigrant bashing'' and says, ''Even illegal aliens deserve humane treatment as they are detected, detained and deported.''
 In the fight over the Senate bill, Numbers USA had daily conference calls with conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Eagle Forum. 
 For tax purposes, Numbers USA has two arms, an educational foundation and an advocacy group that lobbies Congress. Together, Mr. Beck said, they have a budget of $3 million this year, but will probably raise and spend $4.5 million.
 Mr. Beck said that in the past the group received about two-thirds of its money from foundations like the Colcom Foundation of Pittsburgh and the Weeden Foundation in New York. Many of these foundations have an interest in conservation.
 Numbers USA has raised the rest of its money from individual contributors over the Internet. The group collects detailed information on its members -- their ethnic background, politics, religious affiliations, occupations and concerns -- so it can choose the most effective advocates on any particular issue.
 In a survey question on religion, the group said the information would be useful because many lawmakers were likely to respond better to people with ''a very similar religious worldview.''
 ''This is our citizen army,'' Mr. Beck said, pointing to a map that showed members of his group in every Congressional district.

HEADLINE: Diversity Plans Based on Income Leave Some Schools Segregated

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER and ALAN FINDER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
When San Francisco started trying to promote socioeconomic diversity in its public schools, officials hoped racial diversity would result as well. 
 It has not worked out that way. 
 Abraham Lincoln High School, for example, with its stellar reputation and Advanced Placement courses, has drawn a mix of rich and poor students. More than 50 percent of those students are of Chinese descent. 
 ''If you look at diversity based on race, the school hasn't been as integrated,'' Lincoln's principal, Ronald J. K. Pang, said. ''If you don't look at race, the school has become much more diverse.'' 
 San Francisco began considering factors like family income, instead of race, in school assignments when it modified a court-ordered desegregation plan in response to a lawsuit. But school officials have found that the 55,000-student city school district, with Chinese the dominant ethnic group followed by Hispanics, blacks and whites, is resegregrating. 
 The number of schools where students of a single racial or ethnic group make up 60 percent or more of the population in at least one grade is increasing sharply. In 2005-06, about 50 schools were segregated using that standard as measured by a court-appointed monitor. That was up from 30 schools in the 2001-02 school year, the year before the change, according to court filings.
 The San Francisco experience is telling because after the recent United States Supreme Court decision restricting the use of race-based school assignment plans, many districts are expected to switch to economic integration plans like San Francisco's as a legal way to seek diversity. As many as 40 districts around the country are already experimenting with such plans, according to an analysis by Richard D. Kahlenberg of the Century Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy research group. 
 Many of these experiments are modest, involve small districts or have been in place only a few years. But the experiences of these districts show how difficult it can be to balance socioeconomic diversity, racial integration and academic success.
 Only a few plans appear to have achieved all three goals. Others promote income diversity but not racial integration while still other plans are limited and their results inconclusive. Those who have studied them say a key to that outcome is how aggressively a plan shifts students around and whether there are many schools that can lure middle-class students from their neighborhoods into poor ones. 
 ''Systemwide programs are more effective than piecemeal programs,'' said Mr. Kahlenberg, who has studied plans like these.
 The purpose of such programs is twofold. Since income levels often correlate with race they can be an alternate and legal way to produce racial integration. They also promote achievement gains by putting poorer students in schools that are more likely to have experienced teachers and students with high aspirations, as well as a parent body that can afford to be more involved. 
 ''There is a large body of evidence going back several years,'' Mr. Kahlenberg said, ''that probably the most important thing you can do to raise the achievement of low-income students is to provide them with middle-class schools.''
 Economic integration initiatives differ from each other, and from many traditional integration efforts that relied on mandatory transfer of students among schools. Some of the new initiatives involve busing but some do not; some rely on student choice, while some also use a lottery. And so it is difficult to measure how far students travel or how many students switch schools. 
 The most ambitious effort and the example most often cited as a success is in the city of Raleigh, N.C., and its suburbs.
 For seven years the district has sought to cap the proportion of low-income students in each of the county's 143 schools at 40 percent. 
 To achieve a balance of low- and middle-income children, the district encourages and sometimes requires students to attend schools far from home. Suburban students are attracted to magnet schools in the city; children from the inner city are sometimes bused to middle-class schools at the outer edges of Raleigh and in the suburbs. 
 The achievement gains have been sharp, and school officials said economic integration was largely responsible. Only 40 percent of black students in grades three through eight in Wake County, where Raleigh is located, scored at grade level on state reading tests in 1995. By the spring of 2006, 82 percent did. 
 ''The plan works well,'' said John H. Gilbert, a professor emeritus at North Carolina State University in Raleigh who served for 16 years on the county school board and voted for the plan. ''It's based on sound assumptions about the environment in which children learn.''
 The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district, North Carolina's largest, has also tried an economic integration plan, but with less success. 
 Students were once assigned to schools in Charlotte and its suburbs based in part on achieving racial balance, but that system was struck down in federal appeals court in 2001. 
 The school board then created an assignment plan based on income and choice; a low-income student could transfer to a middle-class school if he came from a high-poverty, low-performing school. But such transfers could occur only if there was room, and there seldom was. ''There are not a whole lot of seats available and so there is not a lot of choice available,'' said Scott McCully, the district's executive director of planning and student placement.
 Within several years, said Roslyn Arlin Mickelson, professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, ''the schools became markedly more segregated.'' 
 In the smaller school system in Cambridge, Mass., children apply to the city's 12 elementary schools and socioeconomic status is an important factor in ultimate assignments. The system has been phased in gradually since the fall of 2002.
 Last year, 75.8 percent of Cambridge's low-income third graders were judged to be progressing toward reading proficiency. That was higher than the statewide average for low-income students, 71.3 percent, and better than the rate in more than a dozen other cities in the state. 
 Other districts have not seen such results. One district in San Jose, Calif., switched to using family and neighborhood income instead of race for assignments two years ago, giving a preference to students in low-income areas who try to transfer to schools in higher income areas, and vice versa. 
 But in the first year, the number of students switching schools declined significantly and has only begun to recover in the last year. 
 San Francisco had been under a court order to desegregate for more than 20 years, with no school allowed to have a majority of students from one racial or ethnic group. But after Chinese-American parents whose children were kept out of certain elite schools sued, the district switched in 2002-03 to a plan that sought socioeconomic diversity.
 Students apply to the schools they want to attend, and the district uses a ''diversity index'' for assignments when a school is oversubscribed. The index considers the language spoken at home, whether a child qualifies for free lunch or is in public housing, a child's academic performance and the quality of a child's prior schools. But it has not resulted in racial integration.
 ''We were hopeful that the diversity index would work,'' said Stuart Biegel, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was the district's court-appointed monitor. ''No one was rooting against it. But itdidn't work.''
 Officials say one problem is that many students apply to neighborhood schools, which do not recruit enough students from outside their area. Another problem is demographics. Mr. Biegel said public school students in San Francisco were relatively low income over all, whatever their race or ethnicity, so the diversity index produced less mixing than hoped. 
 The wide ethnic diversity in San Francisco's schools, which are about one-third Chinese, also introduces calculations among parents that make it easier to get income diversity without racial or ethnic diversity. 
 At Willie L. Brown Jr. College Preparatory Academy, a fourth- through sixth-grade school in the predominantly black neighborhood of Bayview, 75 percent of the students are black. Most are poor. 
 Tareyton D. Russ, the principal, said students from other neighborhoods did not seek to go there so the diversity index did not even apply. ''Poor Chinese kids don't want to go to school with poor black kids,'' Mr. Russ said flatly. 
 Conversely, one white parent interviewed as she dropped her child off at summer school said some white parents avoided schools with a heavy Chinese concentration, like Lincoln, believing they would be too high-pressure for their children. She declined to be quoted by name.
 David Campos, the general counsel to the school district, said the resegregation was so disappointing that the school board might try to test whether Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's opinion in the recent Supreme Court case left open the possibility of using race if other methods of integration fail. 
 ''We stopped using race at some point,'' Mr. Campos said. ''And then for a number of years we have tried to use a number of race-neutral factors to achieve racial diversity, which methods haven't worked. Should the board decide to use race, and they may or may not, we are a very good test case.''

HEADLINE: Gateway to Andes: Lakes, Backpackers And an Easy Vibe

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER. 
LARRY ROHTER is chief of The Times's bureau in Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
 PATAGONIA gets all the attention and renown, but the lake district just to its north has always been one of Chile's most beautiful regions. In recent years, the area has also become increasingly accessible, as Chile's fast-growing economy has transformed the once-sleepy and staid resort town of Pucon, at the east end of Lago Villarrica, into an Andean version of Aspen.
 In the language of the Mapuche-Pehuenche Indians who dominated the region before the first European settlers arrived in 1883, Pucon means ''entrance to the mountains.'' With all the hotels, condos and restaurants going up around town, Pucon now plays its traditional role in more luxurious fashion, serving as a gateway both to the lake district that stretches southward for 150 miles to Puerto Montt and to the snow-capped volcanoes that form a magnificent backdrop to those expanses of water and forest.
 This is not the tropics, however: Pucon, population 14,500, is nearly 40 degrees below the equator, about as far south as New York City is north. That means the seasons and the weather change markedly, and Pucon with them, offering visitors a very different set of attractions at different times of year. 
 During the Southern Hemisphere summer, December through March, the main focus is the lake itself and the rivers that feed it. The beach in front of the venerable Gran Hotel Pucon is so crowded then that, as Chileans like to say, ''the only way to get a spot is if someone dies.'' For more active types, there is also boating, jet skiing and water skiing and sport fishing.
 But during the winter season that is just now beginning and continues until September, Pucon turns into a major ski area, centered around Mount Villarrica, an active volcano visible all over town and just a few miles to the south. Halfway up the mountain, at the 4,700-foot mark, is a lodge called Centro de Esqui Villarrica, which, for 18,000 pesos a day (about $34 at 536 pesos to the dollar), provides five or six lifts to trails of varying degrees of difficulty, as well as snowboarding and hiking trails.
 At night, the restaurants, bars and clubs along Calle Fresia, the main drag, come alive. The cuisine is varied: in addition to the salmon and trout dishes that one would expect in a place so closely tied to lakes and rivers, there are plenty of restaurants specializing in Italian, Spanish, Uruguayan barbecue and even Pan-Asian food.
 Since Pucon was largely developed by German and Swiss families with names like Gudenschwager and Holzapfel, a Teutonic influence on cuisine is also quite noticeable. Though few diners are willing to brave eating outdoors during the winter season, when warmer weather comes, one favorite local pastime is to while away part of the day at a sidewalk cafe with a plate of locally made kuchen, and an espresso or pisco sour, Chile's national drink.
 There is even a casino, adjoining the luxury Hotel del Lago, that functions all through the night. If that makes Pucon sound uncomfortably like Las Vegas, never fear: the vibe throughout town is easygoing and informal, geared more toward backpackers than high rollers, and far less stuffy or celebrity-obsessed than in Bariloche, the rival Argentine ski resort on the other side of the Andes that is a traditional favorite of moneyed South Americans.
 In fact, whoever invented the phrase ''the great outdoors'' must have had Pucon in mind. The town is awash in outfitters that offer canoeing, kayaking, hiking, rafting, mountain biking, rappelling and horseback riding, either as day trips or as multiday excursions; almost all such agencies have employees who speak English.
 Pucon also makes a wonderful jumping-off point to explore other lakes, including Calafquen and Panguipulli, both an hour's drive to the south. My favorite, though, is the quieter, isolated Caburgua, about 20 miles northeast of Pucon, where last December I spent a relaxing morning watching separate groups of vacationing Chilean high school students and German tourists trying to master the paddleboats that are for rent on the lake's southern shore.
 Chileans have traditionally flocked to Pucon to take advantage of the many hot springs just east of town, and foreign travelers are now also embracing that habit. The Termas los Pozones, for example, has a following among younger visitors, especially those on a budget: it is open 24 hours, and at 3,500 pesos per person for a day, a visit costs nearly half the price of some of its competitors. All six of its natural pools are often filled late at night
 The Termas de Huife is the more sedate, upscale choice, offering three pools of different temperatures, as well as spa and massage services in tasteful wood-paneled cabins; there is also a hotel on the premises. But for me the charm of the place is best found during a daytime soak, when it is possible to search the sky for the condors that occasionally hover above the nearby forest and listen to the rushing waters of the Rio Liucura, just a stone's throw away.
 The area's main attraction, though, is probably Villarrica National Park, which sprawls eastward along Highway 199 to the border with Argentina. The 230-square-mile park, crisscrossed by hiking trails, encompasses a pair of imposing volcanoes: one that shares its name with the park and the lake, and Quetrupillan, which is smaller and harder to reach because it is along the park's more isolated southern flank. 
 Mount Villarrica was known to the Mapuches as Rucapillan, or the Devil's Lair, and remains an active volcano. Its last major eruption occurred in 1971, sending a nine-mile flow of lava through forests and rivers. Plumes of smoke can be seen wafting from Rucapillan's crater with some frequency, recalling the respectful words of the poet Alonso de Ercilla, who trekked through the region in the mid-1500s as part of the first Spanish expedition to explore the lake district:
 Great neighbor volcano Known as Vulcan's forge that belches ceaseless fire.
 Locals say they worry about Mount Villarrica only when it is not letting off steam, because that means pressure for an eruption is building up inside. In fact, climbing the mountain's northern face is one of Pucon's most popular day trips. For about 27,000 pesos, or $50, outfitters will organize groups and provide gear, a guide and transport to and from the ski lodge that is the starting point for the trek to the crater.
 But my top choice, whether for hiking or just contemplation, is the smaller, quieter and more remote Huerquehue National Park. The nine-mile road from Lago Caburgua will tax both your patience and the suspension on your car, but Huerquehue's charms become evident as soon as you start your trek, which is less grueling than the one up Mount Villarrica. The main trail winds its way up through stands of dense lenga and araucaria forest and past waterfalls to three small lakes, offering spectacular glimpses of the volcano and nearby Lago Tinquilco. 
 If Pucon's menu of activities sounds appealing, my last piece of advice is this: go now rather than later. In the six years that I've been visiting the lake district, I've noticed billboards for time-share condos appearing with greater frequency on the road to Pucon, along with construction of chalets and cabins on the slopes of some of the hills that rise from Lago Villarrica. The threat of overdevelopment is quite real. But for now, Pucon is finally enjoying a well-deserved moment of glory.
 VISITOR INFORMATION 
 Round-trip fares from Kennedy Airport in New York to Temuco, Chile, start at around $1,125, according to a recent Web search. From Temuco, the 55-mile bus trip to Pucon costs about 1,900 pesos, or about $3.55 at 536 pesos to the dollar. You can rent a car in Temuco from about $50 a day. 
 WHERE TO STAY
 Hotels encourage foreign visitors to pay in United States dollars, which allows them to avoid paying a 19 percent value-added tax. 
 Generations of Chilean families have summered at the lakeside Gran Hotel Pucon (Clemente Holzapfel 190, 56-45-913-300; www.granhotelpucon.com), which has 145 rooms with views of either the lake or the Villarrica volcano. Double rooms range from $110 a night in the low season to $215 in the high season, breakfast included. 
 About a mile out of town is the Hotel Antumalal (56-45-441-011; www.antumalal.com), a 20-room Bauhaus beauty with a lovely hillside garden, winding paths and waterfalls. Doubles start at $115 in the low season and $224 in the high season, including breakfast.
 Major hotels all have their own dining rooms. At the Antumalal, for instance, the menu brings European finesse to fish and other Chilean ingredients; dinner for two with Chilean wine runs about 37,500 pesos.
 In town, Calle Fresia is lined with restaurants of almost every imaginable type. Puerto Pucon y Tequila (Fresia 246; 56-45-441-592) has Spanish and Portuguese seafood dishes.
 For kuchen, strudel and other German delicacies, try the Holzapfel Backerei (Clemente Holzapfel 524; 56-45-443-546). 
 EXCURSIONS
 The ski lodge and runs on Mount Villarrica are owned by the Gran Hotel Pucon, and skiing arrangements can be made in the lobby. There are also numerous agencies around town that can make those arrangements and organize other trips, including an ascent of the volcano. One good place to start is Politur, at O'Higgins 635; (56-45) 441-373; www.politur.com. Its rates may be a bit higher than some competitors', but it's reliable.

HEADLINE: Hartford's Tax Challenge

 BODY:
Hartford suffers all the usual ills of Connecticut cities: A high poverty rate, high taxes and boundaries that have limited the city's growth for many decades. These are challenge enough. But last year the capital city went through its first property revaluation in eight years. The results will begin having an impact on tax bills this month. 
 Taxes are always a major issue for a poor city. But the question of which group will bear the heavier burden has caused businesses and residents to square off. How leaders handle the consequences will have a big impact on the city's future. 
 ''Every chief elected official of a Connecticut city knows that during revaluation we move around the deck chairs of the Titanic,'' said Mayor Eddie Perez. But the balancing act is even more delicate in Hartford. Because it has three major hospitals, three colleges and dozens of government buildings, about half of its 18 square miles is tax-exempt. With a population of 125,000, it has one of the lowest rates of owner-occupied housing (less than 25 percent) of any city of its size in America. 
 The low rate of owner-occupied housing is one reason Hartford adopted an unusual method of levying property taxes more than 15 years ago that unwittingly hurt businesses. The city is now trying to dismantle this approach, which came about when an earlier revaluation, in 1989, drastically increased taxes on residential property, according to Lawrence LaBarbera, the city assessor. 
 Soon after, the General Assembly passed a law allowing Hartford to give a property tax break to residences of three units or fewer to keep more people from fleeing the city. To compensate for the cut in revenue, the city imposed a surcharge on the property taxes of businesses as a way to stabilize neighborhoods. But this added an incentive for businesses to leave, something the city could not afford.
 Last year's revaluation made clear how lopsided the system had become. Residences have doubled and tripled in value, but they still enjoy a tax break. Small businesses looking at large potential increases in taxes began to ask, with good reason, why they weren't protected too. 
 To its credit, the city decided to phase out the surcharge over five years, while phasing in the impact of revaluation over the same period. What worries city leaders is what happens during the sixth year -- when there is no more surcharge, and no more phase-in to cushion the blow of rising residential taxes. 
 Mayor Perez says that the only way to stabilize revenues for all cities in the state is for Connecticut to change the centuries-old system of forcing municipalities to rely on property taxes for the majority of their revenue. Of course he is right; that very same remedy was proposed by a blue ribbon commission several years ago. The commission's report has since gathered dust, so no municipal leader in the Land of Steady Habits should hold his breath waiting for tax reform. 
 Mayor Perez intends to establish a committee soon of about 18 or 20 people, from all sides, to look at options for improving Hartford's economic climate. That is a good idea, though the committee should do more than simply discuss ways to reform the system. It should gather workable ideas from other urban success stories and identify impediments the city puts in its own way to keep it from prospering.
 It is true that state policies are not helpful. It is also true that Hartford could probably make some changes that would improve the city's fortunes for both residents and businesses.

HEADLINE: The Man Without a Country

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
WHERE do you live? 
 For New Yorkers, the answer to that question can take any number of forms, general, specific or existential. Uptown, downtown, Brooklyn or Queens. The West Village, the Lower East Side, 102nd and Riverside. On the knife edge of despair. In a state of perpetual anxiety.
 For me, the nonexistential answer is painfully complicated. (So is the existential one, but that's another story.) I live on Madison Avenue a few blocks north of Madison Square Park, in a neighborhood that has no name. It is not quite Murray Hill or Kips Bay (thank God), and certainly not Chelsea. Calling it the Flatiron district is possibly claiming an untoward intimacy with a beloved landmark, but I've been known to do so, for the sake of convenience, and to avoid having to confess to the shaming fact of its namelessness. 
 But lately I've been calling it the Brown Zone. 
 Let me explain how I came by the peculiar nomenclature. You know those little maps of Manhattan and environs affixed to the barrier between passengers and driver in most taxis, helpfully dividing Manhattan into little pastel-colored blocks, with the name of each neighborhood superimposed in soothing blue type? Next time you get into a taxi, note the unsightly brown slab to the east of Chelsea, north of Gramercy and south of Murray Hill. It is the only patch of Manhattan that, according to the taxicab commission, has no quasi-official designation. This is where I live.
 The neighborhood is one of the few left in Manhattan in which commercial tenants still seem to outstrip -- or at least vie with -- residential inhabitants for supremacy. In fact, I moved to the neighborhood about five years ago because I found an apartment, to purchase, within a few blocks of what was then my office. I was living in the teeming East Village at the time, and while I loved the bustling 24/7 neighborhood life there, the advantages of being able to walk to work in the time it took to consume a small coffee from the bodega swayed me. 
 What I didn't count on was the alarming absence of bodegas. In the East Village, a possibly grimy but usually friendly convenience store, where you could buy a magazine, a bagel or a beer at any time of day, hugged almost every corner. Here there is only one such establishment within bad-hangover-walking distance (one block) of my current apartment. When it mysteriously closed for a few days awhile back -- I never found out why, I was too afraid to ask -- life seemed to take on a tentative, semi-post-apocalyptic cast. 
 But that weird, thankfully brief interlude is nothing compared with the strange history of the Duane Reade That Closed. 
 Yes, you read that correctly. Elsewhere in the city, indeed everywhere else in the city, branches of this and other drugstore chains sprout like fungi in a dank wood after a rainstorm. But my Duane Reade, the one at Madison Avenue and 27th Street, snapped shut several months ago, seemingly overnight. 
 Certainly there were signs that not all was well. The branch was closed on weekends, for starters. And you rarely had to confront that troublesome moral choice, whether or not to obey the signs saying ''Please form a line at each register.'' At my Duane Reade, generally only one register was open at any time. 
 So it should have come as no surprise when my Duane Reade closed. And, granted, there's another one on Park and 28th. But that's a light year away in Duane-Reade-proximity terms, and I feel that this is a disturbing portent.
 But of what? Urban decay? With frenzied gentrification the rule in Manhattan today, you might almost hope so. But what is confusing about life in the Brown Zone is that signs of economic uncertainty and residential inconvenience are matched by indications that the neighborhood is becoming an increasingly desirable place to live. 
 It is still pleasantly quiet on weekends -- there are no enticing retail stores, really, unless you're in the market for a Persian rug -- and while Susanne Bartsch briefly played host to a Tuesday-night club around the corner from me, that operation never turned 27th Street into the hideous obstacle course its far western stretches have become. 
 Still, luxury condominiums are popping up everywhere, blaring their seductive urbanity and top-drawer amenities from the construction scaffolding that spans every other block. The Madison Grand, on the park's northwest corner, is a stately red-brick pile now anchored by a branch of that other kudzu-like New York enterprise, the Chase bank. Two doors up from me, an unexceptional building once home to a grimy Greek coffee shop is now a gutted-and-renovated stack of condos advertising white-glove service from Geoffrey Zakarian's Country restaurant a block away.
 Which brings me to another key indicator of urban renewal, as opposed to decline: the recent advent of a few top-tier, top-chef-branded restaurants. In addition to Country, in the renovated Carlton Hotel, there is Urena, an haute-Spanish place on an unprepossessing block of 28th Street, two doors down from the barbershop where I can never manage to get the same $12 haircut twice (at that price I don't complain); and of course A Voce, the Italian restaurant from Andrew Carmellini (formerly of Cafe Boulud on the Upper East Side).
 Danny Meyer was of course the area's pioneering fine-food figure. He opened Eleven Madison Park and its neighbor Tabla well before the area began to emerge from the doldrums. His high-end barbecue joint, Blue Smoke, I prize mainly for the jazz club downstairs, where I have spent some unforgettable evenings in the company of Bill Charlap. 
 And for a legion of New Yorkers, Mr. Meyer seems to have single-handedly put Madison Square Park itself on the map by opening his faux-modest little hamburger stand in the southeast corner. 
 The Shake Shack, as it is famously and whimsically called, has now become an urban attraction of such renown that you could probably raise, slaughter and cook your own cow in the time it takes to get a burger and fries there. The last time I visited, I was offered one of those plastic gizmos that look like stun guns and was told it would throb when my order was ready. I stared disconsolately at it for 30 minutes before it made a peep, by which time I was nearly ready to give up.
 Like many Brown Zoners, my feelings for the Shake Shack have progressed from enthusiasm and pride to distant affection and veiled dislike. I resent that it has relegated my adored Madison Square Park to being a backdrop to a fry joint. 
 But I'm also grateful for the many benefits Mr. Meyer's entrepreneurial hand has brought to the area. In truth, I wouldn't mind if he kept at it. If I may make a suggestion, Mr. Meyer, have you ever thought of getting into the deli business? Although the neighborhood has made much happy progress is the years since I've lived here, the Brown Zone remains a bagel wasteland.

HEADLINE: The Richest of the Rich, Proud of a New Gilded Age

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Amanda Cox contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The tributes to Sanford I. Weill line the walls of the carpeted hallway that leads to his skyscraper office, with its panoramic view of Central Park. A dozen framed magazine covers, their colors as vivid as an Andy Warhol painting, are the most arresting. Each heralds Mr. Weill's genius in assembling Citigroup into the most powerful financial institution since the House of Morgan a century ago.
 His achievement required political clout, and that, too, is on display. Soon after he formed Citigroup, Congress repealed a Depression-era law that prohibited goliaths like the one Mr. Weill had just put together anyway, combining commercial and investment banking, insurance and stock brokerage operations. A trophy from the victory -- a pen that President Bill Clinton used to sign the repeal -- hangs, framed, near the magazine covers. 
 These days, Mr. Weill and many of the nation's very wealthy chief executives, entrepreneurs and financiers echo an earlier era -- the Gilded Age before World War I -- when powerful enterprises, dominated by men who grew immensely rich, ushered in the industrialization of the United States. The new titans often see themselves as pillars of a similarly prosperous and expansive age, one in which their successes and their philanthropy have made government less important than it once was. 
 ''People can look at the last 25 years and say this is an incredibly unique period of time,'' Mr. Weill said. ''We didn't rely on somebody else to build what we built, and we shouldn't rely on somebody else to provide all the services our society needs.'' 
 Those earlier barons disappeared by the 1920s and, constrained by the Depression and by the greater government oversight and high income tax rates that followed, no one really took their place. Then, starting in the late 1970s, as the constraints receded, new tycoons gradually emerged, and now their concentrated wealth has made the early years of the 21st century truly another Gilded Age. 
 Only twice before over the last century has 5 percent of the national income gone to families in the upper one-one-hundredth of a percent of the income distribution -- currently, the almost 15,000 families with incomes of $9.5 million or more a year, according to an analysis of tax returns by the economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkeley and Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics.
 Such concentration at the very top occurred in 1915 and 1916, as the Gilded Age was ending, and again briefly in the late 1920s, before the stock market crash. Now it is back, and Mr. Weill is prominent among the new titans. His net worth exceeds $1 billion, not counting the $500 million he says he has already given away, in the open-handed style of Andrew Carnegie and the other great philanthropists of the earlier age.
 At 74, just over a year into retirement as Citigroup chairman, Mr. Weill sees in Carnegie's life aspects of his own. Andrew Carnegie, an impoverished Scottish immigrant, built a steel empire in Pittsburgh, taking risks that others shunned, just as the demand for steel was skyrocketing. He then gave away his fortune, reasoning that he was lucky to have been in the right spot at the right moment and he owed the community for his good luck -- not in higher wages for his workers, but in philanthropic distribution of his wealth. 
 Mr. Weill's beginnings were similarly inauspicious. A son of immigrants from Poland, raised in Brooklyn, a so-so college student, he landed on Wall Street in a low-level job in the 1950s. Harnessing entrepreneurial energy, deftness as a deal maker and an appetite for risk, with a rising stock market pulling him along, he built a financial empire that, in his view, successfully broke through the stultifying constraints that flowed from the New Deal. They were constraints not just on what business could or could not do, but on every high earner's take-home pay. 
 ''I once thought how lucky the Carnegies and the Rockefellers were because they made their money before there was an income tax,'' Mr. Weill said, never believing in his younger days that deregulation and tax cuts, starting in the late 1970s, would bring back many of the easier conditions of the Gilded Age. ''I felt that everything of any great consequence was really all made in the past,'' he said. ''That turned out not to be true and it is not true today.'' 
 The Question of Talent
 Other very wealthy men in the new Gilded Age talk of themselves as having a flair for business not unlike Derek Jeter's ''unique talent'' for baseball, as Leo J. Hindery Jr. put it. ''I think there are people, including myself at certain times in my career,'' Mr. Hindery said, ''who because of their uniqueness warrant whatever the market will bear.'' 
 He counts himself as a talented entrepreneur, having assembled from scratch a cable television sports network, the YES Network, that he sold in 1999 for $200 million. ''Jeter makes an unbelievable amount of money,'' said Mr. Hindery, who now manages a private equity fund, ''but you look at him and you say, 'Wow, I cannot find another ballplayer with that same set of skills.' ''
 A handful of critics among the new elite, or close to it, are scornful of such self-appraisal. ''I don't see a relationship between the extremes of income now and the performance of the economy,'' Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve Board chairman, said in an interview, challenging the contentions of the very rich that they are, more than others, the driving force of a robust economy. 
 The great fortunes today are largely a result of the long bull market in stocks, Mr. Volcker said. Without rising stock prices, stock options would not have become a major source of riches for financiers and chief executives. Stock prices rise for a lot of reasons, Mr. Volcker said, including ones that have nothing to do with the actions of these people. 
 ''The market did not go up because businessmen got so much smarter,'' he said, adding that the 1950s and 1960s, which the new tycoons denigrate as bureaucratic and uninspiring, ''were very good economic times and no one was making what they are making now.''
 James D. Sinegal, chief executive of Costco, the discount retailer, echoes that sentiment. ''Obscene salaries send the wrong message through a company,'' he said. ''The message is that all brilliance emanates from the top; that the worker on the floor of the store or the factory is insignificant.'' 
 A legendary chief executive from an earlier era is similarly critical. He is Robert L. Crandall, 71, who as president and then chairman and chief executive, led American Airlines through the early years of deregulation and pioneered the development of the hub-and-spoke system for managing airline routes. He retired in 1997, never having made more than $5 million a year, in the days before upper-end incomes really took off. 
 He is speaking out now, he said, because he no longer has to worry that his ''radical views'' might damage the reputation of American or that of the companies he served until recently as a director. The nation's corporate chiefs would be living far less affluent lives, Mr. Crandall said, if fate had put them in, say, Uzbekistan instead of the United States, ''where they are the beneficiaries of a market system that rewards a few people in extraordinary ways and leaves others behind.'' 
 ''The way our society equalizes incomes,'' he argued, ''is through much higher taxes than we have today. There is no other way.''
 The New Tycoons
 The new Gilded Age has created only one fortune as large as those of the Rockefellers, the Carnegies and the Vanderbilts -- that of Bill Gates, according to various compilations. His net worth, measured as a share of the economy's output, ranks him fifth among the 30 all-time wealthiest American families, just ahead of Carnegie. Only one other living billionaire makes the cut: Warren E. Buffett, in 16th place. 
 Individual fortunes nearly a century ago were so large that just 30 tycoons -- Rockefeller was by far the wealthiest -- had accumulated net worth equal to 5 percent of the national income. Their wealth flowed mainly from the empires they built in manufacturing, railroads, oil, coal, urban transit and mass retailing as the United States grew into the world's largest industrial economy. 
 Today the fortunes of the very wealthiest are spread more widely. In addition to stock and stock options, low-interest credit has brought wealth to more families -- by, for example, facilitating the sale of individual businesses for much greater sums than in the past. The fortunes amassed in hedge funds and in private equity often stem from deals involving huge amounts of easy credit and vast pools of capital available for investment. 
 The high-tech boom and the Internet unfolded against this backdrop. The rising stock market multiplied the wealth of Bill Gates as his software became the industry standard. It did the same for numerous others who financed start-ups on a shoestring and then went public at enormous gain.
 Over a longer period, the market lifted the value of Mr. Buffett's judicious investments and timely acquisitions, and he emerged as the extraordinarily wealthy Sage of Omaha, in effect, a baron of the new Gilded Age whose views are strikingly similar to those of Carnegie and Mr. Weill.
 Like them, Mr. Buffett, 78, sees himself as lucky, having had the good fortune, as he put it, to have been born in America, white and male, and ''wired for asset allocation'' just when all four really paid off. He dwelt on his good fortune in a recent appearance at a fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is vying for Mr. Buffett's support of her presidential candidacy.
 ''This is a significantly richer country than 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago,'' he declared, backing his assertion with a favorite statistic. The national income, divided by the population, is a very abundant $45,000 per capita, he said, a number that reflects an affluent nation but also obscures the lopsided income distribution intertwined with the prosperity.
 ''Society should place an initial emphasis on abundance,'' Mr. Buffett argued, but ''then should continuously strive'' to redistribute the abundance more equitably. 
 No income tax existed in Carnegie's day to do this, and neither Mr. Buffett nor Mr. Weill push for sharply higher income tax rates now, although Mr. Buffett criticizes the present tax code as unfairly skewed in his favor. Like Carnegie, philanthropy is their preference. ''I want to give away my money rather than have somebody take it away,'' Mr. Weill said. 
 Mr. Buffett is already well down that path. Most of his wealth is in the stock of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, and he is transferring the majority of that stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation so the Gateses can ''materially expand'' their giving.
 ''In my will,'' he has written, echoing Carnegie's last wishes, ''I've stipulated that the proceeds from all Berkshire shares I still own at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes.''
 Revisionist History
 The new tycoons describe a history that gives them a heroic role. The American economy, they acknowledge, did grow more rapidly on average in the decades immediately after World War II than it is growing today. Incomes rose faster than inflation for most Americans and the spread between rich and poor was much less. But the United States was far and away the dominant economy, and government played a strong supporting role. In such a world, the new tycoons argue, business leaders needed only to be good managers.
 Then, with globalization, with America competing once again for first place as strenuously as it had in the first Gilded Age, the need grew for a different type of business leader -- one more entrepreneurial, more daring, more willing to take risks, more like the rough and tumble tycoons of the first Gilded Age. Lew Frankfort, chairman and chief executive of Coach, the manufacturer and retailer of trendy upscale handbags, who was among the nation's highest paid chief executives last year, recaps the argument.
 ''The professional class that developed in business in the '50s and '60s,'' he said, ''was able as America grew at very steady rates to become industry leaders and move their organizations forward in most categories: steel, autos, housing, roads.''
 That changed with the arrival of ''the technological age,'' in Mr. Frankfort's view. Innovation became a requirement, in addition to good management skills -- and innovation has played a role in Coach's marketing success. ''To be successful,'' Mr. Frankfort said, ''you now needed vision, lateral thinking, courage and an ability to see things, not the way they were but how they might be.''
 Mr. Weill's vision was to create a financial institution in the style of those that flourished in the last Gilded Age. Although insurance is gone, Citigroup still houses commercial and investment banking and stock brokerage.
 The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 outlawed the mix, blaming conflicts of interest inherent in such a combination for helping to bring on the 1929 crash and the Depression. The pen displayed in Mr. Weill's hallway is one of those Mr. Clinton used to revoke Glass-Steagall in 1999. He did so partly to accommodate the newly formed Citigroup, whose heft was necessary, Mr. Weill said, if the United States was to be a powerhouse in global financial markets. 
 ''The whole world is moving to the American model of free enterprise and capital markets,'' Mr. Weill said, arguing that Wall Street cannot be a big player in China or India without giants like Citigroup. ''Not having American financial institutions that really are at the fulcrum of how these countries are converting to a free-enterprise system,'' he said, ''would really be a shame.''
 Such talk alarms Arthur Levitt Jr., a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who started on Wall Street years ago as a partner with Mr. Weill in a stock brokerage firm. Mr. Levitt has publicly lamented the end of Glass-Steagall, but Mr. Weill argues that its repeal ''created the opportunities to keep people still moving forward.''
 Mr. Levitt is skeptical. ''I view a gilded age as an age in which warning flags are flying and are seen by very few people,'' he said, referring to the potential for a Wall Street firm to fail or markets to crash in a world of too much deregulation. ''I think this is a time of great prosperity and a time of great danger.''
 It's Not the Money, or Is It?
 Not that money is the only goal. Mr. Hindery, the cable television entrepreneur, said he would have worked just as hard for a much smaller payoff, and others among the very wealthy agreed. ''I worked because I loved what I was doing,'' Mr. Weill said, insisting that not until he retired did ''I have a chance to sit back and count up what was on the table.'' And Kenneth C. Griffin, who received more than $1 billion last year as chairman of a hedge fund, the Citadel Investment Group, declared: ''The money is a byproduct of a passionate endeavor.'' 
 Mr. Griffin, 38, argued that those who focus on the money -- and there is always a get-rich crowd -- ''soon discover that wealth is not a particularly satisfying outcome.'' His own team at Citadel, he said, ''loves the problems they work on and the challenges inherent to their business.''
 Mr. Griffin maintained that he has created wealth not just for himself but for many others. ''We have helped to create real social value in the U.S. economy,'' he said. ''We have invested money in countless companies over the years and they have helped countless people.''
 The new tycoons oppose raising taxes on their fortunes. Unlike Mr. Crandall, neither Mr. Weill nor Mr. Griffin nor most of the dozen others who were interviewed favor tax rates higher than they are today, although a few would go along with a return to the levels of the Clinton administration. The marginal tax on income then was 39.6 percent, and on capital gains, 20 percent. That was still far below the 70 percent and 39 percent in the late 1970s. Those top rates, in the Bush years, are now 35 percent and 15 percent, respectively.
 ''The income distribution has to stand,'' Mr. Griffin said, adding that by trying to alter it with a more progressive income tax, ''you end up in problematic circumstances. In the current world, there will be people who will move from one tax area to another. I am proud to be an American. But if the tax became too high, as a matter of principle I would not be working this hard.''
 Creating Wealth
 Some chief executives of publicly traded companies acknowledge that their fortunes are indeed large -- but that it reflects only a small share of the corporate value created on their watch.
 Mr. Frankfort, the 61-year-old Coach chief, took home $44.4 million last year. His net worth is in the high nine figures. Yet his pay and net worth, he notes, are small compared with the gain to shareholders since Coach went public six years ago, with Mr. Frankfort at the helm. The market capitalization, the value of all the shares, is nearly $18 billion, up from an initial $700 million.
 ''I don't think it is unreasonable,'' he said, ''for the C.E.O. of a company to realize 3 to 5 percent of the wealth accumulation that shareholders realize.''
 That strikes Robert C. Pozen as a reasonable standard. He made a name for himself -- and a fortune -- rejuvenating mutual funds, starting with Fidelity. In one case, he said, the fund he was running made a profit of $1 billion; his pay that year was $15 million.
 ''In every organization there are a relatively small number of really critical people,'' Mr. Pozen said. ''You have to start with that premise, and I made a big difference.''
 Mr. Weill makes a similar point. Escorting a visitor down his hall of tributes, he lingers at framed charts with multicolored lines tracking Citigroup's stock price. Two of the lines compare the price in the five years of Mr. Weill's active management with that of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway during the same period. Citigroup went up at six times the pace of Berkshire. 
 ''I think that the results our company had, which is where the great majority of my wealth came from, justified what I got,'' Mr. Weill said. 
 New Technologies
 Others among the very rich argue that their wealth helps them develop new technologies that benefit society. Steve Perlman, a Silicon Valley innovator, uses his fortune from breakthrough inventions to help finance his next attempt at a new technology so far out, he says, that even venture capitalists approach with caution. He and his partners, co-founders of WebTV Networks, which developed a way to surf the Web using a television set, sold that still profitable system to Microsoft in 1997 for $503 million.
 Mr. Perlman's share went into the next venture, he says, and the next. One of his goals with his latest enterprise, a private company called Rearden L.L.C., is to develop over several years a technology that will make film animation seem like real-life movies. ''There was no one who would invest,'' Mr. Perlman said. So he used his own money. 
 In an earlier era, big corporations and government were the major sources of money for cutting-edge research with an uncertain outcome. Bell Labs in New Jersey was one of those research centers, and Mr. Perlman, now a 46-year-old computer engineer with 71 patents to his name, said that, in an earlier era, he could easily have gone to Bell as a salaried inventor.
 In the 1950s, for example, he might have been on the team that built the first transistor, a famous Bell Labs breakthrough. Instead, after graduating from Columbia University, he went to Apple in Silicon Valley, then to Microsoft and finally out on his own. 
 ''I would have been happy as a clam to participate in the development of the transistor,'' Mr. Perlman said. ''The path I took was the path that was necessary to do what I was doing.''
 Carnegie's Philanthropy
 In contrast to many of his peers in corporate America, Mr. Sinegal, 70, the Costco chief executive, argues that the nation's business leaders would exercise their ''unique skills'' just as vigorously for ''$10 million instead of $200 million, if that were the standard.''
 As a co-founder of Costco, which now has 132,000 employees, Mr. Sinegal still holds $150 million in company stock. He is certainly wealthy. But he distinguishes between a founder's wealth and the current practice of paying a chief executive's salary in stock options that balloon into enormous amounts. His own salary as chief executive was $349,000 last year, incredibly modest by current standards.
 ''I think that most of the people running companies today are motivated and pay is a small portion of the motivation,'' Mr. Sinegal said. So why so much pressure for ever higher pay?
 ''Because everyone else is getting it,'' he said. ''It is as simple as that. If somehow a proclamation were made that C.E.O.'s could only make a maximum of $300,000 a year, you would not have any shortage of very qualified men and women seeking the jobs.''
 Looking back, none of the nation's legendary tycoons was more aware of his good luck than Andrew Carnegie. 
 ''Carnegie made it abundantly clear that the centerpiece of his gospel of wealth philosophy was that individuals do not create wealth by themselves,'' said David Nasaw, a historian at City University of New York and the author of ''Andrew Carnegie'' (Penguin Press). ''The creator of wealth in his view was the community, and individuals like himself were trustees of that wealth.''
 Repaying the community did not mean for Carnegie raising the wages of his steelworkers. Quite the contrary, he sometimes cut wages and, in doing so, presided over violent antiunion actions. 
 Carnegie did not concern himself with income inequality. His whole focus was philanthropy. He favored a confiscatory estate tax for those who failed to arrange to return, before their deaths, the fortunes the community had made possible. And today dozens of libraries, cultural centers, museums and foundations bear Carnegie's name.
 ''Confiscatory'' does not appear in Mr. Weill's public comments on the estate tax, or in those of Mr. Gates. They note that the estate tax, now being phased out at the urging of President Bush, will return in full in 2010, unless Congress acts otherwise. 
 They publicly favor retaining an estate tax but focus their attention on philanthropy. 
 Mr. Weill ticks off a list of gifts that he and his wife, Joan, have made. Some bear their names, and will for years to come. With each bequest, one or the other joins the board. Appropriately, Carnegie Hall has been a big beneficiary, and Mr. Weill as chairman was honored at a huge fund-raising party that Carnegie Hall gave on his 70th birthday. 
 The Weills -- matching what everyone else pledged -- gave $30 million to enhance the concert hall that Andrew Carnegie built in 1890 in pursuit of returning his fortune to the community, establishing a standard that today's tycoons embrace.
 ''We have that in common,'' Mr. Weill said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 21, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about a new era of wealthy and powerful men misidentified the cable television network that the entrepreneur Leo J. Hindery Jr. assembled and sold in 1999 for $200 million. It was InterMedia Partners, not the YES Network. (He was a founder in 2001 of the YES Network, which has not been sold.)
A front-page article on Sunday about a new era of wealthy and powerful men incorrectly described the management role of Robert C. Pozen at Fidelity Investments, and referred incorrectly to his pay. Mr. Pozen oversaw the entire investment department at Fidelity; he did not manage any funds, including one that made a profit of $1 billion one year. The manager of that fund, not Mr. Pozen, was paid $15 million. Also, the article misinterpreted comments by Mr. Pozen about managing a company. Mr. Pozen was referring to the manager of the portfolio that made $1 billion -- not to himself -- when he said, ''In every organization there are a relatively small number of really critical people.''

 BODY:
Palestinians never used to do these things to one another. Putting bullets in the back of the heads of men on their knees. Shooting up hospitals. Killing patients. Knee-capping doctors. Executing clerics. Throwing handcuffed prisoners to their deaths from Gaza's highest (and most expensive) apartment buildings. There is a madness in Gaza now. Hamas -- a religious political-military organization that dominated the last Palestinian elections -- claimed it was fighting infidels, with a holy sanction to kill. Fatah -- the largest group in the Palestine Liberation Organization -- was nearly as brutal as Hamas and claimed it was fighting the Nazis. Poor young men from the squalid, stinking refugee camps of Gaza, their heads filled with religious slogans and revolutionary cant, took off their knitted black masks to pose in front of the gilded bathrooms of the once-powerful and rich men of Fatah. Then they stole the sinks, toilets, tiles and pipes, leaving the wiring and the metal scraps for the ordinary, unarmed poor. 
 Gaza today is so far from the hopes of people like James Wolfensohn -- the former World Bank president who tried to coordinate economic redevelopment in the 140-square-mile territory between Israel and Egypt after the Israelis withdrew nearly two years ago -- as to seem like the other side of the earth. Rather than a model for a future Palestinian state, Gaza looks like Somalia: broken and ravenous. The civil war that Palestinians insisted could never happen just has, a civil war abetted by Israel and the United States in the name of antiterrorism and stability -- another policy that has failed, at least here, where a burning smell still fills the nostrils and where a masked Hamas gunman with an AK-47 recently sat at the abandoned desk of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, lifted up the phone and said: ''Hello, Condoleezza Rice? You have me to deal with now.'' But the military victory of Hamas may also bring a welcome measure of quiet and security to the 1.5 million people of Gaza, nearly 70 percent of them refugees, who have been living a nightmare of criminal gangs, street-corner vendettas, clan warfare, absent police, corrupt officials, religious incitement and unremitting poverty.
 Khaled Abu Hilal, a thin, grizzled chain-smoker who sucks in tobacco smoke the way an emphysema patient sucks in oxygen, is at the center of the revolution. He is a hated figure among many in the secular, nationalist Fatah; they think he is a heretic who helped set off the Gaza implosion. But his journey is Gaza's journey, from Fatah fighter and Israeli prisoner to disgusted ex-Fatah man, now associated with Hamas. His anger with Mahmoud Abbas -- Yasir Arafat's successor as chairman of the P.L.O. and now president of the Palestinian Authority -- and with what he considers the endless, futile and demeaning effort of a corrupt Fatah to please the Israelis, is shared among an increasing number of Palestinians.
 Standing early last month amid the Israeli-bombed ruins of the buildings of the Executive Force, which he helped Hamas build as a parallel police and protection force, Hilal, now 39, was quietly triumphant. He had been serving as a close aide to, and spokesman for, the tough Hamas interior minister, Said Siam, who left office in opposition to the national-unity government with Fatah. Both he and Siam were central to the campaign by the Executive Force and by Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, that pulled Fatah down in six days in early June. ''I feel proud, no question,'' he said as aides urgently shoved cellphones into his hand. ''I feel I did my national duty, and that makes me very comfortable, psychologically speaking.'' Two weeks later, at a packed and sweaty rally in Gaza City, Hilal announced that he would lead a new Fatah movement and military force in Gaza, allied with Hamas, called Fatah al-Yasir/Higher Military Command, named after Yasir Arafat.
 ''This is pure Fatah, Fatah before Oslo,'' Hilal shouted hoarsely, referring to the 1993 peace accords with Israel that created the Palestinian Authority. Hilal sees Oslo as a betrayal of the Palestinian struggle for real statehood, and he called his new movement ''a true Palestinian national liberation movement.'' Surrounded by large, bearded gunmen in black uniforms, Hilal wore a loose, untucked shirt and looked as tiny as Arafat. ''The good and honorable people of the Fatah movement have rejected the collaborators!'' he shouted. At the end, he was mobbed by hundreds of young men, both acolytes and job seekers.
 Whether or not he succeeds with the new movement, Hilal (if he lives) presents the first major internal challenge to the Fatah establishment, represented by Abbas, calling Fatah back to its roots as a resistance movement of revolutionary fighters. Establishment Fatah has excommunicated Hilal, and some would surely like to see him dead. But if Palestine is now divided between the West Bank and Gaza, Fatah in Gaza is divided, too.
 In a conversation after the Hamas victory, Hilal, speaking through an interpreter, said he felt ''bitterness about the spilling of Palestinian blood,'' but the spilling of blood for the cause of Palestinian independence and dignity, as he sees it, is an inevitable, even necessary sacrifice. At least 160 Palestinians, most of them Fatah, died in that week of war last month, including 45 civilians, and some 800 were wounded, according to the Mezan Center for Human Rights in Gaza. Another 50 were killed in an earlier round of fighting, in May. No matter what happens now, Hilal said, ''it will not be worse than the previous period of chaos, nothing worse can come. And maybe now we have the chance to move very seriously to encourage the local economy, small business, agriculture. The most important thing is that we have got rid of the mafia that exists in the security apparatuses and that paralyzed our daily life.''
 By ''mafia'' he means Fatah -- or at least the leadership of Fatah that he believes betrayed its duty to its own people. For Hilal, the recent battle was for the purity of Fatah, which he maintains he represents against what he calls ''the polluted stream'' of Fatah, ''the diverted ones,'' who betrayed Palestinian aspirations for independence at Oslo and became entranced by Israeli and American approval and gold. The major mistake of Arafat and Fatah was to accept the Oslo accords, Hilal says, and those who opposed the accords then -- Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- were correct. ''I am pro-peace and anti-Oslo,'' Hilal told me. ''Oslo is a project for treason, not for peace.''
 The Palestinian Authority, an outgrowth of the accords, was not a government, in Hilal's view, but a welfare agency that has served Israeli interests. By keeping Palestinians focused on getting their monthly checks, it has enslaved them and prolonged the Israeli occupation of Palestine, instead of enabling Palestinians to build a real economy and nation. ''Negotiations have become a good in themselves after Oslo, and that's a complete failure,'' he said. ''The Palestinians only talk, and the Israelis are happy. They can negotiate forever and seduce these collaborators with money, V.I.P. treatment, exit visas, cars, businesses and monopolies. 
 ''It's a form of control, of colonialism,'' Hilal went on. ''When the Palestinian Authority employs 180,000 people, you drive them away from the real issue, you hold them by their neck and you make them dependent on the system. If you agree with Oslo, you get benefits and jobs. For those who resist, nothing; the price is sometimes to be killed.'' There is no real economy in the Palestinian territories, he said, noting that the authority has to rely on foreign aid even to pay its swollen wage bill for employees who do little work. ''Instead of decent jobs, we have these colonial handouts, and the corrupted ones take their cut of everything,'' he said. He paused a moment, then added, ''You can control an animal by feeding it, but a human being will start to think.''
 Born in southern Gaza a year after the 1967 war, Hilal came of age in the refugee camps of Khan Yunis. His family fled from Bashit, a village in what is now central Israel, during the 1948 war. The village was destroyed, he notes coldly, replaced by what he calls ''the Jewish settlements'' of Benaya and Aseret.
 He grew up under Israeli occupation in the twisting, fetid alleys of Khan Yunis, only a few yards from the home of Muhammad Dahlan. Dahlan, seven years older than Hilal, would become Fatah's security chief in Gaza. Hilal once worked for him, then came to despise him. 
 Hilal was radicalized early. ''I was no observer,'' he says now. ''I was arrested two days before I turned 16, because I threw a hand-made bomb toward an Israeli military jeep in Khan Yunis.'' He spent the next 11 years, from 1984 to 1995, in six different Israeli prisons, from the most secure, in Ashkelon, to the most difficult, in the Negev tent prison of Ketziot, which was shut down for a time after international protests. ''I paid the price,'' Hilal says flatly. ''Many like me paid the price. Though our economic situation then was better than in any Arab country, we cared more about fighting the occupation than about bread or school. The occupation arrested us to put an end to all these emotions in us. But it backfired. ''
 Like Maxim Gorky, he said that ''prison was my university,'' and then he laughed. A year in Israeli prison, he says, ''is like 10 years outside in terms of educational consciousness and commitment to your country, transferring it to a faith inside yourself. That's the most powerful incentive, to sacrifice for your country with consciousness. It's not about passion.'' Every Palestinian entering prison chose a faction; he chose Fatah, he says, because of Arafat. Most prisoners belonged to Fatah, and they met three times a day, for 90 minutes a session, to learn about the history of Palestine, the Arab world and the Fatah program. They also studied what Hilal calls ''political science and military science.'' They studied languages; he chose to learn Hebrew, which he speaks and reads easily. 
 After the Oslo accords, which brought Arafat and the P.L.O. back from exile in Tunis, thousands of Palestinian prisoners were released, but not Hilal. ''I opposed Oslo from the beginning,'' he says. ''I was the representative of all the factions in Ketziot then, and the Israelis knew I opposed Oslo. Not because I oppose peace, but because I didn't trust the Israelis and military occupation.''
 Fatah split bitterly over Oslo, with Farouk Kaddoumi, Arafat's No. 2 in the faction, remaining in exile. When Hilal was finally released in 1995, Arafat persuaded him to ''give Oslo a try'' and work in the Palestinian Authority. He served in the presidential-security detail from 1996 until 2002, the second year of the second intifada. He then became a leader of Fatah's Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades -- set up by Arafat to compete with Hamas's military wing, and using many of the same tactics, including killing Israeli civilians -- and was a close aide to Samir al-Masharawi, who was Muhammad Dahlan's right-hand man.
 Then, following Hamas's victory in January 2006, Hilal left Fatah, soon becoming spokesman for the minister of the interior in the new Hamas government. Why? ''I discovered there were traitors in conspiracy against our Palestinian cause,'' Hilal told me. ''Even Arafat understood by 2002 that Israel and America were looking for collaborators, not partners for peace.'' For Hilal, the symbol of the rot in Fatah was the dapper Dahlan, the boy who grew up near him in Khan Yunis and who became a favorite of the Israelis and the Americans. ''Dahlan is an American employee,'' Hilal said. ''I heard Arafat say that myself.''
 Ahmed Hillis, a critic of Dahlan who nonetheless remained in Gaza as a leader of Fatah after last month's fighting, dismisses Hilal's claim to hold true to the ideals of the organization. ''He's Hamas now,'' Hillis says. ''He was kicked out of Fatah a long time ago.''
 Ziad Abu Ein, a Fatah leader in Ramallah, knew Hilal in Ashkelon prison and respected him. He says he believes that Hilal left Fatah over a difference about money and sponsorship. ''For the sake of dollars he left the official channels and went to Hamas seeking funding,'' Ein said. ''He doesn't represent Fatah anymore; he was fired when he joined the Hamas government. Fatah doesn't need mercenaries. He sold himself to Hamas, even though he claims he is Fatah.''
 Hilal scoffs at the charge. And in fact he seems sincere in his anger with Fatah and in his belief that those who supported Oslo and negotiations with Israel, led by Abbas, have lost their way and lost touch with the real life of Gaza's people.
 Hamas won the January 2006 elections for many reasons, but prime among them was a general disgust that had built among Palestinians, and among many members of Fatah like Hilal, at the corruption of Fatah's men at the top. They may have begun as revolutionaries, but they ended up as padded bureaucrats, benefiting from the privileges that their supposed adversary, Israel, was eager to provide them. One Israeli negotiator in the days of Camp David, Gidi Grinstein, recently described how Fatah's leaders would travel only first class, with junior staff traveling in business. Only Israeli cabinet ministers could travel business class, Grinstein noted. ''We used to joke that they were the 'full-belly revolutionaries,' '' he said. ''Dahlan was a kid from a refugee camp who lived in a palace.''
 Dahlan, who has always denied corruption charges, used to control monopolies on oil supplies into Gaza and on exit permits. Fatah took a big cut of the import and export business at the Karni crossing on the Israeli border. But there was also Ahmed Qurei, the former prime minister known as Abu Ala, who was famous for his factory in Abu Dis, which was widely reported to supply cement for the building of some Israeli settlements and even for the separation wall. 
 Fatah lost touch not only with the grass roots but also with its soul, and when it largely traded armed resistance against Israel for negotiations that failed to produce either peace or a better life for Palestinians, it seemed to lose a certain amount of self-respect. When Arafat died, it lost its defining symbol, the one charismatic man who combined the idea of war and politics in his tiny, uniformed self, his kaffiyeh carefully tied in the shape of British Mandate Palestine, and who could gather together the many strands of Palestinian politics.
 Even the gunmen of Fatah's Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades began to lose faith in their leaders, especially in Abbas. He had trouble paying them, but more important, his sincere, open and brave commitment to nonviolence seemed to them a surrender to Israeli occupation.
 Hamas, working to Islamicize Palestinians and recruit them, combined religious fervor, well-financed charitable and social work and an effective strategy of military confrontation and terrorism. It is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, and both try to disrupt its financing through charitable contributions and bank transfers. Its choice to enter electoral politics was much discussed inside the movement and presented a profound change. It also meant that Fatah had a competitor for the first time, and one as well-financed as itself.
 Hamas has a religious foundation, but it is also an intensely nationalist movement, with Palestine as its focus. Hamas continues to refuse to recognize the existence of Israel. But it has none of the grand ambitions of Osama Bin Laden or Al Qaeda to drive the ''U.S. crusaders'' out of the Middle East, nor does it aim at Americans; instead, Hamas sees Washington as a reality and wants the Americans to push Israel to leave lands it occupied after the 1967 war, although Hamas refuses to endorse a permanent two-state solution. Hamas is secretive and severe but also, in its way, pragmatic. (For example, it stopped carrying out suicide bombings inside pre-1967 Israel as of September 2004, judging them to be counterproductive.)
 It was Muhammad Dahlan who organized the Gaza crackdown on Hamas in 1996, when on Arafat's orders, Hamas men were arrested and their beards shaved. Many were taken to the headquarters of the Preventive Security, which Dahlan headed, where, it was reported at the time, they were tortured. Sometimes, according to Hamas officials, men were made to sit on bottles and thus sodomize themselves. Ten years later, during one postelection round of fighting between Hamas and Fatah, men of the Preventive Security marched through the streets, chanting a slogan referencing that time, with particular messages for Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister, and Mahmoud Zahar, then the Hamas foreign minister. ''Zahar!'' they chanted. ''Tell Haniya! The time of the bottle is returning!''
 When Hamas took over Gaza, its fighters wept as they raised their green flag over the Preventive Security building, then turned to Mecca and prayed. Then they looted the building and Dahlan's luxurious villa. Dahlan, who was in Cairo, did not return to Gaza but fled to the West Bank.
 The fight between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza has been brutal ever since last year's elections brought Hamas to power. Fatah refused Hamas's invitation to join in a coalition government. And, together with the security forces it had controlled since the Palestinian Authority was established after the 1993 Oslo accords, Fatah simply refused to recognize the legitimacy of Hamas, elected or not. 
 Even more, there were organized campaigns of crime and disruption from Fatah-run security forces, intended to make Hamas's government untenable. Many Palestinians spoke of recognizing Fatah men as they hijacked cars or forced their way to the head of lines in hospitals and ministries. One family I met spoke of Fatah officers, called to stop a riot in Khan Yunis over a new delivery of cooking gas, forcing their way to the front of the line and taking the remaining gas canisters for themselves. Then there were the criminal gangs that, as Hilal put it, ''hid under the umbrella of resistance and invented a slogan and bought the T-shirt and pretended to belong to the Brigades of Whatever.''
 Hilal, like the leaders of Hamas, says that Fatah security forces deliberately set out to undermine the new Hamas government. But in any case, the Fatah-dominated police were doing little to enforce the law or to confront armed gangs, some of whom also contained policemen. Nor were the courts in Gaza providing any form of justice, meaning Gazans who wanted retribution or protection found their own armed men, usually from their own clan, or hamulla. 
 To defend Hamas and to try to provide security on the streets, in April 2006, the Palestinian Authority's new interior minister, Hamas's Said Siam, created the Executive Force, the parallel police force of volunteers, which President Abbas soon banned. No one in Gaza paid any attention to the ban. Hilal went to work for Siam and Hamas, agreeing with their attempt to bring security to Gazans, as Hamas had promised during its campaign. Hilal brought with him, he told me, 1,000 members of the Fatah-affiliated Aksa and Abu Rish Brigades, as well as representatives from other factional militias who were committed to fighting Israel, like the Popular Resistance Committees, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. (The Israeli security agency, Shin Bet, confirmed this information to me.) 
 ''We can do more to provide security with 3,500 volunteers than the Palestinian security forces with their 70,000,'' Hilal said at the time, in one of a series of conversations we've had since Hamas took over. ''We hold the gun out of faith and commitment to the national project, not for a salary. The main reason for the chaos is not the society, but the paralysis, weakness and corruption of the Palestinian Authority and its security forces, who just incite and do not do their jobs.''
 Hilal, who lives modestly with his wife and five children in the center of Gaza, is revered by many in the Executive Force, who regard him as clean, committed and logical. Akhaim al-Khalidi is one of them, a 23-year-old Fatah member from a Fatah family. He joined the Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades in 2001 to fight the Israeli occupation, he told me recently. ''But instead, many of them became corrupted, trying to find money,'' he said, especially as Arafat was being squeezed by Washington and Israel to stop paying so many gunmen. ''Abu Hilal is an honorable man, and he is doing important work.'' Another Gazan fighter who supports Hilal, Muhammad Saqqa, is also Fatah but told me he admires Hamas. ''Though we in Fatah were the fathers, I feel jealous of Hamas and their inspiration,'' he said. ''They respect the young and the old, they're very secretive and disciplined, unlike Fatah. Don't consider them a stupid terrorist group. They're educated, organized, and they were elected. They distinguish between military and political and social work, and they are very honest with themselves.''
 Saqqa said that his father and one brother worked for Abbas's Presidential Guard; another brother worked for Fatah General Intelligence. But another brother joined Hamas's military, the Qassam Brigades, while Saqqa himself joined the Executive Force. ''My family criticizes me for dealing with Hamas, but Hamas are our brothers,'' he said, adding later, ''Abu Hilal knows Fatah very well and understands its shortcomings.''
 By the time the fighting in Gaza began last month, the Executive Force had grown to nearly 6,000 well-trained men and had been made a part of the Palestinian Authority's security forces, and they were being paid. The Shin Bet says the force shared a military headquarters with the Qassam Brigades, and while retaliating for rocket fire into Israel, Israeli forces aimed at and destroyed nearly every facility of the Executive Force. Shin Bet officials refused to discuss Hilal, despite his prominence and his years in Israeli prisons, but Israel clearly regards him as a danger. On May 17, an Israeli missile was fired at the bodyguards around Hilal's house. One of them, Talat Abed Haniya, 30, was killed, and four others were wounded.
 Israel is now confronted with an excruciating if not quite existential dilemma. There is a hostile entity on its southern border, run by an armed group that is committed to fighting Israel and is opposed to its existence. Gaza has become comparable to southern Lebanon, which is run by Hezbollah. Israel let Hezbollah grow, feeling restrained by an international border and its own nightmares about its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Many in Israel consider that policy of restraint to have been a considerable mistake. Should Israel now let a Gazan Hamastan grow, or try to take it out, hoping that Fatah can restore some semblance of authority there? Even before last month's rout of Fatah, there was already pressure from the Israeli Southern Command for a major incursion into Gaza to try to whack back growing Hamas power -- ''to cut the grass,'' as the Israeli military chief of staff, Dan Halutz, told me when he was still in office.
 The problem of Gaza will be the first to confront Ehud Barak, the new Israeli defense minister. Barak, who as prime minister tried and failed, with Bill Clinton, to cut the clotted mess with the Palestinians in one go, is also the most decorated soldier in Israel's history. A former army commando, Barak is likely to favor operations neater than massed-armor invasions of crowded refugee camps. But ambitious to be prime minister again, he is also unlikely to sit on his hands.
 Hamas is likely to try to ensure that it gives Israel no provocation for such an incursion, needing the time to try to consolidate daily life in Gaza, which means working functionally with Israel on imports of fuel oil, electricity, milk, drugs and most everything else. Fighting Israel now will do nothing for Hamas or for Gazans who want Hamas to deliver on its promise of ''change and reform,'' the slogan under which it won power.
 Hilal says that he still believes, like Abbas and unlike Hamas, in a negotiated two-state solution. ''But more and more,'' he explained, ''Palestinians understand that a real peace is built on struggle, and it is made between enemies, not friends. The government that is an enemy to Israel but chosen by the people is the one able to make peace.''
 As you move around Gaza, along with the poverty and shoddy construction of everything except public buildings, a few lavish apartment houses and the mosques, what strikes you hardest is the increasing religious conservatism. Most of the people in the streets are men, and the women you see are almost invariably covered -- not just with a head scarf that surrounds the face and hides the hair, but with long, heavy dresses, usually black, that fall to the ankles. You notice the radical fervor of the martyr posters and the fierceness of the gunmen, but perhaps the biggest shock is how young everyone is. According to official figures from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 49 percent of the population of Gaza is 14 or younger; 60 percent are 19 or younger. Nearly 76 percent are under 30. So there is a lot of testosterone, not much sexual mingling and very few jobs.
 For Hilal, this pressure cooker of youth, anger and lack of opportunity is necessary for the revolution in consciousness he maintains is happening. According to the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, 58 percent of those under 30 expect a more violent struggle with Israel over the next 5 to 10 years, and only 22 percent say that there will be a peaceful negotiated solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Forty-eight percent say they believe such an agreement is impossible; 20 percent more say that it will come only ''in a few generations.''
 Nasreen al-Howh is a 26-year-old psychiatric social worker in Gaza, and she says that the constituency for peace is shrinking, especially among the young. ''I'm very worried about this generation,'' she said recently, pulling at her white head covering. ''They are very pessimistic and very vulnerable to appeals for mastery, for meaning.'' What they want, she says, is a sense that they can control their lives, and that their lives will have meaning. So they are susceptible to appeals from religious groups and armed groups that claim to be fighting Israel. She conceded that she, too, cannot imagine a final peace with Israel or a two-state solution. ''The resistance camp is crowding out the peace camp,'' she told me. ''So long as there's no peace, there's resistance.''
 Under pressure and without work, many young men ''will try to avoid all that responsibility and go to the tanzim,'' she went on to say, referring to the militias. ''The tanzim also gives them self-confidence; it alleviates the fear inside of them.'' Mkhaimer Abusada, who teaches at Al Azhar University, told me: ''They can get $100 working for the tanzim. They've lost perspective. They've lost the belief in peace. And they've lost faith in education -- in their future here.''
 It's not hard to find young people at loose ends, jobless and bored, admiring of the gunmen, ready to be inspired or recruited or manipulated or brainwashed into fighting for -- or against -- something larger than their own lives. Some want a job, but many believe that their only honorable future is in ''struggle'' or ''resistance'' against an Israel that they, like Hilal, believe does not keep its promises and is insincere about its willingness to leave Palestinian lands in return for peace.
 Fadel Bsiso, a skinny and jobless teenager, sat with two friends in the smoky A-Shiraa coffee shop in Gaza City not long ago, nursing a single coffee and sharing a water-pipe. (Each pipe costs $1.20 to rent with one bowl of tobacco.) His father ''confronted the Israelis many times in the first intifada,'' he said proudly. 
 And Bsiso himself? ''I've just got into one military faction,'' he said. Why join? ''I feel I'm looking for protection,'' he said. ''This is how I find it.'' Protection from whom? He looked stunned. ''From Israel,'' he said. ''It's a war, an endless war with them, mentioned even in the Koran. Our religion does not allow us to live with them.''
 But his father is Fatah, which recognizes a two-state solution, right? Bsiso shrugged: ''The Jews are imposed on us. They have no roots here. They came and took our land and built a state, but we don't accept it.''
 One of the friends, Sakher Hillis, who is 19, broke in. ''They chose a weak country, but they were surprised to find out we're strong,'' he said. 
 Bsiso said his father wants him to be a teacher. ''But then he jokes and says, 'Even if you go as a martyr, I have seven others.' '' 
 Hillis's own father is in Hamas. ''I'm very pessimistic,'' he said. ''But I feel I can give my life to the cause. I'm very bored with this life, honestly. This life has no meaning for me. If I can find a goal and achieve it, I can be optimistic. But this depression is inside of us.''
 Is religion part of the answer? ''Religion plays a role because it encourages struggle,'' Hillis said. ''It says fight in the name of God. I'm not extreme, I promise you -- this is normal.''
 The Palestinian poet Ahmed Dahbour is troubled by the turn to Hamas and religious and political extremism and has tried to understand it as an expression of frustration, especially generational frustration. Dahbour was 2 when his family fled Haifa into exile in 1948. ''I'm the generation of the nakba,'' he told me recently -- the ''catastrophe,'' as Palestinians refer to the establishment of Israel and their own flight or expulsion. ''We fled with nothing, and my mother used to create for me an imaginary city, a paradise called 'Haifa.' The enemy was an idea. But this generation is different. This generation saw the Israeli soldier, and it is full of bitterness and envy.''
 He emphasized the patriarchal nature of Palestinian society, and the deep humiliation suffered by a father who cannot protect his family from invasion, incursion, poverty, unemployment and fear. ''The fathers feel shame, but so do the sons,'' Dahbour said. ''The sons become martyrs, not the fathers.''
 Then he added, ''The revolution of the sons is to protect the dignity of the fathers.''
 ''This suffering and these deaths are the tax imposed on us by the occupation,'' Hilal told me. ''We suffer and burn, but what causes revolution? Poverty, injustice and anger -- this is what leads to revolution, even in free countries. This is what gives us fuel to resist the occupation and create a revolution in our thinking.''
 Two phenomena are merging, he went on to say: ''personal revenge and the national project.'' Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank, he's convinced, are stoking a third intifada, ''more bloody and violent.'' Hilal is stoking it too, in his own way. The young generation now, with all its anger and hopelessness, is a necessary part of the victory Hilal is sure will come -- when Israel, he believes, will come to terms with Palestinian nationalism and negotiate a future with an enemy it has been forced to respect.
 ''I think this generation will be the liberation generation,'' he said. ''If in the past, 1 percent of the people went into resistance, from this generation, 20 percent or more will do it. This generation will be the one most ready to resist. This generation will be our liberation army.''

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin, angered by American plans to deploy a missile shield in Eastern Europe, formally notified NATO governments on Saturday that Russia will suspend its obligations under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, a key cold war-era arms limitation agreement. 
 The decision ratcheted up tensions over the missile shield plan, but also reflected a trend of rising anti-Americanism and deep suspicion toward the West here as Russia's March presidential elections approach. 
 Russia's suspension will take effect in 150 days, according to a copy of the president's decree posted on a Kremlin Web site. That delay leaves open the possibility of further negotiation on the 1990 treaty, which resulted in a huge wave of disarmament along the former East-West divide in Europe. 
 Despite a Foreign Ministry statement that Russia would reject any limitations on redeploying heavy weaponry on its Western border, the Kremlin's move is not expected to radically transform the security situation. 
 But the decision is a strong indicator that the smiles and warm embraces between Presidents Bush and Putin just a few weekends ago at the so-called lobster summit in Maine did little to soften the Kremlin's pique over proposals to build two American missile defense bases in former Soviet satellite states, Poland and the Czech Republic.
 So on Saturday, Mr. Putin reached for a powerful diplomatic tool to fend off what he has described as American bullying and NATO and European encirclement, both economic and military, that the Kremlin believes encroaches into a Russian sphere of influence. White House officials expressed immediate disappointment after the announcement from Moscow, but pledged to continue to meet with their Russian counterparts to resolve the dispute.
 ''We're disappointed Russia has suspended its participation for now, but we'll continue to have discussions with them in the coming months on the best way to proceed in this area, that is in the interest of all parties involved and provides for security in Europe,'' said Gordon D. Johndroe, the National Security Council spokesman.
 Critics of the United States' handling of relations with Russia have warned that the Bush administration was creating an environment in which the Putin government, emboldened by a flood of oil dollars and seeking to re-establish its status in the world, could pick and choose among its treaty obligations. After all, the Bush administration has put less stock in official treaty relations than many predecessors. Under Mr. Bush, the United States pulled out of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty so it could pursue the goal of a global antimissile shield, the exact effort that has so angered Mr. Putin and his inner circle.
 Indeed, the Saturday announcement from Moscow was not much of a surprise, given Mr. Putin's earlier warnings. Bush administration officials routinely point to other significant areas of cooperation -- on halting nuclear proliferation, on battling terrorism and combating drug traffic -- so White House officials reject assessments that relations with Russia are on the point of rupturing.
 But while the Saturday announcement was, at least, unsettling to officials in Washington and in NATO capitals, senior policy analysts said it is likely only to strengthen the position of Mr. Putin's leadership clique among Russian voters in the spring elections. Anti-American posturing has played well with the public, and it is encouraged in the state news media and through such means as leaflets distributed by Kremlin-sponsored youth groups. One depicts American warplanes loading body bags at a Moscow airport, for example.
 Mr. Putin's decree explained the decision to indefinitely suspend Russia's treaty obligations as caused by ''extraordinary circumstances'' that ''affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures.'' 
 A separate statement by the Foreign Ministry identified these circumstances as unrelated to the missile shield plans -- though Mr. Putin has linked the issues in previous speeches. In the most notable case, during a state of the nation speech to Parliament on April 26, Mr. Putin threatened to suspend observance of the treaty in response to the United States' abrogation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and plans to deploy missile-shield elements in the Czech Republic and Poland.
 Still, Mr. Putin's threat in April, and his execution of it on Saturday, left some arms-control experts scratching their heads because the conventional forces treaty has no formal provision for a signatory nation to suspend observance. A nation can withdraw from the treaty without violating its terms, but only after notifying the other signatory countries 150 days in advance. 
 The decree Mr. Putin signed on Saturday adhered to that time frame, but sought to apply it to suspension instead of withdrawal. The foreign ministry said this formulation complied with ''international law.'' 
 The Kremlin on Saturday offered six reasons for suspending the treaty, many of which reflected a deep bitterness in Moscow about what is perceived here as a string of broken promises as NATO expanded into the former Warsaw Pact countries after the fall of communism.
 They included a claim that NATO expansion into Eastern Europe had beefed up the alliance's military capabilities in violation of the treaty, a charge that NATO denied. 
 The statement said the new NATO member nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are not signatories of the treaty but have alliance weapons deployed on their territories. Russia maintains that NATO committed in 1999 to refrain from opening bases in new member countries, though now the United States is building facilities in Romania and Bulgaria. NATO says those are training sites.
 Also, the statement noted that NATO governments have not ratified the 1999 amendments to the treaty, which Russia ratified in 2004. Western governments say they will not ratify them until Russia withdraws troops from the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Moldova.
 In a statement, NATO said member countries would convene a task force on Monday to formulate a response. 
 ''NATO regrets this decision,'' James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said in a telephone interview. ''The allies consider this treaty an important foundation of European security. This is a disappointing move in the wrong direction.''
 He said the treaty has no provision for suspension, only withdrawal. ''Nobody is going to be splitting hairs here and requiring Russia withdraw,'' he added. He also denied that NATO's eastward expansion left the bloc in violation of the treaty. ''All of this falls into a larger Russian concern of encirclement,'' he said. 
 The European Union called the treaty suspension ''regrettable.'' Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said in a telephone interview: ''We appeal to everyone to start talking. This treaty is fundamental for the stability and security of Europe.''
 In Germany, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Russia's decision ''was a real cause of concern.'' Some members of Germany's governing coalition have repeatedly criticized the American missile shield plan, saying it could lead to just such a move by Russia.
 A statement posted by Russia's Foreign Ministry said flatly that Russia would halt inspections allowed under the treaty and claim the right to redeploy heavy weaponry along its western and southern borders, but would do soonly in response to any possible NATO redeployment. It also suggested that the suspension was Russia's first official rejection of the arms limitations treaties of the Soviet Union. 
 A deputy foreign minister, Sergei I. Kislyak, said Russia was not ''shutting the door on dialogue'' on the treaty, leaving open the possibility of a negotiated retreat from the position announced Saturday.
 However, Russian commentators with ties to the Kremlin were quick to praise the suspension. ''Today's decision is not propaganda,'' Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a Kremlin-linked political analyst, said in remarks carried by Interfax. It comes ''against the backdrop of the world's rearmament near our borders,'' he said. ''If today's message is ignored, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty will be next.''

HEADLINE: Telling Chicago How to Secure and Run the Games

BYLINE: THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Chicago Olympics organizers can turn to some big names with proven track records for advice on how to win the selection process and then run the 2016 Summer Games.
 Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, rescued the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth ran the profitable 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and is chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, and the Masters tournament chief Billy Payne helped Atlanta win the 1996 Summer Games over Athens, the Olympics' birthplace.
 Each recently talked about what Chicago should do to win its first Olympics and then how to be a successful host of the Games. Their advice was simple: Make friends on the International Olympic Committee, train many volunteers and do not do it for the money. 
 ''I hope people don't think it's a big moneymaker and a source of economic development and good for business, because that's not what the Olympics is about,'' Romney said. ''The Olympics is about an opportunity to serve the world and to welcome the world.''
 By the end, many said the Salt Lake City experience became what Romney described. But that happened only after a bribery scandal in the selection process shook the Olympic movement to its core, resulting in many of the changes Chicago must deal with in this revamped, and supposedly cleaned-up, selection process.
 And Atlanta? It was unwieldy, included a fatal bombing at Centennial Olympic Park and is largely considered the most overcommercialized Olympics in the history of the modern Games.
 Chicago is new to the Olympic selection process, and the Chicago 2016 organizing committee can learn plenty from the successes and failures the three American cities experienced.
 With United States Olympic Committee guidance, the Chicago group has already reached out to leaders of the 2012 London Olympics and the Athens and Barcelona Games, the Chicago 2016 spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. And Romney met with Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, during a campaign visit there in April.
 The road to securing the Games begins with getting to know people in the international sporting world and on the I.O.C., which Payne said was necessary for Atlanta because the Southern city was not well-known outside the United States.
 ''It occurred to us early on that coming out of the blue as we did virtually unknown that the best way that we could compete would be to secure the trust and the friendship of the respective members and hoping in the process to convince them that we would be great custodians of this wonderful gift which they give every four years,'' Payne said.
 For Chicago, which has some international recognition but is largely known for its past of gangsters and slaughterhouses, that means playing host to international competitions and having the city's representatives attend major events.
 This week, Daley and a small delegation of the city's Olympic organizers are in Brazil at the Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro -- a chief rival of Chicago for the 2016 Games -- where they will attend the opening ceremonies and watch events, Sandusky said.
 About 5,500 athletes from 42 countries are expected to attend the Olympic-style Pan Am Games, which began yesterday and run through July 29.
 For Daley, it is another chance to interact with I.O.C. members, whose contact with bid cities has been limited by Olympic rules enacted after the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. A few days before he left for Brazil, Daley said he would talk up Chicago, its history and its diversity by promoting ''how great the people are, first and foremost.''
 ''This city is a, really a secret throughout the world,'' he said.
 Ueberroth said having a high-profile mayor like Daley -- whom he described as ''shake your hand, make a promise, keep a promise'' -- was key to the city's efforts to build trust among the I.O.C. members and eventually win the 60 votes needed to get the Games.
 ''They basically will vote for the people that they trust and that they know that are going to stay the course,'' Ueberroth said.
 Other cities competing for the 2016 Games so far are Doha, Qatar; Madrid; Tokyo; and Baku, Azerbaijan. The I.O.C. will pick a host city in 2009.
 A recent misstep before the start of the Pan Am Games has Chicago organizers already trying to counter negative stereotypes about Americans.
 A U.S.O.C. worker last week scrawled the message ''Welcome to the Congo!'' on a board in the organization's Rio de Janeiro news media center. The greeting, reportedly in reference to warm temperatures, was blasted by Brazilians, who did not like having their country compared to a less-developed nation and viewed the Americans as arrogant.
 The U.S.O.C. apologized, and Sandusky said the Chicago delegation in Brazil was conscious of ''being humble and listening.''
 Another issue Olympic host city hopefuls must address is whether they have the facilities -- or enough money to build them.
 Chicago lacks some of the major facilities, including a $1 billion lakefront athletes' village and a $366 million temporary stadium. But Payne said major construction was not a big hurdle for a city like Chicago.
 ''I think that they would have confidence that the design, technological expertise that Chicago could bring to the task would be more than adequate to pull it off,'' Payne said, noting that Atlanta had to build a stadium and athletes' village, too.
 Trouble over financing for a new stadium did complicate New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, which were awarded to London.
 Ueberroth said the government, private sector and community must come together to make the Games work. In Chicago, donors have raised millions of dollars to finance the city's bid, and the government has pledged millions more in financial guarantees in case the Games falter.
 An Olympics cannot happen without thousands of volunteers, and Romney, a millionaire businessman, said they should be treated like regular employees. 
 ''We tried to change the normal American attitude of, These are the rules and we're here to enforce them. Instead it was, You were our guests; we're here to make sure you have a great time,'' said Romney, who described the Olympics as one of the great experiences in his life, adding that any city that the chance to hold the Games should be ecstatic.

HEADLINE: What Does It Take?

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai is a contributing writer. His book, ''The Argument: Billionaires, Bloggers and the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics,'' will be published next month.

 BODY:
Of all the campaign themes that will emerge leading up to the 2008 primaries, one you probably won't hear a lot about is experience. That's because the candidates who are at the moment best positioned for the nominations of their parties have surprisingly little of it. At a time when the nation looks for a leader to meet profound challenges to its decades-long dominance as an economic and military power, the five candidates who lead in state and national polls -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney -- have won a grand total of five statewide elections in their cumulative political careers and have served a combined 20 years in statewide office. (Fred Thompson, who may soon be among the leaders in the Republican field, served eight years in the Senate.) 
In fact, the executive with the longest tenure in the group is Giuliani, who would be the first mayor in history to ascend to the presidency without holding some higher office first. Meanwhile, candidates with long careers spent mastering foreign and domestic policy, like Joe Biden and John McCain, have been flailing. In a round of television ads that feel more like a cry for help than a campaign pitch, Bill Richardson -- the two-term governor of New Mexico and a former congressman, U.N. ambassador and energy secretary -- sits in a drab office somewhere (Iowa, perhaps?), enthusiastically showing off his resume while a clueless middle manager, entirely uninterested, rushes him along.
 This dynamic would seem, at least at this very early stage of the campaign, to presage a significant break with the past. Through the long decades that saw the rise and fall of American industry and the cold war, serious contenders for the presidency could generally boast of distinguished careers in statewide or federal office. Ronald Reagan served two terms as California's governor before he was finally elected president at the age of 69; George H. W. Bush had twice been vice president, following stints as a diplomat and C.I.A. director; Bill Clinton had been elected to five terms as governor of Arkansas, after serving as the state's attorney general. There have been exceptions, of course, most notably Jimmy Carter, whose paltry experience -- a single term as governor of Georgia -- seemed like the right antidote to the disillusionment of Watergate. (It wasn't.) At no time in modern history, however, have the crowded fields of both parties been so dominated by relative newcomers.
 George W. Bush's legion of critics would probably assert that he alone lowered the bar for presidential preparedness, and this theory has some merit; having served just one full term as governor of a huge state before he ran in 2000, Bush was the least experienced nominee in 24 years. But American politics can never be viewed in isolation from the rest of society, and something deeper has been happening out there. The emergence of the Internet age has been accompanied, in general, by a steady devaluing of expertise. A generation ago, you went to the doctor to find out about the pain in your knee; now you go to WebMD, diagnose it yourself and tell him what medicines you want. People used to trust stockbrokers and insurance agents; now they buy and sell at E*Trade and compare policies online. American voters who once looked to newspaper columnists for guidance on politics now blog their own idle punditry. Suddenly, experience is downright suspect -- it's the barrier that so-called professionals use to wall themselves off from everyone else. Americans now belong to what the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Andrew Keen calls ''the cult of the amateur,'' and, in this new world, the ideal president may be one who hasn't governed, or at least not for long.
 Experience, after all, hasn't proved to be much of an asset among baby-boomer politicians, whose long history waging the same ideological struggles makes them less able, not more, to transcend stalemate. Today most of the leading presidential candidates have other kinds of experience that are arguably just as relevant to the presidency as years logged in statehouses or the Capitol -- living at the White House, running the Olympics, locking up white-collar criminals. Obama, who leads the field in financial contributions, would set a new precedent for inexperience in the White House; he was a state senator only three years ago, when he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic convention, and before that he was a community organizer. But in a country where the average American is now said to change careers something like three times, it's probably unhealthful to expect our most capable leaders to spend their adult lives campaigning at state fairs and mastering Robert's Rules of Order.
 Then again, there are reasons to think that accumulated wisdom really does matter. Bush the Decider campaigned on the premise that a good president, like a C.E.O., need only be able to judge shrewdly among policy options A, B and C. But his presidency illuminates that running a White House isn't, in fact, a simple multiple-choice test; a president's advisers often disagree not only on the means of achieving their goals but also on the goals themselves, and a president has to filter out competing ideologies before he can clearly see the options laid before him. 
 Experience is what prepares presidents to stand by their convictions even when experts urge them not to, like Johnson's signing the Voting Rights Act, or Harry Truman's integrating the Armed Services. It is also what enables presidents to recognize when compromise -- even odious compromise -- is the last, best option, as Bill Clinton did on welfare reform. Lacking that kind of expertise, George W. Bush never did seem to master the balance between principle and pragmatism, the veteran politician's art of when to build bridges and when to burn them. Whoever gets the nominations next year will want to study Bush's experience closely -- if only because they may not be able to count on their own.

HEADLINE: Famous, Fired Or Both

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 AFTER John McCain discovered that his campaign was nearly broke -- at a time when he was already hemorrhaging in public opinion polls -- he did what presidential candidates in trouble always seem to do: he forced out his top consultants. 
 The unmistakable message of this bloodletting was that Mr. McCain's woes were not caused by Mr. McCain, or his opponents, or being out of sync with the times, but rather the bad work by his blue-chip stable of advisers. Terry Nelson, his campaign manager, and John Weaver, his senior adviser, walked out the door Tuesday morning, and, with a new team in charge, Mr. McCain headed for New Hampshire to try to resuscitate his campaign.
 But this shakeup raises a question that has hovered over American campaigns in the 25 years since the rise of the celebrity political consultant: Are these advisers really as important as they would like us, and their clients, to think? Have they ever been? 
 There is little doubt that consultants -- a catchall describing strategists, pollsters, ad makers, managers and media advisers -- are an integral part of defining who the candidate is and presenting the candidate's ideas to the public. This goes from critical decisions like settling on the phrase that defines a candidacy (President Bush as the ''compassionate conservative,'' for example) to whipping up a quick response to a crisis, or even determining the official color of campaign bumper stickers.
 But consultants are not the candidate. And for all the attention paid to them, they rarely, if ever, determine whether a candidate wins the election. Mr. McCain is not the first flailing presidential candidate to dump a few consultants. Bob Dole, who was running in the Republican primaries, left two of them on a airport tarmac in Jacksonville, Fla., in 1988. But the upheaval probably says more about Mr. McCain's state of mind than about his prospects of being the next president.
 ''They are totally overvalued,'' said Mark McKinnon, who was President Bush's media adviser and part of Mr. McCain's stable for a while this year. ''The problem with the John McCain campaign wasn't Terry Nelson and John Weaver. It was immigration and Iraq.''
 ''The problem with political consulting is you don't need a license or a degree,'' Mr. McKinnon added. ''Anyone can just show up with a camcorder. It is the ultimate in hackery -- for which I am perfectly suited.'' 
 Nelson Warfield, a media consultant advising Fred Thompson, a likely Republican presidential candidate, said: ''How are important are they? I think in a presidential race there are larger dynamics at work than some guy can fix by telling you how to part your hair.''Consultants have been around presidential candidates almost as long as there have been presidential candidates. But as news coverage of campaigns moved from the public stage to internal workings -- scrutiny encouraged by behind-the-scenes books like ''The Selling of the President'' by Joe McGinniss about the 1968 race -- operatives increasingly found themselves sharing a moment on the evening news with the candidate.
 The first glimmers of this era came with Patrick Caddell, the colorful South Carolinian pollster who advised Jimmy Carter in 1976. The phenomenon was established when Lee Atwater took a high-profile role in the election of George H. W. Bush in 1988. By 1992, it seemed only natural that a documentary film portrayed the deliberations of James Carville, Paul Begala and George Stephanopoulos as they helped elect Bill Clinton.
 Consultants have encouraged a culture that deifies them, happy to be the subject of prominent profiles in the pages of the Style section of The Washington Post or The New York Times Magazine. (The hot consultant this year? David Axelrod, his steady hand at the helm of Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign.) They appreciate that the adulation translates into business, not to mention book and Hollywood contracts. Political correspondents -- including yours truly -- are just as guilty: we are the enablers who eagerly grab the colorful if facile narratives provided by consultants who are often more colorful than the candidate.
 Dennis W. Johnson, a professor of political science at George Washington University and an expert on consultants, said their ascendance is, historically speaking, a relatively contemporary occurrence and, he hoped, a passing one. ''James Carville, Lee Atwater and Karl Rove come to the fore: these are people known to the general public,'' he said. ''Everyone else in the business is rightly anonymous.''
 The cast, though, is really larger than that. Dick Morris, the former consultant to the Clintons, has a newspaper column and is a fixture on cable TV shows. Bob Shrum, a senior adviser to Senator John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000, just wrote a memoir recounting his years as a consultant. Mr. Carville and his wife, Mary Matalin, the Republican consultant, are as likely to be recognized walking into a Washington restaurant as an actual former presidential candidate.
 For all the attention, the last few years have not been particularly good to political consultants. Mr. McCain's campaign imploded even though he recruited some of the best and the brightest advisers, including an infusion of talent from the White House political operation. 
 If Mr. Rove, the embodiment of the species, was responsible for elevating the consultant's status to ever new heights, he may prove responsible for its diminishment as well. Hailed as the genius behind Mr. Bush's presidential victories and the Republican gains in 2000 and 2004, Mr. Rove now carries the burden of a 2006 election that cost his party control of Congress and called into question the political theories that are his stock in trade. And his unorthodox decision, for a consultant, to play such a prominent role in the White House means that he is now integrally linked to the travails of the second-term Bush presidency.
 Mr. Shrum's book could prove an unwelcome legacy for consultants, as well, since he recounts potentially damaging details involving clients like John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat. Candidates may now think twice about how much to open up to a paid consultant whose next check might come from a publisher. 
 It has always been an oversimplification to say that consultants are the architects of success or failure. The roles are more subtle. 
 Mr. Weaver may not always have given Mr. McCain the best advice: in retrospect, reaching out to religious conservatives in a speech at Jerry Falwell's university was not the best political move of the year given Mr. McCain's history of attacking this wing of the Republican Party, a stand that strengthened his position with moderate voters. But Mr. Weaver was a calming presence to Mr. McCain on the campaign trail.
 Mr. Carville, Mr. Begala and Mr. Stephanopoulos were advisers who meshed, ideologically and stylistically, with Mr. Clinton. ''That sign, 'It's the economy, stupid,' was for Clinton -- not for the staff,'' Mr. Shrum said, referring to the advice Mr. Carville posted in the campaign's war room. 
 Mr. Begala, recalling his years on the Clinton campaign, said: ''I think that's why Clinton hired us. He wanted an extension of his own personality.''
 In 1988, Mr. Atwater ran, and became identified with, the brutal contest against Michael S. Dukakis, who was governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Atwater, more than Mr. Bush, drew criticism for that campaign, which no doubt suited both Mr. Atwater and Mr. Bush fine at the time. (''Oh, that's all history,'' Mr. Bush said of his campaign after he won.)
 And consultants serve other, less obvious roles. 
 The hiring of Mr. Carville and Mr. Begala by Mr. Clinton in 1992, and Mr. Shrum by Mr. Kerry in 2004, provided a burst of legitimacy and fund-raising for both candidates.
 Professor Johnson, for one, said he found it odd that such stock was given to consultants -- Mr. Shrum ultimately has taken more than a little of the blame for Mr. Kerry's loss -- and suggested that perhaps, finally, consultants would return to the side of the stage, where they once stood and where, he said, they belonged.
 ''We're always going to have consultants but they are going to be anonymous and that is how it should be,'' he said. ''This should be a contest between the candidates.''

HEADLINE: Just How Long Does the Average Career Last?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Baseball lore is littered with one-game wonders, from Moonlight Graham, whose brief stint in the outfield for the New York Giants in 1905 was immortalized in ''Field of Dreams,'' to Larry Yount, whose major league career amounted to warming up as the announced relief pitcher for the Houston Astros in 1971 when his elbow popped.
 Then there are baseball's Iron Men, like Pete Rose, who played in 3,562 games; Lou Gehrig, who filled in for Wally Pipp at first base and went on to play 2,130 consecutive games; Nolan Ryan, who played in 27 seasons; Eddie Collins and Rickey Henderson, who celebrated silver anniversaries; and Minnie Minoso and Nick Altrock, whose careers spanned portions of five decades. 
 But while no player would ever admit to being merely average, how long a career can the average major leaguer expect to have?
 After studying the 5,989 position players who began their careers between 1902 and 1993 and who played 33,272 years of major league baseball, three demographers have come up with an answer: On average, a rookie can expect to play major league baseball for 5.6 years.
 Their study, which is being published in the August issue of Population Research and Policy Review, also found that one in five position players would play only a single season. 
 Fewer than half of all rookies remain long enough to play a fifth year. And only about 1 percent of players last 20 seasons or more.
 Cognizant that pitchers are more prone to injuries and have volatile careers, the authors, William Witnauer of the State University of New York at Buffalo and Richard Rogers and Jarron Saint Onge of the University of Colorado, excluded them from the study. They also excluded 618 players who made their debut after Sept. 1 and played only that season.
 The authors found advantages in starting a major league career early. The probability of ending a career after one year is 10 percent for players starting at age 20, but rises to 13 percent for players who start at 21, and 36 percent for players who start at 28.
 The probability of leaving the league is 20 percent in the first year, but drops to 11 percent or greater in every subsequent year. While a rookie can expect to play 5.6 years, a player in his third season can expect to play six additional years.
 ''Whereas a normal work career typically involves a gradual ascent followed by a slow decline, baseball careers are characterized by rapid ascent followed by rapid decline, or more accurately as an inevitably short time on a very slippery slope,'' the study said. ''The explanation lies in baseball's extremely high selectivity.''
 The study said careers had been lengthened by free agency and league expansion. 
 A rookie could expect to play 4.3 years in what the authors call the Early Era, between 1902 and 1945, 6.47 years in the Golden Age (1946-68) and 6.85 years in the Modern Era. The study does not include players whose careers began later than 1993, because many are still playing.
 ''One- and two-year careers were more common in the earlier parts of the century,'' Rogers said, but gains in longevity have not been significant -- from a median of three years in the Early Era to six years in the Modern Era. 
 ''We can speculate that career length has increased because of better overall health, longer life expectancies, better sports training and medicine, better scouting and recruitment, higher salaries, higher prestige, league expansions, and fewer social and economic disruptions,'' Rogers said. 
 Moreover, the authors wrote, the length of a career can be affected by other factors, including the willingness of teams to pay for better players; a player's personal attributes, which might compensate for lackluster performance; and injuries, scandal and other personal problems. 
 Unlike most other careers, professional players ''know (but do not necessarily accept) that the role is temporary, exit is often involuntary, and the elite status conferred by the role is difficult to achieve after,'' the authors said.

HEADLINE: Officer Dies Five Days After Shooting, Parents at His Side

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS; Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, Colin Moynihan and Tony Ramirez.

 BODY:
With his parents and fellow officers from the 71st Precinct at his bedside, a 23-year-old police officer who had been on the force only a year and a half died yesterday, five days after he was shot in the face during a traffic stop in Brooklyn.
 The officer, Russel Timoshenko, died at Kings County Hospital Center at 4:14 p.m. 
 ''They did everything humanly possible to save Officer Timoshenko's life,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said at a news conference outside the hospital yesterday afternoon. ''Officer Timoshenko made the ultimate sacrifice with unflinching bravery and dedication to duty. We'll never forget him, and we're committed more than ever to see to it that those responsible for this crime are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.'' 
 Officer Timoshenko died while on life support machines that allowed him to breathe. Each of the two bullets that struck Officer Timoshenko cut across his spinal cord, just beneath his brain, doctors said, which left him unable to breathe on his own or to move his muscles. After tests determined yesterday that he had no brain activity, the doctors pronounced him dead and the respirator was turned off.
 ''He had no oxygen for 15 or 20 minutes before he got here because of the paralysis,'' said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, director of trauma and critical care at Kings County Hospital Center. ''And I think that's what determines his course. The activity in his brain ceased. And that's death in New York State.''
 As word of the officer's death spread around the law enforcement community yesterday evening, police officers drove by the Timoshenko family's modest white brick home in the Bay Terrace neighborhood of Staten Island. And about 150 others, including his partner, Officer Herman Yan, who also had been shot, filed past his bedside after he died. Many of the officers were in tears, Mr. Kelly said.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had been out of town yesterday afternoon, came back to the city and went to the hospital after Officer Timoshenko died.
 ''While I can't know the anguish they are going through, I want Russel's parents, Leonid and Tatyana, to know their son was a hero,'' the mayor said in a statement.
 The authorities said that charges against the three men arrested in the shooting would now include murder.
 Officer Timoshenko, who was born in Belarus, arrived in the United States in the early 1990s, when he was 7. He graduated from Tottenville High School in Staten Island and was a gifted and popular economics student at City College. Tall and blond, he had an easy laugh, played on the lacrosse team and liked to dance. A professor said he assumed his student would graduate, get an M.B.A. and go into business. 
 Instead, Officer Timoshenko abruptly dropped out of college to become a police officer, an act that stunned some of his classmates and professors. Those closest to him, however, said that police work had all along been one of his passions. In his short career, he made 15 arrests.
 At 2:30 a.m. Monday, Officer Timoshenko and Officer Yan, 26, were on patrol in the Prospect-Lefferts Garden section of Brooklyn. They pulled over a black BMW on Lefferts Avenue. The computer in their squad car showed that the BMW's license plate belonged on a Mitsubishi. The BMW turned out to have been stolen from a dealership on Long Island.
 Officer Timoshenko got out first. He approached the passenger side of the car, while Officer Yan, a few steps behind, approached the driver's side. Without warning, at least one of the BMW's occupants fired through a rolled-down window. Officer Timoshenko was struck twice, the impact of the bullets sending him sprawling backwards.
 Officer Yan returned fire and was struck in the arm and chest -- his life likely saved by his protective vest. He was able to call for help. Within a minute, another officer got Officer Timoshenko into his car and began speeding to the hospital, where doctors opened his airway to restore breathing.
 Doctors took a CAT scan of the officer's head, chest and abdomen and found severe damage. He was bleeding profusely from the mouth, where one of the bullets had entered, and blood had pooled in his lungs.
 Doctors gave him a tracheotomy to aid his breathing and brought him to the intensive care unit, where they noted that his brain had begun to swell.
 In the middle of last week, doctors became concerned that Officer Timoshenko was brain dead because his intracranial pressure was alarmingly high. They conferred with a colleague at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, who agreed with their fears. 
 At the request of the officer's family, a doctor in Russia was sent information about his condition.
 On Friday and again yesterday, Officer Timoshenko was given tests to determine if he had any cranial nerve function. He had none, and 14 minutes after 4 p.m., he became the third New York City police officer this year to die of gunshot wounds.
 Two auxiliary officers, Nicholas Pekearo and Eugene Marshalik, were killed in Greenwich Village on March 14 while following a man who had just shot a pizza parlor employee to death. That man, David Garvin, was later killed by the police. Last week, Officer Marshalik's parents, who also were from the former Soviet Union, visited the Timoshenkos at the hospital.
 The two men accused of shooting Officers Yan and Timoshenko, Dexter Bostic, 34, and Robert Ellis, 34, were found near Interstate 80 in northeastern Pennsylvania last week, where they had been driven by a friend after the shooting. Another man, Lee Woods, 29, who the police said was driving the BMW, was arrested in New York. 
 After Officer Timoshenko died, but before it was publicly announced, more than 30 friends, neighbors, police officers and firefighters gathered at the Russian Orthodox Church of the New Martyrs and Confessors of Russia in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, his family's church. 
 Father Pavel Ivanov had heard unofficially that the officer had died, but went forward with the ''moleben,'' or service for the sick. The knowledge clearly weighed on him: During the service, he sometimes referred to the officer in the present tense, sometimes in the past.
 ''Russel,'' said Father Ivanov, ''is in dire need of our prayers whether he stays with us or passes on.''
 At the hospital, George Kallaur, an archpriest in the Russian Orthodox Church, conducted a 10-minute service after Officer Timoshenko was pronounced dead. Twenty people crammed into the officer's hospital room while others stood in the doorway and halls. As part of Russian Orthodox tradition, Mr. Kallaur said, friends and family members kissed the officer's hands and feet.
 Mr. Kallaur said that on Friday he had brought Officer Timoshenko a large silver crucifix from Russia and placed it around the officer's neck, hoping it would help him recover. The crucifix, which has a compartment inside, contained the bones of a third-century martyr.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Kallaur performed Officer Timoshenko's absolution, called a ''dumb and blind'' confession because the officer was unable to communicate. The Russian Orthodox church believes that a dead person's soul remains present for three days near the deceased's family members. 
 ''The soul,'' said Mr. Kallaur, ''while it is still alive, can absolutely still hear.''

HEADLINE: The Cost of Saving Energy

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS have often been told that they use less energy than most Americans, partly because they live in the most densely populated city in the country.
And that's true, up to a point. 
 Sure, New Yorkers have the benefit of an extensive mass-transit system, which means lower auto emissions, but the city's residential buildings are less energy-efficient than those in many other places in the country, particularly in eco-friendly states like California and Vermont. 
 ''The main reason that New Yorkers use much less electricity is that our apartments are so much smaller'' than homes in other cities, said Rohit Aggarwala, the director of the Long-Term Planning and Sustainability Office, part of the Mayor's Office of Operations. 
 In fact, most big New York buildings, both commercial and residential, are wasting thousands of dollars a year on energy, the city says. Energy use by buildings accounts for almost 80 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions, and residential buildings for about a third of that. These gases are released in creating the energy used to heat, cool and light the buildings, as well as to run myriad household appliances and gadgets. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has created a blueprint, called PlaNYC, to control future development in the city, with a goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 30 percent, compared with 2005 levels. 
 While some reductions can be accomplished by toughening the requirements for new construction, about 85 percent of the buildings that will exist in the city in 2030 are already standing.
 And those buildings need to go on an energy diet.
 There are a number of relatively inexpensive things that residential buildings could do that would immediately lower their energy costs and that would reduce their ''carbon footprints,'' the emissions these buildings are responsible for, Mr. Aggarwala said. 
 The easiest, and cheapest, is to install energy-efficient light bulbs in all common areas. More expensive plans -- the costs of which can often be offset by loans and grants from New York State -- include replacing old inefficient boilers with more efficient modern ones and installing solar panels on the roof.
 Ashok Gupta, a senior energy economist and the director of the air and energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group in New York, said many buildings start with the least expensive measures with the biggest immediate payoff -- buying fluorescent bulbs for about $4 each, for example, or thermostatic radiator valves for about $90 each.
 But that is where a lot of buildings stop, and Mr. Gupta said he would like to see them reach a bit further, to measures whose costs could be recouped in two to five years. The next step, for example, might be installing motion sensors that would dim the lights by 50 percent when the hallways and stairwells were not in use. 
 In a 60,000-square-foot building with 40 apartments, hiring an electrician to install motion sensors might cost $11,000, according to estimates produced by Optimal Energy Inc., a consulting company in Bristol, Vt., that has done regional energy-efficiency studies for New York State and Con Edison. The building could save that much in lower electricity bills over two years, assuming that it was already using fluorescent bulbs, and the sensors alone would reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by about 40 metric tons per year, the company said. 
 That would be the equivalent of driving a car that gets 25 miles per gallon for 110,250 miles, according to Dr. Stuart Gaffin, an associate research scientist at the Center for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University.
 As you would expect, it would take longer to recoup the costs of the more expensive measures. 
 Optimal Energy estimates, for example, that it would cost about $20,000 to weatherize that 60,000-square-foot apartment building, which could be paid for by five years of lower heating bills. Weatherizing would include sealing gaps around windows, exterior doors, and interior pipes and wiring. 
 Some residential buildings might also consider installing solar panels on the roof, to provide a nonpolluting source of electricity to light the hallways and run the elevators. Experts recommend doing this only after more glaring energy inefficiencies have been addressed, because in a large apartment house, solar panels are not going to produce enough energy to replace Con Edison. 
 Solar requires patience. It could take up to 15 years to break even on $19,000 spent on solar panels, and that is after subsidies and tax breaks offered by the state and federal governments. Mayor Bloomberg has proposed an additional subsidy for installing solar panels on buildings in New York City. 
 Mr. Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council contends that environmentalists often sell themselves short by focusing too much on payback periods. ''Nobody asks what the payback period is for a marble lobby,'' he said. But if a lot of large commercial and residential buildings installed solar panels, he said, that could go a long way toward reducing the city's overall impact on global warming. 
 ''From a societal perspective, the benefits are huge,'' Mr. Gupta said.
 As it stands, very few apartment buildings in New York have taken the first step and hired energy consultants. The first step most consultants suggest is to switch to fluorescent bulbs (a cheap fix), and then to solve the heating problems (to keep residents from being uncomfortable). 
 The Towers Cooperative, an eight-building complex with 111 apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens, last year hired Power Concepts, an energy auditor in Manhattan. 
 Once the audit was done, Bobbi Turner, the building's manager, sat down with the board. They decided to start with the fixes that their in-house maintenance staff could do -- for example, installing fluorescent bulbs as the old incandescents burned out. Ms. Turner said the electricity bills for the common areas were 7 percent lower last year than in 2005.
 For now, Ms. Turner and the board have decided to forgo many costlier measures that were recommended, including installing separate boilers for hot water and heat to cut down on the fuel the co-op uses in the warm weather when residents need hot water but not heat. 
 It would have cost $86,000 to do this in all eight buildings, with a payback period of five and a half years.
 But the buildings' staff did implement other suggested improvements to the heating system, which included installing thermostatic radiator valves in all apartments. 
 ''Our job is to make sure that we are doing things as efficiently as possible,'' Ms. Turner said. 
 The co-op did not have a maintenance increase this year, and Ms. Turner attributes this largely to the cost savings from the efficiency measures that have been implemented so far.
 Other buildings have needed to take more extensive measures to solve more complicated problems. 
 At 395 Riverside Drive, a 15-story co-op at the corner of 112th Street, the apartments on the west side of the building were often cold because of wintertime blasts of wind off the Hudson River. If the heat was turned up to offset the cold, apartments on the east side of the building got too hot.
 The board at 395 Riverside Drive ordered an energy audit from the Association for Energy Affordability, based in Manhattan, which recommended installing additional heat sensors and upgrading the computer that regulated the heat. 
 These changes were made last fall, at a cost of almost $8,000. The building paid $8,500 less on fuel bills, a decrease of nearly 16 percent, from December 2006 to April 2007, despite a spike in heating oil prices, according to the building's management company. 
 And the residents were more comfortable, said Dr. Eric Linden, a periodontist who is a former vice president of the co-op board. 
 The building also replaced the bulbs in the hallways with fluorescents, although, as at the co-op in Queens, the in-house staff replaced them gradually. 
 Dr. Linden credits these changes with keeping a lid on maintenance. The monthly fees, which range from $500 to $2,200, depending on the size of the apartment, rose 3 percent this spring. 
 ''But we might have had to raise them 4 to 6 percent if the energy costs had gotten completely out of control,'' Dr. Linden said. 
 Remarkably, the age of a building seems to have no correlation with how energy efficient or inefficient it is. Some of New York City's most efficient are old brick-and-mortar buildings ''that just have amazingly good maintenance staff,'' said Michael Colgrove, a senior project manager at New York State Energy Research Authority, whose goal is to make multifamily buildings more efficient.
 On the flip side, Mr. Colgrove said, owners in condominiums built 5 or 10 years ago should not be complacent. ''Almost all new construction in this city can easily improve their energy efficiency by 20 percent,'' he said.
 Daniel M. Krainin, a lawyer who is the president of a Brooklyn co-op, had an energy audit done for his building, a converted brownstone with eight apartments in Park Slope. 
 F. L. Andrew Padian, the director of multifamily services at Steven Winter Associates, an architecture and engineering firm in Norwalk, Conn., that performed the audit, recommended five measures. So far, the co-op has acted on only one, installing a mixing valve on the boiler for $550. Mr. Krainin said that this cut the building's oil bill by more than $400 in the last year.
 Sometimes, Mr. Padian said, cutting fuel use is simply a matter of recalibrating some controls. ''When I can walk in with a screwdriver and cut energy bills by 40 percent, people are really happy,'' he said. ''In other buildings, the old boiler is responsible for 85 percent of the energy waste.'' 
 The four other measures that he recommended for the building would cost about $30,000 in all: replacing the old boiler with an efficient unit, replacing the old beat-up windows with new double-paned windows, insulating the roof and installing motion sensors on the lights in the basement.
 ''Thirty thousand dollars would be a lot of money for a co-op our size,'' Mr. Krainin said. 
 After reading the audit report, residents voiced their reservations until they learned that the co-op could finance the work with a below-market loan subsidized by the state.
 ''Now everyone is sold on the idea that if we can do it without increasing the maintenance fees, then it makes sense,'' Mr. Krainin said. ''But I think we might have had more objections if we'd gotten to the point that it would cost people money in the form of higher maintenance fees or a surcharge.''
 That may be the sentiment of many co-op and condo boards now, but energy-efficiency experts say that attitudes are changing fast. 
 Jonathan F. P. Rose, a New York developer who specializes in energy-efficient construction, said the public is much more aware of environmental issues like global warming than it was a few years ago.
 Developers are racing to build new condominiums that can be marketed as ''green.'' And Mr. Rose said that older condos and co-ops could distinguish themselves with ''energy smart building'' certificates if they successfully completed the new state energy-efficiency program and cut their energy use by 20 percent.
 ''This isn't a fad,'' Mr. Rose said. ''I think this is a cultural transition. In the future, I think there will be such a preference for green buildings that those buildings will have an edge.''

HEADLINE: Neighborly Advice, for Good or Ill

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT.

 BODY:
THE impulse to keep up with Joneses plays an enormous role in the behavior of consumers, whether they're shopping for clothing or toothpaste, buying a home or deciding which school ought to be entrusted with their children. 
 It turns out that the investing arena is no different. When making changes in their portfolios, people pay a great deal of attention to what their neighbors are doing.
 That's the conclusion of a new study, ''Information Diffusion Effects In Individual Investors' Common Stock Purchases: Covet Thy Neighbors' Investment Choices,'' which appears in the July issue of The Review of Financial Studies. Its authors are Zoran Ivkovich and Scott J. Weisbenner, assistant professors of finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
 The study relied on a database containing extensive information about the stock portfolios of about 35,000 households that were clients of a large discount brokerage firm from 1991 through 1996. Though the firm did not divulge these households' identities, the database did include their ZIP codes. That let the professors determine whether investors were more likely to favor a stock if some of their neighbors were buying it or others from the same industry, too.
 There was strong evidence of such herding behavior. The likelihood that a household would follow the lead of other investors was greatest when they lived nearby. It tended to shrink quickly as the distance grew.
 One possible cause of this pattern is that investors -- by word of mouth, whether over the garden fence or at the gym -- learn which stocks their neighbors are buying and then tend to favor those stocks themselves.
 But the professors also looked into other possible causes, including the fact that some local economies are dominated by a single company or industry. In Silicon Valley, for example, investors are more apt to buy tech stocks than investors elsewhere, even if they never talk to one another about the latest hot software company. 
 This possibility led the professors to devise a number of complex tests to determine the actual role of word of mouth in investor decisions. One of the more intriguing tests took advantage of a barometer designed by Robert D. Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard; it measures the level and intensity of social interaction in a community. States with the highest scores in Professor Putnam's index were North and South Dakota; Alaska and Hawaii ranked lowest. Professor Ivkovich and Professor Weisbenner found significantly more herding behavior in high-ranking states.
 Over all, the professors concluded that ''there is strong evidence that individuals' stock purchase decisions are related to those made by their neighbors.''
 Because the time period the professors analyzed ended in 1996, it is unclear what impact, if any, the explosive growth in investment chat rooms, and of the Internet generally, might have on the word-of-mouth effect. But in his book ''Bowling Alone,'' Professor Putnam argues that more traditional modes of social interaction are in many ways far more powerful than those conducted over the Internet. This suggests that the word-of-mouth effect is likely to still be playing a powerful role, Professor Weisbenner indicated in an e-mail message. 
 Is the word-of-mouth effect necessarily bad? You may be inclined to think so, especially if you have a statistical bent. But the professors are careful to stress that your neighbors' influence may have some benefits. It may be that in an increasingly complex world, word of mouth is an efficient, inexpensive way to find out about promising opportunities.
 Nevertheless, there are obvious pitfalls to basing stock selections on what your neighbors are buying. One that the professors addressed is its effect on portfolio diversification. When we discuss the latest hot stocks with our neighbors, it's unlikely that we will talk about more than just a handful of companies. As a result, this word-of-mouth effect is likely to make our portfolios too concentrated in just a few stocks. All other things being equal, underdiversified portfolios tend to be riskier than those with a broader sampling of stocks.
 A bigger potential problem, of course, is that individual investors, on average, don't outperform the market. For word of mouth to have a positive effect, we need to resist the urge to buy a stock just to keep up with the Joneses; instead, we should buy it only if it survives more objective scrutiny. 

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Peer Pressure'' According to a new study, investors are heavily influenced in their stock purchase decisions by what their neighbors are buying. Data reflect the stock portfolios of 35,673 households at a large discount brokerage firm from 1991 through 1996. Distances are defined so as to create regions of roughly equal geographical area.

HEADLINE: Russia's Trademark Gun, but Others Grab the Profits

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

 BODY:
MOSCOW
 THE automatic Kalashnikov, the world's most abundant firearm and a martial symbol with a multiplicity of meanings, turns 60 this year. In some places this is cause to shudder. In Russia it is treated as a milestone to celebrate, and a chance to cry foul.
 Once strictly Communist products, the AK-47 and its offspring are killing tools so durable and easy to use that they were heralded as achievements of state socialism and industrial might. Uncoupled from the laws of supply and demand by their origins in planned economies, they flowed from arms plants in the tens of millions, becoming national defense and foreign policy instruments for the Soviet Union and allied states.
 But the 60th birthday party has displayed the rifle's evolving place in both the market and the Kremlin's mind. These days the Kalashnikov is seen through capitalist lenses, and argued about in ways that could not possibly have been envisioned by its Communist creators. 
 In cash-hungry Russia, Kalashnikov is now an informal brand. And as purchases of Kalashnikov rifles and their derivatives continue on foreign markets, Russian arms manufacturers and exporters worry not about ideology and world dominance, but over sales opportunities lost. 
 The back story manages to be both odd and unsurprising. Russia's anger is at the United States, a potential customer that has become, once again, a premier distributor, handing out the weapons to indigenous police officers and soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States was also a bulk purchaser in the 1980s, when it supplied mostly Chinese and Egyptian Kalashnikovs to anti-Soviet insurgents in Afghanistan.
 In returning to the Kalashnikov market, the Pentagon has shunned purchases from Russia, opting instead for AK-47 knockoffs available for sale or donation from other countries' stockpiles. (The true AK-47 was short lived and swiftly modified; its many variants, almost all of which the Soviet Union helped create via foreign aid, are often inaccurately called AK-47s, by now universal shorthand.)
 In Afghanistan, the United States has selected the AMD-65, a short-barreled Hungarian Kalashnikov copy with a forward hand grip and futuristic muzzle, as the standard weapon of the Afghan police. It has received most of its projected 55,600 AMD-65s via its foreign military sales programs, according to data provided by Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan. 
 Another 10,000 Kalashnikov knockoffs were transferred in 2006 to Afghanistan from Slovenia. At least some weapons being handed out, based on an examination of the shipping containers and rifles this spring in Afghanistan, are inexpensive Chinese clones.
 Similarly, in Iraq (which once had its own Kalashnikov plant, built with Communist help) the United States scrounged or purchased more than 185,000 Kalashnikov-style rifles and light machine guns for Iraqi security forces from 2003 and 2006, according to the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. 
 It did so without buying a single weapon from Russia, which, as creator of the underlying design that all automatic Kalashnikovs share, regards itself as the rightful owner of an informal but global brand.
 These transfers have alarmed and irritated Russian officials and arms merchants, and split the AK-47's 60th birthday celebrations between parties and bitter pleas. 
 With events that began in early July and will continue into August, the Kremlin and its arms-export agency are feting both a family of weapons and the man credited with their creation, Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, who at 87 has proved to be as durable as the rifles that bear his name. 
 Even General Kalashnikov himself is venting his dismay over proliferation without Russian profit. ''I take them into my hands and, my goodness, the marks are foreign,'' he said of the knockoffs the Soviet Union once championed. ''Yes, they look alike. But as to reliability and durability -- they do not meet the high standards of our military.''
 Without these controversies, the celebrations might have had a familiar feel. The AK-47 and its derivatives, first tested in the forests outside of Moscow six decades ago, have been common on battlefields and in Soviet and revolutionary iconography for two generations. General Kalashnikov long ago became a hero of the proletariat. 
 By the fall of the Soviet Union, their global saturation was complete. Soviet students practiced assembling and disassembling Kalashnikovs in the 10th grade. Soviet statues clutched them with muscular, thick-handed grips. Almost anyone who might fight the West or its partners had been eligible for automatic rifle shipments from the Communist bloc, or even a rifle or ammunition plant. 
 Every self-respecting Communist revolutionary and even allies of convenience, from Fidel Castro to Yasir Arafat to Idi Amin, eventually had their Kalashnikov stockpiles and Kalashnikov poses, never mind the body counts.
 The testimonials this month have celebrated Russia's version of this history. Depending on your point of view, these rifles have been either a revolutionary's trusted partner or a lethal instrument of proxy war, terror and crime. The chosen speakers, hand-picked by Russian officials, have chosen the former line.
 ''On behalf of all my brethren who died in the anti-American war to liberate our country, we thank you for inventing this weapon,'' Senior Col. To Xuan Hue, the defense attache from Vietnam, told Mr. Kalashnikov at one celebration.
 Group Capt. Biltim Chingono, the defense attache from Zimbabwe, also sidestepped the rifle's checkered reputation, saying that in his country's civil war it had proved ''to be the mightier and decisive freedom pen.''
 In Russian circles, little praise is being spared. ''The famous Kalashnikov assault rifle has become not only an example of daring innovative thought but also a symbol of the talent and creative genius of our people,'' President Vladimir V. Putin said in a decree.
 At the same events, Russian officials and arms manufacturers are clamoring over who should be allowed to put Kalashnikov rifles on the market. 
 Some arguments are based on quality, and Russia claims, without offering evidence, that the copies and clones are not as well made as the genuine article. There is some support for this on black markets in Iraq, where the Russian Kalashnikovs often fetch higher prices than their clones, although whether the rifles are better or simply more coveted is not clear.
 Other arguments are rooted in what the Russians claim is law, as the arms industry insists that the factories that the Kremlin once sponsored, and now are in sovereign, post-Soviet countries, have no right to manufacture or sell items of Soviet design. 
 ''More than 30 foreign companies, private and state based, continue the illegal manufacturing and copying of small arms,'' said Sergey V. Chemezov, the former K.G.B. officer and confidant of Mr. Putin's who directs Rosoboronexport, the state arms-marketing agency. ''They undermine the reputation of the Kalashnikov.''
 So far, few customers have paid notice. The largest customer in the market, the United States, has purchased whatever weapons it sees fit, coloring the AK-47's 60th birthday, like much of Kalashnikov history, with another angry struggle.
 ''We cannot tolerate the situation when only 10 percent of the Kalashnikovs are manufactured legally,'' said Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister. ''We cannot stand for this. We must fight.''

HEADLINE: The Green Road Less Traveled

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Whoever knew 

 BODY:
I.B.M. is managing traffic congestion in Stockholm. Well it is, and therein lies a story.
 Probably the biggest green initiative coming down the road these days, literally, is congestion pricing -- charging people for the right to drive into a downtown area. It is already proving to be the most effective short-term way to clean up polluted city air, promote energy efficiency and create more livable urban centers, while also providing mayors with unexpected new revenue.
 Imagine a day when you will go online and buy a pass to drive into any major urban area and the price of your pass will be set by whether you are driving a hybrid or a Hummer, the time of day you want to drive, the road you want to use and how much carbon your car trip will emit. And if there is an accident on the route you normally take, an alert will be sent to a device in your car warning you to go a different way. 
 Well, that day is pretty much here for London, Stockholm and Singapore -- and New York City could be next. In a few years, the notion that you will be able to get into your car in the suburbs and drive downtown for free will be as old-fashioned as horses and buggies.
 But what does this have to do with I.B.M.? To make congestion pricing work, you need technology -- cameras, software and algorithms that can read auto license plates as they flash by and automatically charge the driver or check whether he or she has paid the fee to enter the city center. (The data is regularly destroyed to protect privacy.) That is what I.B.M. is providing for the city of Stockholm, which, after a successful seven-month trial in which traffic dropped more than 20 percent, will move to full congestion pricing in August.
 ''In Stockholm, we built a system where we have a ring of cameras around the city -- 18 entry points with multiple lanes,'' explained Jamie Houghton, I.B.M.'s global leader for road charging, based in London. ''I.B.M. Stockholm runs the whole system.''
 O.K., Friedman, so I.B.M. is now in the traffic biz. Who cares?
 I care, because it underscores a fundamental truth about green technology: you can't make a product greener, whether it's a car, a refrigerator or a traffic system, without making it smarter -- smarter materials, smarter software or smarter design.
 What can many U.S. companies still manufacture? They can manufacture things that are smart -- that have a lot of knowledge content in them, like a congestion pricing network for a whole city. What do many Chinese companies manufacturer? They manufacture things that can be made with a lot of cheap labor, like the rubber tires on your car. Which jobs are most easily outsourced? The ones vulnerable to cheap labor. Which jobs are hardest to outsource? Those that require a lot of knowledge.
 So what does all this mean? It means that to the extent that we make ''green'' standards part of everything we design and manufacture, we create ''green collar'' jobs that are much more difficult to outsource. I.B.M. and other tech companies are discovering a mother lode of potential new business for their high-wage engineers and programmers thanks to the fact that mayors all over the world are thinking about going green through congestion pricing systems.
 ''Congestion pricing of traffic is emerging as a completely new services market for I.B.M.,'' said Mr. Houghton. ''I.B.M. is in discussion with major cities worldwide, including some in China.''
 Hopefully, if the New York State Legislature acts, New York City will get access to a $500 million Department of Transportation grant for a pilot congestion pricing system. The more U.S. cities adopt congestion pricing, the more U.S. companies will quickly develop the expertise in this field, which is going to be a huge growth industry on a planet where more and more people will be living in cities. Congestion pricing is the only way to make them livable without trillions of dollars of new infrastructure.
 As New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who's trying to bring this system to his city, put it to me: ''The percentage of your working day spent in a commute will go down and the time you spend being productive and being paid, or simply relaxing, will go up. Also, more people will do business in the city, because they can get to stores, offices or the theater more easily.'' 
 So if you hear a politician say that we can't afford to impose green standards because it will cost us jobs, tell them: ''Hogwash.'' The more we elevate, expand and globalize green, clean-power standards the more we play to the strengths of the American economy, American jobs and American-based companies.

HEADLINE: At World Open, a Sharp Battle Amid a Sea of Quiet Draws

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
The closest thing to a trial by fire in chess in this country is the World Open in Pennsylvania. The tournament has become the nation's pre-eminent event, living up to its grandiose name. 
 This year's Open, which ran from June 28 to July 4, attracted 35 grandmasters and 10 international masters. In all the sections, more than 1,000 players took part. Why do so many people play? Money. This year, prizes were substantial. 
 The top section ended in a tie for first place among nine (yes, nine!) grandmasters. On tiebreaks, Varuzhan Akobian of California was awarded the victory. 
 How did nine players tie for first? When they faced lower-ranked players, they usually won, but when they faced one another, most games ended in draws. While many of those draws were competitive (a 69-move game between Hikaru Nakamura and Sandipan Chanda; a 31-move battle in which Alexander Stripunsky forced a perpetual check against Nakamura by sacrificing a rook and a knight), others were not (12 moves between Leonid Yudasin and Akobian; 17 moves between Nakamura and Akobian). 
 Were the short draws a conspiracy? Probably not. More likely, they were a byproduct of economic reality. All the grandmasters who tied for first earn their living from chess. While all certainly wanted to win the tournament outright, drawing so often assured them of ending up ''in the money'' -- a little more than $5,000 each, before expenses. 
 Still, some blood was shed among the top players. In Round 5, Akobian took down Stripunsky, who was leading with a perfect 4-0. Stripunsky recovered to tie for first.
 The opening was the Botvinnik Variation of the Semi-Slav Defense, a line that can lead to sharp and unbalanced positions. 
 Stripunsky's 11 ... h5 has been played before, but it is provocative and risky, given Black's lagging state of development. 
 Through 14 Qc1, the game followed a known path, but 14 ... Qe7 was a new attempt to solve Black's coordination and development problems. It did lead to a trade of queens, reducing the risk to Black's king, but in the end this move fared no better than earlier attempts like 14 ... Rg6, 14 ... Ng4 or 14 ... c5. 
 With 19 ... b4, Black parried the threat of 20 Ne4 (which could be met by 20 ... c5), but at the cost of weakened queenside pawns. 
 Perhaps Black should have tried 24 ... Rc8, trying to hold his remaining queenside pawns rather than go for a counterattack with 24 ... Rd8. The problem for Black was that after the exchanges on moves 28 through 31, White had outside passed pawns on the kingside and his bishop was better than Black's knight. 
 In the final position, Black gave up, since the only way to save his knight, 41 ... Kd6, loses to 42 Kb4 Nc6 43 Bc6 Kc6 44 h5, when White's h pawn queens.

HEADLINE: Electric Cars Nearly Ready, But Batteries Are Less So

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAMERON

 BODY:
CLEVER and attractive, the Chevrolet Volt, a design study for a new wrinkle in electric cars, dominated the headlines coming from the Detroit auto show in January. But the introduction was punctuated with an asterisk.
The car that promised a fuel economy equivalent of 150 miles a gallon and a total range of 640 miles using its onboard recharging system carried a major caveat: the lithium-ion batteries required to make it a reality are not yet available, and won't be until 2010 at the earliest, industry experts say. 
 The Volt is not the only car waiting for lithium-ion batteries to be roadworthy. Reports last month in Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, a Japanese business newspaper, said that the next generation of the Toyota Prius would be delayed by six months because the carmaker had decided that lithium-ion batteries were not quite ready. 
 Officially, the car was not postponed because Toyota had never announced an introduction date, but such a decision would have major implications: reverting to nickel-metal hydride batteries in today's Prius means finding room for a larger and heavier power pack. A Toyota spokesman, John Hanson, said that while the company saw ''huge potential'' in lithium-ion batteries, it wanted to assure future Prius buyers the same levels of affordability and reliability they experience in today's models. 
 The quest for batteries that provide sufficient range at a reasonable cost has gone on for a century. Electric power was a viable alternative when automobiles were first gaining popularity, eventually losing out to combustion engines in the 1920s. In recent decades, research efforts have gained greater urgency. 
 Like King Canute, who as ruler of England commanded the incoming tide to go out, the state of California decreed in 1990 that pollution-free electric cars must come into being. Battery-electric cars looked like a sensible solution for urban air-quality problems because pollutants would be produced where the electricity was generated, rather than where the car was driven. 
 Since the early 1990s the price of gasoline has doubled, and with it the motivation to seek alternatives. Battery technology has evolved considerably; hybrids have arrived, priced to reflect their need for two power plants instead of one and a battery that by itself is one-third of the car's driveline cost. The plug-in hybrid -- whose battery can be recharged from a wall socket as well as by an onboard combustion engine -- has attracted a vocal following. 
 Before 1990, the principal battery choices were lead-acid, the familiar auto engine starting battery, and nickel-cadmium. The lead-acid battery is well-proved, but heavy considering the small amount of energy it can store. Nickel-cadmium batteries offer more miles of driving for a given weight and size, but are less attractive because a recycling system is not well-established. They are also at least four times as expensive.
 The real force driving battery development has been portable electronics and cordless power tools, not vehicles. Both are high-volume applications. The workhorse here is the nickel-metal-hydride battery, which can store three times the energy of lead-acid cells in a package the same size. Nickel-metal-hydride is the most commonly used type of batteries in hybrids and electric-only vehicles because they are long-lived -- Honda's warranty for the Civic Hybrid battery runs 10 years/150,000 miles in some states -- but are a great deal more expensive than a basic lead-acid battery. With a rapid recharge taking three hours, they were not the answer to California's push for mainstream zero-emissions cars.
 Another new battery type came along in 1991 -- the lithium-ion battery. Its light weight -- lithium is the third-lightest of elements -- improved energy capacity for a given weight, and subsequent developments in electrode chemistry suggest that by 2010 it will be the winning technology for all applications. (It is already common in devices like cellphones and laptop computers.) 
 One problem has been durability, with early lithium-ion units tolerating only 750 cycles of discharge and recharge, or about two years of service, before deterioration of the terminals carrying power reduces charge capacity by 20 percent. A change from a terminal made of carbon to one made of lithium titanate spinel oxide holds the promise of increasing this to 9,000 cycles and 20 years' use.
 Many other battery chemistries exist -- sodium-sulfur, nickel-zinc and nickel-iron -- but the major contenders for use in electric vehicles remain the nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion types. 
 Temperature control is an important consideration in the development of auto batteries; some cell or electrode types need to be warmer than others to function. And there are upper temperature limits -- overheating and fires from lithium-ion batteries in laptop computers made headlines about a year ago. 
 All batteries slowly lose their charge to small internal currents, which generate heat just as a toaster does. If electrode deterioration increases this self-discharge current enough, catastrophic overheating can occur. Novel electrode chemistries or external control electronics promise to eliminate this hazard. 
 So far, lithium-ion batteries have gained capacity at the rate of 8 percent to 10 percent a year, doubling their ability to store energy over a decade. This and improved electrode chemistry have refreshed the appeal of the battery-electric car. Tesla, an electric-car startup that plans to start delivering its $98,000 Roadster this fall, has developed a power storage system of 6,831 lithium cells, each about the size of a AA battery, that it says will power the car 200 miles. 
 With the prospect of greater range, increased durability and their low cost to refuel, battery-electric vehicles start to look like just a bigger and practical power tool -- one that may well make more sense than electric cars that use hydrogen fuel cells to produce power. 
 Would urban and suburban citizens buy lots of small electric vehicles at a price competitive with economy gasoline-powered cars? Have batteries matured enough to hit such a price point? Or will new emissions solutions make the small turbodiesel our first choice, as in Europe? It all comes down to price.

HEADLINE: The Funds Are Good. The Fund Companies Are Better.

BYLINE: By BARRY REHFELD

 BODY:
INVESTORS in the market for mutual funds may want to consider a promising alternative: shares of asset management companies that sell the funds. Over the long run, after all, these companies have produced much better returns than mutual funds over all. 
 For example, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained an annualized 11 percent over the last five years and domestic equity mutual funds rose by an average of 14 percent, according to Morningstar, the five largest publicly traded asset management firms gained an average of 30 percent, annualized. Those companies were BlackRock, Legg Mason, AllianceBernstein, Franklin Resources and T. Rowe Price. 
 Their comparative advantage over the average mutual fund isn't likely to falter any time soon, many analysts say. ''I'll take the returns of the stocks over the funds over any time frame,'' said Rachel Barnard, a Morningstar stock analyst.
 Much of the money management firms' allure is in their business model, which generates returns in good years and bad. They collect fees on assets under management, and, with some exceptions, the fees generally increase in proportion to asset growth. Among larger firms, an economy of scale funnels much of the increase in fees directly to the firms' bottom line. This makes for a very profitable corner of the financial services world, especially in a rising market. 
 When the market declines, however, asset management firms may be vulnerable. In such times, they can face a double whammy. As fund prices slide, which in itself would generally reduce management fees, investors often withdraw their money, helping to create a vicious cycle. Holding the shares of these firms is hardly without risk, particularly when the share prices are richly valued. This may be a problem right now: according to figures from Marc Irizarry, a Goldman Sachs analyst who follows asset managers, the stock prices of the overall group -- defined as those publicly traded United States companies that make most of their money from asset management -- as a whole are near the highest they have been relative to the S.& P. in two decades. 
 Investors should also be aware that the industry is highly regulated and therefore subject to a vast range of legal, political and legislative actions that can affect share prices. 
 Many strategists who are bullish on the industry say that asset management has become global in scope and that there are plenty of growth opportunities abroad for American fund companies. ''Looking across the globe, there's a massive amount of money to manage,'' Mr. Irizarry said. Foreign markets, with their higher savings rates and higher economic growth projections, are the places to look for it, he said.
 In a similar vein, Chris Spahr, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: ''The U.S. is a mature market, but there are a lot of countries that are where we were a decade or two ago. They're looking to invest their money, and there are a number of U.S. managers that have the fund performances, the asset mix, the distribution, the advertising and the sales force to compete for it abroad.'' 
 Both analysts are recommending AllianceBernstein, citing its ability to deliver worldwide. The company, which is based in New York and trades on the New York Stock exchange, is part of Axa, the global insurance and financial services company based in Paris. AllianceBernstein is the third-largest publicly traded asset management company, according to the newspaper Pensions and Investments. Thirty-six percent of Alliance's $717 billion in assets under management come from overseas sources, said John Meyers, a company spokesman. 
 Other companies with a significant presence overseas include Franklin Resources, Legg Mason and BlackRock, all of which trace about a third of their assets under management to foreign customers. Legg Mason and BlackRock are adjusting to huge mergers completed in the last couple of years. 
 Mr. Irizarry of Goldman said that he would put BlackRock -- which he said was the largest publicly traded asset manager in terms of global assets under management -- into a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. ''It's got a trillion dollars in assets,'' he said. ''It's so dominant.''
 Ms. Barnard likes Franklin andT. Rowe Pricefor the long term. T. Rowe Price has a strong position in the 401(k) market, she said, adding that both companies impress her for their diversity of offerings and their performance strength over many years. T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, lacks a significant foreign presence but has shown movement in that direction, going to 7 percent of its total assets under management from zero since 2000, according to Brian Lewbart, a company spokesman.
 Among the smaller firms, Ms. Barnard suggests Eaton Vanceas a niche player with good long-term potential. Mr. Irizarry recommends Affiliated Managers, which has made several successful acquisitions, like Chicago Equity Partners and First Asset Management, and Federated Investors, which he said is his ''defensive'' choice because 70 percent of its assets under management are held in money market funds, making the firm one of the least susceptible to a market downdraft. 
 Still, smaller firms over all have underperformed the five large ones by 13 percentage points, annualized, over the past five years, Mr. Irizarry said. He has sell ratings on Calamos, Gamco and W. P. Stewart, in part because they do not have what he called ''ample global exposure.'' 
 Ms. Barnard said she would avoid Cohen & Steers, Waddell & Reed and Janus because the range of their product offerings is not very diversified.

HEADLINE: Outlet Shopping, The European Way

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
EUROPE has long been a popular summer travel destination for Americans, but this year, with the dollar trading at all-time lows against the euro, it can be painful -- especially for those who like to bring home a souvenir or two (or a bagful, perhaps) from their favorite European designers. 
 They may still be able to. The designer outlet concept, long popular in the United States, has swept through Europe over the last several years. From Ireland to Greece, retailers, developers and investors have been pouring money into the development of outlet centers that typically offer brand-name or designer merchandise at 30 percent to 70 percent below regular retail prices. 
 Outlet shopping emerged in the United States in the 1970s as a way for merchants and designers to sell off surplus or last season's merchandise; there are now 222 such centers nationwide. The concept was exported to Britain in the mid-1990s, where it was quickly embraced by retailers and consumers. Forty-two outlet centers were built in Britain from 1994 to 2001, and developers are now turning their attention to other parts of Europe. 
 At the end of 2006, there were 66 outlet centers in 14 European countries, and new ones are being built at a furious pace, especially in emerging markets like those of Eastern Europe.
 ''These economies are booming,'' said Linda Humphers, the editor of Value Retail News, an industry journal that tracks outlet centers. An additional 23 European outlet centers are expected to open in the next two years, with four in Prague alone, she said. 
 Countries like Poland, Ukraine and Hungary are especially ripe for development, added Brendon O'Reilly, a partner in charge of outlet services at GVA Grimley in Britain, a real estate consulting company that also operates outlets.
 Although outlet shopping is an American invention, most of the development in Europe has been from its local companies. Only a few American developers have dabbled there. 
 Prime Retail, an outlet developer based in Boston, formed Athena/Prime Retail Europe in 1999 to develop outlets in Western Europe, but later pulled out. Prime Retail was sold to the Lightstone Group four years ago. 
 The Craig Realty Group, which is based in Newport Beach, Calif., and operates 13 outlet centers in the United States, was a partner in a center near Milan, but sold its stake last December. The company has also looked at sites in Poland and Croatia, but has no immediate plans to dive back in. 
 ''There are some great opportunities,'' said Steven L. Craig, the chief executive of Craig Realty. But the distance and complexities involved in navigating foreign regulations and cultures, he said, make finding a local partner essential.
 For Europe -- home to many image-conscious luxury brands -- designer outlets represent a significant cultural shift. In the past, some high-end brands were known to burn their excess inventory rather than risk it ending up being sold on the streets. But as designer outlets have caught on, luxury brands see them as a way to dispose of excess inventory in a controlled and profitable manner. 
 And, it should be noted, with a certain flair. You won't see the Fendi handbags flying or shoppers digging through bins in a bargain hunter's frenzy. This is civilized discount shopping, and developers are aiming to create a high-end, luxury environment that draws local shoppers as well as tourists.
 Since his company opened one of England's first outlet center, Cheshire Oaks, near Chester, in 1995, discount outlets ''have evolved to upscale experiences,'' said J. W. Kaempfer, the chairman of McArthurGlen, an outlet developer based in London. The idea, he said, is to provide ''an outdoor experience with cafes, dining and entertainment for a day out with friends and families.'' 
 Today the company operates 15 outlet centers in England, Scotland, Wales, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, Spain and Germany, with combined revenue around $1.9 billion a year. Six more are under development in Italy, Germany and Greece. Its most recent projects, including four in Italy and one in Vienna, are decidedly more upscale.
 In June, McArthurGlen formed a partnership with Altagamma, the association of Italian luxury brands including Pucci, Gucci, Ferragamo and Missoni, to pursue new retail opportunities. Their first project will be Noventa di Piave, a 26,000-square-foot outlet ''village'' near Venice that is scheduled to open in the fall of 2008. Designed by Hydea, an architectural firm based in Florence, Italy, the village will draw on traditional Venetian architecture and include piazzas and porticos. 
 For Value Retail Management, a developer of high-end outlet centers, luxury has been the strategy from the start. The company, based in London, is unusual in that it owns, operates and manages all of its outlet centers -- nine villages in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium and Ireland. The original vision, said Desiree Bollier, the company's chief executive, was ''to bring a sense of luxury to a segment that wasn't very well developed.'' 
 Each village has a staff of two dozen Value Retail employees who provide marketing and technical support to retailers. There are no food courts. Instead, top chefs and restaurateurs are recruited, such as Antonio Carluccio, who runs a cafe in the company's Bicester Village outside of London. 
 The villages, which are marketed together under the Chic Outlet Shopping of Europe brand (chicoutletshopping.com), follow a certain formula. Each is within an hour of a major city and near other interesting tourist destinations. For example, Bicester Village is in Oxfordshire, England, an hour from London and just 10 minutes from Oxford. Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, is nearby, as is the two-Michelin-star restaurant, Le Manoir aux Quat'saisons. 
 Another of the company's projects, La Vallee Village, is on the way from Paris to the Champagne region, and Disneyland Paris is just five minutes away. Its cobbled streets and flower boxes lend an air of country chic. 
 And while the villages carry major international brands like Versace and Puma, each also has some local favorites, like Pedro del Hierro at La Roca Village near Barcelona, Spain, and Olivier Strelli in Maasmechelen Village near Brussels. 
 The strategy seems to be working. Ms. Bollier of Value Retail Management says the company's revenue grew by more than 16 percent last year.
 The outlets draw much foot traffic from locals who might visit the villages several times a year. But tourists tend to spend more, and outlet centers have been aiming to woo them. Both McArthurGlen and Value Retail have forged partnerships with luxury tour operators and travel agents like Leaders in Travel and Shop Around Tours, both based in New York.
 At Value Retail villages, there are even staff members on site to provide tax forms and help tourists fill them out so they can get their refunds of value-added tax. Ms. Bollier says tourist visits -- from Russia, South America and China, as well as the United States -- increased by 45 percent over the last year.
 ''The U.S. customer is very outlet-savvy,'' Ms. Bollier said. ''With the currency not being in favor, buying products in this type of environment makes a lot of sense.'' 
 Last week, the dollar sank to a record low against the euro and stood at $1.3768 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Better Late Than Never: A Bit Extra for State Tourism Ads

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
LIKE everyone else who relies on state money, Connecticut tourism officials had to wait for the state budget to pass before knowing how much they could spend next year on trying to draw visitors to the state.
Already outspent by their counterparts in neighboring states, they feared the worst. But the final $36 billion two-year deal -- passed moments before the new fiscal year started July 1 -- included a surprise: $100,000 they were not expecting. 
 That brought the marketing allocation to the Commission on Culture and Tourism to $4.3 million, up from $4.2 million last year. 
 ''It is not competitive with what our neighboring states, our competing states, invest, but every little bit counts,'' said Karen Senich, the commission's acting executive director.
 The budget also included $4.5 million to be distributed equally among the state's five tourism districts for separate but coordinated marketing efforts, and $4 million extra for the commission to issue grants to cultural, historical and arts groups.
 The commission's budget of $5.5 million -- $4.2 million for marketing and $1.3 million for administrative costs -- for fiscal year 2006 ranked 40th among comparable state tourism budgets, down from 30th in 2001, and behind Pennsylvania's $31 million and New Jersey's $12.8 million, according to a study by the Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group.
 The study did not rank New York State, which, according to its budget office, allocated $16 million last year to promote tourism and $22 million this year.
 Magazine closing dates for fall issues were in June, so the delay in passing the budget, and the uncertainty surrounding the final allocation, forced the commission to pass on placing ads. 
 ''We could have used the knowledge that we had $100,000 more,'' said Barbara Cieplak, the commission's marketing director. ''Our fall campaign has to be planned in June, so not knowing our numbers and fearing our budget would actually be cut by $200,000, we weren't able to buy fall media as we would have planned to do.''
 To partially compensate, the commission will spend some money left over from last year on a newspaper insert in the fall. Tourism stalwarts including the two casinos, several hotels, wineries and other attractions will be featured and pay most of the bill.
 ''We still haven't decided what else we'll do in the fall,'' Ms. Cieplak said. ''We'll invest some of the additional $100,000 in advertising, but $100,000 is still not enough to do a full fall campaign.''
 That's ominous in light of what happened last year: There was no fall advertising. Those funds were diverted to last-minute summer TV spots when rising gasoline prices made short vacation drives suddenly attractive.
 But without fall advertising, inquiries for travel information fell 82 percent in October, from 30,000 in October 2005. ''It shows a dramatic difference,'' Ms. Cieplak said. ''If you advertise, they will come.''
 To make an impact while spending less, tourism officials focused on the one target customer shown by research to have the most potential: women ages 35 to 54 with household incomes of more than $80,000 who live in the New York area, travel with their families or other adults, make vacation decisions and value proximity.
 This summer's ''Closer Than You Think'' campaign, which began in March, shows people relaxing at state attractions and scenic locations looking refreshed.
 ''We know that what this agency does has an economic impact on the state economy,'' Ms. Senich said. ''For every dollar the agency spends, there's money back to the state.''
 According to a state-sponsored report released last year, visitors in 2004 spent more than $9 billion and generated $70 million in hotel occupancy taxes and $1.5 billion in state and local revenue. They supported 110,000 jobs, 6.5 percent of the state's total. 
 State tourism officials see a new opportunity in the nonstop daily round-trip flights to Amsterdam from Bradley International Airport that began July 1. Several commission members flew on that first trip and met with Dutch and German tour operators, travel agents and travel writers. 
 ''Our goal is to get the European market here,'' Ms. Senich said. ''We're promoting how easy an airport it is to maneuver in and continue on to Connecticut, Massachusetts and the rest of New England, and we hope for a favorable response.''

HEADLINE: With This Tool, You Tell a Mechanic What's Wrong

BYLINE: By JOHN R. QUAIN

 BODY:
TWO of the most alarming words a car owner can face are ''check engine.'' That warning light on the dashboard could mean the car needs expensive engine work or simply that the gas cap is loose.
For most drivers, there's no way to find out without taking the car to a mechanic. The primary reason is that vehicles are largely controlled by onboard computers, which are generally inaccessible without the proper equipment and software. So when that check engine light goes on, a mechanic has to link to the car's computer to obtain the codes that detail the problem and then translate those codes, which are indecipherable to most mere mortals. You must trust his translation and hope that the loose-gas-cap code wasn't misinterpreted as the get-out-your-checkbook code.
 But there are a growing number of products and services that are helping to take that helplessness out of car repair by doing the translation for you. A Connecticut company has begun to place drive-up kiosks in some Southern states that offer a do-it-yourself computerized car check. With this system, you can arrive at the mechanic with some idea of what's wrong with your car, even if you don't know how to fix it. 
 Since 1996, all vehicles have been equipped with a standard plug, called the on-board diagnostics, or O.B.D.-II port, to access a car's emissions codes. The port is just under the dashboard on the driver's side of most vehicles. Furthermore, as the sophistication of safety, engine, transmission and even entertainment systems has grown, the O.B.D. port has increasingly been used to tap into these onboard computers as well. 
 Professional mechanics can spend about $6,000 on diagnostic tools and pay monthly subscription fees for up-to-date codes. In most cases, consumers can obtain the same information online by subscribing to services provided by individual automakers, but this can be expensive. Chrysler, for example, charges $20 a day, or $200 a month, for such information. And you still need a device to pull the codes from your car's computer. 
 Some service centers, like Pep Boys, charge $85 or more to run a computer diagnostic check, although your local mechanic may do it without charge. However, the kiosks that are arriving at some service centers, gas stations and auto parts stores may obviate the need for fees or for favors from a mechanic.
 Environmental Systems Products of East Granby, Conn., has designed a system, called SAM (for Smart Auto Management), that looks like a gas pump. Drivers pull up to a SAM kiosk and tap its touch screen to watch an instructional video. SAM walks customers through the process, which involves paying a $15 fee with a credit card, scanning the car's vehicle identification number, or V.I.N., bar code (usually found on the door frame) using a scanner and connecting a lunchbox-size wireless diagnostics reader to the vehicle's O.B.D. port. 
 The whole process takes less than 10 minutes. At the end, a motorist receives a lengthy printout listing any detected diagnostic codes and their meanings. For example, in one test report the SAM printout explained that a P0125 code meant that the engine coolant sensor was unable to record the correct temperature, which could result in poor fuel economy and engine performance. It also indicated the seriousness of the problem (not very) and possible fixes. An additional page noted if any recalls or technical service bulletins, or T.S.B.'s, had been issued by the automaker. To get a detailed listing of T.S.B.'s and recalls, consumers have to register at the SAM Web site, iamsam.com, and pay $20 for an annual subscription to track up to seven vehicles.
 The SAM system isn't perfect. My 2000 Dodge Durango, for example, had a new transmission control module that wasn't properly connected to the truck's main computer. Consequently, it couldn't communicate with SAM.
 ''But it's not just for people who think there's something wrong with their car,'' said Art Jacobsen, vice president for product development at SAM. ''It can tell you if there's something wrong with a used car you're about to buy, like if an air bag is missing.'' 
 The company opened its first 200 SAM kiosks mainly in North Carolina and Atlanta and hopes to expand nationally later this year, part of a trend to give consumers better access to their car's computers. 
 Already available are inexpensive hand-held devices like the $90 CarMD, which plug into the O.B.D. port on most vehicles. Should your vehicle have problems, the CarMD will display the diagnostic codes from the car's computer on its small screen. To translate the codes, owners install CarMD's Windows-based software on a PC and plug the device into the computer's U.S.B. port. The device then connects to CarMD's site to explain the codes. The site identifies the specific codes for a vehicle based on the V.I.N. typed in. 
 In my case, the CarMD report indicated that two engine sensors might be malfunctioning. However, the report was still littered with inscrutable abbreviations like E.T.C. and I.A.T.
 Inilex, which makes a competing product to the LoJack antitheft device called the Kepler Advantage, is planning to add basic car diagnostic information to its location tracking service. The device, which costs $1,100, uses a global positioning system, or G.P.S., to determine a car's location and then to inform owners via an e-mail message when the vehicle has traveled outside an approved area. This summer, the company is hoping to introduce a $14.99-a-month service that will not only track a vehicle's location, but also monitor basic diagnostic information, like coolant levels and the condition of the transmission. 
 Although automakers charge for access to their codes, by law translations of the emissions control codes have to be available to all mechanics to meet federal requirements and state inspections. Furthermore, there is legislation pending in three states -- Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York -- that seeks to force automakers to make all of their computer diagnostic and control codes available to independent repair shops and installers. Still, now that consumers are getting do-it-yourself access to most codes, there's no doubt that diagnostic services like SAM are a step in the right direction. 
 And if one is available in your area, even if you're not buying a car or trying to ignore a check engine light, a clean diagnostic report could give you peace of mind before you load up the family sedan for that long summer vacation drive.

HEADLINE: Man of the Flesh To Man of the Cloth

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

 BODY:
OAK PARK, Calif.
 SOME people have their midlife crisis in reverse, like Ronald Boyer, who for most of his professional life has been better known as a star of pornographic films, Rod Fontana.
 After 30 years of sowing the wildest of oats, Mr. Boyer, 54, has searched his soul and chosen, to the surprise of family and colleagues, to seek a priesthood in the Episcopal Church.
 From his work in the rented villas of the San Fernando Valley, where hard-core sex films are shot, he has moved just a short distance west, to the Church of the Epiphany, which is guiding his transformation from pornography star to preacher.
 The psychic distance, however, has been vast. In January, the lumbering 6-foot-3 performer was greeting fans on the red carpet of the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas, along with the superstars of pornography like Jenna Jameson and Ron Jeremy. 
 In June, he was carrying the Holy Bible and a text titled ''Gospel Light'' to a live Internet show where he preached on the relative evils of pornography. ''Is pornography a sin?'' he asked on the show, which is aimed at people in the sex industry. ''Probably. Definitely,'' he answered, a response that reflected his own ambivalence as much as a desire not to alienate his audience. ''So is eating carrot cake until you're sick to your stomach,'' he continued. ''And so is punching somebody in the face. That's a sin.''
 Mr. Boyer's embryonic ministry, devoted to bringing spiritual comfort to those marginalized by the sex industry, is driven by his deep faith and by a medical crisis that threatened the life of his child. But it is a work in progress, fraught with the contradictions and internal struggles of a man leaving behind a livelihood that was central to his identity.
 He has tired of performing in sex movies, but even now doesn't condemn it. ''Not one time did Jesus refer to pornography, or homosexuality,'' he observed on the Internet show, which he began as a co-host in May. ''Jesus could have commented. He didn't.''
 Still, to pursue a new path as a religious leader, he had to make a clear choice. At the end of January, Mr. Boyer, who is married to a recently retired adult-film star, Liza Harper, announced his own retirement and gave up directing and performing in hard-core movies, he said, for good. ''I don't enjoy it anymore,'' he said at the time. 
 Mr. Boyer's embrace of Christianity was not a result of a bolt-from-the-blue conversion. It was a gradual awakening to spirituality, in part stirred by unsettling changes in the multibillion-dollar pornography industry, which has veered into extreme territory in search of new ways of selling sex. 
 His journey from one private corner of American society to another has, by chance, traced the contours of America's experiment with sexual liberation to a return to more traditional values. 
 For Mr. Boyer, his path completes a circle. He grew up in a conservative Southern Baptist community in South Carolina, where he was baptized and pursued a penchant for preaching as a teenager. He studied history and religion at Southern Wesleyan University, but dropped out to join the Army and serve in Vietnam, where he was wounded.
 Back home, he became a police officer and was offered a job in New York City in 1975, he said. But before he could start, the city went to the verge of bankruptcy and Mr. Boyer found himself unemployed. At that crucial moment an actor friend confided that he was making a living by appearing in pornographic films, and offered to get him involved.
 ''I did my first job,'' Mr. Boyer recalled of that summer, 1976. The set was at 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue, and there were tall ships on the Hudson River for the Bicentennial. ''After that, I was hooked,'' he said. 
 He liked the easy money, the sex, the camaraderie. He would not get rich performing in pornography, but he made a steady living. 
 Then, in the 1980s, he re-enlisted in the Army, he said, and served about a decade on active duty in what he called military intelligence. 
 A spokeswoman for the Army said Mr. Boyer was listed as having a rank of E-4 specialist, but she could not confirm any dates. 
 After the Army, Mr. Boyer returned to pornography, where he became known as ''the colonel'' for his military bearing. He had a reputation for sexual adventurousness. ''Rod was one of the kinkiest guys I ever met,'' said Urbano Martin, a director who has made many films with him. ''I find it hard to believe he's going to give this up. Rod is very addicted to the sex part of it.''
 Asked about this, Mr. Boyer acknowledged, ''When it comes to sexual acts, I'll do anything.'' But in recent years, he said, ''my view of morality in this business has changed.''
 He was speaking on the floor of the sex industry convention in Las Vegas last January, where he was interviewing people for a documentary about spirituality, and where, in a sign of the contradictions in his life, his wife had been nominated for best supporting actress in a sex film for 2006.
 ''When I got into porn,'' Mr. Boyer said, ''everyone in the business was kind to each other, loved each other, came together in crisis. It wasn't some 1970s kumbaya, but people generally cared. Now you see devil signs, Satanism and horns everywhere.'' He gestured at a passer-by with ''Hail Satan'' on his T-shirt. ''That's disturbing me a lot,'' he said. ''I see more of an evil influence in the business.''
 He told anecdotes of being asked by directors to defile the flag or the Koran in sex scenes; he has resisted what he sees as a trend to choke or hit women during intercourse, or use what he considers degrading language.
 Neil Malamuth, a psychology and communications professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the effects of pornography, said a niche of the sex industry has become more extreme and even violent, though that was not true for the entire business.
 ''There are younger people who represent these extreme videos, who are trying to break in, find a niche, and they can't make their money by just following what the older guys have done,'' he said. 
 With no pension forthcoming after his career as a performer, Mr. Boyer is feeling economic pressure above all. He has renewed a private investigator's license to make money while he pursues his religious avocation. And as recently as January, on the same day that he was making his documentary about spirituality, he still performed in a sex film. 
 At a shoot in a luxury suite at the hotel where the adult video convention was held, he watched a football game while a first-time performer, Gianna Ferrari, had sex with him. ''My mind's not there,'' he said afterward.
 The contradiction between giving up pornography and feeling its attraction was still apparent in June, four months after retiring. ''I love sex,'' he said. ''I love performing. I love the combination of the two. I could go back and do it again, but I don't think I would. I had a passion for that. I put it there. Now I've channeled my passion to a different place.'' 
 Giving up pornography is only one step on a long, difficult road to becoming a priest. In February and March, Mr. Boyer studied at a religious retreat in Big Sur, then prayed at a cathedral in San Francisco. He returned to meet with his priest and with the second-ranking official of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, Bishop Suffragan Chester L. Talton, to gain approval to establish a ministry among sex workers.
 The process to priesthood will take several years. Mr. Boyer began by being confirmed in the Episcopal Church this year. He is undergoing training to become a deacon, which will allow him to conduct most aspects of ministering short of the sacraments. To become a priest, he must study in a seminary for approximately two years and his candidacy must be approved by the diocesan bishop.
 J. Jon Bruno, bishop for the Los Angeles Diocese, said Mr. Boyer's path to the priesthood would not be precluded by who he was. ''I wouldn't put up an immediate impediment because of someone's past life,'' he said. ''There's no exclusion in the gospel for anybody.''
 The diocese is integrating Mr. Boyer at a time when the national leadership of the Episcopal Church has come to near schism with the global Anglican Communion over the decision to accept homosexuals in the clergy and to consecrate same-sex unions. In Los Angeles three congregations have left the diocese over the issue.
 Now the diocese faces the challenge of welcoming an ex-performer with more than 300 hard-core movies to his credit, most of them with unprintable titles. (''Foot Hustle'' is one exception, a tribute to Mr. Boyer's foot fetish.) His embrace of Jesus is hardly the stuff of a tidy Sunday homily. Fellow parishioners at the Church of the Epiphany in Oak Park do not know about Mr. Boyer's life in pornography, and the church leaders who do seem uncomfortable discussing it in depth. 
 ''I am hoping he can bring hopefulness and a love of Christ to people who desperately need it,'' said the Rev. Hank Mitchel, vicar of the church, on a recent Sunday after services. 
 There is one other element of Mr. Boyer's story. He and his wife have a daughter, Diana, who at 11 months old came down with a deadly staph infection from an insect bite on her bicep. Doctors prepared to amputate the baby's arm when she did not respond to several antibiotics. But at the last moment they found a new drug to which the baby responded.
 The experience convinced both Mr. Boyer and Ms. Harper, who was raised Roman Catholic, that they wanted to be part of a church. It was a personal crisis that cemented Mr. Boyer's decision to pursue a spiritual path. 
 He was rejected by several congregations before coming to Oak Park, he said. When Mr. Mitchel heard the story of their daughter, now a delicate 4-year-old, the vicar recalled, ''I broke down in tears and said, 'You are welcome here.' '' 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 22, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Sunday Styles last week about Ronald Boyer, a former actor in pornographic movies who has expressed the desire to be an Episcopal priest, referred incorrectly to his progress toward that goal. He has been confirmed in the church; he is not working toward ordination as a priest or undergoing training to be a deacon. The article also referred incorrectly to efforts by Mr. Boyer to establish a ministry among sex workers. He discussed the plan with the vicar of his church; he did not meet with the secondranking official of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, Bishop Suffragan Chester L. Talton.

HEADLINE: Somehow The Spending Doesn't Stop

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
IT'S the economic riddle of 2007: Why have Americans kept spending with such endurance when all signs have pointed to a slowdown?
 Pay raises for most Americans have been trailing or barely beating inflation. The housing market is in its sharpest slump in more than a decade and showing no sign of recovering. Energy prices have risen relentlessly, and surveys are picking up growing pessimism about the state of the economy. 
 Yet consumers seem undeterred. In fact, with the rest of the economy growing at a sluggish pace in the first three months of the year, the high-rolling American consumer kept the country from slipping into a recession. 
 There were recent signs that spending had slowed somewhat, but the outlook is hardly bleak. Last week, the government unexpectedly reported that retail sales dropped overall in June. Yet the mass retailers Wal-Mart and Target said that sales grew more than they expected, and stock prices on Wall Street closed at their highest levels ever. The consumer, investors seemed to be saying, is still going strong. 
 So the riddle becomes not only why do consumers keep spending in such big gulps, but also what could slow them down?
 History offers a few hints. Today there are no lines outside gas stations, as there were during the Arab oil embargo. Nor are there lines outside unemployment offices, as there were in the early 1980s when the jobless rate reached double digits. By those standards, even the dot-com bust looks like a hiccup.
 ''If you compare now to what happened in the late 70s and early 80s, this is a transition that has been handled quite well by consumers,'' said Richard Curtin, director of surveys at the University of Michigan, which conducts a closely watched monthly survey on consumer sentiment. ''They've seen worse. They have a lot more experience in judging the twists and turns of the economy.''
 In the past, consumers have pulled back when the job market seized up. In the early 1980s and early 1990s, when consumer spending actually declined, employers were laying off hundreds of thousands of workers a month. And in 2001 and 2002, during the most recent stretch of weak consumer spending, businesses were again cutting back.
 If that were to happen again, the current spending boom could turn into a bust, economists say.
 ''If you were looking to see what could break the consumer,'' Mr. Curtin said, ''I think their Achilles' heel is the employment situation.'' 
 Of course, the jaded American consumer has picked up some stubborn spending habits from the economic stability of this decade. That may account for why so many economists were wrong when they expected people to sit on their wallets as the residential real estate market imploded. 
 ''People were expecting a very quick response to the housing collapse,'' said Ethan Harris, the chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''It didn't happen. And the reason it didn't happen is the way the consumer manages their wealth is they tend to adjust gradually to changes. They gradually ratchet up spending when they feel wealthy. And when they feel less wealthy, they gradually ratchet down spending.''
 Not surprisingly, the rich have been consuming the fastest, and making up for any other consumer shortfalls. ''They do matter more in terms of aggregate spending -- it's a statistical fact,'' said Scott Hoyt, senior economist with Moody's Economy.com.
 In 2005, the most recent year the government tracked expenditures by income level, the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans were responsible for 39 percent of consumer spending. That was up from 38.6 percent in 2004. The share of spending by the remaining 80 percent of the population, meanwhile, declined from 2004 to 2005.
 It would be an overstatement to say that the rich are the only ones propping up consumer spending, but their significance is hard to overstate. Consistently strong sales growth among high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom suggests that wealthy Americans have been spending more as lower-income families cut back.
 The poorest Americans, of course, are those affected the most by rising energy prices. So when gas jumps above $3 a gallon, they more than anyone else have to scale back discretionary purchases. But they are not spending less over all, so consumer spending keeps rising.
 ''It's not that money is not being spent, but it's being spent in different places'' said Philip Rist, vice president of strategy for BIGresearch, a consumer research company that advises retailers. ''It's a redistribution.''
 Some economists are starting to see signs that spending is cooling. Goldman Sachs's chief United States economist, Jan Hatzius, recently published a paper that argued that spending was ''vulnerable to a sharp slowdown in the coming months.'' 
 While vehicle and retail sales have looked promising, growth rates in recent months were slower than last year. ''Auto and major retailer receipts,'' Mr. Hatzius wrote, ''have historically been an excellent proxy for overall consumption growth.'' 
 Using more black-and-white terms, some economists say consumers' wallets must empty eventually. ''It's hard to see how they can keep doing what they're doing,'' said Mr. Hoyt of Economy.com.
 But a bet against the American consumer has long odds. ''People keep looking for disaster, and there's always a new reason why the consumer is going to collapse,'' said Mr. Harris of Lehman Brothers. ''It's not going to collapse.''

HEADLINE: Long-Term Solutions For Roosevelt's Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Roosevelt's Rough Ride'' (editorial, July 8), an $8 million advance proposed by State Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr. is unreasonable. Yes, the district is near financial insolvency, but we reached that point under state control. 
 Roosevelt has made many major improvements. Eighth graders' standardized reading test scores increased by 22 percent and the elementary school test scores are still some of the highest in New York State.
 The financial problems plaguing Roosevelt are systemic. Roosevelt does not have a large enough commercial tax base to sustain a school district. Mr. Fuschillo needs to look at long-term options for equitable funding of the district, including the elimination of tax breaks to businesses operating in the community.
 Mr. Fuschillo's World Bank-type loan smacks of paternalism and classism. Why should the district have to borrow and then pay back money to remedy fiscal mismanagement overseen by the state? As one of several elementary school teachers laid off on June 26 by the district because of state budget cuts, I feel that the state should examine alternative and sustainable methods to help fund the district. Burdening the district with long-term debt is just a fix that fails.

HEADLINE: When New Building Dries Up Resources

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
UNTIL five years ago, it seemed that the breakneck pace of development in Effingham County, a Savannah suburb in southeast Georgia, knew no limits.
But like other fast-growing areas across the country, Effingham had to learn that large-scale expansion often comes at a price. In the county's case, it was the long-term integrity of the vast underground water supply that serves it as well as other major areas in the South.
 ''The prevalent mentality that natural resources have no end has come to an abrupt halt here,'' said John A. Henry, chief executive of Effingham's Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Authority. Because overuse of its wells could draw in saltwater, the county can no longer rely solely on the wells for business and residential use, he explained, and it has been buying water from Savannah for the last five years.
 As a result, cities in the county have had to spend millions of dollars and expect to spend millions more to try to keep up with growth. Residents' water bills have risen significantly, and yet, the growth continues. 
 As recently as the early 1980s, Effingham County was still dotted with farms and corner gas stations. But in the last two decades it has grown rapidly, becoming home to subdivisions and to businesses like Wal-Mart and McDonald's. The county's population was 37,535 in 2000, a 46.1 percent increase from the 25,687 population in 1990, according to census figures. By 2006, it was 48,954, up another 30.4 percent.
 Effingham's development has been most noticeable in the city of Rincon, 20 miles north and slightly west of Savannah along State Highway 21, where new building permits for single-family houses rose to 268 last year from 65 in 1996. The city's population in 2006, according to census data, reached 6,922, an increase of more than 58 percent from 2000, when it was 4,376.
 The water problem became widely known about a decade ago, after years of investigation by scientists at the United States Geological Survey. They said that intense industrial and residential development had caused a cone of depression in the Upper Floridan aquifer, straining the key underground water source past its limits. 
 The problem in Effingham County, said Timothy Baumgartner, an engineer with EMC Engineering Services Inc., which works for Rincon, was that continued high use there of underground water could intensify saltwater intrusion in wells throughout the area served by the aquifer. 
 The strain on the underground supply has already caused some saltwater to be suctioned into low-lying coastline areas near Hilton Head, S.C., about 40 miles east of Rincon. Federal officials said that unless action was taken, future generations would draw saltwater instead of freshwater.
 ''Maybe not in one year or two,'' said Steve Liotta, an Effingham County engineer, ''but in 5, 10 or 15 years, wells in cities served by the Upper Floridan aquifer would increasingly become contaminated with saltwater.''
 Last year, in response to the federal government's findings, Georgia ordered sections of Effingham and all of neighboring Chatham County to lower daily groundwater use to five million gallons below 2004 levels. Rincon and other areas in the county were forced to pipe in water, from surface sources like rivers and streams, that is treated in Savannah and then sent out. In addition, no new wells could be drilled.
 So far, Rincon has spent nearly $10 million to build a water treatment plant, and it is about to spend $3.5 million more to upgrade the facility. The goal is to reprocess water already used by households so that it can be reused for nondrinking purposes like watering lawns and irrigation, said David Schofield, Rincon's acting city manager. 
 Stacie and Preston Taylor, who moved to a starter home in a development in Rincon four years ago and then two years later to a larger colonial in another development, were initially able to draw their drinking water from a community well. Now they must tap into municipal supplies, and that, Mrs. Taylor said, is taking a hefty bite of their household budget. 
 Mrs. Taylor, a mortgage banker, and her husband, a sales representative, used to pay $30 a month for their water; their monthly bill for water that now comes from Savannah is $300, and sometimes more. ''It can be very hard on a family's budget,'' she said. 
 But the high quality of the local public schools and the ''family-type, small-town feeling'' in Rincon, despite its growth, offset other negatives. The Taylors have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Kaylee, and are expecting another child in December.
 Sandy Martin and her husband, Stan Milam, retirees who used to own a home near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and now live in Springfield, another city in Effingham, said that the county had changed since they first moved there six years ago. Not only water problems but increased traffic have resulted from new development, Ms. Martin said. 
 The couple, who live in a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath ranch on 28 acres that they bought in 2001 for less than $250,000, still draw from their own well and do not have to pay for municipal water. But their friends and neighbors pay for water, Ms. Martin said, ''and they can get grumpy about that, especially when it comes time to fill their pools.''
 ''People complain about paying for water,'' she said, ''but lots of things that used to be free, like TV reception, now cost money.'' 
 Residential real estate in Effingham remains a bargain compared with Savannah, according to LaTrelle Pevey, the owner of ERA Adams-Pevey Realty in Rincon. In today's market, a new 1,400-square-foot subdivision house with three bedrooms, two baths and a fenced yard on one-fourth to one-half an acre in southern Effingham would cost $130,000 to $175,000. In Savannah, the same house would cost $160,000 to $195,000, Ms. Pevey said.
 What prompted the decades-long land rush in the 480-square-mile Effingham County? According to V. Elaine Seabolt, the president and owner of Seabolt Brokers/Harry Norman Realtors in Savannah, the county owes its growth to two groups. 
 Young families, seeking to escape the higher cost of housing in Savannah, began migrating in the early 1990s in search of small starter homes selling for $125,000 and up, Ms. Seabolt said. Empty nesters, many priced out of retirement havens like Hilton Head, also gravitated to Effingham, where the climate is warm most of the year, the cost of living reasonable and the threat of hurricane damage far less than in Florida.
 ''The bottom line is that dirt is a lot cheaper right outside of Savannah,'' Ms. Seabolt said, ''and certainly less expensive than in Hilton Head.''
 The Floridan aquifer system, according to the Geological Survey, is one of the most productive in the world, underpinning about 100,000 square miles in southern Alabama, Southeastern Georgia, Southern South Carolina and all of Florida. It provides water for cities including Savannah and Brunswick in Georgia; and Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Orlando, and St. Petersburg in Florida.
 Effingham's water problems are not unusual. In Naples and Tampa in Florida, in Southern California and in Scottsdale, Ariz., aquifers have similarly been stressed by intense development, Mr. Baumgartner of EMC Engineering said. But those cities, he said, do not have the saltwater problem. 
 Ken Lee, Rincon's mayor, said that the city, which was ''now trying to play catch-up to solve the problems,'' had no plans to cut back on either residential or commercial growth because of the water problems.
 But not everyone agrees that the explosive development of the last two decades should continue, according to Levi Scott, Rincon's assistant mayor, who grew up in the city during the 1950s and 1960s.
 ''You hear a lot of griping at council meetings,'' he said. ''Some people think the city has already paid too high a price for all this growth.'' So far, there is no organized opposition to growth. 
 Mr. Liotta, the county engineer, said the focus should be on how best to conserve water for future generations. ''One way to do that,'' he said, referring to the county's new policies, ''is that the more water someone uses, the more they will pay.''

THE SECRET HISTORY
 OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE
 Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and
 the Truth About Global Corruption.
 By John Perkins.
 365 pp. Dutton. $25.95.
When discussing the movers and shakers who made the last third of the 20th century so special, people tend to rattle off names like Mao Zedong, Richard Nixon, Yasir Arafat, Henry Kissinger, Pol Pot and Ronald Reagan. Yet if John Perkins, the author of ''The Secret History of the American Empire,'' is to be believed, to that list must be added one more name: his own. 
 Perkins is the author of the fabulously successful, and in some quarters revered, ''Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,'' which explains how a cabal of wicked men like him have enabled perfidious corporations to seize control of the planet. Now, in a follow-up written not for crass financial gain but because he owes it to his fellow man, the promiscuously altruistic Perkins comes completely clean about the epochal role he has played in ruining life on earth. 
 After all, it was Perkins's work for a Boston consulting firm that allowed nefarious multinational corporations to plunder Indonesia, Perkins's acquisition of for-your-eyes-only population data from the mysterious ''Dr. Asim'' that enabled the Secret American Empire to take over Egypt, Perkins's covert missions in Saudi Arabia that sealed Saddam Hussein's fate, and Perkins's invention of an ingenious payment system that led directly to the destruction of Bolivia's economy. Thus, while the average person may think George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin are the ones who pull the strings on this planet, Perkins disabuses his readers of such naivete. It is the economic hit men (E.H.M.'s) and their rough-and-tumble cousins, the corporate ''jackals,'' all of them in the employ of the ''corporatocracy,'' who decide who prospers, who starves, who lives, who dies. And, as is so often the case with deceptively omnipotent organizations, it is the Secret American Empire's ability to dominate the world without having an official address or even a fax number that makes it so sinister, so powerful, so deadly. 
 This empire ''is as ruthless as any in history,'' Perkins writes. ''It has enslaved more people and its policies and actions have resulted in more deaths than those under the imperial regimes of Rome, Spain, Portugal, France, England and Holland or at the hands of Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler, and yet its crimes go almost unnoticed, disguised in the robes of eloquent rhetoric.'' 
 Perkins, like Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte and many other titans who irrevocably altered the course of history, has an unusual background. Son of a New Hampshire prep school teacher, he spent several years working for the Peace Corps in South America, apparently doing good things. Then, for reasons that seem to have something to do with making a lot of money, he made the unusual decision to go to work as a minion of Lucifer. He spent most of the 1970s and '80s helping the evil corporatocracy that runs the Secret American Empire establish suzerainty over the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South America and Africa. Then one day, while visiting Tibet, he had a Saul of Tarsus-type conversion and realized that being an economic hit man, while not as bad as working as a jackal, was immoral. Since that time he has devoted every waking breath to exposing the machinations of the corporatocracy -- whose errand boys include the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the news media -- and making this a better planet.
 So Perkins falls into the same category as St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Augustine and Charles Colson: He is an unimpeachable expert on virtue now because he was an expert on vice then. In sum, ''The Secret History of the American Empire'' is not so much a commercial product as a selfless gift to the American public. Indeed, Perkins comes across as so apologetic and self-abnegating that it's surprising he even charges money for the book. It was probably his publisher's idea. Corporatocratic swine.
 Yet even though Perkins is perhaps the nicest person to come along since Alcuin of York, his book is not without its flaws. Because so many of the anecdotes and even the general outline of Perkins's conspiracy theories date from the '60s, a better title might have been ''Rip Van Winkle Versus the Trilateral Commission.'' The author also has a tendency to play fast and loose with the facts, skating over Castro's myriad crimes in Cuba and Mao's festive homicide in China. He is weak on American history, somehow confusing the monstrously inhospitable Iroquois tribes with the Little Sisters of the Poor. He describes Che Guevara's death in ludicrously dramatic terms, when in fact this trendsetter, fashion plate and full-service psychopath came to a clownish end. He seems to believe that the C.I.A., having murdered the democratically elected presidents of Chile and Ecuador, then put Linda Tripp on the payroll in a plot to destroy Bill Clinton -- and frankly, this sounds a bit far-fetched. He suggests that the first President Bush invaded Panama because Manuel Noriega had incriminating photos of George W. Bush snorting cocaine and engaging in kinky sex. If only history were this much fun!
 Still, these lapses, oversights and harmless exaggerations do not detract from the author's central message: I used to be an ''infidel dog,'' and the rest of you infidel dogs had better listen up. As he explains when detailing his pivotal role in the Secret American Empire's annexation of the Middle East: ''The Egyptians knew something that only a few of my countrymen comprehended: We used data like the projections Dr. Asim had provided to me for empire building. E.H.M. economic reports were far better weapons than crusader swords had ever been. Israeli bombs served their purpose, delivering havoc, raining down fear and compelling government officials to capitulate. But people like me were the real danger.'' 
 Luckily for mankind, Perkins has retired from his job as an infidel dog and now works on the side of the angels. 
 Whew. That was close.

HEADLINE: Once Frumpy, Green Cars Start Showing Some Flash

BYLINE: BY PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
WHEN Christopher Paine, the director of ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' filmed the General Motors EV1, he had to search for a flattering perspective.
''When we filmed the car on the road, its best angle was the low front shot from the side,'' he said. ''It was gorgeous. The back of the car was more challenging. The car's style did not appeal to certain design sensibilities. 
 ''That Citroen-like back was not successful,'' he added.
 Mr. Paine is putting it mildly. The EV1 was derided for its appearance. So was the spacey Honda Insight, the first hybrid to go on sale in the United States. Neither was a commercial success. 
 Both shared a stylistic similarity to the long skirts of the early 20th century: They suggested Popeye's pal, Olive Oyl, in her ankle-length dress. The rear fender skirts seemed frumpy. 
 Honda's hybrid evoked similar reactions. While the Insight could theoretically get 56 miles a gallon in the city and 70 on the highway, its shape put people off. 
 The EV1, G.M.'s pioneering electric car, and the recently discontinued Insight raised a challenge that designers are still dealing with. How do you signal green to other drivers, and is it for pride or marketing? How do you provide drivers assurance about the novel technology? What does green look like? How do you design a green car? How green do drivers want to appear? 
 One way to suggest green through design is simply to paint or mark models that have better fuel economy or reduced emissions. Toyota offers the hybrid versions of the Camry in a color called Jasper Pearl, a light, almost luminous, green. When I drove a test model, several people asked if the car was a hybrid, simply because of its strange green paint, I believe. 
 Saturn offers the hybrid version of its Vue utility wagon in green. It also applies what it calls a Green Line badge to them -- the word line implying more green models to come. Ford adds a green-leaf badge to hybrid versions of its Escape and Mercury Mariner.
 BMW's 7 Series with hydrogen power is indistinguishable from other 7 sedans except for its badge. Honda's discontinued Accord Hybrid resembled the standard model, and its Civic Hybrid is distinguished from its siblings largely by pie-pan wheel covers. 
 The Toyota Prius offers a now-recognizable and characteristic silhouette: a long arc of roof, a short hood and a high, stubby back. It is not lovely and it is not as radically different from other cars as the EV1 or the Insight. But it is different enough to signal that it represents a different kind of car. 
 While in the traditional visual language of auto design the small hood sends a signal that the Prius is low-powered and ineffectual, its now familiar silhouette speaks of greenness. Of course, Toyota also offers other hybrids whose status is signaled by a badge that reads Hybrid Synergy Drive.
 For the next-generation Prius and other possible hybrid vehicles, Toyota designers have been trying to answer the question of what green should look like. 
 One effort, by Toyota's Calty design studio in Newport Beach, Calif., is a show car that aims to make the hybrid attractive by making it sporty. The car, called the FT-HS, projected a hybrid power plant with the equivalent of 400 horsepower. It seemed inspired by the idea of the electric Tesla sports car, to replace the sense of green as sacrifice with one of sport and indulgence.
 Toyota called the idea hybrid-sports. William Chergosky of Calty, said: ''The FT-HS wasn't just meant to showcase the idea of hybrid-sports. It was also meant to be a vehicle that would help us clarify a hybrid design idiom. The design language of a hybrid should speak to its function.'' 
 Mr. Chergosky said the FT-HS's design started with the idea of placing the engine in an unconventional place. ''Our model was the styling cues that midengined cars have. 
 ''What we hoped to create was a look that conveyed lightweight, efficient, advanced and clean,'' he said -- not simply hybrid. 
 This can seem high-concept. Mr. Chergosky added in an e-mail message: ''The hybrid story should be a holistic one that starts from the inside (the heart) and transforms the outer shell (the healthy body).'' 
 Another new green Toyota is the Hybrid X show car, created at Toyota's ED2 design center in southern France and introduced at the Geneva auto show last spring. The glass of the highly aerodynamic body forms two U shapes. Seen from above they make the X of the car's name. The emphasis is on an open, spacious interior. 
 Honda's Small Hybrid Concept, also in Geneva, seemed aimed at curing the ills of the Insight, although its rear end bore an echo of that car. It rides on macho 20-inch wheels and has no hint of fender skirts. 
 For the Volt, Chevrolet's electric show car with a supplementary gas engine, a team of designers led by Bob Boniface tried to avoid the dull appearance of other green cars. They took echoes of the face of the sporty Camaro and made the beltline, which separates the windowed greenhouse from the lower body, high.
 Ultimately, a dramatic change in the engineering of cars will change their appearance and style. ''A car on the outside fundamentally has to look like what it is inside,'' said Chris Chapman of BMW's Designworks studio in Newbury Park, Calif. ''This was true in the first electric cars and will be in the future.'' 
 The basic design of any car, he said, is dictated by the placement and size of engines, batteries, fuel and so on. These affect where passengers and luggage go. Together, they make up what designers call the package. As changes occur in motors, he said, ''people come to accept the new look, as they accept the flat wedge airfoil shape of the Prius,'' he said. ''In the long run, new designs and layout and architecture will have to come out from underneath, from the basic technology.'' 
 Designers have done little to signal green in a car's cabin, but that may be changing. Ford recently announced that its 2008 Escape would use only recycled fabric in its seating surfaces. This is green, but not obviously so. But why shouldn't it be? asked David Lyon, head of North American interior design for G.M. He is looking for alternatives to leather, a sort of design equivalent to a vegan menu, and for materials that look recycled. Recycled items can become something for drivers to boast of, he said. 
 Green cars can too often look ''like sensible shoes'' in the phrase of Bob Boniface, the G.M. designer. 
 Tom Peters, who headed the design of the latest Corvette, said, ''There are two schools of thought on this.'' One makes the car conventional, the other makes it strikingly different. The former strategy is aimed at reassuring buyers. Drivers are used to cars with hoods and engines in front, for instance.
 ''If there is no engine in front -- without that mass in front of us --many of us feel vulnerable,'' he said.
 But he added: ''From a designer's standpoint, you want to celebrate the new techno. With fuel-cell technology it is very exciting to create a new shape, a new surface vocabulary, new ways to get into and out of the car. People are ready for that now.''

TWENTY GRAND
 And Other Tales of 
 Love and Money.
 By Rebecca Curtis.
 238 pp. Harper Perennial.
 Paper, $13.95.
Not long ago, in a conversation with my father, I described a person I knew by saying he had an edge. It quickly became clear that my father assumed my description was a criticism when in fact I'd meant it in a positive way. I was reminded of this conversation while reading Rebecca Curtis's debut story collection, ''Twenty Grand.'' Curtis's stories, almost all of them first published in The New Yorker and other literary magazines, definitely have an edge. I'm pretty sure my father would find them weird and depressing. I think they're terrific. 
 Curtis establishes a blunt tone from the beginning. The unnamed protagonist of the first story, ''Hungry Self,'' is a 19-year-old working as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant. When she realizes that a customer is the counselor her family saw years before, the protagonist explains of the counselor, ''She was a fat ugly lesbian.'' While the comment feels decidedly harsh, the protagonist means it as a statement of fact as much as an insult. + 
 What makes this protagonist and the others like her not just bearable as narrators but also highly compelling is the believability and authenticity of their circumstances and observations. They don't mean to offend or discomfit; they're just saying what they see as true, which might happen to be offensive or discomfiting. And they're never any easier on themselves than they are on other people. In that first story, the waitress says of a co-worker, ''I was terribly in love with him, but we were separated by race and by the fact that he hated me.'' 
 I have heard some collections criticized for featuring stories that are too similar to one another in terms of setting, character or tone, and while I can imagine this criticism being leveled at ''Twenty Grand,'' it's not one with which I'd agree. In fact, I'm suspicious when stories in a collection aren't particularly similar because it makes them seem like soulless pastiche; if you want stories with entirely different sensibilities, why not just read books by different authors? With Curtis, there's no doubt you're entering the world of a particular writer's preoccupations. There are actually two kinds of stories here -- one realistic, the other surreal -- but even between these, there is much overlap. 
 The realistic stories usually feature a female protagonist who ranges in age from childhood to early adulthood, comes from a blue-collar family in rural New England, is often working a crummy job, and is an observant underdog. The second kind of story, which veers into the territory of allegory or fairy tale, also tends to have a girl or young woman as its main character, but here, instead of dealing with creepy bosses or rich, cold-hearted roommates, she must face down talking wolves or monsters with green and brown fur. +
 Tension propels both kinds of stories. Bad things happen to Curtis's characters; and even when you don't yet know what the bad thing will be, you feel it coming. In the surreal stories, the badness is concrete -- the wolves, the monsters -- but it's actually more powerful when it's less blatant. In ''Big Bear, California,'' a young woman living in a dorm for the summer does not lock her door when she climbs into bed one night, and she is intruded upon by an unbalanced-seeming law student whom she declined to kiss on their blind date the previous evening. The scene vibrates with the suspense of whether the student will physically accost her, suspense that Curtis underplays perfectly. In a later story, ''The Witches,'' a girl agrees to take a friend and the friend's boyfriend out on her stepfather's boat on prom night. When the friend climbs into the water for a swim, the question of what will happen to her makes it very hard not to skip ahead. 
 Personally, I find Curtis's realistic stories to be so much stronger than the surreal ones that I think this would have been a better book if the surreal ones had been omitted. Though surreal fiction has a kind of cult following -- among its most admired practitioners are Aimee Bender and Judy Budnitz -- in Curtis's case, the stories don't take advantage of her considerable gifts. They seem politically loaded in heavy-handed ways (one is about abortion; the narrators of two are mentally disabled), and they also seem satirical, though what they're satirizing isn't quite clear. Their cool hollowness -- perhaps it's irony -- implies that the person who wrote them has a facility with language but not much to say, which, for Curtis, obviously isn't true. 
 If Curtis's surreal stories are hardly more than sketches, the realistic ones are complex and bracing and ambitious, and perhaps most impressive, they are all these things without ever showing off. Indeed, much of what Curtis does best draws little attention to itself. Her dialogue is crisp and economical; her scenes are beautifully controlled without feeling overdetermined; and her characters are as nuanced as real people. She favors a spare, clear, colloquial style that's much harder to pull off than it looks. You rarely read a sentence and think, ''Oh, how exquisitely written!'' But you often think, ''My God, how true!''
 The greatness of Curtis's best stories far exceeds the mediocrity of her middling ones. If you're interested in the strangeness and sorrow of life -- in the small and large interactions that are sometimes horrifying, sometimes merely cringe-inducing and occasionally lovely -- you'll find much to admire in ''Twenty Grand.''

HEADLINE: A Part Made for Her, About Life With a Maid

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES
 AS the grande dame of Latin American actresses, Norma Aleandro is accustomed to having choice roles gravitate in her direction. Whether in the theater or on the screen, her participation is considered a near-guarantee of both artistic quality and box office success. 
 So it was with some apprehension that the director-screenwriter Jorge Gaggero, 37, approached Ms. Aleandro for his first feature-length film. He envisioned a small, intimate character piece, but he wasn't sure how Ms. Aleandro would react to the role he had written with her in mind: that of a once-affluent matron whose fortunes have taken a turn for the worse, complicating her prickly relationship with the maid who has worked in her home for decades.
 He needn't have worried. As soon as Ms. Aleandro, 71, read the script, she was won over.
 ''Here were two characters, both of them quite mature women, who seemed to have nothing to do with a young man,'' she recalled. ''He was writing about something he had not lived himself, but he was able to put convincing dialogue in the mouths of these two grown women, and that indicated to me he knew and understood human beings.'' 
 The result is ''Live-In Maid,'' which opens Wednesday at Film Forum in New York. Ms. Aleandro plays the imperious but insecure Beba Pujol, an aging divorcee who is trying with increasing difficulty to maintain appearances and the standard of living to which she is accustomed, even if it means not paying her loyal maid, Dora, for months at a time.
 ''All over Latin America, not just in Argentina, houses are designed with a room for a live-in maid, for women who postpone their own lives for the sake of others and become consumed by a household,'' Mr. Gaggero said. ''The relationship between a maid and her employer has elements of class conflict, but it is also symbiotic, and I felt that had never been adequately portrayed, either on television or in film.''
 Mr. Gaggero said the notion of ''Live-In Maid'' originated with his return to Argentina from Los Angeles in August 2001, just as the country was about to be plunged into its worst economic crisis in modern history. He had been studying at the American Film Institute for three years, but when he couldn't find work after he came back, he decided to occupy his time writing a script.
 ''Coming from outside, I was able to see things with a different perspective,'' he said. ''The reality was tragic, but there was also something comic about it, and I wanted to capture those extremes.''
 For Argentine audiences who saw ''Live-In Maid'' when it was released here as ''Cama Adentro'' to glowing reviews in 2005, a few passing references are enough to fix the story during the waning months of 2001. At the end of that year, the Argentine economy collapsed, millions of people had their life savings first frozen and then devalued, and in a chaotic two-week period five presidents held office.
 Given the situation swirling around Mr. Gaggero as he was writing, it is tempting to equate Beba's decadence and decline with that of Argentina. (Its economy has since come roaring back.) But both Mr. Gaggero and Ms. Aleandro emphasized that was not their intention.
 Any Argentine ''over the age of 40 has lived through various types of crises, from economic to coups, but I never saw this as a metaphor,'' Ms. Aleandro said in an interview in her home here. ''I'm not terribly enamored of the type of film or theater that carries political banners instead of letting people draw their own conclusions, especially when there is a whole world of personal relationships waiting to be recounted.''
 Class tensions and conflicts, however, were another matter. North Americans may be familiar with master-servant relationships primarily through British productions like ''Remains of the Day'' or ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' but in Latin America even lower-middle-class families often have a ''girl'' who cares for the children and lives with the family but is not formally a part of it.
 ''Mistress and maid live in parallel worlds, but the relationship is deep and intense,'' Ms. Aleandro said. In the case of Beba and Dora, she added, ''they are united forever in a strange, unspoken friendship'' that reflects ''an emotional necessity and dependence.''
 More than 100 women auditioned for the role of Dora, Ms. Aleandro's foil. Mr. Gaggero said the search ended the minute he met Norma Argentina, who had no previous acting experience but had worked as a maid for more than 20 years and had both the stolid dignity he was seeking for the character and the darker, indigenous features that are typical of many maids who work for the Europeanized elite here.
 ''The truth is that Norma Argentina was encouraged by her employer to come to the casting session, and when she called her family to tell them she was going to be in a movie with Norma Aleandro, they thought she was crazy,'' Mr. Gaggero said. ''The portrayals of maids you see on soap operas are often parodies, but Norma Argentina had different qualities, and when I brought her together with Norma Aleandro, they meshed right away.''
 Beba's world is one quite familiar to Ms. Aleandro. Her own home, behind a high red wall on a quiet residential street in the comfortable Belgrano neighborhood here, is barely a block from the building where much of ''Live-In Maid'' was filmed, and she has employed the same maid for more than 30 years.
 ''I was even able to come home for lunch'' during the shooting of ''Live-In Maid,'' she said. ''That's a luxury you rarely have in this profession.''
 Born into a family of actors, Ms. Aleandro played her first professional role at 13 and made her debut in the movies in 1952. The trajectory of her career continued steadily upward until 1976, when her outspoken political views enraged the military junta that had just seized power.
 ''First there was tear gas in the theater, then a bomb at my house and finally a phone call telling me, 'You have 24 hours to leave the country or we'll kill you,' '' she recalled. ''I didn't belong to any party or movement, but when I did interviews, I made statements about human rights and the general state of things. People were disappearing, and I said so.''
 She spent the next five years in Uruguay and Spain, a period she describes now as ''a disaster.'' But she returned before the dictatorship collapsed in 1982 to appear in the world premiere of the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa's play ''La Senorita de Tacna,'' in which she faced the challenge of playing the same character at the ages of 90 and 19.
 At the time her decision was hailed both as an act of defiance of the dictatorship and as the first sign of a cultural thaw. ''The rest of the cast was told not to stand near me when we came out to take our bows, just in case somebody tried to shoot me,'' she said. ''But by then, they could do nothing.''
 In the English-speaking world, Ms. Aleandro is probably best known for her role in ''The Official Story,'' which won an Academy Award as best foreign-language film in 1985 and also earned her the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival. In that movie, based on real events, she plays a teacher whose life falls apart when she discovers that the daughter she and her husband adopted as an infant is the child of political prisoners murdered by the military.
 The success of ''The Official Story'' drew Hollywood's attention to Ms. Aleandro, and she took advantage of the opportunities that came her way. She was nominated for an Oscar in 1988 as best supporting actress for her performance in ''Gaby: A True Story,'' played opposite Anthony Hopkins in ''One Man's War'' and appeared as Isabella Rossellini's mother in Joel Schumacher's ''Cousins'' before deciding to come home.
 ''It served me well -- I learned English and made friends -- but I wanted to reinsert myself here and do theater,'' she explained. ''I like the movies, but in the theater a performance keeps on growing because you can't tread the same path as the day before. It's like the difference between a musician making a recording and playing a live concert.''
 Over the years Ms. Aleandro has shown a special fondness for the classics, ranging from the Greeks and Lope de Vega to Ibsen and Chekhov. But she also revived ''La Senorita de Tacna'' in 2004, and she and Mr. Gaggero are now trying to adapt ''Live-In Maid'' as a play, which she would direct. For his part, Mr. Gaggero is preparing to film a movie about fear and crime among the bourgeoisie here, to be called ''La Seguridad de los Perros.'' At the same time he is working on a script for his first English-language movie, an adaptation of Richard Ford's novel ''Wildlife,'' a coming-of-age story set in Montana in the 1960s.
 As he was writing and filming ''Live-In Maid,'' Mr. Gaggero was also working on a documentary, ''Vida en Falcon,'' that examined the 2001 economic crisis from the masculine side. The main characters are two men who lose their jobs and homes and end up living in rickety Ford Falcons they have bought with the last of their savings.
 ''Both of these are stories that take place five blocks from where I live,'' Mr. Gaggero said. ''I am a great believer in looking, really looking at what's going on right under your nose. You don't have to go great distances to see classes, people and situations in interaction and conflict. All you have to do is go out on the street, and it's right there in front of you.''

HEADLINE: The Hit Maker of Barrow Street

BYLINE: By ROBERT SIMONSON

 BODY:
MOST of Scott Morfee's life takes place on a couple of blocks in Greenwich Village. When he's not at the Barrow Street Theater -- the 199-seat house he manages and where he has presented almost every show of his 10-year career as a producer -- he's at AOC, a regular hangout on Bleecker Street. There is an apartment somewhere in Park Slope, Brooklyn, but it's more of a crash pad than a center of operations. And while he occasionally takes in a Broadway show, he says he feels more comfortable in the cramped black-box theaters south of 14th Street.
 Mr. Morfee is an example of an almost extinct breed: the creative commercial Off Broadway producer. At a time when the Off Broadway model has been declared broken and financially unworkable, he continues to steer long-shot propositions into the Barrow Street.
 So far he has beaten the odds: his productions regularly win good reviews and eke out yearlong runs. ''When everyone else is screaming 'Disaster! Close it! It's over!,' Scott is piece by piece putting it together,'' said the playwright and actor Tracy Letts, whose plays ''Killer Joe'' and ''Bug'' were produced in New York by Mr. Morfee. 
 If you have ever visited the Barrow Street and seen one of the shows Mr. Morfee has mounted with his longtime producing partner Tom Wirtshafter -- Austin Pendleton's ''Orson's Shadow,'' Nilaja Sun's ''No Child ...'' and the improv act TJ & Dave among them -- you have probably seen him. He may be running the box office or taking tickets. On the opening night of his latest effort, the whimsical, quasi-documentary musical ''Gone Missing'' (yet another critical favorite) he was an usher. It's all part of a catch-all work ethic he drills into his staff and that he bases on a sign he once saw in a Montauk restaurant. It read: ''Piano player needed. Must have knowledge of shucking clams.''
 ''If you can't house-manage or run a box office, it doesn't matter how many other skills you have,'' he said. ''You can't work in our theater. Everybody has to do a little bit of everything.''
 That sounds like a piece of hardheaded office policy. But Mr. Morfee is an odd sort of businessman. He refers to breaking even as a ''home run.'' He avoids star casting. He'll read a playwright's entire output before deciding whether to produce one particular script. (''I'm interested in what they're after,'' he says.) His plays are packaged as open runs, not limited engagements that are constantly extended due to ''popular demand,'' because he considers the latter model dishonest. And Broadway is not an ambition; he refers to it as ''another city.''
 One has to ask: What makes Mr. Morfee run? ''I think part of it is stubbornness,'' Mr. Letts said. ''But part of it is, he remembers when Off Broadway was still vital, and he doesn't understand why it can't still be.''
 As well as anyone in the theater, Mr. Morfee, 52, can tell you what's ailing Off Broadway, from the lingering economic effects of 9/11 to the week-by-week way in which people now plan their lives to the distractions of a scrubbed-up Broadway. But even as he growls out the laundry list of plagues, one senses that he mistrusts the coroner's report.
 How else to explain his current programming spree, the most ambitious of his career? In addition to ''Gone Missing,'' whose run has just been extended to Sept. 16, Mr. Morfee is preparing for the 2007-8 season the New York premiere of ''When You Cure Me,'' a drama about the paralysis of a teenage rape victim written by the young British dramatist Jack Thorne. There's another show set for 2008, but Mr. Morfee, a superstitious man who's fearful of jinxing himself, will not disclose its title. The last show may go into a theater other than the Barrow, possibly running simultaneously with the Thorne work.
 To ask why he's taking on so many shows in lean, uncertain times is to ask a cat lover why he is about to adopt a 13th stray. ''There's a tremendous amount of high-quality work being done Off Broadway,'' he said. ''These plays need to be seen by more people. This is my whole point, an absolute mission of ours.'' 
 Mr. Morfee didn't begin his career as a producer in earnest until 1998, when he was 43. Before then, he did a lot of things, as you might expect of a guy who was twice kicked out of Miami University of Ohio for bad behavior. He worked on an Ohio River barge, in the circulation department of Time magazine and sold hot dogs at the United States Open. When he first moved to New York City in 1977, he bused tables at a Village restaurant, earning $125 a night. The waiters, most of whom were actors, told him about the TKTS half-price ticket booth. ''Basically, I'd never been to theater,'' he said. '' I had all this cash in my pocket.'' He saw shows on Broadway, at the Public Theater and at Circle Rep. ''It sort of consumed me.''
 But he didn't go into the theater business. He graduated from Pace University with a degree in marketing and worked at D-A-Y Public Relations, handling companies like Polaroid and Scott Paper. He was a vice president before he was 30, but after 10 years he was looking for something new. ''That's the moment when the theater happened to me,'' he recalled. ''I didn't happen to it.''
 The life-changing call came from the producer Darren Lee Cole, an old friend who had the rights to produce ''Killer Joe'' in New York. ''He said, 'Do you want to step up and co-produce?' '' Mr. Morfee remembered. He read Mr. Letts's play, a visceral black comedy about a trailer-trash murder plot, signed on and culled together $150,000 worth of small-time investors. Reviewers raved, and the show was a smash, selling out for months. Limousines idled outside the SoHo Playhouse. Mr. Morfee had a new profession. 
 Around this time Mr. Morfee met Mr. Wirtshafter, another neophyte producer. ''I like the way he produced,'' said Mr. Wirtshafter. ''He has a very good eye, and he gets along in a very appropriate way with people.'' Together, they opened Glen Berger's ''Underneath the Lintel,'' a quirky solo piece about a librarian tracking down the history of a book returned 123 years past due. The timing was not auspicious; it opened just after Sept. 11, 2001. But they fought week by week and managed to keep it open for more than a year. They've stuck together ever since. 
 It may come as a surprise to many who know Mr. Morfee that he even has a producing partner. Mr. Morfee's outspoken style -- he's criticized everyone from Rudolph W. Giuliani to the League of Broadway Theaters and Producers -- has made him the face of the Barrow Street. Mr. Wirtshafter, meanwhile, keeps a low profile, spending his days as a financial services consultant. 
 ''He's the show, and I'm the business,'' is how Mr. Wirtshafter, 53, puts it. It was Mr. Wirtshafter who realized ''the problem with the theater is the guy making all the money is the theater owner,'' leading the two to lease the Barrow Street. And he is the primary fund-raiser, some of those funds being his own. The pair's most recent shows, ''No Child ...'' and ''Gone Missing,'' were financed solely by the Barrow Street Theater Company and Mr. Wirtshafter.
 What both men have in common is their pride in the good they've done the playwrights they've produced. Whatever reputations Mr. Letts, Mr. Berger amd Mr. Pendleton enjoy are courtesy of their Barrow Street productions. Asked if he subscribes to the old-fashioned idea that the playwright is the soul of the theater, Mr. Morfee sharply answered ''Yes'' before the question was finished. 
 ''Scott's a great believer in his own tastes and instincts, and justifiably so,'' Mr. Pendleton said. ''Just about every play he's put up the past few years has worked. If he likes something, and it could possibly work, he puts his head down and goes for it. That's the way the commercial producers used to be.''

HEADLINE: The Boat Is About to Rock (Again) in Internet Video

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
DMITRY SHAPIRO brings an unlikely gadget into meetings these days: a TV remote control. 
 As chief executive of Veoh Networks, an Internet video company based in San Diego, Mr. Shapiro uses the remote to navigate the company's new software program, VeohTV, on his laptop. The software acts like a Web browser but displays only Internet video, presenting full-length television shows and popular clips from the Web's largest video sites, like NBC.com and YouTube. It lists those videos in a program guide and plays them in a small window or across the entire screen.
 The product, now in a private testing phase, will be available to the public later this year. It has the potential to be a popular and practical way to watch online video. But like a long line of other innovative high-tech tools, VeohTV could also threaten and alienate traditional media companies and even cause some of Veoh's Internet rivals to consider legal remedies. 
 For the last two years, Veoh Networks has operated a video-hosting Web site, Veoh.com. The site works much the way YouTube does, with a few notable exceptions. The company does not impose any time limits on the length of videos and does not use digital fingerprinting technology to filter out copyrighted material. That has led to some rights holders to complain that Veoh has fallen behind in protecting intellectual property.
 Nevertheless, Veoh.com has been growing fast: it draws about 15 million visitors a month, up from 4.5 million in January. Veoh Networks is a private company and does not release financial data. YouTube, by contrast, gets more than 100 million visitors and serves up more than three billion video clips a month, according to several market research firms.
 ''It's impossible to compete with YouTube as a video sharing site now,'' said Josh Bernoff, a vice president at Forrester Research. ''Veoh is a good example of a company that decided to go off in a new direction.''
 That direction is VeohTV. To support the new effort, the company raised about $26 million this summer from investors, includingTime Warner; Goldman Sachs; Spark Capital, a venture capital firm in Boston; and the former Disney chairman Michael D. Eisner, who joined the Veoh board and counsels Mr. Shapiro, a 38-year-old, Russian-born engineer. The company introduced VeohTV as a beta product last month, making it available for testing to a group of invited users. 
 I found VeohTV to be easy to use. Once the software is downloaded to a computer, it offers an easy-to-navigate directory of 114 video channels, including listings for CBS, NBC, Fox and YouTube. On the NBC channel, there are dozens of episodes of ''Heroes,'' ''30 Rock'' and ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.'' On the Fox channel, there are several full-length episodes of the dramas ''Bones'' and ''24.''
 Those shows are free and available for streaming on the NBC and Fox sites. The VeohTV player, Mr. Shapiro said, is just giving them a new audience. 
 ''There are full-length episodes at Fox.com, but many customers don't know how to find them,'' he said. ''The Web browser is fine for short clips. But if you just want to sit back and watch video on the Web, this is what you will want to use.''
 Major media companies, however, are more interested in protecting their copyrighted programs. Veoh does not ask for permission to play material from other Web sites, though Mr. Shapiro says he wants to strike advertising-sharing deals with content owners to ensure that shows appear in high-quality video. But Veoh does not think that it needs consent because VeohTV is doing nothing more than playing what is already online, including any commercials shown during the programs.
 The networks may disagree. By only offering video, VeohTV omits all the other advertisements on the network sites. For example, people who watched an episode of ''Heroes'' on NBC.com last week also saw for 40 minutes a banner ad for McDonald's on the same page. VeohTV users watching the same episode would not see the banner. 
 Rick Cotton, the executive vice president and general counsel of NBC Universal, said that streaming full-length television episodes drives traffic to other parts of NBC's site and exposes users to the ads on it. And the right to play those shows is valuable, he said, pointing to the still-unnamed venture between NBC Universal and the News Corporation to create an online repository of their TV shows and movies. Sites like MySpace, AOL and MSN have already entered into commercial agreements to display the venture's content. 
 ''This material has value,'' Mr. Cotton said. ''The notion of taking it and generating traffic with it needs to be negotiated and needs to be done with the agreement of content owners.'' That's why NBC and the other major studios are keeping close tabs on VeohTV's business model. 
 FOR some video content, VeohTV can act as a digital video recorder, turning a video stream -- meant to be viewed on the Web -- into a downloaded file on a user's hard drive. VeohTV users can record a YouTube video, for example, even though YouTube, owned by Google, says its terms of service specify that videos uploaded to the site will only be streamed.
 Other software, like the recently released RealPlayer 11, by RealNetworks, can turn streaming video into downloads as well. But according to Ricardo Reyes, a YouTube spokesman, VeohTV steers users away from its ads while violating YouTube's contract with its users. Mr. Reyes says the company is watching Veoh carefully. In response, Mr. Shapiro says his software provides an easier way to do something that is already technically possible on YouTube. 
 Mr. Shapiro and his backers are aware their product will disrupt current business models. So have many technological innovations in the past, he argued, and Veoh hopes to build a large audience while courting large media companies. That creates an apparent contradiction that will be hard to resolve. Veoh maintains that it does not need permission to list and play other companies' videos inside VeohTV. But it also wants to play nice.
 ''We are going to try to be friendly to content owners,'' said Todd Dagres, a partner at Spark Capital who serves on the Veoh board. ''We are going to try to be the white-hat company.''

HEADLINE: Getting a Boost Up the Ladder of Success

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TO begin, I am lying in a lavish sleeper bed in first class on a wonderful British Airways Boeing 777, heading from Heathrow to Dulles. I am the only person in first class who isn't asleep. Even my night owl wife-for-life is fast asleep on the bed next to me.
 I am happy because I just finished a pleasant two-week stay in Frankfurt, Berlin and London, working on a movie, staying in great hotels and eating amazing filet of sole. And I hardly had to pay for a penny of it. That was a big part of why I enjoyed it so much.
 I can't sleep, though, so I close my eyes and think about something soothing and reassuring -- namely, my late father, Herbert Stein. I think about him for a long time, and what comes to me is this: Almost everything I have I can trace back to my father and mother. To their efforts, to who they were, to their character. 
 For example -- and the list could go on forever -- here I am writing this column about economics and finance. But how do I know a tiny bit about them? Because my father was a learned economist who talked about it around the dinner table, along with my mother, who was also a highly educated economist. 
 Because my father and mother's close friend from grad school at the University of Chicago, C. Lowell Harriss, was my teacher for three economics classes at Columbia University and was especially kind to me, often walking with me for a long time after class to elaborate on what he had just been teaching. Because another great economics teacher at Barnard College, Robert Lekachman, was also a family friend and took extra time with me.
 And because I had grown up around economics, I just assumed that I could learn it and assimilate it, and so I had confidence in my abilities in the field. This led to my getting good grades and helped me get into Yale Law School and Yale's graduate school, where I studied with still more friends of my parents, like Henry Wallich and James Tobin.
 And how did I get started as a writer? Because I had written an essay about Richard Nixon and pop culture and did not have a clue about where to sell it. My mother and father were friends with the powers that be at the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, and that greased the skids there, during and after my time writing speeches about economics for Mr. Nixon and Gerald Ford at the White House. 
 And of course, I got my first full-time writing job there in good measure because my father was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Nixon from 1972 to 1974.
 From then on, I've been writing about economics, especially how it affects individuals.
 And what about my wife, the world's most nearly perfect human? Well, we met at the Junior Foreign Service Officers' Ball at the State Department on July 4, 1966. I was there because my father had gotten me some consideration as a summer intern at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, now defunct, at the State Department. If I had not gotten that job, who knows?
 How did I get my start as a performer in front of the camera? Well, here we go again. It was from a chain of connections I made starting in 1973 at a Yom Kippur breaking of the fast at the home of William Safire, then a Nixon speech writer and fast friend -- and later pallbearer -- of my father's. His wife, Helene, was a close friend of my mother's.
 So all of it can be traced back to the help of my father and mother: the first-class seat, the wife next to me, the fact that I am writing this at all.
 Now, there's a point to all this. I write mostly about investments, and they are important. But for most people everywhere, their livelihood comes primarily from working. Their success depends largely on a combination of education, ability, work habits and connections. If you are like me and a great many other people who fly first class, you started out with some connections and made the most of them, or at least made something of them.
 When I consider my friends who are extremely successful (much more successful than I am), many of them were given a big push in their education and career from family members.
 But what if you don't have a well-connected father? What if you don't have a well-connected mother? What if you don't have a father at all? What if you are an immigrant without any connections, with parents who barely speak English, if at all? What do you do? 
 What if you are a young man or woman who has some talent and ambition but little or no idea of how to get onto the ladder? To tell you the truth, I am not at all sure what you do.
 But I do know that there is a large class of baby boomers who have done well in their financial lives. They are retiring now and looking for things to do to help the community that gave so much to them.
 I KNOW that I have beaten this drum before, but let me beat it again. I wonder whether there is some well-organized human being in the government or private sector who could create an organization that would go into schools on a continuing basis and teach people how careers are made. I wonder whether there could be some link with teachers in schools in nonrich neighborhoods who could tell helpful men and women about boys and girls who need mentors to get them going into higher education and entry-level jobs, and then to counsel them about how to behave on the job and in school.
 I keep thinking that if the big hedge funds and investment banks and private investment firms deployed even a tiny fraction of their ability to help boys and girls, and if they really are as effective as they seem to be, and if they worked with retired boomers looking to make a difference, they could do a lot.
 There is an immense problem of inequality in this country. It is getting worse, not better. It cannot be solved entirely by tax policy. And it certainly cannot be solved by monetary policy. But we could take a stab at it, even if it's a small stab, by sharing the skills and connections that some of us have -- and were born with -- with those young people who have what it takes in the cerebral cortex but need an outside connection.
 My father was one of those kids. His mentor was a professor at Williams College named F. Taylor Ostrander. His friendship and support of my pop changed his life. What if there were a league of Taylor Ostranders out there? It would not change everything for everyone, but it would change life for some, and that's a good day's work.

HEADLINE: Fair Taxes? Depends What You Mean by 'Fair'

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President Bush and is advising Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
DO the rich pay their fair share in taxes? This is likely to become a defining question during the presidential campaign.
 At a recent fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett said that rich guys like him weren't paying enough. Mr. Buffett asserted that his taxes last year equaled only 17.7 percent of his taxable income, compared with about 30 percent for his receptionist. 
 Mr. Buffett was echoing a refrain that is popular in some circles. Last year, Robert B. Reich, labor secretary during the Clinton administration, wrote on his blog that ''middle-income workers are now paying a larger share of their incomes than people at or near the top.'' 
 ''We have turned the principle of a graduated, progressive tax on its head,'' Mr. Reich added.
 These claims are enough to get populist juices flowing. The problem with them is that they don't hold up under close examination.
 The best source for objective data on the distribution of the tax burden is the Congressional Budget Office. The C.B.O. goes beyond anecdotes and bald assertions to provide hard data on who pays taxes. One can argue about the details of its methods, but there is no doubt that it is nonpartisan and that its tax analysts are some of the best in the business.
 The C.B.O.'s most recent calculations of federal tax rates show a highly progressive system. (The numbers are based on 2004 data, but the tax code has not changed much since then.) The poorest fifth of the population, with average annual income of $15,400, pays only 4.5 percent of its income in federal taxes. The middle fifth, with income of $56,200, pays 13.9 percent. And the top fifth, with income of $207,200, pays 25.1 percent. 
 At the very top of the income distribution, the C.B.O. reports even higher tax rates. The richest 1 percent has average income of $1,259,700 and forks over 31.1 percent of its income to the federal government.
 One might wonder how Mr. Buffett gets away with a tax rate of only 17.7 percent, while a typical millionaire is paying so much more. Most likely, part of the answer is that Mr. Buffett's income is made up largely of dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at only 15 percent. By contrast, many other top earners pay the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 35 percent on their salaries, bonuses and business income.
 The distinction is crucial for understanding how much the rich pay. Indeed, the share of top incomes coming from capital is much lower now than it has been historically. According to Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, for the richest Americans -- those in the top 0.01 percent of the distribution -- the percentage of income derived from capital fell to 25 percent in 2004 from 70 percent in 1929. 
 If your image of the typical rich person is someone who collects interest and dividend checks and spends long afternoons relaxing on his yacht, you are decades out of date. The leisure class has been replaced by the working rich.
 Another piece of the puzzle is that Mr. Buffett's tax burden is larger than it first appears, because he is a major shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway.
 When the C.B.O. studies the tax burden, it includes all federal taxes, including individual income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate income taxes. In its analysis, payroll taxes are borne by workers, and corporate taxes by the owners of capital. For the richest 1 percent of the population, 9.3 percentage points of their 31.1 percent tax rate comes from the taxes that corporations have paid on their behalf. The corporate tax would undoubtedly loom large if the C.B.O. were to calculate Mr. Buffett's effective tax rate.
 None of these calculations, however, say whether the rich are paying their fair share. Fairness is not an economic concept. If you want to talk fairness, you have to leave the department of economics and head over to philosophy.
 The quintessential political philosopher of modern liberalism is John Rawls, the author of the 1971 classic ''A Theory of Justice.'' Professor Rawls concluded that the primary goal of public policy should be to redistribute resources to help those at the very bottom of the economic ladder. If Professor Rawls were alive today, he would most likely want to raise the top income tax rate of 35 percent in order to finance a more generous safety net. And for much the same reason, he would probably raise taxes on the middle class as well.
 Professor Rawls would get a vigorous debate from his Harvard colleague, the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick. In his 1974 book, ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia,'' Professor Nozick wrote: ''We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by someone who now makes last-minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting. There is no central distribution, no person or group entitled to control all the resources, jointly deciding how they are to be doled out. What each person gets, he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a gift. In a free society, diverse persons control different resources, and new holdings arise out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons.'' 
 To libertarians like Professor Nozick, requiring the rich to pay more just because they are rich is little more than officially sanctioned theft.
 There is no easy way to bridge this philosophical divide, but the political process will, inevitably, try to forge a practical compromise among those with wildly divergent views. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, the candidate George W. Bush made clear where he stood: ''On principle, no one in America should have to pay more than a third of their income to the federal government.'' As judged by the C.B.O. data, he has accomplished his goal.
 A question for any political candidate today is whether he or she agrees with the Bush tax ceiling. If not, how high above a third is he or she willing to go?

 BODY:
Of all the campaign themes that will emerge leading up to the 2008 primaries, one you probably won't hear a lot about is experience. That's because the candidates who are at the moment best positioned for the nominations of their parties have surprisingly little of it. At a time when the nation looks for a leader to meet profound challenges to its decades-long dominance as an economic and military power, the five candidates who lead in state and national polls -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney -- have won a grand total of five statewide elections in their cumulative political careers and have served a combined 20 years in statewide office. (Fred Thompson, who may soon be among the leaders in the Republican field, served eight years in the Senate.) In fact, the executive with the longest tenure in the group is Giuliani, who would be the first mayor in history to ascend to the presidency without holding some higher office first. 
Meanwhile, candidates with long careers spent mastering foreign and domestic policy, like Joe Biden and John McCain, have been flailing. In a round of television ads that feel more like a cry for help than a campaign pitch, Bill Richardson -- the two-term governor of New Mexico and a former congressman, U.N. ambassador and energy secretary -- sits in a drab office somewhere (Iowa, perhaps?), enthusiastically showing off his resume while a clueless middle manager, entirely uninterested, rushes him along.
This dynamic would seem, at least at this very early stage of the campaign, to presage a significant break with the past. Through the long decades that saw the rise and fall of American industry and the cold war, serious contenders for the presidency could generally boast of distinguished careers in statewide or federal office. Ronald Reagan served two terms as California's governor before he was finally elected president at the age of 69; George H. W. Bush had twice been vice president, following stints as a diplomat and C.I.A. director; Bill Clinton had been elected to five terms as governor of Arkansas, after serving as the state's attorney general. There have been exceptions, of course, most notably Jimmy Carter, whose paltry experience -- a single term as governor of Georgia -- seemed like the right antidote to the disillusionment of Watergate. (It wasn't.) At no time in modern history, however, have the crowded fields of both parties been so dominated by relative newcomers.
 George W. Bush's legion of critics would probably assert that he alone lowered the bar for presidential preparedness, and this theory has some merit; having served just one full term as governor of a huge state before he ran in 2000, Bush was the least experienced nominee in 24 years. But American politics can never be viewed in isolation from the rest of society, and something deeper has been happening out there. The emergence of the Internet age has been accompanied, in general, by a steady devaluing of expertise. A generation ago, you went to the doctor to find out about the pain in your knee; now you go to WebMD, diagnose it yourself and tell him what medicines you want. People used to trust stockbrokers and insurance agents; now they buy and sell at E*Trade and compare policies online. American voters who once looked to newspaper columnists for guidance on politics now blog their own idle punditry. Suddenly, experience is downright suspect -- it's the barrier that so-called professionals use to wall themselves off from everyone else. Americans now belong to what the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Andrew Keen calls ''the cult of the amateur,'' and, in this new world, the ideal president may be one who hasn't governed, or at least not for long.
 Experience, after all, hasn't proved to be much of an asset among baby-boomer politicians, whose long history waging the same ideological struggles makes them less able, not more, to transcend stalemate. Today most of the leading presidential candidates have other kinds of experience that are arguably just as relevant to the presidency as years logged in statehouses or the Capitol -- living at the White House, running the Olympics, locking up white-collar criminals. Obama, who leads the field in financial contributions, would set a new precedent for inexperience in the White House; he was a state senator only three years ago, when he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic convention, and before that he was a community organizer. But in a country where the average American is now said to change careers something like three times, it's probably unhealthful to expect our most capable leaders to spend their adult lives campaigning at state fairs and mastering Robert's Rules of Order.
 Then again, there are reasons to think that accumulated wisdom really does matter. Bush the Decider campaigned on the premise that a good president, like a C.E.O., need only be able to judge shrewdly among policy options A, B and C. But his presidency illuminates that running a White House isn't, in fact, a simple multiple-choice test; a president's advisers often disagree not only on the means of achieving their goals but also on the goals themselves, and a president has to filter out competing ideologies before he can clearly see the options laid before him. 
 Experience is what prepares presidents to stand by their convictions even when experts urge them not to, like Johnson's signing the Voting Rights Act, or Harry Truman's integrating the Armed Services. It is also what enables presidents to recognize when compromise -- even odious compromise -- is the last, best option, as Bill Clinton did on welfare reform. Lacking that kind of expertise, George W. Bush never did seem to master the balance between principle and pragmatism, the veteran politician's art of when to build bridges and when to burn them. Whoever gets the nominations next year will want to study Bush's experience closely -- if only because they may not be able to count on their own. 
 THE SELF-DOUBTING FIRST PRESIDENT
 He then entered on a more explicit disclosure of the state of his mind, observing that he could not believe or conceive himself anywise necessary to the successful administration of the Government; that, on the contrary, he had from the beginning found himself deficient in many of the essential qualifications, owing to his inexperience in the forms of public business, his unfitness to judge of legal questions and questions arising out of the Constitution; that others more conversant in such matters would be better able to execute the trust. .. .James Madison's memorandum of a conversation with 
 George Washington, May 5, 1792
 What Does It Take?
 There is not one leading presidential candidate with a lot of aWshington experience.

HEADLINE: Strategists As Stars

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 AFTER John McCain discovered that his campaign was nearly broke -- at a time when he was already hemorrhaging in public opinion polls -- he did what presidential candidates in trouble always seem to do: he forced out his top consultants. 
 The unmistakable message of this bloodletting was that Mr. McCain's woes were not caused by Mr. McCain, or his opponents, or being out of sync with the times, but rather the bad work by his blue-chip stable of advisers. Terry Nelson, his campaign manager, and John Weaver, his senior adviser, walked out the door Tuesday morning, and, with a new team in charge, Mr. McCain headed for New Hampshire to try to resuscitate his campaign.
 But this shakeup raises a question that has hovered over American campaigns in the 25 years since the rise of the celebrity political consultant: Are these advisers really as important as they would like us, and their clients, to think? Have they ever been? 
 There is little doubt that consultants -- a catchall describing strategists, pollsters, ad makers, managers and media advisers -- are an integral part of defining who the candidate is and presenting the candidate's ideas to the public. This goes from critical decisions like settling on the phrase that defines a candidacy (President Bush as the ''compassionate conservative,'' for example) to whipping up a quick response to a crisis, or even determining the official color of campaign bumper stickers.
 But consultants are not the candidate. And for all the attention paid to them, they rarely, if ever, determine whether a candidate wins the election. Mr. McCain is not the first flailing presidential candidate to dump a few consultants. Bob Dole, who was running in the Republican primaries, left two of them on a airport tarmac in Jacksonville, Fla., in 1988. But the upheaval probably says more about Mr. McCain's state of mind than about his prospects of being the next president.
 ''They are totally overvalued,'' said Mark McKinnon, who was President Bush's media adviser and part of Mr. McCain's stable for a while this year. ''The problem with the John McCain campaign wasn't Terry Nelson and John Weaver. It was immigration and Iraq.''
 ''The problem with political consulting is you don't need a license or a degree,'' Mr. McKinnon added. ''Anyone can just show up with a camcorder. It is the ultimate in hackery -- for which I am perfectly suited.'' 
 Nelson Warfield, a media consultant advising Fred Thompson, a likely Republican presidential candidate, said: ''How are important are they? I think in a presidential race there are larger dynamics at work than some guy can fix by telling you how to part your hair.''Consultants have been around presidential candidates almost as long as there have been presidential candidates. But as news coverage of campaigns moved from the public stage to internal workings -- scrutiny encouraged by behind-the-scenes books like ''The Selling of the President'' by Joe McGinniss about the 1968 race -- operatives increasingly found themselves sharing a moment on the evening news with the candidate.
 The first glimmers of this era came with Patrick Caddell, the colorful South Carolinian pollster who advised Jimmy Carter in 1976. The phenomenon was established when Lee Atwater took a high-profile role in the election of George H. W. Bush in 1988. By 1992, it seemed only natural that a documentary film portrayed the deliberations of James Carville, Paul Begala and George Stephanopoulos as they helped elect Bill Clinton.
 Consultants have encouraged a culture that deifies them, happy to be the subject of prominent profiles in the pages of the Style section of The Washington Post or The New York Times Magazine. (The hot consultant this year? David Axelrod, his steady hand at the helm of Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign.) They appreciate that the adulation translates into business, not to mention book and Hollywood contracts. Political correspondents -- including yours truly -- are just as guilty: we are the enablers who eagerly grab the colorful if facile narratives provided by consultants who are often more colorful than the candidate.
 Dennis W. Johnson, a professor of political science at George Washington University and an expert on consultants, said their ascendance is, historically speaking, a relatively contemporary occurrence and, he hoped, a passing one. ''James Carville, Lee Atwater and Karl Rove come to the fore: these are people known to the general public,'' he said. ''Everyone else in the business is rightly anonymous.''
 The cast, though, is really larger than that. Dick Morris, the former consultant to the Clintons, has a newspaper column and is a fixture on cable TV shows. Bob Shrum, a senior adviser to Senator John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000, just wrote a memoir recounting his years as a consultant. Mr. Carville and his wife, Mary Matalin, the Republican consultant, are as likely to be recognized walking into a Washington restaurant as an actual former presidential candidate.
 For all the attention, the last few years have not been particularly good to political consultants. Mr. McCain's campaign imploded even though he recruited some of the best and the brightest advisers, including an infusion of talent from the White House political operation. 
 If Mr. Rove, the embodiment of the species, was responsible for elevating the consultant's status to ever new heights, he may prove responsible for its diminishment as well. Hailed as the genius behind Mr. Bush's presidential victories and the Republican gains in 2000 and 2004, Mr. Rove now carries the burden of a 2006 election that cost his party control of Congress and called into question the political theories that are his stock in trade. And his unorthodox decision, for a consultant, to play such a prominent role in the White House means that he is now integrally linked to the travails of the second-term Bush presidency.
 Mr. Shrum's book could prove an unwelcome legacy for consultants, as well, since he recounts potentially damaging details involving clients like John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat. Candidates may now think twice about how much to open up to a paid consultant whose next check might come from a publisher. 
 It has always been an oversimplification to say that consultants are the architects of success or failure. The roles are more subtle. 
 Mr. Weaver may not always have given Mr. McCain the best advice: in retrospect, reaching out to religious conservatives in a speech at Jerry Falwell's university was not the best political move of the year given Mr. McCain's history of attacking this wing of the Republican Party, a stand that strengthened his position with moderate voters. But Mr. Weaver was a calming presence to Mr. McCain on the campaign trail.
 Mr. Carville, Mr. Begala and Mr. Stephanopoulos were advisers who meshed, ideologically and stylistically, with Mr. Clinton. ''That sign, 'It's the economy, stupid,' was for Clinton -- not for the staff,'' Mr. Shrum said, referring to the advice Mr. Carville posted in the campaign's war room. 
 Mr. Begala, recalling his years on the Clinton campaign, said: ''I think that's why Clinton hired us. He wanted an extension of his own personality.''
 In 1988, Mr. Atwater ran, and became identified with, the brutal contest against Michael S. Dukakis, who was governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Atwater, more than Mr. Bush, drew criticism for that campaign, which no doubt suited both Mr. Atwater and Mr. Bush fine at the time. (''Oh, that's all history,'' Mr. Bush said of his campaign after he won.)
 And consultants serve other, less obvious roles. 
 The hiring of Mr. Carville and Mr. Begala by Mr. Clinton in 1992, and Mr. Shrum by Mr. Kerry in 2004, provided a burst of legitimacy and fund-raising for both candidates.
 Professor Johnson, for one, said he found it odd that such stock was given to consultants -- Mr. Shrum ultimately has taken more than a little of the blame for Mr. Kerry's loss -- and suggested that perhaps, finally, consultants would return to the side of the stage, where they once stood and where, he said, they belonged.
 ''We're always going to have consultants but they are going to be anonymous and that is how it should be,'' he said. ''This should be a contest between the candidates.''

Los Angeles
 AMID the debates -- and the looming deadline -- over Mayor Michael Bloomberg's congestion pricing plans for the city, one recent traffic measure has caused little uproar: increased fines ($115) for drivers who block the box. Indeed, many New Yorkers support the mayor's plan, which means that not just regular police officers, but also the city's more than 2,800 traffic agents have the authority to hand out tickets for an infraction known as blocking the box. And why not? Few things enrage travelers more than the driver who blocks the intersection, intensifying the already suffocating traffic congestion. 
 But the truth is that while this plan may satisfy revenge fantasies and increase city coffers, it won't loosen gridlock's grip. It may even tighten it. 
 Blocking the box isn't a law enforcement issue that Mayor Bloomberg can address by simply having traffic agents mete out punishment. It's a traffic management issue that represents political neglect of the road network. Drivers aren't letting their cars sit in the cross hairs of oncoming traffic out of spite. They don't relish the cursing, honking and fist shaking aimed at them. Like everyone else in the standstill, they'd prefer to be moving. But there's just nowhere to go.
 Much of Manhattan's congestion stems from vehicles passing through the island on their way to destinations outside or on the outskirts of the borough. These travelers would love to bypass most or all of Manhattan, but the roadway network won't allow it. Instead it crams motorists together, turning crosstown travelers into box blockers. 
 So, here's the question: If straphangers can choose between local and express service, why can't motorists? In cities all over the world and even in the United States, drivers can choose to drive up and over intersections on humps called queue jumpers, or they can duck under intersections through short tunnels. 
 Queue jumpers and tunnels could make for a good fit in many spots throughout New York because they operate within existing rights of way. They can also be configured for many different types of roads, from two-lanes on a one-way street (sending one lane over the intersection) to streets with six or more lanes. 
 Just take a look at how effective the Murray Hill Tunnel is at bypassing traffic. The tunnel, which carries two lanes of car traffic from East 33rd Street to East 41st Street, is a great way to avoid the congestion of Park Avenue. Now imagine more of these tunnels and some well-placed queue jumpers and soon you're traveling across town, dodging red lights. 
 Cities like Paris, Sydney, Melbourne, Tokyo and even Tampa, Fla., have upgraded beyond queue jumpers to provide longer under- and aboveground motorways. Granted, much of the metropolitan region is packed with subway and train tunnels and other utilities, but elevated facilities need only airspace, and wide swaths of subterranean space remain uncluttered.
 Consider the western edge of Manhattan, where there are no serious underground obstructions from the Battery to the George Washington Bridge. Various east-west streets are also free of subway tunnels. In the book ''Street Smart,'' one contributor, Peter Samuel, makes a sensible suggestion: construct a truck-only tunnel that would take many lane-cloggers off surface streets. ''It would feed a north-south truckway spine along the west side of Manhattan, with short east-west spurs,'' he writes.
 Gridlock hasn't grown fiercer because drivers have become ruder and simply no longer care if they block the box. Rather, clogged intersections represent a symptom of congestion's root cause: political neglect. 
 For decades, officials have failed to upgrade the road network to keep up with a swelling population. Mayor Bloomberg has said that the city will grow by 900,000 people by 2030; if this neglect continues, it will generate even more gridlock. Over the next 20 years city forecasters expect automobile traffic to grow by 10 percent and freight traffic to increase by 64 percent. But of the mayor's 16 major transportation recommendations in the city's long-range plan, not one would significantly increase the road system's capacity. 
 Mayor Bloomberg's ironfisted approach to intersection blockers not only allows an outdated roadway system to grow more antiquated, it may also erode support for congestion pricing. Cities like London and Stockholm have found it easier to sell the public on congestion pricing when road projects are a part of the deal, and New York should follow suit. After all, most of those who would pay the $8 congestion toll -- if the plan is approved by Albany in time to meet tomorrow's federal deadline for a grant of about $500 million for the program -- aren't out-of-towners, they're the mayor's own constituents. 
 As we await news from Albany, many remain suspicious of congestion pricing, and they won't take kindly to additional measures that cast drivers as scapegoats. Promising to devote some congestion pricing money to building queue jumpers may win over fence-sitting motorists, not to mention bus riders who would enjoy bona fide express service.

HEADLINE: Aid to Pakistan For Tribal Areas Raises Concerns

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: GHALANAI, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The United States plans to pour $750 million of aid into Pakistan's tribal areas over the next five years as part of a ''hearts and minds'' campaign to win over this lawless region from Qaeda and Taliban militants. 
 But even before the plan has been fully carried out, documents and officials involved in the planning are warning of the dangers of distributing so much money in an area so hostile that oversight is impossible, even by Pakistan's own government, which faces rising threats from Islamic militants. 
 Who will be given the aid has quickly become one of the most contentious questions between local officials and American planners concerned that millions might fall into the wrong hands. The local political agents and tribal chiefs in this hinterland on the Afghan border have for years accommodated the very groups the American and Pakistani governments seek to drive out. 
 A closely scripted visit to the hospital here, used for a pilot project by the United States Agency for International Development, showed the challenges on full display. The one-story hospital here was virtually empty on a recent day. 
 Local people had no way to get there. Three of the 110 beds were occupied. Two operating tables had not been used in months. Many doctors had left because the pay was too meager and security too precarious, said Dr. Yusuf Shah, the chief surgeon. 
 Sher Alam Mahsud, the local political boss who escorted this reporter on a rare visit, said he wanted all the American aid money ''delivered to us.'' But the precarious security does not allow the Americans to assess the aid priorities firsthand, or to provide oversight for the first installment of $150 million allocated by the Bush administration. 
 ''Delivering $150 million in aid to the tribal areas could very quickly make a few people rich and do almost nothing to provide opportunity and justice to the region,'' said Craig Cohen, the author of a recent study of United States-Pakistan relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Yet it is here in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or FATA, as the region is formally called, that Washington is intent on using the development aid as a counterinsurgency tool, according to a draft of the Agency for International Development plan given to The New York Times by an official who worked on it. 
 The draft warns that the ''severe governance deficiencies'' in the tribal areas will make it virtually impossible for the aid to be sustainable or to overcome the ''area's chronic underdevelopment and consequent volatility.'' 
 The ambitious plan was publicly highlighted during a visit to Pakistan in June by Richard A. Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, as a measure of Washington's support for Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. 
 ''The objective driving this decision is the hope that by bringing the FATA into the mainstream and assuring that basic human services and infrastructure are on par with the rest of Pakistan, the people of FATA would be less likely to welcome the presence of Al Qaeda and Taliban,'' the draft states. The projects include health and education services, water and sanitation facilities, and agricultural development, it says, making clear that these are a means to a broader end. ''The main goal of the United States government in relation to the FATA is counterterrorism,'' it says.
 One way to improve the chances of the aid's efficacy would be greater emphasis on political reform in the tribal areas, according to the draft. The Pakistani government has created a panel to study reform of the political structure in the areas, the draft noted, adding that ''Usaid should explore opportunities for contributing its substantial experience in local government capacity building to any reform efforts the government of Pakistan decide to undertake.'' 
 Even if the tribal areas were not under the sway of the Taliban, which they increasingly are, the development challenge here would be steep enough, the document and interviews make clear. 
 The area, home to 3.2 million people, remains a desolate landscape where women are strictly veiled. Female literacy -- at 3 percent -- is among the lowest in the world. Schools are often used to run businesses. There is no banking system. Smuggling of opium and other contraband is routine. 
 The hostility to almost anything that smacks of foreign influence is such that money from the modest development agency program, administered by the charity Save the Children at the hospital here, was being delivered anonymously, undercutting any potential public relations benefit for the United States. 
 ''We can't do branding,'' said Fayyaz Ali Khan, the program manager for Save the Children, in an interview in the city of Peshawar. ''Usually we say the aid comes from the American people, but here we can't.'' 
 Suspicions about modern medicine are rife. A Pakistani doctor was blown up in his car in June after trying to counter the anti-vaccine propaganda of an imam in Bajaur, one of the tribal agencies, Pakistani officials said. 
 The Pakistani government has virtually no authority here. After years of fighting to assert its authority, at the cost of about 600 soldiers, it negotiated peace accords with tribal authorities that have all but confined Pakistani troops to their barracks. 
 Tribal elders, local imams and governors known as political agents -- their title goes back to the British colonial days -- are the on-the-ground arbiters of all decisions in many districts. The political agents are widely considered corrupt. 
 A senior American official in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, who would not speak for attribution, defended the plan's goals as necessary and achievable. The official said that ''Pakistani firms, consulting organizations and nongovernmental organizations'' would be the main deliverers of the assistance.
 The official said, referring to the international aid agency, that these would in turn be ''managed under Usaid direct contracts and grants to American and international organizations.'' 
 Mr. Cohen, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was skeptical. Almost every potential recipient of the money was suspect in the eyes of the people it was supposed to help, he said. ''The notion that there's going to be $150 million a year to Pakistani nongovernmental organizations who are going to be out in the open seems naive to me,'' he said.
 ''The insecurity of the area will require a heavy reliance on local partners'' like Pakistani nongovernmental organizations to administer projects, he added. ''But the nongovernmental organizations don't trust the military, the military doesn't trust the tribal chiefs, and the tribal chiefs won't trust us unless they're getting a cut of the money.'' 
 Such Pakistani groups were often targets of the Islamic militants in the tribal areas. The militants are increasingly destroying CD shops and attacking small efforts to gain advantages for women. 
 Mr. Mahsud, the political agent for the tribal agency, or district, of Mohmand, where the hospital is, had his own ideas. Any aid money from Western donors should be ''pooled here,'' he said, during an interview at the FATA secretariat headquarters in Peshawar, meaning it should be distributed through local officials. 
 His power was evident when he drove in his impressive new four-wheel-drive vehicle through the heavy metal black gates that mark the boundary to his tribal agency. Armed men in heavy gray uniforms, wearing black felt berets in the summer heat, snapped to attention. 
 The hospital itself was barren, and silent. Dr. Shah, the chief surgeon, and other doctors who had come to the hospital for the visit of an outsider, said water was a luxury trucked in by tanker, arriving at best every other day.
 One doctor, Aaquila Khan, brimmed with passion about helping the poor and feeble women who came to visit the woefully underequipped hospital, but she lives in Peshawar, more than an hour's drive away, and so comes in just two or three days a week, mornings only, to treat those female patients. 
 ''They are very much anemic,'' she said of eight women she treated during a recent visit. ''They are not educated, they are not aware of family planning, they have no money.'' Only the women living within walking distance could come, she said. 
 The aid program run by Save the Children, a small $11 million starter project that hints at the bigger things planned by the Americans, formally began last December with a signing of a memorandum of understanding with the tribal authorities. 
 The idea is for Pakistani doctors to train health care workers who will go into the field and train traditional health assistants on more modern methods. 
 But the first training sessions have only just begun, said Mr. Khan, the program manager for Save the Children. The only sign of the program was a ''resource room'' with a large blond wood table and a dozen or so chairs still in their plastic wrapping. 
 The training sessions take place in Peshawar, over the tribal boundary, to ensure the safety of the doctors.

HEADLINE: Casinos Booming In Katrina's Wake As Cash Pours In

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss. 

 BODY:
This seaside gambling resort along a stretch of the Gulf Coast, sometimes called the ''redneck Riviera,'' has 40 percent fewer hotel rooms and only two-thirds as many slot machines as it did before Hurricane Katrina. A major bridge that connects the casinos in this popular tourist destination to Alabama, the Florida Panhandle and other points east remains closed, and Mayor A. J. Holloway estimates that as many as 15 percent of the city's pre-Katrina residents still have not returned.
 Yet business in the gambling halls of Biloxi has reached all-time highs in recent months, so much so that Larry Gregory, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, has half-jokingly barred his staff from uttering the phrase ''record-setting'' because ''it was becoming too redundant.'' 
 A similar story has been unfolding in New Orleans, where tourism is still in the doldrums and only 60 percent of the pre-Katrina population has returned nearly two years after the hurricane and flooding devastated the area. 
 Indeed, the casinos there seem to be faring even better than their Gulf Coast cousins.
 Harrah's New Orleans, the largest casino in the city, is on pace for its best year ever: gambling revenue is up 13.6 percent through the first five months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2005, pre-Katrina.
 The casinos in this region are generating more revenue -- from significantly fewer players -- in large part because of the extra money that many area residents have in their pockets and fewer alternatives on where to spend it, casino executives and others in the region say. 
 ''There's been this huge infusion of cash into the local economy,'' said Bob Mahoney, the co-owner of Mary Mahoney's Old French House restaurant in Biloxi. ''Federal money has poured into the area. Insurance money has poured in. And wages have gone up considerably given the demand for workers.''
 That demand, Mr. Mahoney said, means he now pays a starting dishwasher $8.50 an hour rather than $6; a $12-an-hour construction worker typically earns $20 an hour or more now. 
 But just because people here have more money does not mean they feel particularly good about their situation. Far from it. 
 ''It's like a barroom,'' said Ted Lewis, 48, a case manager at a New Orleans homeless shelter who started coming to Harrah's only after the casino's reopening in early 2006. ''When times are bad, people come to release stress. They drink, they gamble.'' 
 They do indeed. Boomtown New Orleans, for instance, a casino on the edge of the city that was not flooded, booked $83 million in profit last year, nearly triple its pre-Katrina best. Here in Biloxi, even with two fewer casinos operating through the first half of the year, gamblers lost $428.3 million in the first five months of the year, compared with $418.7 during the same period in 2005. 
 Locals now abound at the gambling centers. Gary W. Loveman, the chief executive of Harrah's Entertainment, said that before Katrina, roughly three out of every four people gambling at his company's New Orleans property was a tourist; today the majority are from the city or the surrounding area, including a number of construction workers drawn to the area and other temporary residents.
 ''With all the bowling alleys and social clubs and churches and favorite restaurants that aren't there,'' Mr. Loveman said, ''we're getting a much larger share of the discretionary spend.''
 To gambling critics like the Rev. Tom Grey, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, this new reliance on locals demonstrates that the region's casinos are ''predators feasting on the suffering and misery of an area that has seen more than enough suffering and misery.''
 Casino executives say they are just giving people a place to go for diversion. Meanwhile, perhaps their biggest challenge is to talk about their success without betraying too much glee, given the pain, financial and otherwise, still being felt by virtually every other industry in town. 
 ''Certainly we need to be sensitive to all that people have gone through,'' Mr. Loveman said, even as he described himself as ''very pleased'' that his company has ''done exceedingly well at Harrah's New Orleans.'' 
 To help capture as much of the population's idle cash as possible, Harrah's has been aggressively marketing its casino to locals -- a population, Mr. Loveman said, that the property had ''not paid much attention to'' in the past. 
 At Harrah's, the number of players is down 20 percent to 30 percent for the first five months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2005. Over all, the casinos dotting the Mississippi Gulf Coast recorded 30 percent fewer visitors in the first quarter of 2007 compared with the same period two years earlier. 
 Craig Williams, 32, is a typical customer. He used to spend a lot of his off-hours working on his house in New Orleans East -- until it was destroyed by flood waters. He now lives in a rental apartment elsewhere in the city. So he logs longer hours in his job with Amtrak and is a frequent visitor to Harrah's. 
 ''I've been coming here because there's really nothing else to do,'' Mr. Williams said. 
 Another factor in Mississippi is a new law that allows casinos to be within 800 feet of water rather than requiring them to be on a floating barge and or riverboat. As a result, gambling concerns large and small are now more bullish on the Gulf Coast, said Mr. Gregory of the Mississippi casino commission, prompting many to invest in rebuilding and improvements.
 One example is the Imperial Palace, a low-rent gambling hall prior to the storm that has been reinvented as the IP Casino Resort, complete with a spa, upscale restaurants, a fashionable nightclub and many design flourishes borrowed from Las Vegas. The IP has also added a V.I.P. check-in area and high-limit gambling pit, Jon Lucas, the general manager, said, ''letting us make more of a play for the high roller.''
 With only 26 percent of the rooms offered by the city's non-casino hotels back on the market, according to the Mississippi Hotel and Lodging Association, Mr. Lucas says the more time people spend in a property, the more they tend to gamble.
 Gamblers are playing longer, casino executives say, and they are wagering larger sums and spending more time at slot machines and table games. Despite the absence of crowds of tourists, the average visitor is contributing more to the coffers -- 38 percent more in the Gulf Coast casinos, according to figures for the first three months of the year. 
 ''I guess it's sad,'' said Sylvia Lumas, 69, playing at a slot machine at Harrah's New Orleans. ''But it's entertainment. That's what we're looking for here. Everything has been so sad.''

HEADLINE: Killing the Regulator

 BODY:
The Chinese government's extraordinary decision to execute its chief food and drug regulator for taking bribes and allowing the sale of tainted drugs is a perfect example of all that is wrong with China's approach to regulation. 
 Beijing's leaders -- who disdain the idea of their own accountability -- may think that killing the regulator is enough to reassure consumers at home and abroad that China is now ready to guarantee the safety of its products. But they're wrong. 
 What China needs is an effective and transparent regulatory system and a clear understanding that its export boom will suffer if it continues to sell tainted food, toys and toothpaste. Until that happens -- and there is no guarantee that it will -- American regulators will have to do more to screen Chinese imports to protect American consumers.
 China's dysfunction has deep roots. The Communist Party leadership has muzzled consumer advocacy groups and the press. The government is also loath to do anything that might hinder the country's breakneck economic growth. With no public accountability, shoddy companies are allowed to cut every possible corner in their pursuit of business, often under the protection of corrupt government officials. 
 The results include rivers laced with ammonia and toothpaste sweetened with an industrial solvent, as well as tainted antibiotics that have killed more than a dozen children and sickened hundreds. The good news is that for the first time China's leaders are talking about the need for more and better regulation. And Washington and other governments can help with offers of technical advice and warnings about the cost of failing to take it.
 But the scope of the problem is too big, too complex and too urgent for the United States -- with $300 billion worth of Chinese imports a year -- to wait for Beijing to act. American importers need to provide the first line of defense. Companies like Wal-Mart should send inspectors regularly to visit the factories of Chinese suppliers, to ensure that products are up to acceptable standards. Ultimately the American government will have to enforce these norms.
 Unfortunately, the Bush administration has spent the last five-plus years emasculating the American regulatory system. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has seen its budgets repeatedly cut. The Food and Drug Administration has not received the resources it needs and today inspects only a minute share of all imported food. 
 It is hard to imagine anything good coming out of the China export scandals. But perhaps they will persuade Congress's new Democratic leaders that America also needs a stronger and more transparent regulatory system.

HEADLINE: A New Populism Spurs Democrats On the Economy

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15 

 BODY:
On Capitol Hill and on the presidential campaign trail, Democrats are increasingly moving toward a full-throated populist critique of the current economy.
 Clearly influenced by some of their most successful candidates in last year's Congressional elections, Democrats are talking more and more about the anemic growth in American wages and the negative effects of trade and a globalized economy on American jobs and communities. They deplore what they call a growing gap between the middle class, which is struggling to adjust to a changing job market, and the affluent elites who have prospered in the new economy. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, calls it ''trickle-down economics without the trickle.''
 Populism is hardly new in the Democratic Party. Al Gore vowed to fight for ''the people versus the powerful'' in his presidential campaign seven years ago, and Republicans have long accused the Democrats of practicing ''class warfare.'' 
 But the latest populist resurgence is deeply rooted in a view that current economic conditions are difficult and deteriorating for many people, analysts say, and it is now framing debates over tax policy, education, trade, energy and health care. Last week, Senate Democrats held hearings on proposals to raise taxes on some of the highest fliers on Wall Street, the people at the top of private equity and hedge fund firms. 
 In the House, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, convened party leaders and economists for a searching discussion of ''globalization, outsourcing and the American worker -- what should government do?'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, offered the participants some blunt marching orders: ''The American people want to know what we're doing about their economic security.''
 Their language, and to some degree their proposals, reflect a striking contrast with the approach taken by Democrats during much of the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton asserted that trade would create American jobs and that paying attention to the concerns of Wall Street would help the economy by lowering interest rates. The more populist tone is one indication of a broader debate among Democrats over economic policy and how much they should break with the careful centrism of the Clinton years embodied by Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, who was a champion of free trade and cutting deficits.
 So far, Republicans have, by and large, stuck by their free-market philosophy. They point to a rebounding stock market, declining deficits and steady if unspectacular economic expansion as evidence that conservative policies of tax cutting, less regulation and more trade are working.
 But Democrats say they are responding to economic trends that the statistics in the headlines do not capture, including middle-class insecurity about jobs, the affordability of health insurance and the costs of education. The times have changed, these Democrats argue, and six years of Republican tax and economic policies have heightened the inequities.
 Even as Mrs. Clinton has sought to associate herself with the economic growth of her husband's administration, she, like other Democratic presidential candidates, has been expressing a sharp skepticism toward trade and globalization under President Bush. In recent weeks she has announced her opposition to the proposed South Korean Free Trade Agreement and denounced globalization that ''is working only for a few of us.'' She accepted the endorsement of former Representative Richard A. Gephardt, who spent much of his political career fighting what he asserted were unfair trade agreements. 
 And Mrs. Clinton has increasingly focused on ''rising inequality and rising pessimism in our work force,'' and suggested that another progressive era is -- and ought to be -- at hand. 
 Former Senator John Edwards, another Democratic candidate, staked out similar positions months ago and regularly notes that in the last 20 years, ''about half of America's economic growth has gone to the top 1 percent.'' Mr. Edwards praises recent efforts to raise taxes on private equity and hedge funds. His campaign manager, former Representative David E. Bonior, notes that Mr. Edwards has been sounding these themes since his first presidential campaign in 2004.
 ''John Edwards was there at the beginning of this,'' Mr. Bonior said. 
 While campaigning in Iowa last week, Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, suggested that even those who followed the standard advice for coping with a globalized economy -- get more education for higher-skilled jobs -- were losing out. 
 ''People were told, you've got to be trained for high-tech jobs,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and then it turned out that some of those high-tech jobs were being outsourced. And people were told, now you need to train for service jobs. And then it turned out the call centers were moving overseas.''
 It is not unusual for candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to move left in the primary season; Mr. Clinton himself touched on some of these populist themes in his 1992 campaign. But all the major Democratic candidates for president are promising to use government to ease the insecurity of the middle class, on issues like education and health care.
 Sixteen months before the election, with their domestic platforms being formed, these candidates are proposing, for example, to let the Bush tax cuts expire for the most affluent Americans and, in some cases, redirect that money to expanded health care. On the campaign trail and in Congress, Democrats are also talking about expanding assistance for college and help for workers who lose their jobs to cheaper labor abroad. 
 Democrats have also been pushing for legislation that would allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare with the pharmaceutical industry, a favorite target of the economic populists.
 Democratic leaders say that unless Congress restores the confidence of the middle class, it will be hard to sell Americans on more trade or even an immigration overhaul.
 ''I don't think we'll be able to do trade agreements, immigration reforms or any of these other kinds of reforms,'' Ms. Pelosi said, ''until we present a positive, aggressive economic agenda to the American people -- until they know where they stand, now and in the future.''
 Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, said, ''Trade may not be the reason, or the number one reason, they're losing their jobs, but they think it is.'' 
 Democratic leaders in the House recently announced that their legislative priorities did not include the renewal of the president's ''fast track'' authority to negotiate new trade agreements, which expired this month. First, they said, they want to find ways ''to expand the benefits of globalization to all Americans.''
 There is anxiety on both left and right of the Democratic Party about this new populism. Many on the left worry that the Democratic establishment is merely paying lip service. They are skeptical about the party leaders' loyalties, noting that many rely on huge contributions from Wall Street, and many have a long commitment to a free-trade agenda. Democratic leaders have, in fact, tried to advance some trade agreements this year, only to meet with substantial resistance within their caucus. Many of the new populists also see the Democratic establishment as far too cautious in confronting what they see as broad inequities in the tax code.
 At the same time, centrist Democrats, like those at the research group the Third Way, worry that the party is veering left away from the optimistic, pro-growth, business-friendly policies that Mr. Clinton championed. 
 But many Democrats argue that this is an inevitable response to the dislocation and unease in much of the country, which was a crucial factor in the party's victory in Congress last November. The case for populism is made most powerfully by the Democrats who were elected to Congress last fall. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who defeated a Republican incumbent with an attack on the trade and economic policies of recent years, said he was convinced that the populists were on the rise. He noted that he carried Ohio by 12.5 percentage points two years after John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, lost the state by only about 2 percentage points, and with it the presidency.
 ''That's because of the economic populist message,'' Mr. Brown said. ''They voted minimum wage, they voted trade, they voted student loans, they voted health care and prescription drugs, over what their traditional conservative social values might suggest. And that's the route to winning Ohio for Hillary or Barack or anybody else.''
 Even Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who is viewed as far too much of an establishment, free-trade Clintonian by many populists, says the party must respond. ''The party that deals with globalization and economic security will win,'' Mr. Emanuel said.

HEADLINE: He Rang The Alarm On Darfur

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Some day an American president will visit a genocide museum in Darfur and repeat the standard refrain: If only we had known ...
 But that excuse will ring hollow, because there was a whistle-blower in the heart of the Bush administration. Roger Winter, whom President Bush had appointed in 2001 to a senior post in the U.S. Agency for International Development, frantically tried to ring alarm bells -- but instead the administration turned away.
 If there was a hero within the U.S. government on Darfur, it was Mr. Winter. But it was doubly frustrating for him because in 1994 he had the same experience during the Clinton administration, when he was running a refugee organization and desperately trying to galvanize officials to respond to the Rwandan genocide. 
 In outrage at Bill Clinton's inaction during the Rwandan slaughter, Mr. Winter abandoned the Democratic Party and became a Republican.
 Mr. Winter, 65, who also served in the Carter and (briefly) Reagan administrations, traveled regularly to Sudan for the Bush administration, trying to end the 20-year war between northern and southern Sudan. On those trips, Mr. Winter encountered the slaughter in Darfur as it began.
 In May 2003, long before any newspaper noticed, Mr. Winter warned in Congressional testimony that violence was erupting in Darfur. Then, on Nov. 3, 2003, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum transmitted a message warning Washington that ''the situation in Darfur is critical'' and adding that ''ethnic cleansing ... is underway.''
 But Washington shrugged.
 State Department officials apparently worried that an uproar over Darfur would derail the north-south agreement in Sudan, a prize achievement for the Bush administration. So they looked away. The State Department was even angry when the Agency for International Development released satellite photos showing the burned villages in Darfur.
 Before testifying to Congress, Mr. Winter had to submit prepared remarks to the State Department for vetting. Frustrated by State's passivity, he used his off-the-cuff remarks to speak passionately -- and uncensored -- about the horrors in Darfur.
 Mr. Winter once took an administration colleague with him to fly over Darfur from Chad, to show him the Janjaweed militias as they burned villages. Administration officials aren't supposed to invade another country's air space and buzz militias as they slaughter civilians, but Mr. Winter was desperate to get another administration witness.
 ''We were trying to get everybody's attention, including the White House and State Department and everybody else,'' Mr. Winter recalls.
 When Sudanese forces blocked a road to aid groups, Mr. Winter invited aid groups to join his own convoy and insisted on going down the road to assure humanitarian access. 
 It was agonizing, he says, to feel that Mr. Bush wanted to do the right thing on Sudan -- and yet see the administration acquiesce on mass murder. Later Mr. Winter served as State Department envoy for Darfur, but at State he burned with the same frustration and retired last year, deeply disillusioned.
 ''Khartoum looked the U.S. in the eye, and we looked away,'' Mr. Winter said, adding: ''There was no real intention of taking effective action. They saw that. They read us. And so they weren't threatened.''
 Mr. Winter favored -- and still favors -- a no-fly zone over Darfur. We wouldn't keep planes in the air, or even shoot planes down. But after Sudan bombed civilians in Darfur, we would later destroy a Sudanese attack helicopter on the ground.
 Aid groups worry that such a strike would endanger their efforts. But I think Mr. Winter, who has 26 years' experience in Sudan, is exactly right that a no-fly zone is the best way to shake up Sudanese officials and make them negotiate seriously for a peace agreement in Darfur.
 ''What we have done with our handling of Darfur is show Khartoum that in certain circumstances we are a toothless tiger,'' he says. ''No matter how forceful the words we use, we don't act. Or we act in ways that the bad guys in Khartoum find tolerable. ... It tells them that they can get away with mass murder.''
 The upshot, Mr. Winter believes, is that Sudan is increasingly likely to resume its war against southern Sudan, erasing one of Mr. Bush's genuine achievements. Mr. Winter says of administration officials, ''They're turning a silk purse into a sow's ear.'' 
 Mr. Winter admires Mr. Bush for pushing for north-south peace but fears that the administration is simply running out the clock on Darfur. ''Where we have gotten to with Sudan,'' he says heavily, ''is a tragedy.''

HEADLINE: Off the Coast of Maine, the Time Is Right for Racing in Bulky, Plodding Boats

BYLINE: By MAREK FUCHS

DATELINE: STONINGTON, Me., July 15 

 BODY:
The lobstermen's ball lasted until the early hours, and then the lobstermen mostly stumbled their way back to the shipyard, where they spent a restless night on their open boats, under a bad roll of fog.
 The well-prepared managed to prop up tents on their decks, but for others bed was nothing but the hard surface of the engine covering and a blanket. 
 On Sunday morning, it was time to head out to sea -- not in search of lobsters but for a competition that has become one of the social events along the coast here, a Kentucky Derby for the trapping set. 
 Lobster boats are built to be sturdy and are capable of handling pretty much anything on the open water. They are not built for speed. But several times during the summer, up and down the coast of Maine, lobstermen soup up their engines, weigh down the back of their boats and gun the vessels in races that are sanctioned by the Maine Lobster Boat Racing Association.
 Jimmy Brown, a 56-year-old lobsterman from Montauk, N.Y., came up to watch the race, but he did not find it particularly practical to speed about in a lobster boat.
 ''You have to let the cages soak,'' Mr. Brown said, ''and besides, economy is more important than speed.''
 Edward Shirley, 62, one of the participants in the weekend of races, thought otherwise.
 ''You don't make a lot of money in this race, but it's good people and camaraderie, and lobstermen are always in need of comrades,'' said Mr. Shirley, who lives on Verona Island, Me.
 This weekend's racing took place in this fishing village on the tip of Deer Isle, an island connected to the mainland by an almost comically antiquated suspension bridge. It is populated by lobstermen and vacationers, many of them artists who came here for part of the summer long ago and never left.
 The lobstermen on the island have challenging lives that include seasonal employment, early hours and grinding physical work that can shred shoulders and backs. 
 At stake in Sunday's races were $4,000 to $5,000 in cash, thousands of dollars more in prizes including a bilge pump and oil, and bragging rights.
 Local lobstermen had the benefit of sleeping in their own beds, which was an advantage to Andy Gove, a 77-year-old who was the heavy favorite in his race class.
 Mr. Gove's 36-foot, 900-horsepower boat is named ''Uncle's U.F.O.'' -- though he is not sure why. 
 ''My wife's brother suggested it,'' Mr. Gove said, ''and I didn't have anything better, so I took it.'' 
 Though delayed because of the fog, the races -- nearly three dozen of them, divided by classes -- took place on Sunday. The first was for boats 16 feet and under, with skippers 18 and younger, all the way up to a class for boats 40 feet and longer with at least 750 horsepower. There was a separate class for women. And all the classes compete in the open diesel division. 
 The course ran more than a mile, most of it a flat-out sprint. About 150 other vessels, from lobster boats to viewing barges, ran through man-of-war jellyfish and several seals in Stonington Harbor to watch from the best vantage point, forming a pathway for the racers.
 After averaging 46.4 miles per hour against the current to win the day, Mr. Gove was crowned the overall champion. Word around the shipyard is also that Mr. Gove uses his age to lull competitors into a false sense of security, but he said after the race that his days on top might be over.
 ''Too old,'' he said with a shrug as he was greeted with hoots, backslaps and compliments.

HEADLINE: Clout Reduced, A Congressman Pushes Harder

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: SODUS POINT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Representative James T. Walsh knows what it means to have clout. 
 A powerful Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, he shepherded billions in post-9/11 disaster aid for New York City. When Carnegie Hall needed federal funds, Isaac Stern himself dropped by Mr. Walsh's Capitol Hill office. Wynton Marsalis took him on a personal tour of Lincoln Center after the center's jazz program got federal support.
 But these days, Mr. Walsh seems a little humbled, and a little worried. He cannot get a bill passed without the help of the rival party. He is on a list of Republicans whom Democrats are seeking to topple. 
 And 16 months before the election, he is a man on the run, raising money as never before and dashing from one campaign-style appearance to another across his vast district in central New York. 
 ''I went 10 years without doing a town hall meeting,'' explained Mr. Walsh as he took a break between appearances in this community on Lake Ontario. ''I did 10 already this year.''
 Mr. Walsh's plight captures the fears and dangers Republicans in New York face nowadays. Many in the party worry there will be a huge Democratic turnout in the state for the presidential election in 2008, especially if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is topping the ticket. 
 Mr. Walsh, 60, who barely won re-election last year, has hung on to his seat in this Democratic-leaning district by stressing his independence. Indeed, since the Democrats returned to power in Congress, he has sided with them on a variety of issues, including increasing the minimum wage and repealing tax breaks for oil companies. But whether that will be enough remains to be seen.
 ''I think the waters are pretty roiled,'' Mr. Walsh said, commenting on the harsh political climate his party faces. ''I still think the Republican name brand is still not that strong.''
 Democrats are taking aim at Mr. Walsh, who lives in Onondaga, a suburb of Syracuse, and four other Republican congressmen in three states -- Thomas M. Reynolds and John R. Kuhl Jr. of New York, Mike Ferguson of New Jersey and Christopher Shays of Connecticut -- who were narrowly re-elected last year, as part of their push to solidify their hold on the Northeast. Mr. Walsh's 2006 challenger, Dan Maffei, a former television reporter and Congressional aide, who lives just outside of Syracuse in De Witt, has already been aggressively campaigning against him.
 Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who is in charge of the House Democratic campaign effort for 2008, says Mr. Walsh's margin of victory -- he won by roughly 3,400 votes last year -- gives Democrats confidence they can take the seat.
 ''There is no doubt that the election last year sent a wake-up call to Jim Walsh,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''But I think it may be too late for him to recover.''
 In addition, Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group in Washington, has run television advertisements attacking Mr. Walsh for supporting President Bush's policy on Iraq.
 Since 1989, Mr. Walsh has represented New York's 25th Congressional District, which stretches from Syracuse through miles of farm country to the suburbs of Rochester. Like much of the upstate region, it is struggling economically, having seen its population drop over the last decade with the loss of manufacturing jobs from venerable employers like the Carrier air-conditioning plant in Syracuse. The district's demographics are challenging, too, with a mix of urban, suburban, exurban and rural voters who frequently have different priorities.
 The son of William F. Walsh, a mayor of Syracuse in the 1960s and a congressman in the 1970s, Mr. Walsh is an amiable man with a dry wit and soft-spoken manner. He is not given to self-promotion, making him something of an oddity among the brash characters who make up New York's Congressional delegation.
 But when Republicans were in control of the House, his influence was unmistakable. He held the privileged post of cardinal, as the chairmen of House Appropriations subcommittees are known, giving him a large say over how billions of dollars in federal money were spent. This allowed him to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid to the hospitals, colleges and farms in his district.
 A serious student of policy, Mr. Walsh was also a favorite of politicians, civic leaders and business representatives around the state.
 For much of his career, Mr. Walsh never had to worry about re-election, consistently piling up big margins of victory. Then 2006 struck. Mr. Walsh did not seem prepared for the fierce challenge he faced.
 Five months before the election, Mr. Walsh had only about $600,000 in his campaign treasury, when other Republicans were amassing large sums in preparation for a rough election season. Ultimately, Mr. Walsh won with 49 percent of the vote, after Mr. Maffei spent months depicting him as a pawn of President Bush and conservatives on Capitol Hill. 
 This time, Mr. Walsh says he is taking no chances, and is aiming to raise at least $1 million, which he says would be a first for him.
 ''I've never raised a lot of money,'' he said the other day, while sitting in Captain Jack's Good Time Tavern in Sodus Point. ''But forewarned is forearmed. We are raising like crazy now. I am not too old to learn.''
 He and his rival will need plenty of money. It is expensive to reach voters on television in the district, which stretches over four counties and includes two major media markets, Rochester and Syracuse.
 Now that he is in the minority, Mr. Walsh insists that he can still influence policy, but as a free agent, pursuing alliances with Democrats. (When Republicans ran the House, the leadership imposed strict party discipline to pass legislation because of their slim majority.)
 Mr. Walsh noted that the last time Republicans were in the minority, he managed to work with Democrats to pass several initiatives, including one that provides federal financing for hearing tests for newborns.
 ''You can get some work done in the minority,'' he said. 
 These days, Mr. Walsh seems to grab every opportunity he can, no matter how small, to reconnect with voters. In two typical days, his office issued three press releases highlighting the millions of dollars he had secured for everything from local law-enforcement initiatives to water projects on Lake Ontario and Onondaga Lake. 
 One recent Monday, he traveled his district like a candidate locked in a tight race. He began at a retirement community in the Rochester suburb of Macedon, where he gave residents a flag that had flown over the United States Capitol. He then went for about an hour's drive to a beach on Sodus Point, where he cut the ribbon at a ceremony for a bathhouse that he had helped secure federal dollars to build.
 Yet there are times when Mr. Walsh, who has long seemed most happy diving into the details of policy, does not seem entirely comfortable with the preening that retail politics demands.
 ''The silly thing about this job,'' he told the audience at his last stop in Sodus Point, ''is that you show up at the beach in a suit and wingtip shoes.''

Karen Houppert is the author of ''The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo, Menstruation.''

DATELINE: Baltimore 

 BODY:
 IN May the Food and Drug Administration approved a new birth control pill, Lybrel. It is as effective at preventing pregnancy as the other pills already out there (about 98 percent) but boasts one advantage: Women who take it will never get their periods.
 Lybrel is landing on pharmacy shelves this month. And now war has been declared on menstruation.
 Already the first few volleys in this battle have been exchanged. Gird yourselves, women, for a barrage of advertising and research highlighting the debilitating effects of periods and the joys of menstrual suppression. 
 After all, periods and their mood swings are bad for family values (who wants to have a stay-at-home mom when she's so darn cranky?), bad for women's health (women were never meant to menstruate so much; natural selection designed their bodies for back-to-back pregnancies and breast-feeding), bad for the fashion industry (how can beige be the new black if women won't wear it all month?) and bad for the economy (everybody knows women take to their beds at the merest whisper of ''cramps,'' fueling the nation's employee-absentee rate). Western civilization, it seems, hinges on our ability to wrangle our messy cycles to the ground and stomp 'em out once and for all.
 Sound absurd?
 In a presentation by Lybrel's maker, Wyeth, to investors and analysts last October, Dr. Ginger D. Constantine, the company's therapeutic director for women's health, laid the groundwork. Citing company-backed studies, she reported that menstruating women feel less effective at work and take more sick days. Not only that, but they don't exercise and they wear dark clothes more often, she said.
 Suddenly, news articles are weighing the pros and cons of our monthly cycles. And while it's great that the American news media are, for a moment, challenging the culture of concealment that typically surrounds the topic of menstruation, history shows that such debates are, well, cyclical. 
 It seems every time women start demanding access to this or that, there is a rash of studies ''proving'' that menstrual cycles render them unsuitable. In the 1870s and 1880s, when Americans were debating the value of higher education for women, a flurry of research asserted that women's cycling constitutions made them unfit for sustained mental and physical labor. Henry Maudsley, a British doctor, reflected popular opinion -- dressed up as ''scientific truth'' -- when he observed that menstruation doomed girls to failure in college.
 Comparing boys and girls, Maudsley insisted in an article, was ''not a question of two bodies and minds that are in equal physical condition, but of one body and mind capable of sustained and regular hard labor, and of another body and mind which one quarter of each month, during the best years of life, is more or less sick and unfit for hard work.'' Maudsley's definition of ''hard work'' was unclear: no one worried that the fragile cook, servant girl or farmer's wife was being overtaxed during any time of the month.
 After women pressed ahead, attended college and excelled in the halls of learning, the debate about menstrual cycles shifted from their suitability for higher education to their suitability for public life in general. When the suffragists asked to participate in the political process, experts retaliated with more research proving that women belonged in the domestic sphere; menstruation figured prominently among the reasons.
 Once women won the right to vote in 1920, the menstruation-equals-inadequacy debate ebbed for a while. In fact, two decades later, new proof arrived that women were perfectly fit and capable -- even when bleeding -- and therefore should step right up and join the war effort. When Rosie the Riveter was needed in American factories and recruits in the Women's Army Corps, the War Department produced films telling women of the abundance of scientific evidence proving periods are no big deal. 
 A 1942 American propaganda film, ''Strictly Personal,'' for example, coached novice Wacs on nutrition, rest and exercise. In one scene, a soldier lies listlessly on her cot -- ''I can't drill today, I feel unwell,'' she whines -- but a fellow Wac tells her to buck up. And a voiceover ''doctor'' explains: ''That's Victorian stuff. And so is that trash about nerves and sensibility during this period.'' Menstruation, he says, ''is no excuse for absenteeism and self-coddling.''
 But then the war ended, and Rosie and the Wacs were retired -- and shown a fresh batch of studies proving that children need their moms at home, that the workplace is potentially hazardous to women's unborn children and that women's cycles make them less efficient workers than men. By 1953, the affliction premenstrual syndrome turned up in the medical literature.
 Someone cynical might suggest that research highlighting menstruation's distressing consequences bubbles to the surface every time the public feels anxious over women's expanding roles. (Say, the possibility that there might be a menopausal woman in the White House -- and yes, you can't win for losing here, given that our periods allegedly drive us to distraction and their cessation does the same.) So take today's hoopla over menstrual suppression with a grain of ibuprofen.
 While it may be good news for the 8 percent of women who have debilitating periods (a constellation of symptoms known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder), the rest of us may be puzzled by the fuss. Sure, getting our periods can be a bother sometimes, but after the traumatic moment of menarche -- ''How can this be happening to me when the sixth-grade pool party is tomorrow and I have no idea where that tampon goes?'' -- most of us get used to it.
 It just is. 
 This is not a particularly profitable attitude for Wyeth, angling for its share of the $1.7 billion annual American market for birth control pills. It's also not terribly useful for Barr, which makes Seasonale, an oral contraceptive that reduces women's periods to once every three months. Nor for Watson, which sells a generic equivalent.
 So what's a poor company to do? Re-conceptualize menstruation as a disease in need of treatment.
 And what's a poor menstruating woman to do? Get cranky with the prophets who offer to cure us of menstruation; who minimize the complex interplay of hormones and their many roles in our bodies; who gloss over the still unknown long-term effects of menstrual suppression; who promise that cycle-free women are better lovers, mothers, workers. 
 Or just don't buy it.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 27, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on July 17, about a new birth control pill that suppresses periods, incorrectly described premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It refers to severe irritability, tension and depression before periods, not to debilitating periods.

HEADLINE: A Company's Stock Suffers, But Mostly in Silence

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
By its own measures, everything looks good at ACA Capital Holdings, a financial management and insurance company. But other numbers do not look so good, and the stock price is falling rapidly. The company will not comment on what is going on.
 In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, ACA shares fell 22 percent, dropping $1.87, to $6.59, on the heaviest volume in the company's brief history. The shares have lost a third of their value since Thursday, and are trading at less than half of their value a month ago. 
 ACA has written billions of dollars worth of insurance on the value of financial assets, and it manages collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s -- investment vehicles that invest in bonds backed by risky mortgages and other debt -- on billions more. Some of the C.D.O.'s it manages for others were mentioned by bond rating agencies last week as candidates for downgrading.
 But it is not clear how much pain ACA could suffer from the subprime market. In detailing its exposure to subprime mortgage loans on its Web site last week, the company said that nearly all of its direct exposure to subprime mortgage debt came through securities rated AAA by at least one bond rating agency. Such securities have generally held their value even as others have plunged in market value amid turmoil in the subprime market.
 Late yesterday, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, said it was considering lowering ratings on various securities issued by 19 C.D.O.'s, including 4 managed, though not owned, by ACA. The agency said the moves ''reflect the increased probability of default'' of underlying mortgages.
 Until last month, ACA's assurances had satisfied investors, although the stock suffered briefly on May 10, when it reported first-quarter earnings. Under normal accounting rules, those results showed that profits were down sharply, and that book value had plunged because of declines in market value of some assets.
 But the stock quickly recovered to above $14 a share after the company pointed to its own adjusted measures of earnings, which showed rapid increases in both profits and book value.
 In June, the shares began to slide again after the company said that insiders, primarily private equity firms that owned the company before it went public last November, wanted to sell 3.9 million shares, more than a tenth of the shares outstanding. 
 The proposed offering by insiders was quickly withdrawn after the stock came under pressure, but the selling intensified last week.
 Yesterday, the company refused to answer any questions and told the stock exchange that it would not comment on its plunging price. That served to intensify the selling pressure. Including the 3.1 million shares that traded yesterday, 4.7 million shares -- about two-thirds of the 6.9 million shares in public hands -- have traded in the last two sessions.
 The company's largest shareholder, with a 27.6 percent stake, is a fund managed by Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, an affiliate of the Bear Stearns Companies, whose own shares fell $2.58 yesterday, to $140.31. Last month, Bear Stearns was forced to bail out a hedge fund it managed that had suffered losses in subprime mortgage securities.
 In a statement, John D. Howard, the chief executive of Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, said, ''We have great confidence in ACA's management team.''
 After ACA disclosed the extent of its subprime exposure last week, Craig Siegenthaler, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said the disclosure increased the risk profile for ACA, and reduced his price target on the stock to $12, from $17.
 ACA was forced to reduce both the price and the size of its offering before it went public last year at $13 a share. The share price fell below $13 for a couple of days after the offering, but stabilized and rose above $16 by February, before the subprime problems surfaced.
 ACA is exposed to the mortgage market in two ways. The company manages and partly owns C.D.O.'s. and also insures investors in other C.D.O.'s. 
 In a report yesterday morning, Geoffrey Dunn, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, reduced his earnings forecast, saying that ACA's price had fallen because it ''has no real comparable peers in the publicly traded markets, is very complex and seems to operate in areas that are at the heart of the market's current concerns.'' 
 But, Mr. Dunn said in an interview, ''in our worst-case scenario, we think the stock has a double-digit valuation.'' He said the price decline was not caused by ''fundamentally legitimate concerns.''
 The difficulties in assessing ACA's profitability was shown when it released its first-quarter financial statements in May.
 Under generally accepted accounting principles, ACA was required to take a loss for the fall in value of some derivative securities it owned, and to reduce its book value for the decline in other securities. A result was that profits were down 17 percent from a year earlier, although the company still reported profits of $11.4 million, or 31 cents a share. Its book value fell to $11.62 a share, from $13.96 at the end of 2006.
 But ACA told investors that those numbers were misleading, and its chief executive, Alan S. Roseman, said the results ''underscore our ability to produce significant growth throughout changing market conditions.''
 Mr. Roseman said that ACA's preferred measurements of income, called net economic income and base economic income, were each up 41 percent from a year earlier. That was largely because those measurements ignored losses in derivative securities owned by the company. Assuming, as the company does, that those derivatives return to original value, there will be no long-term losses, the company explained.
 In computing its adjusted book value, the company not only excludes those derivative losses but also adds in the value of future fees it will collect for managing C.D.O. portfolios. By that measure, adjusted book value rose to $24.91 a share, from $22.93.
 ACA's competitors in insuring C.D.O. values generally have AAA ratings from the rating agencies. But ACA has only an A rating, indicating a financial position that is less solid, although still good. In affirming that rating in June, Standard & Poor's said ACA had insured $10.3 billion in C.D.O.'s that invested heavily in subprime mortgage bonds. While that made up nearly a quarter of all bonds insured by the company, S.& P. said that the bonds ACA insured were themselves rated AAA.

HEADLINE: In the Desert, Harnessing the Power of the Sun by Capturing Heat Instead of Light

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Scientists have struggled for years to make electricity from the sun's light at a cost competitive with power from coal or natural gas. The challenges are formidable. But now they are close, using the sun's heat instead.
 Last month, Acciona Energy, a Spanish company, opened a solar thermal installation spread across 400 acres of desert outside Boulder City, Nev., 25 miles southwest of Las Vegas. Called Nevada Solar One, it has 47 miles of trough-shaped mirrors, lined up in rows. Producing 64 megawatts, it is many times larger than the largest photovoltaic installations, which use the cells that are found in everything from rooftop panels to pocket calculators. 
 Acciona will not disclose the production costs at the thermal plant, which was subsidized by the Energy Department. But according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, representing manufacturers of both photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, power from solar thermal electricity costs 12 to 14 cents a kilowatt-hour to produce, while power from solar cells costs 18 to 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. The national average retail price of electricity is about 10.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. 
 Photovoltaic cells, first made practical for the space program, are falling in price, but so are the thermal systems, which focus sunlight on a fluid-filled pipe to collect the heat.
 ''There's really this renaissance of solar thermal technology, and people are working very hard on how to reduce costs,'' said Martin Heming, the executive in charge of solar technology at Schott, the German company that made the collector pipe for Nevada Solar One.
 Schott is developing a system that will use molten salt, rather than a liquid, to fill the pipes. Salt could absorb the same amount of heat or more without boiling, and it would stay at atmospheric pressure. The current system heats the pipe to 750 degrees, helped by small electric motors that change the angle of the mirrors during the day to face the sun.
 The heated fluid runs through the pipes to a central power block, where it flows through a network of pipes bathed in ordinary water. The water is boiled and the steam drives a turbine, as in coal plants.
 But a typical coal-burning plant produces about 600 megawatts, roughly 10 times more than Nevada Solar One does. ''The optimum economic size is probably even larger than Nevada Solar One,'' said Thomas R. Fair, executive for renewable energy at the two companies that are buying the solar plant's output, the Nevada Power Company and the Sierra Pacific Power Company. There is a lot of open desert land, he said.
 A new generation of solar thermal plants is likely to use more efficient technology. Mr. Heming said that switching to sodium, for example, would allow for higher temperatures. Less energy would leak out of the pipe, and electric output would rise.
 Solar thermal power is also being applied in two other ways. One is a supplement to a combined-cycle gas plant. In those plants, natural gas is burned in a jet engine, turning a turbine shaft to make electricity. The exhaust is used to boil water, and that steam is used to turn a second turbine, making more electricity.
 In the solar thermal variant, heat from the sun is used to preheat the water that the exhaust gases will boil. Proponents say that such a system could get about one-sixth more work out of the natural gas by operating at 70 percent efficiency. Most current plants operate with efficiencies in the range of 50 percent to 60 percent.
 The World Bank is considering financial help for projects in Egypt and Morocco that would create such a hybrid plant. 
 The second application shows that not all solar thermal projects are large and high-tech. An American start-up company, the Solar Turbine Group, founded by engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, received $130,000 from the World Bank and is testing two prototypes in Lesotho, in southern Africa, that use simple components, including old car parts.
 Four parabolic dishes, each 10 feet high and 4 feet across, focus heat on a black collector, to boil water. The steam can be run through an old car air-conditioning unit, using the compressor backward, to convert heat energy into mechanical power. (Under a car's hood, the compressor takes mechanical power from the engine and uses it to squeeze the refrigerant down to a liquid, so it can give off its heat.)
 In the solar turbine design, the mechanical power turns a generator, which can also be scavenged from a car. Or the mechanical power can be used to drive a refrigeration unit.
 In production, the units will sell for $5,000 and produce about 600 watts, said Sam White, a founder of the Solar Turbine Group. The price is about the same as for solar cells, but this system also creates steam for hot water.
 Solar thermal may have another advantage: it may be easier to store energy by storing it as heat. That is important because solar production is strongest in the afternoon but ends long before peak demand ends. High temperatures persist when the sun is very low in the sky or below the horizon.
 One possibility is to store large amounts of hot water or molten sodium to allow electricity production into the early evening hours. If utilities built solar plants instead of natural gas plants to meet peak demand, the value of the solar output would increase.

 BODY:
BACK TO BACK Domestic airlines are expected to post an aggregate profit of about $4 billion this year, which would make 2006-7 the first back-to-back years of profitability since 1999-2000, the Air Transport Association said in a recent outlook for 2007. Debt levels remain high, however, ''leaving the airlines vulnerable to fuel spikes, recession or exogenous shocks'' like terrorist attacks and natural disasters, said John Heimlich, the trade group's chief economist. True financial health for the industry, including the ability to add new-model aircraft to fleets, will require ''many years of profitability,'' Mr. Heimlich said. 
 VIRGIN AMERICA'S GREEN LIGHT Poised to begin domestic service next month, Virgin America said that it had received approval from the Transportation Department to begin selling tickets. Virgin America, a new airline that is required by law to be under United States ownership and be operated separately from Virgin Atlantic, is expected to fly initially from its base in San Francisco to New York and to expand its domestic network to eight more cities within a year. Virgin said that it would announce dates for ticket sales and for the first flights soon. The airline has 10 new Airbus 319/320 aircraft with leather seats and advanced in-seat video and other entertainment systems.
 BY THE SEAT The number of seats available on scheduled flights worldwide reached a record of 309.7 million this month, according to OAG, the flight information services company. That is a 5 percent increase from July 2006. A total of 2.6 million flights are scheduled worldwide this month, up from 2.5 million last July. According to Back Aviation Solutions, 38,324 commercial aircraft are flying, compared with 36,803 last July.
 WORLDWIDE PASSENGER DEMAND Passenger traffic on world airlines grew 5.5 percent in May over May 2006, the International Air Transport Association said. The strongest growth, 19.6 percent, was in the Middle East. Asia-Pacific passenger traffic was up 5.1 percent. Demand increased 4.2 percent in North America, which showed the highest average load factors of all regions, with 80.4 percent of available seats occupied by paying passengers.
 UNITED STATES PASSENGER DEMAND United States airlines carried 243.2 million passengers during the first four months of this year, an increase of 2.2 percent from the first four months of 2006, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics said. The total includes 214.4 million domestic passengers on 3.2 million flights (the number of flights rose 1.4 percent), and 28.8 million international passengers on 282,900 flights (the number of international flights rose 1.9 percent).
 ET CETERA Gate Gourmet, the airline catering and on-board services company, said it reached an agreement to acquire deSter Holding of Amsterdam, the leading supplier of in-flight items like cutlery, dishes and amenity kits. ... A new luxury hotel brand, Capella Hotels and Resorts, opened its first property, Schloss Velden, in Velden, Austria. The second property is scheduled to open next month in County Cork, Ireland. Four more international hotels are planned by the company for 2008. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Clothes Shopping in Port au Prince, Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By SCOTT SABIN. 
By Scott Sabin, as told to Joan Raymond. E-mail: joan.raymond@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With a soapy hand, I fumbled around for my cellphone in the dark, pushing a random key so the display screen would light the concrete walls of the tiny bathroom in Cherident, Haiti. 
 It provided enough illumination to find the large plastic bucket that contained the cold water I needed to scoop over my head with a plastic cup. Since there was no mirror in my room at the Episcopal parish guesthouse anyway, I shaved in the dark, carefully feeling my face for whiskers and hoping that I didn't leave any noticeable patches. 
 High in the mountains of Haiti, another typical business trip was drawing to a close. It was 4:30 a.m., and I was several hours from the nearest paved road, far from electricity and running water, but comforted by the fact that I would be home in San Diego in time for a late meal with my wife and children. 
 In 14 years as executive director of Floresta, a faith-based nonprofit organization that administers reforestation and economic development programs, my business travel has taken me to some of the poorest regions on earth, areas in which environmental degradation and poverty form a vicious cycle. 
 In recent years, I have made multiple trips to the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Haiti, Tanzania and Thailand. I have also visited Kenya, Nicaragua and Indonesia. In addition to the satisfaction of seeing the poor empowered to overcome seemingly intractable problems, traveling to these places is one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoy my work. 
 An optimistic outlook and flexibility are absolutely necessary, especially in Haiti. Floresta Haiti, our local affiliate, has planted hundreds of thousands of trees and made thousands of microcredit loans to poor farmers in 30 villages, despite the challenges of recent government instability. 
 On my most recent trip to Haiti, about 500 local farmers and government officials had gathered to celebrate our 10th anniversary in the region. To look just right for this special occasion, I had packed a suit and a tie, in addition to the usual hiking boots, water filter and flashlight. 
 What I didn't plan on was my luggage being stolen out of the back of the truck that picked me up from the airport the morning of my arrival. The last couple of years, the security around Port au Prince has been dicey at best. Even a few months ago, kidnappings on the airport road had been quite common. Just two years ago, one of our Haitian staff members had survived a kidnapping attempt, so I was pleased that the United Nations seemed to have finally gotten a handle on the security situation. 
 But as we crept through traffic and wove around pedestrians in a busy neighborhood of the capital city, we realized my bag was missing -- obviously stolen. Thankfully, my laptop and notebooks were in my briefcase safely stowed in the front of the cab, but all my clothes and toiletry items for the week were gone. 
 So it was back across Port au Prince for a quick shopping spree. What I have learned is that you can buy clothes anywhere, even in the poorest regions on earth. There are incredible markets that sell used clothes. And it doesn't matter if it is Tanzania or Haiti. You can recreate a wardrobe, just for a few dollars, though size may be an issue for us Americans. I learned a long time ago that in a pinch you need only three of anything: one to wear, one to wash and one to be drying. 
 There are more than two million people living in Port au Prince, and the city is filthy. Yet these people, many of whom are barely getting by, manage somehow to always look clean and neat, as if they are ready to go to church. Their strength always amazes me.
 Having little wardrobe on that trip did have some advantages -- no luggage to haul, and clearing customs was a breeze. 
 And perhaps my minor inconveniences made me better appreciate what I do have and reinforced the notion that to help people rehabilitate a countryside, grow food and produce a cash crop is much more important than a coat and a tie.

HEADLINE: Filling Gaps in Iraq, Then Finding a Void at Home

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
America has given much to Shaheen Khan. It has taken something, too.
 Three years ago, she was a nursery school teacher here, a meek woman with a melodic voice who charmed the children with tales from her native Pakistan.
 Today, Mrs. Khan shares a room in a dreary nursing home on the fringes of Houston, paralyzed from midchest down and tormented by a fateful choice to try to remake her life.
 Mired in debt and strained by a sometimes difficult marriage, Mrs. Khan signed up in 2004 with the military contracting giant KBR to do laundry for American forces in Iraq, a job that promised to triple the $16,000 a year she was earning at the school. She was assigned to work in the Green Zone in Baghdad, and she convinced herself that she would be safe.
 Five weeks after arriving in Iraq, she was speeding down a Baghdad highway in a Chevy Tahoe when the driver swerved to avoid a box he feared was a bomb. The vehicle rolled five times, leaving Mrs. Khan unconscious, suspended from her seat belt with a crushed spinal cord. Doctors have told her she will not walk again. 
 She is not given to self-pity, but when asked what she looks forward to, Mrs. Khan's eyes turn cloudy. ''Nothing,'' she said. ''Now my life is almost over.''
 This is the face of battle in a new war and a new century -- a 46-year-old Pakistani-American woman, part of a rented army of 130,000 civilians supporting 160,000 United States soldiers and marines. Taking the place of enlisted troops in every American army before this one, these contract employees cook meals, wash clothes, deliver fuel and guard bases. And they die and suffer alongside their brothers and sisters in uniform. About 1,000 contractors have been killed in Iraq since the war began; nearly 13,000 have been injured.
 The consequences of the war will be lasting for many of them and their families, ordeals that are largely invisible to most Americans. And they will be costly. The most grievously injured, like Mrs. Khan, are initially treated at military hospitals in Iraq and Europe, then sent home and left to the mercies of their employer's insurance carrier. The less critically hurt, and those with psychic wounds, must fend for themselves to get care.
 Nobody makes the private workers go to Iraq or forces them to stay, of course; the high salaries some collect lead critics to dismiss them as mercenaries and their employers as profiteers. But many more contractors, like Mrs. Khan, earn relatively modest wages -- far less than the $100,000 the Army says an enlisted soldier costs annually in pay, benefits and training -- and some foreign workers who perform some of the most dangerous tasks are paid just dollars a day. After a decade of downsizing and outsourcing, the American military cannot wage war without them. 
 ''Everything about this is unprecedented,'' said Peter W. Singer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who has written about battlefield contractors. ''The scope, the numbers, the roles people are performing -- this is all new ground.''
 In addition to escaping her troubles, Mrs. Khan, who became an American citizen in 2001, thought going to Iraq would give her a chance to repay the country that offered her fulfillment she could never have had in Pakistan, a close friend said. 
 ''She is totally trapped now -- only her mind and her soul remain her own,'' the friend, Betty Linder, who was once Mrs. Khan's boss, wrote in an e-mail interview. ''Her quest for freedom, literally and symbolically, put her in an eternal prison. The sadness of this could almost symbolize the sadness of the whole Iraq situation.''
 Shaheen Abdul was born into a middle-class family in Karachi. She excelled at the university there, then followed her sister, Mumtaz, to Houston in 1986 and began working in her dry cleaning shop.
 She returned to Karachi seven years later to marry Abdul Waheed Khan, a union arranged by their families. The couple moved to Houston in 1998, when her husband, a welder, got work papers.
 She began teaching at Mrs. Linder's preschool, the Linder Learning Land. ''Shaheen does not have children of her own and she gives all of her love to those that she teaches,'' Mrs. Linder wrote.
 But as happy as she was at school, things were tense at home. Her husband, then working for Halliburton, was often away on jobs and sporadically unemployed, and the couple's credit card debts and car loans totaled more than $35,000 by 2004, Mrs. Khan said. 
 KBR, which until this year was a subsidiary of Halliburton, was hiring for all manner of work in Iraq. Mrs. Khan signed up for a laundry job with a base salary of $48,000 a year and the chance to make as much as $80,000 with overtime, much of it tax-free. 
 She and her husband planned to work a year in Iraq, clear their debts and start anew.
 She signed the 13-page employment agreement with KBR on Aug. 12, 2004, without reading it. The contract noted that she would be working in a ''potentially hazardous environment'' and that her only compensation if she were hurt or killed would be that provided under the Defense Base Act, the law that provides insurance for workers employed at United States military facilities overseas. 
 Mrs. Khan said she underwent several days of briefings and training in safety procedures by KBR. Heather Browne, a KBR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message that during training, ''most of the time is spent on discouraging recruits from taking the job.''
 After the contracts were signed, the Khans were told it was company policy not to send spouses to the same war zone, as they had hoped. On Aug. 15, Abdul Khan boarded a plane to work as a welder at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Thirteen days later, Shaheen Khan left for Baghdad.
 She was assigned a sandbag-ringed trailer in a KBR residential compound known as D2 inside the Green Zone. At 6 a.m. each day, a van picked up Mrs. Khan and other laundry workers and took them to Camp Warrior at the other end of the Green Zone, where she logged in bags of laundry. 
 She found the war zone overwhelming. She had to wear a helmet and a flak vest, and she jumped every time she heard a mortar land or a roadside bomb explode. Her husband, with whom she talked every few days by satellite phone, urged her to go home. 
 On Oct. 3, 2004, she and four other workers were preparing to return to D2 for the night. Anice Holmes, a no-nonsense woman who lives on a small horse farm outside Livingston, Tex., usually took the wheel. She was in Iraq to accumulate some cash after her husband had become disabled. That day, however, Fitim Konjuvca, a young worker from Kosovo, begged to do the driving. 
 Mrs. Holmes, her sister Kathy Elliott and Mrs. Khan climbed in the back seat. Another KBR laundry worker took the front passenger seat.
 Mr. Konjuvca sped off onto a boulevard near the famous crossed-sabers memorial and began climbing past 70 miles per hour, Mrs. Holmes recalled. ''My sister began to yell, 'Fitim!' to tell him to slow down, and then we saw the box in the road. I figured he was going to slow down and go around it, and then he was throwing on the brakes and we're rolling over. I thought we were gone.''
 As the car was tumbling, Mrs. Holmes recalled praying, ''Jesus forgive me of my sins.'' Mrs. Khan said she recited verses from the Koran before blacking out.
 Mrs. Khan and Mrs. Holmes were the most seriously hurt. They were treated at an Army field hospital in Baghdad and then flown to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, an Army hospital in Germany, for surgery.
 Mrs. Khan's husband, alerted to the accident by KBR officials in Afghanistan, hopped a military plane to be byher side. ''I am crying and shouting and weeping and asking what is wrong,'' Mr. Khan said. ''They told me it was her back. I knew right away she would never walk again.''
 After five days at Landstuhl, Mrs. Khan was flown to Houston, where she endured weeks of surgery and rehabilitation. She ended up in the Willowbrook nursing home, sharing a small room with a dying old woman.
 KBR dismissed her, as it does all employees unable to work. Her case was turned over to its insurer, the American International Group.
 A.I.G. paid Mrs. Khan's hospital charges and is covering her nursing home costs. The company calculated her disability payments at $208.88 a week, based on her salary as a teacher and the five weeks she worked in Iraq. On the advice of an A.I.G. adjuster, she hired Gary B. Pitts, a Houston lawyer who represents dozens of contractors hurt in Iraq, and sued the insurer for a higher payment, based on her real and anticipated earnings at KBR. A year and a half after her injury, an administrative law judge awarded her $30,500 a year until she is deemed fit to return to work. Mrs. Khan says she is in too much pain to work now. 
 She has also disputed her medical benefits with A.I.G. The company rejected a claim for treatment of an infected foot, finally relenting after months of wrangling. But the company has refused to pay for in-home care so she can leave the nursing home. An A.I.G. official, Chris Winans, said he could not comment on Mrs. Khan's case for privacy reasons.
 Some Americans shrug about the casualties among contractors, saying they made their money and they took their chances. Others, though, think the nation owes them something more.
 ''We should honor their sacrifices and those of their families,'' said Frank Camm, a Rand Corporation economist who has studied contracting and is the son of a retired Army lieutenant general. ''They're not in uniform, and there is something special about being in uniform. But they deserve a hell of a lot more than we're giving them.''
 Shaheen Khan does not dwell on such questions, or if she does, she does not talk about it. She regrets her decision to go to Iraq, the product, she now believes, of desperation and self-delusion. 
 ''I made a big mistake going over there,'' she said. ''I fooled myself.''

HEADLINE: India's Automakers Face Big Hurdles in Pursuing Global Ambitions

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
Automakers already struggling with intense competition in the United States and many other regions of the world have long worried about their prospects after China and India begin building large numbers of ultra-cheap cars.
 But Chinese carmakers have experienced numerous setbacks to their global ambitions, and a new study of the Indian auto industry reveals more obstacles than many outsiders expected.
 The study, released yesterday by I.B.M. and the Transportation Research Institute of the University of Michigan, notes that Indian automakers are plagued by shortages of skilled workers, inferior product quality and inadequate highway infrastructure, among other challenges. 
 Its authors, who interviewed 30 high-level executives and automotive experts in India, are confident that the industry will surmount the impediments to make India one of the world's top 10 vehicle-producing countries by 2015. But they suggest that the Indian car market remains in a fairly primitive stage of development.
 ''Roads are the big problem,'' said Allan Henderson, senior managing consultant at the I.B.M. Institute for Business Value. ''The infrastructure needs to be improved more than you might think. There's a number of problems, but they're aware of them and they know what it takes to overcome them.''
 Sales of passenger cars in India have more than doubled since 2002, to 1.4 million from 675,116, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 38 makers of vehicles and engines. Passenger car exports have nearly quadrupled in the period but still were less than 200,000 in the last 12 months.
 Future growth could be limited, however, by too few engineers and skilled trades workers. Although India is known as a home of plentiful low-cost labor, many workers do not have the qualifications that automakers there desire.
 ''It was almost unanimous amongst the interviewees that this is a challenge they need to work on,'' said Bruce M. Belzowski, senior research associate in the Transportation Research Institute's automotive analysis division. ''We were under the impression, as most Westerners are, that India is an almost unlimited source of labor.''
 Even if carmakers are able to increase production, the study found that many consumers do not want to buy the products because roads are in poor shape and congested. Motorcycles and other two-wheelers are the most popular form of transportation, outselling four-wheeled vehicles four to one. 
 Exporting is troublesome as well. Indian automakers have difficulty understanding foreign consumers, developing a range of models, managing global supply chain logistics and incorporating advanced technology, the study concluded. Additionally, Indian ports would need significant upgrades to handle high volumes of vehicles.
 ''They're not ready for full-scale exporting,'' Mr. Belzowski said. 
 The problems that Indian automakers are facing will not halt the industry's growth, but they will take time and considerable resources to resolve, Mr. Henderson said.
 Ultimately, he said, ''it doesn't look like there's really anything that should stop the Indians from being major global players.''
 ''They fully expect to be a powerhouse on the world stage.''
 The country's automakers do have several important factors working in their favor: The Indian government is solidly behind their efforts, even drafting an aggressive mission plan for the industry, and Indian consumers generally want to buy vehicles made in their own country to support the economy. (In contrast, Detroit's automakers often complain that they get little support from the United States government or from American consumers.)
 As a result, executives interviewed for the study projected domestic sales to double, to 2.8 million by 2010 and reach 4.2 million by 2015. Even then, just a small fraction of the nation's more than 1.1 billion people will own cars.
 India can assert some advantages over China, which has about 200 million more people and a fairly extensive road network. Auto loans are more widely available in India, making it easier for less affluent consumers to buy a car, and intellectual property is more respected in India than in China, where vehicle designs are often copied freely.

HEADLINE: Ad Downturn Threatening The Survival of Business 2.0

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
One of the voices chronicling the resurgence of high tech may soon be silenced.
 Business 2.0 magazine, a seven-year-old Time Inc. publication that covers start-ups, technology trends and changes in the new economy, might publish its final issue in September, according to people briefed on discussions about the fate of the magazine. 
 Though a reprieve is still possible, according to these people, executives at Time Inc., the nation's largest magazine group, are threatening to shut down Business 2.0 in the midst of a sharp drop in advertising at the San Francisco-based magazine.
 Advertising revenue at Business 2.0 was down 38 percent through July 9 of this year, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. The most recent issue on newsstands ran a scant 102 pages, although summer months are traditionally lean for magazines.
 At the same time, readers are still showing interest in the publication: in 2006 its paid circulation -- 623,000, including newsstand sales -- was roughly the same as 2005.
 So why the threat of the ax for the business and technology magazine during such heated times for the field?
 Aside from the overall downturn in the magazine business, current and former Time Inc. employees point to what appears to have been an ill-advised move this year to combine the advertising sales teams of Time Inc.'s finance and business publications, which include Fortune, Money, CNNMoney.com, Fortune Small Business and Business 2.0. 
 Consolidated under a single banner, Time Inc.'s Business and Finance Network (or Tibfin, as it is known inside the company), Time sales representatives stopped pitching the distinct appeal and audience of Business 2.0 to focus on the larger titles like Fortune. 
 That often turned Business 2.0 into an afterthought; big advertisers like Microsoft and Intel were offered discounts on other Time Inc. business titles if they would also buy pages in Business 2.0.
 The consolidation of sales staffs has been tough on other Time Inc. titles as well, with ad dollars, through July 9, down 26.8 percent at Fortune Small Business, 13.4 percent at Fortune and 8.3 percent at Money. The Time executive who headed the Tibfin initiative, Christopher J. Poleway, was replaced three weeks ago by Vivek Shah as head of the unit. Mr. Shah had run the profitable CNNMoney.com portal.
 Josh Quittner, the former Time magazine technology writer and editor of Business 2.0, has endeavored to save the magazine, even unsuccessfully soliciting venture capital this year in an attempt to buy the title from Time Inc. 
 If Business 2.0 indeed goes the way of defunct Silicon Valley magazines like the Industry Standard, the original Red Herring and Upside, 10 editorial employees will stay on and join Fortune magazine in covering Silicon Valley, according to people briefed on these plans.
 But a final decision still appears to be forthcoming. Mr. Quittner and a Time Inc. spokeswoman declined comment.

HEADLINE: G.M. Buys Stake in Maker of Diesel Engines

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 16 

 BODY:
General Motors said on Monday that it was buying 50 percent of the Italian diesel engine maker VM Motori from Penske Corporation and would introduce a new high-performance V6 diesel engine built by VM Motori. 
 G.M. gave no financial details on the deal but said it had reached a joint venture agreement with Penske, a closely held transportation services company based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., to purchase equity in VM Motori.
 G.M. and VM Motori will jointly develop a 2.9-liter V-6 turbo diesel engine that is scheduled to be introduced in the Cadillac CTS in Europe in 2009, G.M. said.
 VM Motori plans to build the new unit at its plant in Cento, Italy, and is responsible for the engine's design, development and testing, G.M. said.
 Dan Hancock, vice president of global engineering at GM Powertrain, said in a conference call that the automaker intended to introduce diesel engines in the United States in pickup trucks and Hummer H2 sports utility vehicle.
 G.M. currently offers 17 diesel engine variants in 45 vehicle lines around the world and sells more than a million diesel engines annually.
 Starting with 2008 model year cars, the United States will begin phasing in what will be the world's strictest regulations for harmful nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions.
 Diesel cars have had higher exhaust levels of nitrogen oxide than gasoline cars, and G.M., like other automakers, has been lukewarm about diesel engines as a solution for increasing fuel economy, citing the high cost of developing an engine clean enough to meet the coming American standards.
 In a video on the company's Web site, G.M.'s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, had said the company would use clean diesel engines in passenger cars, S.U.V.'s and other light-duty trucks.

HEADLINE: The Richest Owe a Debt to the Rest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I do not begrudge great wealth. But I do begrudge the tycoons featured in ''The Richest of the Rich, Proud of a New Gilded Age'' (front page, July 15). 
 These tycoons singularly attribute their immense wealth to personal skills. This is fiction. The tycoons are wrong to ignore their debts to society, and they are wrong to advocate for a light tax burden.
 The tycoons are the greatest beneficiaries of the society provided to them. They are kept safe by the military and police and fire departments; they become richer from the labor from employees educated in the public school systems; their markets are stable and profitable because of regulators and the justice system. The list goes on. 
 Do these tycoons really believe that their riches are independent of these social investments? And why should they be self-excused from a tax responsibility that accounts for the benefits they consume?
 Christopher J. Pagan Cincinnati, July 15, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 While this generation of robber barons can try to minimize the scale and reach of their wealth, and accentuate the extent of their generosity, it is still an open question as to whether such concentrations of wealth produce societies that are economically and culturally beneficial to everyone.
 Michael Scott San Francisco, July 15, 2007
 To the Editor:
 You note that the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was a legendary foe of organized labor. Even as he built libraries and expounded the ''gospel of wealth,'' Carnegie hired armed guards to keep his work force toiling away in the mills. This suggests that the allure of vast wealth is not money but power. 
 Whether giving or taking, Carnegie wanted to be the one in charge. It also hints at a key difference between Carnegie's Gilded Age and our own. A century ago, the extreme concentration of wealth at the top inspired vocal and widespread opposition. Where is that outrage today?

 To the Editor:
 As a historian who has written about Andrew Carnegie and Gilded-Age America, and as an ex-journalist, I read your article with great interest. 
 While you unearthed many telling similarities of our era and that of Carnegie, an important matter was not mentioned: In the 1880s millions of Americans -- urban workers and farmers, native-born and immigrant, Southerners and Northerners -- launched mass democratic movements out of the belief that something had gone terribly wrong with their country. 
 In their eyes, the United States was not a Triumphant Democracy, as Carnegie characterized it in the title of his self-serving book of 1886; rather, the country was, as one critic put it, an example of Feudalism Restored. 
 Given the proof of deepening and unconscionable economic inequity unearthed by your reporter, not to mention the new zillionaires' thoroughly unself-conscious, zany hubris, one might argue that today America has entered a neo-feudal era. Who knows, the putative serfs of our time, like those of the Gilded Age, might take up metaphoric arms. Let's see what happens in November 2008.

 To the Editor:
 It is not merely disingenuous but deceptive for the new tycoons to say, as did Sanford I. Weill, ''We didn't rely on somebody else to build what we built.'' None of them could have built their fortunes without the labor of many workers both in and outside of their businesses. They relied on their employees to do much of the boring, repetitive work, they relied on their wives or other domestic workers to care for their houses and children, do the shopping, prepare their meals, and do their laundry, without which they would not have been free to devote their ''unique talents'' to developing their businesses.
 Their self-congratulatory tone is, frankly, disgusting, as are their bloated salaries and other benefits. Not only should the invisible workers, their enormous support system, be recognized, but they should also receive equitable compensation.
 Carol Delaney Providence, R.I., July 15, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The valuable article about the rise of a new Gilded Age paid insufficient attention to the way such players as Sanford I. Weill benefited from changes to public policy. Chief among them were deregulation, weakening of unions and worker protections, trade expansion, tax cuts and lax antitrust enforcement. 
 These, far more than executive skill or even a long bull market, are behind the rise of these winners. The consequences for the losers, the American middle class, are only beginning to be felt. 
 Jon Talton Phoenix, July 15, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I was amused that one of your titans loves the problems he works on and then acknowledged that ''wealth is not a particularly satisfying outcome.'' But he later added that if more of this ''unsatisfying outcome'' was allocated to the government through increased taxes, he would cut back on how hard he worked.
 Somehow, I'm reminded of that old restaurant joke: the food was so bad and the portions were so small.

HEADLINE: U.N. Inspectors Confirm Shutdown of North Korean Reactor

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 16 

 BODY:
United Nations inspectors have confirmed that North Korea has shut down its weapons-making nuclear reactor, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring arm, said Monday. North Korea warned the United States, though, that the real bargaining over its nuclear disarmament had only begun.
 The much delayed shutdown was brought about with a series of financial and diplomatic concessions. 
 The road ahead will not be easy, officials and experts said.
 Six-nation talks are set to resume Wednesday in Beijing to try to persuade North Korea to start disabling the closed facilities and to disclose all its nuclear materials and facilities, in return for one million tons of heavy fuel oil and other economic aid and diplomatic incentives.
 ''I certainly have to anticipate there will be problems, because I never expected it would take until July to get this first step done,'' said Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state who is the American envoy to the talks, referring to North Korea's agreement in February to turn off the reactor by mid-April.
 ''It's a reminder of how difficult other steps will be,'' he said in Seoul, where he met with South Korean officials in preparation for the Beijing talks. ''But I think we are off to a good start.''
 Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the atomic energy agency, said Monday in Bangkok that his 10-member team of inspectors visiting the nuclear complex at Yongbyon had verified that the reactor had been switched off, as North Korea announced over the weekend.
 ''After tomorrow, we will be able to report, hopefully, that all of the five facilities have been shut down,'' he said. He was referring to five facilities that North Korea has agreed to shut down under the February agreement with the United States, South Korea, China and Russia in return for an initial shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil. They include a radiochemical laboratory that extracts plutonium from spent fuel rods from the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, and two new, bigger reactors under construction nearby.
 The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that that outcome would depend on ''what practical measures the U.S. and Japan, in particular, will take to roll back their hostile policies'' toward North Korea.
 North Korea said it had allowed the atomic energy agency's team in not to inspect its nuclear sites, but only to ''verify and monitor'' the shutdown. That restriction would not allow the agency to investigate independently how much plutonium and how many atomic weapons North Korea has produced at the Yongbyon complex and what it has done with the uranium-enrichment equipment that American officials say it bought from Pakistan.
 ''There will be a lot of difficulty over the highly enriched uranium issue,'' said Yoon Duk-min, a senior analyst at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. ''It is difficult to confirm whether North Korea has a uranium program unless it decides to be transparent.
 ''No one knows how many centrifuges they have built so far. They can hide them in an underground tunnel.''
 A nuclear bomb can be built with either plutonium or uranium. North Korea admits to extracting plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor, but American officials have said since 2002 that North Korea is running a clandestine uranium-enrichment program as well.
 Even if North Korea disables its nuclear facilities, Mr. Yoon and other experts said, it will probably refuse to discuss giving up its nuclear arsenal during six-party talks. It is more likely to insist on separate talks with the United States on arms reduction, including the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, they said.

HEADLINE: Glaciers in Retreat

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: ON CHORABARI GLACIER, India 

 BODY:
This is how a glacier retreats. 
 At nearly 13,000 feet above sea level, in the shadow of a sharp Himalayan peak, a wall of black ice oozes in the sunshine. A tumbling stone breaks the silence of the mountains, or water gurgles under the ground, a sign that the glacier is melting from inside. Where it empties out -- scientists call it the snout -- a noisy, frothy stream rushes down to meet the river Ganges. 
 D.P. Dobhal, a glaciologist who has spent the last three years climbing and poking the Chorabari glacier, stands at the edge of the snout and points ahead. Three years ago, the snout was roughly 90 feet farther away. On a map drawn in 1962, it was plotted 860 feet from here. Mr. Dobhal marked the spot with a Stonehenge-like pile of rocks. 
 Mr. Dobhal's steep and solitary quest -- to measure the changes in the glacier's size and volume -- points to a looming worldwide concern, with particularly serious repercussions for India and its neighbors. The thousands of glaciers studded across 1,500 miles of the Himalayas make up the savings account of South Asia's water supply, feeding more than a dozen major rivers and sustaining a billion people downstream. Their apparent retreat threatens to bear heavily on everything from the region's drinking water supply to agricultural production to disease and floods.
 Indian glaciers are among the least studied in the world, lacking the decades of data that scientists need to deduce trends. Nevertheless, the nascent research offers a snapshot of the consequences of global warming for this country and raises vital questions about how India will respond to them. 
 According to Mr. Dobhal's measurements, the Chorabari's snout has retreated 29.5 feet every year for the last three years, and while that is too short a time to draw scientific conclusions about the glacier's health, it conforms to a disquieting pattern of glacial retreat across the Himalayas. 
 A recent study by the Indian Space Research Organization, using satellite imaging to gauge the changes to 466 glaciers, has found more than a 20 percent reduction in size from 1962 to 2001, with bigger glaciers breaking into smaller pieces, each one retreating faster than its parent. A separate study found the Parbati glacier, one of the largest in the area, to be retreating by 170 feet a year during the 1990s. Another glacier that Mr. Dobhal has tracked, known as Dokriani, lost 20 percent of its size in three decades. Between 1991 and 1995, its snout inched back 55 feet each year. 
 Similar losses are being seen around the world. Lonnie G. Thompson, a glaciologist at Ohio State University, found a 22 percent loss of ice on the Qori Kalis glacier in Peru between 1963 and 2002. He called it ''a repeating theme whether you are in tropical Andes, the Himalayas or Kilimanjaro in Africa.''
 The Chorabari, sweeping down from Kedarnath peak across 2.3 square miles, is relatively lucky. It is blessed with a thick cover of rocks and boulders, which acts as a sort of insulation and slows the melting. Since Mr. Dobhal began collecting data here in 2003, the Chorabari has been shedding its weight -- that is to say, melting faster than the rate at which snow and ice accumulates, and as a result, thinning out by roughly five feet each year. The snow line, in addition, is gradually moving higher.
 A vast and ancient sheet of ice, a glacier is in effect the planet's most sensitive organ, like an aging knee that feels the onset of winter. Its upper reaches accumulate snow and ice when it is cold; its lower reaches melt when it is warm. Its long-term survival depends on the balance between the buildup and the melting. Glaciers worldwide serve as a barometer for global warming, which has, according to a report this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, been spurred in recent decades by rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Even the Himalayas have grown measurably warmer. A recent study found that mean air temperature in the northwestern Himalayan range had risen by 2.2 degrees Celsius in the last two decades, a rate considerably higher than the rate of increase over the last 100 years.
 In its report, the international panel predicted that as these glaciers melt, they would increase the likelihood of flooding over the next three decades and then, as they recede, dry up the rivers that they feed. ''In the course of the century,'' it warned darkly, ''water supply stored in glaciers and snow cover are projected to decline, reducing water availability in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges, where more than one-sixth of the world population currently lives.''
 India's public response so far has been to blame the industrialized world for rising emissions and resist any mandatory caps of its own. India's per capita share of emissions is one-twentieth that of industrialized countries, the government points out, going on to argue that any restrictions on emissions would stunt its economic growth. 
 And yet, as critics say, India's rapid economic advance, combined with a population of more than a billion people, will soon make it a far bigger contributor to greenhouse gases. More to the point, India stands to bear some of the most devastating consequences of human-induced climate change. 
 The dearth of scientific knowledge adds to the alarm. River flow data is so scant and recent that it is impossible for scientists to predict how the current rates of glacial retreat will affect river volume. 
 To spend a couple of days with Mr. Dobhal, 44, a glaciologist with the Wadia Institute for Himalayan Geology, a government-sponsored research institution based in the North Indian city of Dehradun, is to understand why there is not more research on these glaciers. It is lonely, time-consuming work, equally demanding of body and mind. 
 Mr. Dobhal's days begin inside a tent, not particularly well-suited for such chilly heights, usually around 5:30, with prayers and a cup of hot tea. 
 This morning's journey is just above the base camp, to about 12,800 feet, where Mr. Dobhal must install a set of crude bamboo rulers to measure the undulations of the ice. The drilling machine in this case is a steady hiss of steam that comes out of a steam machine carried on the back and inserted into the glacier through a long, narrow pipe. Mr. Dobhal drives it slowly, expertly through the solid black ice, taking care to drill an absolutely straight 13-foot-long hole. 
 When it is done, the bamboo pole slides in effortlessly. When he is finished, there will be 40 such stakes up and down the Chorabari, in the upper reaches where the ice accumulates in winter, all the way down to where the snout spills its meltwaters. Over the next months, the stakes will record the rise and fall of the ice -- in other words, changes in the glacier's total mass. 
 Downstream, where the glacier's meltwater becomes what is known as the Mandakini River, comes another set of crucial measurements. Six times a day, Mr. Dobhal and his aides, all ethnic gurkhas from Nepal, measure the depth of the water and the speed at which it flows. It is a remarkably simple experiment, like one you might do for a high school science fair. A square wooden paddle, attached to a string, is floated down the channel. A stopwatch measures how long it takes to travel 23 feet. 
 ''This will tell me how much water we are getting from one glacier and at different seasons -- how much in summer, how much in winter, how much in the rainy season,'' was Mr. Dobhal's explanation. 
 Think of the glacier as a bank account, Mr. Dobhal offered. If its total volume -- as measured by the stakes installed in the ice -- is ''how much we have in the bank,'' then the flow of the Mandakini is like the dividends being released for everyday use. 
 Mr. Dobhal's days follow a relentlessly measured pattern. Every day, he is back at the base camp no later than 2 p.m., which is when the risk of an avalanche grows. Even in summer, there are fluke snowstorms; one in late May kept Mr. Dobhal and his crew up all night, brushing snow off the tops of their tents. Tourists and trekkers rarely venture up to these heights. Every once in a while, a Hindu monk can be seen foraging for firewood. Mr. Dobhal met one last year, meditating inside a cave. Even the wildlife is limited to bears and mountain rats. 
 Most evenings are spent listening to a transistor radio broadcast around a campfire. Financing, too, is limited. This year, Mr. Dobhal said he dug in his own pockets to buy winter socks for his aides. 
 Over the coming months, barring an avalanche that could tear them down, the stakes will chronicle the changes in the glacier. At the end of summer, Mr. Dobhal will return to the base camp to see how far the ice has shrunk, and again, he will come when winter sets in, for another set of measurements. The fate of the Chorabari glacier will slowly, painstakingly be revealed.

HEADLINE: A New Fight For a Holdout On Prohibition

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: MOORESTOWN, N.J. 

 BODY:
 For all that this well-to-do South Jersey town has -- a history as rich and deep as some of America's oldest cities, a designation by a national magazine as the top community in which to raise a family -- it has long been well known for something that it lacks: liquor sales.
 Founded by Quakers in the 17th century and further fortified by the temperance movement 100 years ago, Moorestown is one of 39 remaining dry towns -- including Haddonfield and Ocean City -- among New Jersey's 566 municipalities. 
 But now Moorestown, which wears its prohibition like a proud old pearl brooch in an era when suburban towns seem to crave more bling, is, for the third time in a century, considering allowing limited alcohol sales.
 Proponents of the plan, in which the town would sell as many as a half-dozen liquor licenses to restaurateurs for about $1.5 million each, say doing so could provide a welcome infusion of cash to this town of 20,000 and increase its tax base.
 Critics say that it would alter the character of a town that since before Prohibition has been defined as much by a distinct value system preventing alcohol sales as by its sturdy Colonials.
 As supporters work to gather the 1,800 signatures required to put the proposal on the November ballot, many here are split over whether the possible financial rewards in the future are worth breaking with an uncommon part of the town's past.
 ''Moorestown is special,'' said Daniel Roccato, a member of the Township Council who opposes the liquor licenses. ''Are we special because we don't have booze? No. Is that a factor in what makes us special? Absolutely. There is a certain part of our character that is inexorably linked to the fact that we are a dry town.''
 Dry, and divided: The Council voted 3 to 2 this spring to put the referendum process in motion.
 Mr. Roccato argues that the long-term financial effects of relaxing the town's blue laws would be far more harmful than the short-term profit from the liquor licenses.
 ''People are painting a misleading picture when they say there is only benefit and no cost,'' Mr. Roccato said. ''No one is calculating the extra costs.'' 
 He predicted that the police would have to hire more officers to respond to calls at establishments where alcohol is sold and to deal with increased drunken driving. 
 But Jacob Der Hagopian, chairman of the Moorestown Economic Development Advisory Committee and the leading supporter of the plan, calculates the benefits, like the taxes the town could collect from liquor sales. 
 ''We're not trying to create a Mardi Gras-type of drinking environment here,'' said Mr. Der Hagopian, a business developer who has lived in the township for 11 years. ''We're talking about fine dining here.''
 He said that the proposal would not allow liquor stores and that it would probably restrict the licenses to restaurants on the commercial corridor along Route 38 at the southern end of town.
 He also said that communities that border Moorestown -- many of which have liquor stores strategically placed on the township line -- generate money from selling bottles to those who patronize Moorestown restaurants where diners are allowed to bring their own. 
 ''We have to let our commercial assets be able to compete with other towns' commercial assets,'' Mr. Der Hagopian said. 
 Under New Jersey law, municipalities are allowed to issue one liquor license for every 3,000 residents, which is why Moorestown, population 19,017 in the 2000 census, would be limited to six. A license in nearby Cherry Hill recently resold for $1.5 million; Mr. Der Hagopian said bidding would probably open here at $1 million.
 Founded in 1682, the same year as Philadelphia, Moorestown shares a Quaker heritage with that much larger city, 14 miles west across the Delaware River, where it is far easier to procure a drink. 
 Locals say the town's arid history can be traced to its Quaker roots. Later, when the women's temperance movement gained enough sway to lobby the town to enact a regulation, it was codified in 1915, and the sale of liquor was barred in stores and in restaurants.
 Prohibition rendered such laws moot, but when it ended in 1933, Moorestown stayed dry. Twice over the past 75 years -- in 1935 and in 1953 -- residents have had the opportunity to pass referendums putting a red line through the blue laws. Both were soundly defeated, and it could be an uphill battle again this time.
 ''A lot of people don't think it'll pass -- they say, 'Who really needs it?' '' said Ben Blumberg, the owner of Barnacle Ben's restaurant here, which would not be going for a license if the referendum passes. ''A lot of people have wine cellars. There's liquor stores you can walk to. If people want liquor, they know how to find it.''
 Residents jealously guard their quality of life in this town, which Money magazine named the best place to live in 2005.
 Derwood Clem, 68, who has lived here for 26 years, said some of his neighbors ''fear'' -- using air quotes -- the kind of customers who might be attracted by restaurants where liquor is available. 
 ''There's some concern about unsavory characters coming into town,'' Mr. Clem said, before leaning in close and adding in a stage whisper. ''I know a lot of unsavory characters that live here right now.''
 Some opponents of the plan might pin that label on a significant figure from the town's past, Thomas Moore. 
 Mr. Moore who settled here about 1720, soon bought up so much land that the locals changed the community's name from Chester Township to Moorestown. 
 Local historians say that not much is known about Mr. Moore, like what brought him to the town that would eventually bear his name or precisely how long he stayed here. But among the facts that remain in the historical record is his occupation: He was a tavern owner.

HEADLINE: Powerful Earthquake Shakes Japan's Northwest Coast

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, July 17 

 BODY:
A powerful earthquake shook Japan's northwestern coast on Monday morning, killing at least nine people and injuring more than 900, flattening hundreds of buildings and leaving thousands homeless.
 The earthquake also caused a small fire at a nuclear power plant, the world's largest, which later leaked a small amount of water containing radioactive materials into the Sea of Japan. 
 The company operating the plant said the radioactivity level posed no danger to the environment, but it delayed acknowledging the leak for several hours. 
 Television commentators criticized the company's delay in reporting the leak, which was likely to raise fresh concerns about the safety of Japan's nuclear reactors. Japan depends greatly on nuclear power, and its nuclear industry has long been afflicted by scandals and cover-ups.
 The earthquake was centered off the cost of Niigata, a prefecture that was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2004. 
 Skyscrapers here in Tokyo, about 130 miles southeast of Niigata, swayed for almost a minute.
 Japan's meteorological agency said the magnitude was 6.8; the United States Geological Survey put it at 6.6.
 The tremor occurred at 10:13 a.m. on what was a national holiday here. It caused minor tsunamis and buckled roads and bridges. It also toppled one local train and shut down service on the bullet train for several hours, as well as interrupting the supply of power and water to tens of thousands of homes.
 Nuclear reactors in the affected area shut down automatically, but the quake caused a small fire at an electrical transformer at a nuclear plant in Kashiwazaki, a coastal town close to the quake's epicenter. 
 Japanese television stations showed flames and black smoke billowing from the nuclear plant, which is operated by Tokyo Electric. The fire occurred at the plant's No. 3 reactor, which the company said suffered no damage.
 Tokyo Electric initially said that there had been no radiation leaks at the plant. But later in the evening, it said in a statement that a total of 1.36 quarts of water containing low levels of radioactive materials leaked from two locations at its No. 6 reactor, which had been shut down at the time for a regular inspection, into a larger water tank. A total of 317 gallons of water in the tank, including the small amount containing radioactive materials, was then pumped out into the Sea of Japan.
 The leakage occurred at 12:50 p.m. But the company did not acknowledge that there had been a leak containing radioactive materials until past 10 p.m. At that point, it acknowledged on its Web site that it had known at 6:20 p.m. that the leaked water contained radioactive materials, without explaining the delay. 
 Early Tuesday morning, Akira Amari, the minister of economy, trade and industry, summoned Tokyo Electric's president, Tsunehisa Katsumata, and warned him about the company's handling of the incident. ''This may cause people to distrust nuclear power,'' Mr. Amari said. ''We will not have the plant resume operations without confirming safety.''
 In 2002, Tokyo Electric was forced to shut down reactors in Fukushima, a prefecture in northeastern Japan, after admitting that it had covered up violations and falsified records at three plants for more than a decade.
 On Monday, the Japanese media reported that more than 10,000 people left their homes for evacuation centers after the earthquake. The authorities struggled to deliver provisions to the evacuees, most of whom had access to only hardtack and water by late evening.
 Aftershocks could be felt for several hours after the quake, including a large one at 3:37 p.m. that was felt here in Tokyo. 
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe interrupted a campaign appearance in Nagasaki, in western Japan, to fly by helicopter to Niigata. ''I would like to make every possible effort to restore lifelines such as roads, gas and water, because the victims are in a tough situation,'' Mr. Abe, whose approval ratings have continued to slide as an election in the upper house of Parliament nears, told reporters after surveying the damage.
 Troops from the Self-Defense Force were deployed to the affected area. In Kashiwazaki, troops succeeded in freeing an elderly woman trapped in the rubble of her home for more than five hours.
 The authorities said the nine people who died were men and women in their 70s and 80s. Like other rural areas in Japan, Niigata has a disproportionately high number of elderly residents, often living alone in traditional wooden houses that are prone to collapse during earthquakes.
 In October 2004, more than 60 people died and thousands were injured in a 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Niigata. The government was criticized for not providing adequate services for evacuees, many of whom had to stay in public housing for months.

HEADLINE: Avoiding the Dangers Down in the Garden

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
''Leaves of three, let them be.'' No doubt you've heard this warning about poison ivy, a weedy plant that each year causes more than 350,000 reported cases of human contact dermatitis, and probably many thousands more unreported cases. 
 Anecdotes from doctor's offices indicate that this year is shaping up as a particularly nasty one for poison ivy, or Toxicodendron radicans, and evidence suggests that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the air have contributed to bumper crops with a more potent toxin. 
 But the rising risk of developing an extremely itchy, blistering rash from poison ivy is only one of the recent changes in human exposures to toxic or harmful plants.
 Many homes and gardens play host to an increasing number of hazardous plants, and children are most often at risk. In 2003, according to an authoritative new book, poison control centers nationwide received more than 57,000 calls relating to exposure to potentially harmful plants, and 85 percent of them involved children under age 6. Most, however, were considered simply exposures; either no toxin was ingested or the amount consumed was too small to be harmful. 
 The book, ''Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants'' by Dr. Lewis S. Nelson, Dr. Richard D. Shih and Michael J. Balick, was produced under the auspices of the New York Botanical Garden, where Dr. Balick is director of the Institute of Economic Botany. While its primary mission is to help health care professionals identify and treat plant-caused injuries, this lavishly illustrated book can be a helpful guide to ordinary people. It highlights hundreds of troublesome plants, providing photographs and written descriptions, common names, geographic distributions, toxic parts and toxins, effects on the body and information on medical management. 
 I was stunned to realize just how many of these potentially dangerous plants were in my own home and garden, including aloe, elephant's ear, jade, peace lily (Spathiphyllum), philodendron and dumbcane (Dieffenbacchia), as well as foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), hellebore, vinca, rhododendron and chrysanthemum. I count my blessings that none of my children or grandchildren tried to chomp on one of them.
 Of course, plant-based poisons have an important role to play, especially in discouraging predators. And through the ages and into modern times, many have served important medicinal roles. Vinca, for example, was the original source of the anticancer drug vincristine, and foxglove gave us the valuable heart stimulant digitalis.
 Deer, which have become a horrific horticultural nuisance in the Northeast, somehow know to avoid dining on several of the toxic plants, like vinca and foxglove, enabling gardeners to plant them in unfenced areas. If only our children were equally knowledgeable.
 Common Risks
 Dr. Nelson, of New York University School of Medicine and the New York City Poison Control Center, said the problem often began with the fact that many toxic plants are beautiful and colorful, prompting people to pick them to adorn their homes and gardens. But their very attractiveness is what creates a hazard for small children, who may be tempted to put toxic berries, flowers or foliage in their mouths.
 A second risk involves adults, who pick what they think are edible or medicinal plants but mistakenly choose a toxic look-alike. In a recent incident cited by Dr. Nelson, a group of people picked what they thought were wild leeks, or ramps, cooked and ate them. What they really consumed was the cardiac toxin from young false hellebore. Fortunately, they survived the resulting heart rhythm disturbance.
 Other cases have involved people who picked foxglove before it flowered, thinking it was a helpful herb that could be made into a medicinal tea. And sometimes herbal teas that should be safe are not because they were accidentally contaminated by a toxic plant. Thus, it is best to stick to well-known commercial brands packaged in the United States. 
 While ingested plant poisons are the most common hazard for small children, for adults and older children the usual sources of misery are plants that create problems on physical contact, like poison ivy. I asked Dr. Nelson what people do wrong after coming into contact with poison ivy, and the answer was simple: ''They don't wash their hands quickly and thoroughly enough. If you wash off the toxin with soap and water within 10 or 15 minutes, it's unlikely to cause a reaction.'' 
 This can be a particular problem for outdoor sports enthusiasts, landscapers and other outdoor workers who may not notice their contact with the plant or may not have a means of quickly washing away the toxin, called urushiol. Even those who do wash may fail to scrub off the urushiol that gets under fingernails and then spread it to other parts of the body, Dr. Nelson said. 
 Over the course of hours or days, urushiol causes a slowly developing rash characterized by pain, itchiness, redness, swelling and blisters. Contrary to what many people think, the rash itself does not spread. Rather, people spread the toxin around their bodies through scratching and contact with contaminated clothing.
 Other Problem Plants
 Poison ivy is hardly the only source of urushiol, a class of toxins with varying potencies. It is also found in the skin of mangoes, as I sadly learned after eating a mango off the rind. It was still winter when I called my dermatologist and said, ''If I didn't know better, I'd say I had poison ivy of the mouth.'' His immediate response: ''You've been eating mangoes.'' 
 Why, I wondered, had this not happened years ago? The answer was that after repeated exposures to urushiol that caused no reaction, I had become sensitized to the allergen and thereafter any contact with it could cause the same miserable reaction. Dr. Nelson said 85 percent of the population has the potential to develop sensitivity to urushiol. So if you think you can safely traipse through poison ivy, think again. Sooner or later you are likely to suffer as I did.
 Treatment of a poison ivy rash typically involves relieving the itch with calamine lotion and taking an oral antihistamine or, in more serious cases, a corticosteroid. 
 Another common source of contact dermatitis involves the stinging nettle, a weedy plant that also seems to be thriving in our carbon dioxide-enriched environment, Dr. Balick said. These plants are a source of mechanical irritants. They have fragile hypodermic-like tubules containing a mixture of irritant chemicals that are injected when bare skin brushes against the plant and stinging hairs from the stems and leaves break the skin. Unlike poison ivy, the burning, itchy rash caused by stinging nettles is short-lived.
 Still other problem plants contain chemical irritants, like capsaicin from chili peppers. This chemical is a mucous membrane irritant that causes the release of a substance that stimulates pain fibers and inflammation. This is especially painful when contaminated fingers transfer the chemical to the eyes or genitalia. To relieve the discomfort, it takes thorough and repeated washing, an analgesic to relieve the pain and, in some cases, anti-inflammatory medication.
 Some plants, including agave, snow-on-the-mountain, crown-of-thorns, marsh marigold and buttercup, contain an irritant sap or latex, which can cause a chemical burn on the skin.
 Finally, there are plants that contain phototoxins -- substances that increase the sensitivity of the skin to ultraviolet light and can result in a blistering sunburn. Among these are yarrow, rue and Queen Anne's lace.

HEADLINE: Offering Comfort to the Sick and Blessings to Their Healers

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
At 1 p.m. on a weekday, the emergency department at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Upper Manhattan is in full cry, with bays crowded, patients on stretchers lining the hallways, and paramedics bringing in more sick people. Time for the Rev. Margaret A. Muncie to work the floor.
 Not shy, this pastor with the clerical collar, the Ann Taylor blazer and the cheerful insistence of one whose own mother called her a steamroller. Among the first women ordained an Episcopal priest and a self-described ''Caucasian minority,'' she's an odd bird among the ethnically diverse staff and especially the patients, most of them black or Latino. But she keeps pecking her head behind curtains, parting gatherings of worried family members, impervious to startled looks of suspicion.
 ''Hi, I'm Peggy Muncie, a hospital chaplain,'' she says. ''Would you like a visit?'' 
 She's not there to thump. Deftly, she asks people how they're feeling, then lets them vent their pain and fear, their anxiety and frustration. She nods, a little pushy with her probing. She flags a nurse. ''Can you direct a doctor toward that patient?'' she whispers.
 And always, at the end of a visit: ''Would it be all right if I prayed with you?'' The health care chaplain will touch a forehead, hold a hand and quietly pray worries to the Divine, speaking with inflections that, as needed, may be Pentecostal, Roman Catholic, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim. For the Baptist woman in Bed 7 whose anxieties are making her chest pain worse, the chaplain prays for calm to allow the medicine to work. Gradually, the patient's breathing slows.
 ''My job is to be present to patients without judgment,'' Chaplain Muncie says as she pumps a hand sanitizer, ''and to help them find out what is meaningful to guide them through the stress of illness.''
 Most health care facilities around the country work with clergy members. But their involvement varies widely. Some hospitals merely have a list of on-call pastors; others retain professionally trained, board-certified health care chaplains, like Ms. Muncie, who is the only full-time cleric at St. Luke's. (The hospital also has a rabbi and an imam part-time, and a supervisory program for theological students.) 
 These varying levels of commitment have less to do with differing philosophies about spirituality and healing than with the bottom line. Insurance carriers do not reimburse for a chaplain's salary. 
 ''We're a non-revenue-producing service, and in the economics of modern health care, that's not a good place to be,'' said the Rev. George F. Handzo, a vice president at the HealthCare Chaplaincy, a New York City organization that trains and places many chaplains. 
 ''But there is a lot of indirect contribution to the mission of a hospital,'' he added, ''as well as to its margin: customer satisfaction, customer retention and goodwill in the community. From a revenue standpoint, that's crucial.'' 
 The chaplain is also expected to minister to the hospital staff. As Chaplain Muncie, 59, makes her way throughout St. Luke's with a painstaking limp, she chats easily with doctors and nurses. She has sat with an intern who sobbed uncontrollably after pronouncing her first death and prayed with a ward clerk whose mother was in intensive care.
 Every year, the chaplain performs a ''Blessing of the Hands.'' She wheels a cart adorned with a tablecloth, flowers, a bowl and an MP3 player. Surgeons, nurses, aides crowd around as she dips their hands in water, blessing their healing work.
 Although intercessory praying for the sick has existed since the time of ancient shamans, the chaplain's role now reflects the impact of modern technology on medicine. In her nearly five years at St. Luke's, Ms. Muncie has helped mediate ''do not resuscitate'' decisions, organ donations and bioethics disputes. After a visit, she puts the details in a patient's chart. 
 Now she's off to the intensive care unit, where many patients are intubated or comatose. Undeterred, Chaplain Muncie goes room by room, soul-searching. From one bed, eyes watch drowsily but intently; from another, a gurgle: ''Ahhh,'' then, faintly, ''mennnn.''
 ''They say the last sense to leave is a person's hearing,'' she says. ''Well, I was a cheerleader and I can belt it out as loud as anyone.''
 Spotting the chaplain, a woman jumps up from a bedside and embraces her. ''Her husband is semicomatose,'' Ms. Muncie explains later. ''She is going to be a widow soon and she knows it. She trusts me now, so I can begin to ask the difficult questions: 'Have you started to plan for your future?' ''
 One of Chaplain Muncie's signature responsibilities is to stand with a patient's family in the bleak early hours of death. The St. Luke's chaplains are paged when a child or a staff member dies; if a death is traumatic; or in the event of a calamity like a fire. But though raw, savage grief has no vocabulary, Chaplain Muncie must give it voice, in a multitude of languages.
 Recently, a woman from Mexico who spoke no English had to be told that her eldest son, 16, had been stabbed, and died just after surgery. As Chaplain Muncie helped deliver the news, she realized that the shocked woman was Pentecostal. So the chaplain held her, praying in the name of Jesus that Jesus would take her son to Heaven, that Jesus would give her strength to bear this. 
 A few weeks ago, the chaplain had to prepare a Jewish family for a morgue viewing of their father. ''I know that in Judaism, you don't say that the deceased goes to heaven,'' she says now. ''You talk about memory and legacy. This family was having a hard time getting closure. So I said: 'What would your father be saying to help you get through this? What memory will you hold of him?' And their mood changed.''
 Her core belief about healing, says Chaplain Muncie, is animated by Psalm 121: ''My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth'' -- spirit and body; faith and medicine. In 1996, doctors found a benign tumor in her brain the size of a tennis ball. The day after it was removed, she had a stroke. Her right side became paralyzed.
 ''I was frightened and mad,'' she says, over a hasty salad. ''But mostly I worried about my husband and daughters: What about them?''
 So many people prayed for her. She was not allowed to abandon hope, not through the years of pain and physical therapy that reduced the paralysis to a lurching limp, thanks to a device she was recently fitted for -- ''an electronic doohickey, my own little miracle.''
 She hitches up a pants-leg to show off the gadget, a neurostimulator. ''I walk faster now,'' she says. ''I'm the kick-butt chaplain.'' The experience deeply informs her ministry. ''In Scripture it says, 'Get up from your bed and walk, your faith has made you well,' '' she continues. 
 '' 'Well' doesn't mean perfect. But wholeness and healing can happen, even when there is still brokenness on the outside,'' she adds, tears spilling. ''I'm more whole now than 12 years ago. But I still walk a little funny.''
 After lunch she visits the acute-care floor, sitting at the bedside of an 87-year-old glaucoma patient.
 ''The hospital can be a busy, lonely place,'' Chaplain Muncie says. ''Who is there to walk this journey with you?'' 
 The patient doesn't hold back. Brittle-thin, blind, she lives in public housing with her grandson, 19. But he's in serious trouble with the law. If she doesn't kick him outin three days, she says, she'll be evicted. The grandmother is heartsick about ejecting her grandson, yet terrified by looming homelessness.
 The chaplain promises to alert a social worker. Immediately.
 The patient pleads: ''Would you call my grandson and ask him to visit? He hasn't been by.''
 The chaplain agrees. She gently mentions the parable of the Prodigal Son, of letting a profligate young man go so that he may one day return, mature and penitent. 
 Hands clasped, the women pray.
 Chaplain Muncie stands to leave. ''Oh, you lifted my spirit!'' the patient calls out. ''Will you visit me again?''

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell in June as Factory Output Rebounded

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Cheaper gasoline helped pull down prices paid to producers in June while national industrial output increased, in fresh signs the economy was growing without imminent danger that prices will overheat. 
 The reassuring news came before scheduled testimony today and tomorrow by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who is expected to face questions about why policy makers at the central bank remain wary about inflation.
 The Labor Department said yesterday that its producer price index, which measures prices paid at the farm gate and the factory door, fell 0.2 percent after a 0.9 percent increase in May.
 In a separate report, the Fed said output by factories, mines and utilities increased by 0.5 percent in June, bouncing back from a 0.1 percent May decline partly on a surge in production of new cars and trucks.
 In addition, the Fed said factories, mines and utilities operated at 81.7 percent of capacity, compared with an upwardly revised 81.4 percent in May -- the highest since last October.
 But the housing sector still faces daunting problems, underlined yesterday by a report from the National Association of Home Builders that showed sentiment at its lowest level since January 1991. The builders group said the market for single-family homes was ''still in a correction process'' after a strong performance from 2003 to 2005.
 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., Thomas M. Hoenig, said that a weak housing sector was a threat to the overall economy, especially if it caused consumers to pull back on spending.
 Producer prices are a gauge of costs at the wholesale level. Core prices, after stripping out volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.3 percent in June after gaining 0.2 percent in May.
 Part of the rise in core producer prices came from higher prices for new cars and trucks. A department official said that excluding cars and trucks, core prices rose 0.1 percent in June.
 The Labor Department report showed price declines for both food and energy in June. Costs for energy goods over all declined by 1.1 percent in June, a sharp reversal from May's 4.1 percent jump, and food costs fell 0.8 percent last month.
 Gasoline prices dropped 3.9 percent, the biggest decline since a 13 percent plunge in January. That trend has since been reversed as crude oil surged to 11-month highs in July and gasoline prices rebounded.
 David Kelly, an economist with Putnam Investments in Boston, said the June producer prices report should ease concern about the possibility that rising food prices might set off an inflationary spiral.
 ''This P.P.I. number gets rid of one potential source of inflation for the economy,'' Mr. Kelly said.
 Today the Labor Department is scheduled to release its June Consumer Price Index, which will show whether the price declines at the wholesale level are being reflected in stores.

HEADLINE: Banking Regulators to Increase Scrutiny of Subprime Lenders

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
Federal and state banking regulators said yesterday that they would step up their scrutiny of lenders that make home loans to people with shaky credit, focusing on companies that operate outside federal banking oversight. 
 The pilot program, announced by the Federal Reserve, two other federal agencies and state banking officials, is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter and affect about 12 lenders. It will be set up to examine companies that account for the majority of subprime loans, a category that has experienced a surge of defaults in recent months.
 Problems in the subprime market first emerged in February, when the lenders HSBC Holdings and the New Century Financial Corporation reported mounting payment defaults.
 Many subprime lenders have since gone bankrupt or have been sold. Foreclosures were up 87 percent last month from a year ago, a real estate information company, RealtyTrac, said last week.
 The announcement of the program came one day before the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was scheduled to give the central bank's midyear economic forecast to Congress. Lawmakers have criticized the Fed for lax regulation of the mortgage market before the problems came to light.
 Last month, Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, threatened to strip the Federal Reserve of its authority to write rules against mortgage abuses if the central bank did not act quickly. And Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a presidential candidate who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said in May that a ''chronology of regulatory neglect'' allowed the problems in the subprime market to go unchecked.
 Only about a quarter of subprime loans in 2005, the most recent year available, were made by federally regulated banks, according to the Fed. The other 75 percent were made by state-licensed lenders and subsidiaries of federally regulated banks that operate with limited federal regulation.
 The agencies said they would coordinate reviews of lenders and mortgage brokers to make sure they comply with consumer protection laws, as well as evaluate the lenders' underwriting standards.
 In a joint statement, the agencies said they would ''initiate appropriate corrective or enforcement action as warranted by the findings of the reviews or investigations.''
 Other participants in the pilot project are the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies, which are represented by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators.
 Regulators in 26 states have pledged to adopt lending standards similar to those adopted last month by federal banking regulators. The standards call on lenders to evaluate strictly a borrower's ability to repay a home loan and to include consumer protections.

HEADLINE: Chrysler, Citing Fuel Standards, Drops Plans for Big Luxury Sedan

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., July 17 

 BODY:
The Chrysler Group, which is expected to have more difficulty than other automakers complying with proposed fuel-economy standards, said Tuesday that it was dropping plans to build a large luxury sedan. 
 Chrysler is the first carmaker to announce a change in production plans related to efforts in Congress to require that vehicles sold in the United States consume less gasoline. The Senate passed a bill last month calling for automakers to raise their average fuel mileage to at least 35 miles a gallon by 2020; a proposal in the House would hold manufacturers to the same standard by 2018.
 A Chrysler spokesman, Ed Saenz, said the environment was no longer favorable for a luxury Imperial model.
 ''We decided in an era of $3 gas and more regulations headed this way that it didn't amount to a good business case -- a profitable business case,'' Mr. Saenz said.
 He said that executives decided three weeks ago to cancel the Imperial and that the impending sale of Chrysler to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management was not a factor.
 Cerberus's chairman, John W. Snow, said during a visit to the Detroit area last week that he supported improved fuel economy but that the Senate bill threatened the auto industry's future.
 Chrysler will also pay higher interest rates on $12 billion of loans it is seeking to finance Cerberus's buyout after it had difficulties finding investors, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. 
 The new rates, 0.5 percentage point higher than Chrysler said it was seeking last month, will cost the company an additional $70 million a year in interest.

HEADLINE: Quarterly Results Are Mixed as U.S. Banks Report

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
American banks posted mixed quarterly results yesterday as higher customer fees offset rising loan losses and pressure from interest rates and mortgage lending.
 Profit rose 9 percent at Wells Fargo but fell 4 percent at U.S. Bancorp. Earnings were up 31 percent at the Regions Financial Corporation and 8 percent at KeyCorp, two big regional banks. 
 Increasing loan losses, the housing downturn and a flat yield curve, with long-term and short-term interest rates about the same, are pushing banks to seek higher revenue in areas like credit cards and deposit service charges.
 Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wachovia, the four largest American banks, report results later this week.
 Net income for Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is the fifth-largest bank, rose to a record $2.28 billion, or 67 cents a share, from $2.09 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $9.89 billion, while expenses rose 11 percent.
 Analysts on average forecast profit of 67 cents a share on revenue of $9.63 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Wells Fargo, a leading provider of home loans, said it was adding market share in mortgages after dozens of rivals ran into trouble from making exotic loans. Mortgage applications rose 6 percent, to $114 billion, while originations fell just 1 percent, to $80 billion. Lending rose 18 percent from the first quarter.
 U.S. Bancorp, the sixth-largest bank, said profit fell to $1.16 billion, or 65 cents a share, from $1.2 billion, or 66 cents a share. Revenue rose 1.5 percent, to $3.51 billion. U.S. Bancorp is based in Minneapolis.
 Analysts on average forecast a profit of 67 cents a share on revenue of $3.48 billion. 
 Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp operate largely in the western two-thirds of the United States.
 Regions, based in Birmingham, Ala., operates mainly in the Southeast. It said quarterly profit rose to $453.3 million, from $345.3 million, but fell to 63 cents a share, from 75 cents a share, as the number of shares increased. 
 KeyCorp, a Midwestern bank based in Cleveland that also has many branches in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest, said net income rose to $334 million, or 84 cents a share, from $308 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Trying Times Ahead: The Prospect of 60 Million Californians

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
Recently, the California Department of Finance projected that there will be some 60 million people living in the state by 2050. At present there are 36 million. The numbers in themselves are frightening enough, but what I find terrifying is the bland assumption that a two-thirds increase in population is inevitable and that the main problem will be creating the infrastructure necessary to house, feed, educate, transport and govern all those people. To me, the main problem is how to keep them from showing up in the first place. 
 Somehow the numbers in themselves don't really suggest the sobering weight of this projection. To say that for every three Californians now there will be five in 2050 doesn't capture the scale of change. If you said that for every three houses now there will be five in 2050, or for every three cars, ditto, you might be getting a little closer to the visceral feel of the thing. But when it comes to houses and cars, California is a land of loaves and fishes, always multiplying in the most unexpected ways. To live in the state is to live with unrelenting change, whether you like it or not, and it has been that way for decades. 
 But this population increase will mean more than filling up San Bernardino, Riverside and Kern Counties and paving the entire midsection of the state and creating impromptu day-schools and conference centers in stopped traffic. We tend to talk about humans as if they were interchangeable -- as if the Californian of 1957 were somehow equivalent to the Californian of 2007. But today's Californian consumes far more, if you consider consumption in its broadest sense. Draw pictures of those two Californians to the scale of their consumption, and the present-day resident would dwarf his ancestor. 
 There's a chance that a mid-21st-century Californian will look back in horror at the enormous consumption footprint of someone living in the state right now. That sense of horror would be good news -- a sign that the coming generations had taken to heart that the way we live now, even in its current dimensions, is unsustainable. The trouble, of course, is that a population projection like this one more or less takes it for granted that not much will have changed by 2050. Otherwise, there wouldn't be 60 million people in the state. 
 The point of thinking about the future is to help us think about the present. This population forecast is a vivid reminder of the assumptions that make meaningful change so hard. We can't help believing in growth. We can't help believing that the way to create change is simply to buy different stuff, so growth doesn't stop. And we refuse to think seriously about the number of human beings on this planet, a kind of growth that somehow seems ''natural'' to us. It makes no difference how little each of those 60 million Californians will consume in 2050. The number cannot be negative. It's nearly impossible to imagine how they could meet their water needs alone. 
 And then there is the impact of all those people on the other species with which they might have shared the Golden State. In 2007, we remain blindly impervious to the life-claims of almost all other forms of life -- to the moral stipulation that their right to life is equivalent to ours. How it will be then I do not know, but if there are indeed 60 million people living in California in 2050, there will be nothing meaningful to be said on the matter, except as a subject of nostalgia. 
 We like to take it for granted that we're moving ahead in environmental consciousness. We like to hope that the curve of our environmental awareness will catch up to the curve of our economic growth and things will somehow come into balance. But faith in our progressive enlightenment seems a little misplaced to me, especially when I remember a speech that James Madison gave to his local agricultural society nearly 190 years ago. 
 Madison said, simply, that we have no reason to suppose that all of Earth's resources, which support so much living diversity, can rightfully be commandeered to support mankind alone. It seems incredible to me, in 2007, that a former president could articulate such an environmentally sound principle of conscience. But it's a principle that should move to the very center of our thinking. It should cause us to re-examine not just how we shop and what we drive and who we elect but also how our species reproduces. It should cause us to re-imagine that once and future California, which lies only 43 years away, and make sure that it isn't barren of all but us humans.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls Short of 14,000 at Close

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed above 14,000 for the first time today before giving up much of its gains late in the trading session.
 With relatively little news to trade on, investors pushed the stock market up early. The Dow flirted with 14,000, topping it shortly after 11 a.m., but it did not stay at that level for any significant period of time until the afternoon. It closed up 20.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,971.55. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a seesaw day and closed about where it started, at 1,549.37 points. The Nasdaq composite index was up 14.96 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,712.29.
 Stocks have been on a tear since early March and have powered past numerous economic and financial concerns. The Dow has risen 16 percent since March 5, when it hit its lowest point this year. The S. & P. 500 is up more than 13 percent since then.
 Stocks have been bolstered by a strong flow of acquisitions of public companies by private equity firms, stronger corporate earnings forecasts and signs that appear to suggest inflation is moderating. These positive factors have so far managed to outweigh concerns many investors have about the slumping housing and mortgage markets, the rise in oil prices and higher interest rates.
 ''We are able to shake off rising energy prices in part because of the continued merger, acquisition and buy-back activity,'' said Leo P. Grohowski, the chief investment officer at U.S. Trust, an investment firm that is a division of Bank of America.
 Mergers again drove the markets today. Basell, a chemical and plastics maker based in the Netherlands, said it would pay $12.7 billion to buy Lyondell Chemical. And Pogo Producing, an energy company, agreed to a $3.6 billion acquisition by the Plains Exploration and Production Company.
 The Dow was driven higher by American Express. It was upgraded by an analyst at Goldman Sachs, who said that investors have been undervaluing the company's credit card portfolio. American Express closed up $2.86, to $64.74 
 Du Pont, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average, was also up noticeably, probably as a result of the acquisition of Lyondell, a competitor. Its shares rose $1.30, to $53.30.
 That the Dow fell back late in the afternoon is not surprising, and it may have something to do with the psychological significance of the 14,000 mark. Though such thresholds mean little financially, they do serve as points of reflection for investors.
 And investors certainly have plenty to ponder, given the recent spike in Treasury yields and the continued problems in the mortgage market. Oil prices, at $74.07 a barrel, are closing in on $75, a level not reached since last summer.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed above 14,000 yesterday for the first time before giving up much of its gains late in the trading session.

HEADLINE: Some Rain On the Parade On Wall St.

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So have you heard the one about the stock market's new record high?
 Last Thursday, stocks had one of their best days in years, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor 500-stock index both jumping about 2 percent. ''A record day on Wall Street,'' Brian Williams intoned that night at the top of the ''NBC Nightly News'' broadcast. ''Stocks surging up to new highs.'' 
 The next morning, newspapers around the world, including this one, made prominent mention of the record. The Wall Street Journal led its Friday paper with this headline: ''Dow Again Soars to Record High Despite Unease.'' Yesterday, the Dow cracked 14,000 for the first time, before closing at 13,971. 
 Technically, all the talk about records is accurate. But it's also fundamentally wrong. In fact, the attention that's being showered on ''Dow 14,000'' goes a long way toward explaining why our economy has become so susceptible to speculative bubbles.
 The idea that stock prices tend to rise over time really should not be surprising. The price of almost everything rises over time, thanks to inflation. Each year, the federal government prints more money, which is the main reason that the price of groceries, cars, clothes and, yes, stocks keeps on going up. Incomes do, too.
 These increases don't mean, however, that everything is always getting more expensive and everyone is always getting richer (which would be a contradiction). And the stock market's record high does not mean that stocks have been a wonderful investment lately. They haven't been. 
 The S.& P. 500, which is a much better measure than the Dow, closed yesterday at 1,549, just 1.4 percent higher than the peak it reached in March 2000. Think about what that means. While the price of nearly everything has risen over the least seven years -- while the price of bread has increased almost one-third, for instance -- stocks have barely budged. They have only marginally outperformed cash sitting in a bureau drawer. So if we are going to talk about a stock market record, we should be doing the same for a whole lot of other things: Loaves of Bread Surge to New Highs
 I realize that this point can sound like statistical nitpicking, but it actually relates to something quite important. When you overlook inflation, you can start to think that every investment is a can't-miss investment, because its value always seems to be going up. This mistake, combined with the enormous attention that society now devotes to the value of its investments, helps create the conditions for a bubble. 
 A few years ago, I was interviewing a real estate agent in the Midwest, and she mentioned that her daughter had recently sold her house for 30 percent more than she had bought it for a decade earlier. ''Where else can you get a return like that?'' the agent asked. One answer, which I didn't give, is a boring old savings account. 
 The only meaningful way to measure an investment is to strip away the distortions caused by inflation. You're then able to focus on its real value -- what it can buy in the marketplace -- rather than just a number on a piece of paper. (A good rule of thumb is that something appearing to have doubled in price or value since the early 1980s costs the same now, in real terms, as it did then.) When you make these adjustments, it becomes obvious that stocks and real estate are by no means can't-miss investments.
 The average house in the New York region sold for roughly the same nominal price in 1997 as it had in 1988, which in inflation-adjusted terms means its value dropped 31 percent. House prices in New York didn't exceed their 1988 real value until 2002. Then, of course, they soared like never before.
 The stock market has suffered through even longer stretches of mediocrity. The S.& P. 500 first went over 100 in 1968. In today's dollars, that means it was up near 600. It then entered a long period in which it failed to keep pace with inflation -- leading to BusinessWeek's famous 1979 cover article, ''The Death of Equities'' -- and didn't exceed its real 1968 high until 1992. Over the next eight years, it tripled, even after taking inflation into account.
 Today, the S.& P. remains 17 percent below its inflation-adjusted 2000 peak. A share in a mutual fund tied to the S.& P. 500, in other words, can't buy nearly as much today as it could in early 2000. Now, in a way, this might be considered a good sign. If the market isn't really at a record high, it may still have a lot of running room. But I wouldn't be too confident about that. Relative to corporate earnings, stocks remain more expensive than they have been at any time except the 1920s and the 1990s.
 That's the thing about bubbles: they usually take a long time to overcome. The normal pattern after a huge boom -- like the sort we recently had in stocks and then real estate -- is years if not decades in which an investment doesn't keep up with savings accounts. And what kind of a record is that? 
 If you read Sunday's business section, you probably noticed that Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, blogger and Republican policy adviser, wrote the Economic View column. His debut as a regular contributor is the start of some changes in our economics coverage.
 The View column will now be written by a rotating panel of outside economists. Besides Mr. Mankiw, it will include Alan Blinder, Judith Chevalier, Robert Shiller and Lester Thurow, as well as three of the economists who have been writing the Economic Scene column on Thursdays: Austan Goolsbee, Tyler Cowen and Robert Frank. (The fourth member of the Scene rotation, Hal R. Varian, is leaving to concentrate on his new role as Google's chief economist.) 
 They are a stellar group, and they will use the column to examine everything from big policy questions to the economics of everyday life. By moving the economists to Sunday, when our section isn't filled with news, we think we can give their writing more attention.
 My column will now be called Economic Scene, keeping alive a name that's been appearing in these pages almost continuously since 1972.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Borrowing Moves Up

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
When Metropolitan Real Estate Investors of Los Angeles and its Israeli financial partners agreed in April to buy 885 Third Avenue, a Midtown Manhattan office tower that is known as the Lipstick Building because of its elliptical shape, there seemed to be little doubt about how the deal would be financed. 
 Wachovia, one of the most active lenders in commercial real estate, had tentatively agreed to finance 90 percent of the deal, with generous terms that were typical for loans in Manhattan and other cities where the prices being paid for office buildings have skyrocketed in recent years. 
 But Metropolitan's timing was unfortunate. Just after it entered into contract for the 34-story Lipstick Building, its first foray into New York, the lending market tightened. Wachovia, whose loan offer was nonbinding, wanted new terms with less leverage and a higher interest rate. 
 Suddenly, the buyers found themselves scrambling to find new sources of financing and new investment partners so that they could complete the transaction. Otherwise, they would have been obligated to pay a penalty of as much as $45 million to the sellers: Tishman Speyer, the New York real estate company, and Prudential Real Estate Investors. 
 Last week, Metropolitan and its partners, who put up $60 million in equity, were able to close the deal with a new $210 million loan from Royal Bank of Canada and a $60 million investment from Goldman Sachs, said Howard L. Michaels, the chief executive of Carlton Group, Metropolitan's investment banker. 
 S. L. Green, a New York real estate investment trust, bought the land beneath the building and is leasing it to Metropolitan for 70 years. (Several participants in the recent sale said the deal was valued at $607 million, with an additional $40 million or so to cover transaction costs and reserve funds.)
 As debt becomes more expensive and bank loans no longer cover 90 percent of the value, investors are going to wind up putting more equity into the deal, real estate specialists say. ''I can still lend as much money as I could before, but it's going to be much more expensive,'' said one prominent real estate lender, who asked not to be identified. ''Most people are going to want to get more equity.''
 Still, the successful Lipstick Building transaction reflects the strength of the office market in New York, said the sellers' broker, William Shanahan, a vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis. ''The equity markets have stepped up to fill the gap left by the lenders, and they have stepped up relatively quickly,'' he said. ''That's a very healthy sign for the market.''
 By midyear, the overall vacancy rate (including space available for sublet) for the Manhattan office market stood at 5.3 percent, a drop of 2.5 percentage points from the corresponding period last year, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Rents were continuing to climb at a rapid clip, with annual asking rents for prime Midtown buildings at nearly $70 a square foot, the company said. But the pace of leasing has slowed in Midtown, perhaps because of the higher rents or the shortage of large blocks of space.
 Several factors have combined in recent months to raise the cost of borrowing for buyers of commercial real estate, including rising interest rates, foreclosures in the subprime residential mortgage market and a chorus of complaints from bond rating agencies that underwriting standards had become too lax. Like residential loans, commercial mortgages are pooled and packaged into bonds that are sliced up into portions carrying varying degrees of risk. 
 On April 10, Moody's Investors Service caused a stir by announcing that it would adjust its method of rating commercial mortgage-backed securities to better reflect the risk. Moody's said many lenders were underwriting loans based on optimistic projections of future rent growth, even when the leases were relatively new.
 At the Lipstick Building, which is between 53rd and 54th Streets, the expected rate of return in the first year is only 3.6 percent, Mr. Michaels said. But the buyers assume that the cash flow will greatly increase, he said, as annual rents rise to $100 or more a square foot, the level that a number of trophy office buildings in Manhattan have achieved. 
 More than half of the Lipstick Building is leased to Latham & Watkins, a law firm that has been in the red granite and stainless steel tower, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, since its completion in 1986. In 2004, Latham & Watkins signed a new 15-year lease with an annual rent of about $60 a square foot, according to Robert Franco, a vice president at Metropolitan Real Estate Investors. 
 But Mr. Franco said space occupied by many of the building's smaller tenants would become available in the next few years. ''There's assured rent growth,'' he said. ''It's not speculative.''
 Under the new lending regime, however, underwriting is no longer based on future rent increases, and the volume of interest-only loans has declined, said Lee Cotton, the vice chairman of Centerline Capital Group, a New York company that buys high-yield commercial mortgage-backed securities, the riskiest slice. 
 ''What we have seen in the last 60 or 90 days is what we had hoped we would see,'' he said. ''We're back to a more normal credit process.'' But he said lenders still fell short by failing to require adequate cash reserves to cover potential problems.
 But will these changes be long lasting? Jim Duca, a group managing director at Moody's, said the April announcement had been costly for his agency. Sponsors of commercial mortgage-backed securities usually hire two of the three leading ratings agencies to rate the bonds, but Moody's was bypassed on 8 of the 12 most recent deals, he said. 
 ''If we're only going to rate 4 out of 12 deals, the positive effect we're going to have in the market is going to be diluted, and that's not in anyone's best interest,'' Mr. Duca said.
 But Zanda Lynn, a managing director at one of Moody's competitors, Fitch Ratings, said that while her agency had not adjusted its methodology for rating bonds, it, too, lost business after warning in April that defaults on loans issued this year were likely to increase 15 percent over their 10-year term. 
 ''We were shut out of a lot of deals, and that was troubling to us,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Where to Discuss the Nation's Ills

 BODY:
The commission that will pick the venues for next year's final presidential debates has begun visiting the 19 universities and cities eagerly vying for the headline recognition that the candidates' showdowns ignite. If there's any sense of justice, relevance, even poetic stagemanship at work, New Orleans should emerge hands down as the site for the debate that will be dedicated to the nation's domestic problems. 
 It's not too early to state this plainly as various locales and political forces jockey for favor. Three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate are planned by the commission, which is balanced with major party appointees now vetting the applicants for logistics, security and the intangibles of political history.
 By any score, no forum comes close to New Orleans -- a place still struggling two years after Hurricane Katrina to recover its traction on the very issues at the heart of the domestic agenda: housing, health, education, economic opportunity and disaster response. This is obvious to anyone who read Shaila Dewan's recent report in The Times on the 30,000 New Orleans families still displaced across the country, and the 13,000 other families marooned in trailer parks almost two years after the hurricane's devastation.
 Predictably, there's speculation that the last place Republicans would want to be seen debating in the fall of 2008 is New Orleans, the site of President Bush's domestic debacle in muffing recovery from Katrina. But an embattled Republican nominee could show some counterintuitive grit by welcoming the venue as the ideal place to demonstrate forthrightness and concern in emphasizing a new post-Bush agenda. New Orleans's anguish would only be compounded if partisanship denied the city a chance to bear witness to America's troubles.
 New Orleans is already media-tested for the debate throngs, with tourist know-how and a convention center where the nation saw Katrina survivors gather for shelter. Its sponsorship is by four of the city's universities -- Dillard, Loyola, Tulane and Xavier -- and a nonpartisan civic group, Women of the Storm, who succinctly make the ultimate debater's point: ''see it for yourself.''

HEADLINE: Package of Deals Proposed To Save Global Trade Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization made a last-ditch effort on Tuesday to salvage stalled global trade talks by asking the United States and Europe to lower their barriers to farm imports in return for greater export access to India, Brazil and other developing countries.
 A long proposal laying out possible compromises by 150 countries involved in the talks was issued at the World Trade Organization's headquarters in Geneva. Officials said the draft was aimed at breaking a deadlock on issues that have eluded compromise since last summer. 
 Pascal Lamy, director general of the trade group, said the goal was to goad negotiators by laying out ambitious compromises they had been unwilling to make, in part because they did not see compromises by others. He said it would not be clear until September whether the new proposals would accomplish that goal.
 ''Finding such compromise is always difficult, and no delegation will get all it wants,'' Mr. Lamy said. ''These are negotiating instruments, which will be revised and adjusted as governments continue to narrow their differences.''
 The proposal was careful not to assign blame, but it also said time was running out on the possibility of a global trade deal. It was generally acknowledged to be a final attempt to save the talks, with the expectation that they would be declared a failure if it did not succeed.
 The Bush administration reacted cautiously to the new document, which calls on the United States to lower its farm subsidies, which affect trade by making American goods more competitive, to a range of $13 billion to $16.5 billion a year. The last American offer was to lower them to $17 billion a year. In 2005, the United States paid $19.7 billion in farm subsidies. That figure fell in 2006 to $12 billion as food prices rose. But Americans say they have been much higher historically.
 The W.T.O. proposal would also cut the highest United States tariff on manufactured imports to less than 8 percent, from 58 percent. For Europe, the highest tariff would fall below 7 percent, from 26 percent. Tariffs in India on imported manufactured goods would decline to about 15 percent, from an average of 19 percent, while Brazil's would go to 9 percent, from an average of 11 percent.
 Gretchen Hamel, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, said the proposals were, ''as expected, wide-ranging and complex,'' and represented ''a single step in a longer term process'' aimed at reviving the talks.
 An American trade official, who asked not to be identified because of the fragile nature of the negotiations, said that the text put forward represented ''a reasonably good level of ambition'' on all sides but that much work was needed to flesh out the proposals.
 The proposal also calls on Europe and Japan to lower their agricultural barriers and on India, Brazil and other ''advanced'' developing countries -- those already considered exporting powerhouses -- to lower both industrial and farm tariffs.
 Like the United States officials, European and other trade negotiators reacted cautiously to the W.T.O.'s proposals, which were drafted by the organization's top two mediators, Crawford Falconer of New Zealand, the chairman of the agriculture negotiations, and Don Stephenson of Canada, chairman of the industrial product negotiations.
 The global trade talks were started in 2001 in Doha, Qatar, to help the world's poorest countries gain access for their exports to the rich countries, principally the United States and those in Europe.
 President Bush has labeled the talks one of his most important international economic priorities, but they have struggled for years. Last summer, they were suspended when Europe and the United States refused to lower their farm barriers beyond what was being demanded in the developing world.
 Various efforts have been made since then to restart the talks, most recently last month in Potsdam, Germany, with a gathering of four main players in the trade talks: the United States, Europe, Brazil and India. 
 But those talks ended in discord, with Ms. Schwab accusing India and Brazil of backpedaling on what they had been willing to offer in lower barriers to farm and industrial products from the West.
 Many trade officials close to the talks say India and Brazil are fearful of lowering their trade barriers on industrial goods because of a concern that China would move in and wipe out their new industries, much the way Chinese competition has hurt manufacturing in the West.
 Ms. Schwab used particularly tough language toward India and Brazil last month, saying their trade barriers hurt the world's poorest 60 or 70 countries, many in Africa, more than they hurt the rich ones.
 India and Brazil countered angrily that the United States was keeping its own subsidies of farm products high. Some officials close to the talks said India and Brazil had been prepared to lower their tariff barriers but decided against it because of what they viewed as intransigence in Europe and the United States.
 ''Despite all the setbacks, failures and deadlocks that we have experienced over the past year, the underlying fact remains that under the surface, very considerable progress has been made on all areas of this negotiation since the last draft,'' Mr. Falconer said.
 He added that ''all members know that any agreement requires compromise,'' and that he hoped such a compromise ''can be galvanized by having an independent third party express a view on the scope for compromise that no member can quite bring themselves to articulate.'' He said the time has come ''for cutting to the chase'' and that ''no other option is available.''

HEADLINE: Silent Hands Behind the iPhone

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan 

 BODY:
Etched into the back of every iPhone are the words ''Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.'' Apple might as well have added ''Made in Taiwan.''
 With little fanfare, Taiwan companies are playing a big role not only in the production of Apple's latest device but in a wide array of other communications equipment, including the broadband modems in homes across the United States and the next generation of high-speed wireless gear. 
 Apple does not discuss which vendors it uses, but news reports in Taiwan said that Hon Hai and Quanta received orders to produce millions of iPhone handsets, reports that those companies declined to confirm. Other manufacturers there were almost certainly involved because they provide components used in advanced phones, industry analysts said.
 Taiwan companies also have a hand in making iPods and iMacs, they said, as well as game machines for Sony and Microsoft. 
 Taiwan's rise as a communications workhorse is part of a decade-long transformation under way on this Chinese Nationalist-controlled island south of the mainland. Already the world's biggest producers of computer components, Taiwan companies like Compal Electronics, in addition to Hon Hai and Quanta, have used their expertise to branch out into new markets that use many of the same products. 
 By harnessing the ability to cut costs, churn out products quickly and work flexibly with customers, the Taiwan companies have become top makers of cellphones, smartphones, broadband modems, wireless routers, global positioning devices, networking equipment and other gear. They, like companies elsewhere, have also made deep inroads into China, where many of their factories are.
 ''It's not a surprise that the iPhone would be made here because the food chains for Apple's notebooks and iPods are already in Taiwan,'' said Dominic Grant, a telecommunications analyst at Macquarie in Taipei. ''It's a natural progression.''
 Taiwan's evolution from computer-making giant to telecommunications Goliath has gone largely unnoticed in the United States because companies here make most of their money as made-to-order manufacturers, not sellers of their own brand products. But Taiwan's industrial makeover has helped its companies remain competitive in a world increasingly dominated by low-cost Chinese assemblers and by Japanese and South Korean companies with strong footholds in high-end components like flash memory chips.
 The strategy of repackaging -- finding new uses for computer components -- has paid dividends. Companies on the island have captured 87 percent of the global market for wireless modems, 84 percent of the D.S.L. modem market and 70 percent of the market for personal digital assistants.
 In the competitive cellphone business, Taiwan companies made 12.4 percent of the world's handsets last year, up from 9.8 percent in 2005, according to the Institute for Information Industry, a government-affiliated research center. That share is expected to grow as brand-name companies like Sony Ericsson outsource more of their production to companies here.
 In all, Taiwan companies produced $31.5 billion in communications equipment and services last year, more than 50 percent above the total the year before, according to the institute, which expects production to reach a value of $46 billion by 2010. Less than a quarter of that was manufactured on Taiwan, with the bulk made on the Chinese mainland. 
 ''It's been a fairly natural progression because handsets are really a mini-version of the PC, and Taiwanese are adept at adjusting,'' said Gary Chia, president of the Yuanta Research Center.
 The transformation did not happen by accident. As in many Asian areas, the government played an active role in steering businesses into new markets by showering them with tax incentives, cheap property to build factories and research money.
 Companies on Taiwan have also been able to shift gears smoothly because the concentration of component producers on the island has made it easier to gather the technology and engineers to design and assemble new products.
 And Taiwan companies, like their rivals in Japan, South Korea and elsewhere in Asia, have increasingly shifted production to their factories in China to save money. With their close cultural, financial and linguistic ties to mainland China, Taiwan's companies have an edge over those from elsewhere.
 These advantages helped scores of companies tackle new markets. Take D-Link, one of the world's largest manufacturers of broadband modems. About two decades ago, it started out by making network interface cards that linked computers. As Internet access for home use expanded, the company started making dial-up modems.
 As phone companies in the United States and elsewhere started leasing modems to their customers, D-Link was flexible and designed products to each carrier's specifications while remaining cheap enough to nudge out rivals.
 ''Telecommunications companies are difficult to deal with because each one has its own standards, and there is a lot of customization,'' said J. C. Liao, D-Link's president. ''But it turned out to be an advantage because Taiwanese are more flexible compared to companies in the U.S. or Japan. We're quick to lower costs and not stick to our own rules.''
 D-Link has evolved with the technology, expanding into wireless modems and pushing into emerging markets like India and Russia, as well as selling under its own brand name at big retailers like Best Buy and Office Depot to become the No. 2 competitor, after Linksys. About 15 percent of the company's revenue now comes from brand products.
 Mitac International, a leading seller of global positioning devices, took a similar route. Through the 1980s and early '90s, it built personal computers for the likes of Compaq. But as profit margins slipped and mergers reshaped the industry, the company started making personal digital assistants. Then Hewlett-Packard bought Compaq, leaving Mitac short a big customer.
 So when the United States government allowed civilians to use G.P.S. technology, the company integrated it into its personal digital assistants after a couple of years of development. Mitac joined another leader in the industry, Garmin, which is based in Kansas but makes almost all its G.P.S. devices in Taiwan. 
 ''We saw these big waves come one by one in the mid-1990s, so we tried to figure out how to survive in this rapidly changing business,'' said Billy Ho, the president of Mitac International, which sells G.P.S. devices under the Mio brand. ''We realized there was no Microsoft in the digital map business.''
 Mitac still earns about 70 percent of its sales by making desktop computers, servers and other technology for other companies, though Mr. Ho hopes that the share will fall to 50 percent by next year.
 Since so many of the latest devices are made here, it is perhaps unsurprising that some Taiwan companies are beating brand-name companies to the punch. High Tech Computer, for instance, introduced a touch-based handset just weeks before the iPhone was released. With a less recognizable name, High Tech has more modest ambitions. But it is still pleased that Apple has joined the market.
 ''We're happy they share the same vision as we do,'' said Fred Liu, the chief operating officer. ''We think these phones will change people's minds and their behavior.''
 While D-Link, High Tech and Mitac have developed brand-name products to reduce their reliance on their made-to-order business, there are plenty of other companies that have had trouble branching out on their own.
 For instance, in 2005 BenQ, which primarily made cellphones for other companies, bought the handset division of Siemens in hopes of taking on the likes of Sony Ericsson and LG. Yet BenQ, a spinoff of the Taiwan computer giant Acer, alienated one of its biggest customers, Motorola, which was wary of having a new competitor manufacturing its products. BenQ also underestimated the depth of Siemens's problems and how much it would cost to break into an already crowded and competitive cellphone market.
 After losses mounted, BenQ liquidated the venture and will focus its energy on making handsets for other companies, as well as on its existing businesses producing flat-panel monitors, televisions and digital cameras.
 ''People thought with Acer's success, BenQ could make it, too, since its chairman came from Acer,'' said Kirk Yang, managing director at Citigroup in Hong Kong. ''But the acquisition was a black hole. BenQ didn't have a home base and had no experience running a branded handset business.''
 Mr. Yang and other analysts said that Taiwan companies were unlikely to abandon their made-to-order business entirely. Instead, they will focus more on doing more design work on behalf of customers who are trying to outsource more and more of their production.
 ''The iPhone is a great example of where Taiwan is still strong: reliable sourcing, leading technology and complex integration,'' said Allen J. Delattre, chief of the electronics and high-technology practice at the consulting firm Accenture. ''Does the average person who buys an iPhone know it's from Taiwan? Maybe. Do they care? Probably not. But if you look at the companies in Taiwan, they are behind the scenes, and that's a good place to be because that's where the value is.''
 The key for Taiwan companies, Mr. Delattre and other analysts said, is to invest in next-generation products early. For example, companies here are fast becoming important players in the development of WiMax wireless and fiber optic broadband equipment.
 They are again getting a healthy push from the government, which is spending more than $200 million over five years to help create the world's largest high-speed WiMax network. By next year, with 2,000 base stations spread across the island, companies will be able to start testing new applications, like the sending of video from ambulances on their way to hospitals.
 ''We are trying to make the infrastructure more complete,'' said Tsung-Tsong Wu, deputy minister of the National Science Council, which has a $1 billion annual budget. ''If the highways are built, companies can go as fast as they like.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the growth of communications equipment manufacturing in Taiwan misidentified the controlling political party there. The Democratic Progressive Party captured the presidency in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004; Taiwan is no longer controlled by the Chinese Nationalist Party. (A coalition led by the Chinese Nationalist Party still has a majority in the Taiwanese legislature.) Also because of an editing error, the article misidentified Taiwan's geographical location. It is an island east of China, not south.

HEADLINE: Canada's Black Heart

BYLINE: By WILL FERGUSON. 
Will Ferguson is the author of ''Canadian History for Dummies'' and a forthcoming novel, ''Spanish Fly.''

DATELINE: Calgary, Alberta 

 BODY:
 FORGET the cowboy. The true all-American hero is the confidence man: breezy, self-invented, ambitious, protean. So too with Canada. Ignore the scarlet-jacketed Mountie who is strong of jaw and pure of heart. Up here, the voyageur -- a jaunty, indomitable, unpretentious, rough-hewn New World figure -- is closer to the mythical Canadian heart. 
 But just as the Puritan stands in thin-lipped contrast to the American confidence man, so does the Upper Canadian Anglophile oppose the woodsman. (Never mind that the back-breaking reality for the French-Canadian fur trappers was far removed from this romanticized image. We are dealing with iconography here.) 
 Which brings us to Conrad Black, Canada's fallen press baron. Although from Quebec, and therefore technically a Lower Canadian, Mr. Black has a character that is Anglo and Upper all the way through. Though newly convicted on three counts of fraud and one of obstruction, Mr. Black could just as easily be considered as guilty of one crime: hubris. He thought he could bully American prosecutors in the same way he bullied his shareholders.
 Standing up to Americans is normally the sort of thing that would endear a Canadian to his countrymen. But not in this case. Instead, there is a quiet feeling of glee among Canadians over Mr. Black's comeuppance. Not because Mr. Black is rich and powerful or in need of ego deflation. And not because he was revealed to be a swindler on a grand scale. The schadenfreude up here is because Conrad Black -- for reasons that were purely Upper Anglo -- publicly renounced his Canadian citizenship. 
 Was Mr. Black's repudiation of Canada an act of protest against government policies abroad or at home? The seal hunt, say, or the export of cold fronts, prescription medicines and Celine Dion? No, Conrad Black renounced his citizenship in 2001 so that he could dress up as a British lord and play out the ultimate Upper Canadian dream. 
 Mr. Black was forced to choose between his Canadian-ness and his love for the aristocracy because his entry into the British House of Lords was blocked, you see. Blocked by a French-Canadian voyageur, as it were. 
 Former Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a tough little scrapper from the boonies, refused to allow Mr. Black's ascent into the higher echelons of snootiness. Canadian citizens, Mr. Chretien said pointedly, do not accept foreign titles. 
 Mr. Chretien and Mr. Black are opposites in any category you care to mention: class, language, culture, diction. Conrad Black is from a wealthy Anglo Montreal family. Mr. Chretien is from blue-collar Quebec. And their feud played out along Canada's classic fault line, a conflict between Upper Canadian pretensions and French-Canadian disdain for those very same pretensions.
 It ended with Mr. Black stomping off in a huff, rejecting his Canadian citizenship to don the musty robes and puffed up title of Lord Such-and-Such. 
 Lord Black wasn't burned in effigy for his apostasy, but he did greatly irk a lot of his former fellow citizens. And there is nothing so frighteningly passive-aggressive as a well-irked Canadian. 
 More than merely irksome, on a deeper level Conrad Black represents that most Anglo-Canadian of conceits: the blustering royalist, the imperially infatuated capitalist. 
 Remember the Tories that you Americans hounded out of your country after the War of Independence? In Canada they are known as ''Loyalists.'' They are considered heroes, men of principle who sacrificed everything except their honor in the face of American mob rule.
 The Tories who came north to Canada paid a heavy -- and, yes, a heroic -- price for their loyalties. They also established a precedent, one that lingers even now. In Lord Black, we see the self-inflicted colonialism, the infatuation with all things British, that has both marked and marred the Canadian character over the years.
 From British lord to convicted felon, Mr. Black's swan dive has been breathtaking. Almost heroic. Even better, he is now asking for his citizenship back, so he can serve his sentence in a Canadian jail. Good luck with that.
 In Canada, any disagreement with the United States is typically cast in David and Goliath terms, with the Canadians as beleaguered underdogs and the Americans as rapacious swindlers (see: soft wood lumber, treaties regarding). Remember Ben Johnson, the 1988 Olympics sprinter pumped up on steroids? In Canada, he was the underdog. At least, until he got caught. And Carl Lewis was, well, the American, which by definition made him the villain of the piece. 
 The War of 1812? Same thing. We were the underdogs. You were the marauders. (I'm told that in American history books you won the War of 1812. Bizarre.)
 This whole ''Canada as plucky underdog'' narrative hasn't been applied in the case of Lord Black versus the United States, though. Instead, The Beaver, Canada's gloriously named history magazine, is running a contest to name ''the worst Canadian ever,'' and sure enough, Mr. Black, having forsaken his own country and been convicted of swindling his shareholders, is one of the top nominees. 
 Lord Black may find himself bequeathed a new title when the results are announced at the end of July, if only because he reflects so sharply a side of ourselves we so often try to deny: the Anglophilia, the once-defiant but now dated Loyalist mind-set, the yearning for an Old Country that exists only in the imagination.
 On the day the verdict was announced an American journalist called me, asking if Conrad Black -- aggressive, unapologetic, imperially ambitious -- was Canada's future. 
 I thought about the ermine robes, the bluster, the House of Lords pretensions. ''No,'' I said. ''Not the future. The past.''

HEADLINE: Under-20 Team Is Growing Up On Road to 2010

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
In soccer, you win some and you tie some, and when you lose, it does not always mean the better team won. Jozy Altidore and the United States found that out when they were eliminated from the FIFA Under-20 World Cup by Austria last Saturday in Toronto.
 ''I wouldn't be a true footballer if I didn't say I wasn't disappointed,'' Altidore said yesterday in a telephone interview as he prepared for training with his club team, the Red Bulls. ''I thought we could have gone further, but perhaps we didn't play our best when we needed to, and there are no second chances.''
 The American team, which included two players -- Michael Bradley and Freddy Adu -- who have already played for the senior national team, found itself in an unlikely position after the first round: the favorite. The United States finished at the top of its first-round group after a 6-1 thumping of Poland and a victory against Brazil. Altidore, teaming with Adu and Danny Szetela, led the American attack with four goals in the tournament.
 A tactically savvy and physically brutal team from Uruguay took the United States to overtime before losing in the Round of 16. In the quarterfinals, Austria weathered an early American surge before winning in overtime. 
 ''I think we opened a lot of eyes by showing that we can play the game, and I think we made people a little bit uncomfortable by showing that maybe this country has a future in soccer,'' said Altidore, 17. ''We might not have much to show for it, but I think we gave the other nations a wake-up call that we are no longer a pushover.''
 He is now back with the Red Bulls and is likely to be in the starting lineup Sunday against visiting D.C. United in place of the suspended striker Juan Pablo Angel.
 While the American under-20 team was composed primarily of professional players, there is little assurance that more than a handful will graduate to the senior national team. Certainly Altidore, a strong and dangerous striker, has a future with a team that is desperate for consistent goal scorers. Adu and Bradley seem to have the inside track for spots on the roster as qualifying matches for the next World Cup approach. Midfielder Robbie Rogers, goalkeeper Chris Seitz and Szetela, a midfielder, will also challenge.
 In general, however, most of the national team that may end up in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup will be a delicate mix of young and old, experience and exuberance.
 ''The guys who were on this team, we're early in our careers and have a lot of learning to do,'' Altidore said. ''What I learned at the tournament is that this is a really funny game and the best team doesn't always win. I didn't understand why we didn't win that game against Austria. We came out flying in the first half and dominated. It was the little things.''
 ''We had a chance to really make a statement by going to the semis, but it just didn't go our way,'' he added. ''But what I will take away is the atmosphere. It was quite a wonderful thing to score a goal and have thousands of fans chanting for you. I will never forget that experience.''
 An American Adventure
 David Beckham has his own television show even before he has kicked a ball in a Major League Soccer game.
 ''David Beckham's Soccer USA,'' a 13-part series of 30-minute episodes, is scheduled to begin next Wednesday on the Fox Soccer Channel. It is the latest offering from 19 Entertainment (the creators of ''American Idol''), the lead producers in association with M.L.S. and Soccer United Marketing.
 In addition to being telecast in the United States, the show, which will be based at a different M.L.S. game each week, will be broadcast around the world, making it the first original programming to showcase M.L.S., its games and players outside the United States.
 The host for ''Soccer USA'' will be Natalie Pinkham of England as cameras follow Beckham on his American odyssey with exclusive footage and interviews. Each show will also include a weekly roundup of M.L.S. games, news and highlights.
 Spanish Lament
 Ramon Calderon, the president of Real Madrid, is unhappy his club let David Beckham leave for the United States.
 ''I'm sorry he's not with us,'' Calderon said yesterday during an interview at the Midtown Manhattan offices of SCP Worldwide, the company run by Dave Checketts. SCP, which also operates Real Salt Lake and the St. Louis Blues, and Real Madrid, the Spanish champion, have formed a partnership to promote Real in the United States.
 ''Unfortunately, at the time he signed for the Galaxy, our coach did not put him in the lineup and he decided to leave,'' Calderon said. ''His contract was up. Our fans loved him very much. He is a fantastic individual. It's a pity.''
 The man who paid the price was Real's Italian coach, Fabio Capello, who took the team to the title in La Liga (its first since 2003), but in a style that did not please the team's fans, Calderon said.
 ''We needed him to win the title, and we thank him, but we also need a coach who is perhaps not so conservative, who is not happy only winning, 1-0,'' he said. ''Perhaps in Italy they like it, but in Spain we want offense, scoring, a lot of goals.''
 Capello has been replaced by the former German international Bernd Schuster.
 Calderon acknowledged that Real was close to acquiring the Dutch wing Arjen Robben from Chelsea, had already signed the German defender Christoph Metzelder and had re-signed the Argentine striker Javier Saviola.
 ''The average age of our team is now 23 years,'' he said. ''We have players committed to us for the next six or seven years.''
 On the Move
 The transfer market in Europe continues to heat up as the start of the new season approaches. 
 David Gill, the chief executive of Manchester United, said the club's attempt to sign the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez had become ''overcomplicated.'' The deal could cost the club a $60 million transfer fee. 
 ''We are having to deal with four parties -- the player, West Ham, the companies that own Carlos's economic rights and the Premier League -- in an effort to sort everything out,'' Gill told The Daily Telegraph. ''The process is ongoing as we speak, but Carlos will fly in to undergo his medical, and we will take it from there.''
 Yesterday, though, West Ham, Tevez's team last season, refused to give United permission to give him a physical until a transfer agreement had been reached.
 In other transfer news, the Spanish newspaper Marca reported that A.C. Milan would make an offer to Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o, who became expendable when Barcelona signed Thierry Henry from Arsenal of England. ... Manager Roy Keane, who took Sunderland back to the English Premier League, signed the Nigerian midfielder Dickson Etuhu from Norwich City in a $3 million transfer deal. On Monday, Keane acquired Kieran Richardson from Manchester United and has now spent $32.5 million on five players.
 Notes
 The Red Bulls have sold more than 30,000 tickets for DaVID BECKHAM's M.L.S. debut in the New York metropolitan area on Aug. 18 at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.

HEADLINE: 'Key Judgments' on Terrorist Threat to U.S.

 BODY:
Following are the ''key judgments'' released by the White House yesterday from a July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on ''The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland.'' The rest of the intelligence estimate remains classified. (Source: www.dni.gov; emphasis in boldface is given to sections set apart by bullets in the original text.)
 We judge the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. The main threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, especially Al Qaeda, driven by their undiminished intent to attack the homeland and a continued effort by these terrorist groups to adapt and improve their capabilities. 
 We assess that greatly increased worldwide counterterrorism efforts over the past five years have constrained the ability of Al Qaeda to attack the U.S. homeland again and have led terrorist groups to perceive the homeland as a harder target to strike than on 9/11. These measures have helped disrupt known plots against the United States since 9/11.
 We are concerned, however, that this level of international cooperation may wane as 9/11 becomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge. 
 Al Qaeda is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland, as its central leadership continues to plan high-impact plots, while pushing others in extremist Sunni communities to mimic its efforts and to supplement its capabilities. 
 We assess the group has protected or regenerated key elements of its homeland attack capability, including: a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), operational lieutenants, and its top leadership. Although we have discovered only a handful of individuals in the United States with ties to Al Qaeda senior leadership since 9/11, we judge that Al Qaeda will intensify its efforts to put operatives here.
 As a result, we judge that the United States currently is in a heightened threat environment. 
 We assess that Al Qaeda will continue to enhance its capabilities to attack the homeland through greater cooperation with regional terrorist groups. Of note, we assess that Al Qaeda will probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the homeland. 
 In addition, we assess that its association with AQI helps Al Qaeda to energize the broader Sunni extremist community, raise resources, and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives, including for homeland attacks.
 We assess that Al Qaeda's homeland plotting is likely to continue to focus on prominent political, economic, and infrastructure targets with the goal of producing mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, significant economic aftershocks, and/or fear among the U.S. population. The group is proficient with conventional small arms and improvised explosive devices, and is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles.
 We assess that Al Qaeda will continue to try to acquire and employ chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear material in attacks and would not hesitate to use them if it develops what it deems is sufficient capability.
 We assess Lebanese Hezbollah, which has conducted anti-U.S. attacks outside the United States in the past, may be more likely to consider attacking the homeland over the next three years if it perceives the United States as posing a direct threat to the group or Iran.
 We assess that the spread of radical -- especially Salafi -- Internet sites, increasingly aggressive anti-U.S. rhetoric and actions, and the growing number of radical, self-generating cells in Western countries indicate that the radical and violent segment of the West's Muslim population is expanding, including in the United States. The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States -- who are becoming more connected ideologically, virtually, and/or in a physical sense to the global extremist movement -- points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate. 
 We assess that this internal Muslim terrorist threat is not likely to be as severe as it is in Europe, however.
 We assess that other, non-Muslim terrorist groups -- often referred to as ''single-issue'' groups by the F.B.I. -- probably will conduct attacks over the next three years given their violent histories, but we assess this violence is likely to be on a small scale.
 The ability to detect broader and more diverse terrorist plotting in this environment will challenge current U.S. defensive efforts and the tools we use to detect and disrupt plots. It will also require greater understanding of how suspect activities at the local level relate to strategic threat information and how best to identify indicators of terrorist activity in the midst of legitimate interactions.

HEADLINE: Japan Shuts Nuclear Plant After Leak

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 17 

 BODY:
Japanese authorities suspended operation of a nuclear power plant on Tuesday after a radiation leak and other damage from a deadly earthquake raised new concerns about the safety of the nation's accident-plagued nuclear industry. 
 Tokyo Electric Power, which operates the nuclear plant near Kashiwazaki, a city in northwestern Japan, said it had found more than 50 problems at the plant caused by the earthquake on Monday. While most were minor, the largest included 100 drums of radioactive waste that had fallen, opening the lids on some, the company said. 
 The earthquake also caused a small fire at the plant and caused 317 gallons of water containing trace levels of radioactive materials to leak into the Sea of Japan, the company said. On Tuesday, the company announced that it had detected tiny amounts of radioactive material in an air filter in one of the plant's seven reactors. But it said it was unlikely that the material had entered the atmosphere. 
 The company said that it was still examining how the tainted water got out, but that the levels of radioactivity were too low to endanger people or the environment. 
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe criticized Tokyo Electric for being ''too slow'' in reporting the problems to the government and the public. 
 ''Nuclear power can only operate with the people's trust,'' Mr. Abe told reporters on Tuesday. Power companies ''must accurately and swiftly report what is happening.''
 Television videotape showed rescuers digging through buildings in Kashiwazaki that had been toppled by the earthquake, which the local police said had killed at least nine people and injured an additional 1,000. Japan's meteorological agency said the quake measured 6.8 in magnitude, while the United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.6.
 Japan's military used warships and trucks to carry rice balls, bread and water to the remote region in Niigata Prefecture, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo. But relief efforts were slowed by landslides and gapping cracks in the earth that severed rail lines and roads, local news media reported.
 About 13,000 residents fled their homes, Japanese news media reported. Television videotape showed many people sleeping on blankets and futons in school gymnasiums that were being used as shelters.
 In Tokyo, government ministers scrambled to reassure the public about the safety of Japan's nuclear power plants, which have had a string of accidents, at least one of them deadly, and cover-ups of incidents in recent years. The economic ministry, which regulates the power industry, moved swiftly to reprimand Tokyo Electric for not reporting the leak to authorities until about six hours after discovering the problem. The ministry also ordered suspension of operations at the plant, the world's largest by amount of electricity produced, until safety could be ensured, and dispatched a team of inspectors to survey the damage.
 The power company said a cause of the damage was that the force of the shaking from the earthquake had exceeded the design limits of the reactors, suggesting that the plant's builders had underestimated the strength of possible earthquakes in the region. 
 The chief government spokesman, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, said the designs of other nuclear plants may also have to be re-examined to make sure they are strong enough to resist all potential earthquakes.
 Nuclear safety can be a particularly delicate issue in Japan, the only nation to be attacked with atomic weapons, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Nuclear safety experts said authorities apparently feared the earthquake-related accidents could raise fresh public doubts about Japan's 55 nuclear reactors, which the nation relies on for about a third of its electricity and to lessen energy dependence on the Middle East. 
 ''This will stir new debate about whether nuclear plants are safe enough,'' said Haruki Madarame, a professor in nuclear safety engineering at the University of Tokyo. ''Authorities will have to show the public that they are taking all reasonable steps to ensure safety.''
 Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone nations in the world, and has strict regulations meant to prevent earthquake damage to its nuclear plants. Those include building nuclear plants on solid bedrock to limit shaking from earthquakes, and erecting walls to protect against tsunamis at plants along the coast, like the Kashiwazaki plant.
 Tokyo Electric said the damage from the earthquake did not threaten the safety of the reactors at the Kashiwazaki plant. Four reactors were operating at the time, and all shut down safely, Tokyo Electric said. 
 Nuclear safety experts said the earthquake struck as power companies were examining reactors to see if they met safety standards revised last September. They said the unexpected strength of the earthquake's tremors may force authorities to set even tougher standards, and carry out fresh seismic studies to determine if they were underestimating the size of potential earthquakes.
 The Kashiwazaki plant was shut down as Tokyo faced its peak power use during the summer. In March, another nuclear plant operator, Hokuriku Electric Power Company, shut down a reactor after admitting it had covered up a 15-minute uncontrollable nuclear chain reaction in 1999. Three years ago, Japan's deadliest nuclear accident killed four workers at a nuclear plant in Mihama when a steam pipe burst.

HEADLINE: Bush's Mideast: Missing Shades of Gray

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 17 

 BODY:
Five years ago, President Bush said he expected to see an independent Palestinian state before he left office. On Monday, Mr. Bush ratcheted down expectations and said Palestinians faced a stark choice between Hamas, which favors Israel's destruction, and Fatah, which supports a two-state solution with Israel. 
 But Mr. Bush's idea of an internationally backed Fatah's winning over the Palestinian street faces many obstacles. By conflating Hamas with jihadist groups like Al Qaeda and the Taliban, Mr. Bush presented a picture that most Palestinians do not recognize. Their internal divisions -- even with Hamas having routed Fatah in Gaza last month and Fatah running the West Bank -- are much more complex that the one posited by Mr. Bush. 
 Palestinians elected Hamas in January 2006 to rule them, after all, and even many Palestinians who voted for Fatah say the United States-led boycott of Hamas has meant it has never been given a chance to govern.
 They also know that Fatah has hardly been spotless, which is why they voted against it, and that Fatah has done very little to reform itself since.
 Nor is it clear that Mr. Bush's vision is shared by other American allies or other members of the so-called quartet -- Russia, the European Union and the United Nations -- trying to encourage Middle East peace.
 Mr. Bush's speech was also a challenge to moderate Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt to act forcefully to support Palestinian moderates, by deeds as well as by attendance at this fall's American-sponsored conference on the Middle East. But it is doubtful that the Saudis share Mr. Bush's analysis, since they have been urging Hamas and Fatah to get back together again under the agreement they negotiated in their holy city of Mecca.
 Those same Arab moderates are bound to be concerned that an isolated Hamas will be thrown even more into the orbit of Shiite Iran and Syria, a point made on Tuesday by Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy, who said, ''Not recognizing the government elected democratically is not exactly a lesson in democracy, and pushing such a group into the hands of Al Qaeda is not in the international community's interest.''
 Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist and professor, said, ''I was hoping Bush would differentiate between the political and military wings of Hamas as a way out of this dilemma.'' The real choice for Palestinians, he said, is how best to achieve a state and a stable life, and ''most Palestinians now understand that this won't be solved militarily, that one more suicide bombing won't make Israel crumble.''
 Faced with Hamas, Israel and Washington are throwing support behind the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, who personally embraces nonviolence, and the prime minister, Salam Fayyad, an independent economist. Mr. Fayyad has no troops and no electoral mandate, but with Mr. Abbas's support he promises to create a Palestinian administration in the West Bank that can deliver what Hamas won the election promising: change and reform, security and order.
 But if Mr. Fayyad succeeds, it will be without democratic legitimacy. And a putative Palestine divided between the West Bank and Gaza only perpetuates a deep Palestinian political division, leaving out Hamas and the sizable minority who support it. That will undermine the credibility of whatever deal Mr. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, and Mr. Fayyad might be able to reach with a skeptical Israel, where the rightist Likud Party leads the polls.
 Yuval Steinitz, a Likud legislator, says Mr. Bush's ''new approach to Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority will not contribute to peace and stability.'' Mr. Abbas cannot deliver, Mr. Steinitz said. 
 Hamas itself, understanding that many Palestinians were shocked by the ferocity in Gaza, has made some gestures toward reconciliation with Fatah.
 On Monday, for example, the exiled Hamas political director, Khaled Meshal, called for dialogue with Mr. Abbas and apologized to Palestinians for mistakes made during the violent takeover.
 ''What happened, I swear to God and God is a witness, was loathsome for us,'' Mr. Meshal said. ''It is like a medicine pill that we were forced to swallow.'' He said that ''marginal mistakes'' were made ''by individuals who do not represent our policies.'' He added, ''We apologize to God before apologizing to the people for them.''
 For the moment, said Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for the Israeli government, Israel and the United States agree about the need to support Fatah in the West Bank and isolate Hamas in Gaza.
 Israel is prepared to take ''considered risks'' to help Mr. Abbas, Ms. Eisin said, by releasing prisoners, giving amnesty to wanted fighters, lifting roadblocks and removing illegal Israeli outposts on Palestinian land. Still, Israel and Ms. Eisin are less clear about how to isolate Hamas without punishing Gazans.
 ''While Israel is trying to pressure Hamas, you have a lot of angry people getting angrier,'' Mr. Kuttab said. ''I don't believe punishing people produces results. Hamas has maybe blinked a little, but it hasn't raised the white flag.''
 Ms. Eisin said: ''Hamas is there in Gaza, but that doesn't mean we have to help them or can't oppose them. We see Hamas as a terrorist organization, and right now the Palestinian president agrees. Great. It's Tuesday. Let's see what happens Friday.''
 Mr. Bush may have the same concerns. When he announced the international conference for this autumn, without a date, location or list of attendees, he made it clear that it would be his secretary of state, not he, who would lead it.

HEADLINE: Dubai Investment Firm Plans U.S. Purchases

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, July 18 

 BODY:
Dubai International Capital, the private equity firm of Dubai's ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, plans to open an office in the United States in the next eight months as it seeks to add American companies to its European-focused portfolio. 
 ''It is very important for us to find and execute deals in the U.S. as we're trying to create a diversified portfolio,'' Dubai International's chief executive, Sameer al-Ansari, said in an interview Wednesday at the firm's London offices. 
 Dubai International, which invests the sheik's personal funds, acquired minority stakes this year in European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent company of Airbus; HSBC Holdings; and the Icici Bank of India. Five Fortune 500 companies are on a short list for possible investments and about 15 are on a close-watch list, Mr. Ansari said. 
 The firm had considered an investment in Dell, the computer maker, but Mr. Ansari said the opportunity might have passed; the company's turnaround has gained traction and the share price has started to improve.
 The investment firm, based in Dubai, takes stakes in large companies as part of its Global Strategic Equities Fund, which was set up in February to ''create smart money from the region,'' Mr. Ansari said. Dubai International plans to make 10 investments of about $1 billion each and has a rate-of-return goal around 15 percent. 
 Gulf state investment agencies like Dubai International, the Qatar Investment Authority and the Kuwait Investment Authority are buying stakes in overseas companies to get exposure to regions with different growth cycles and to reduce their dependence on oil. Dubai's economy has been booming because of rising oil and real estate prices. A Qatar investment fund offered Wednesday to buy J Sainsbury, the British supermarket chain, which has a market value of $:10.4 billion ($21.35 billion). 
 Dubai International, which was established in 2004, bought the Tussauds Group, owner of the Madame Tussauds wax museum in London, for $:800 million in 2005 and merged it last year with the Merlin Entertainments Group. Dubai International retained a 20 percent stake in the combined company. 
 ''We are looking for undervalued companies with hidden values and problems, but of those kinds that can be fixed,'' Mr. Ansari said. The fund invests only in companies where it has met the management, to ascertain whether the executives understand the problems and are able to solve them with Dubai International's help.
 Two years ago, it bought a stake in DaimlerChrysler for $1 billion and acquired Travelodge, the budget hotel chain, for $:675 million. It also bought the Doncasters Group, a maker of military equipment with some of its plants in the United States.
 The Doncasters deal was held up by a government review of security concerns, but Mr. Ansari said the experience did not reduce his firm's appetite for American assets. 
 ''The Doncasters issues were a very good experience and helped us to build a lot of good will in Washington,'' he said. ''We may be more careful and stay away from defense-related assets, but we now have the feeling that if we do anything in the U.S., Washington understands us.''
 Mr. Ansari said that investing in American companies carried a risk of a possible economic slowdown while European assets are expected to profit from strong growth ahead. Multiples and valuations are better in Europe, he said.
 The firm is also looking for opportunities in Japan, an area Mr. Ansari said he ''gets excited about.'' Russia, South America and the Middle East also have some large companies but the investment opportunities he sees are narrower because of restrictive shareholder structures and limited access to stock exchanges. Aerospace and power industries still have some good investment opportunities, he said.
 Dubai International, which is not part of DP World or the government-owned Istithmar, says it does not see itself as an activist investor but prefers to work with management boards to improve the share price.

HEADLINE: Inflation, Except in Food, Was Relatively Mild in June

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Driven mostly by rising food prices, the Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation barometer, rose by two-tenths of a percent in June, the smallest increase since January, the government reported yesterday.
 Food prices, having risen steadily all year, appear to be overtaking gasoline as a source of inflation. Gasoline prices, now just above $3 a gallon on average, fell slightly in June and might do so again in July, surveys suggest.
 The housing slump, on the other hand, held down home costs, the biggest single item in the C.P.I. market basket. As a result, the so-called core inflation rate -- excluding the often volatile fluctuations in food and energy prices -- was 0.2 percent in June, and 2.2 percent over the last 12 months. The overall index, including food and energy, is up 2.7 percent over the past year. 
 ''The underlying inflation rate is tame,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com. ''But that is not a whole lot of solace for the average American who is spending a record amount for gasoline, and now food prices are approaching record highs.''
 Within the food category, grocery prices have risen at an annual rate of 8 percent so far this year. ''You have to go all the way back to the 1980s to get a figure larger than 8 percent,'' said Patrick C. Jackman, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the C.P.I.
 Rising transportation costs are helping to push up all food prices, Mr. Jackman said. So is the growing cost of corn and soybeans. These basic ingredients in animal feed are increasingly being diverted to the manufacture of ethanol, and as feedstock prices rise, so does the cost of beef, poultry and pork. 
 But if food prices are rising sharply, going up 0.5 percent in June, housing costs are not, and housing is the largest item in the C.P.I., accounting for nearly 24 percent of the national inflation rate. 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses an ''owner's equivalent rent'' to calculate the cost of housing. This equivalent is essentially what a homeowner would pay if he were renting his home. With the inventory of unsold houses piling up in many neighborhoods, the owner's equivalent rent is rising ever more slowly: up at an annual rate of 2.5 percent so far this year compared with 4.3 percent last year.
 A Commerce Department report yesterday added to the evidence of downward pressure on housing costs. While housing starts -- the beginning of new construction -- rose 2.3 percent in June, to an annual rate of 1.467 million, housing permits dropped precipitously, the report said. Housing permits, a barometer of future construction, plunged 4.1 percent for single-family homes, apparently in response to a growing inventory of empty houses, neither sold or rented. 
 ''Just about every housing indicator that has come out recently has been a bad one,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insights. 
 There were other increases. Medical care, college textbooks, tobacco and airline fares all were up in June. Airline fares fell last year, but rising fuel costs have helped to push up fares in 2007, along with filled planes, which ''has stopped some of the fare discounting,'' Mr. Jackman of the statistics bureau said.
 The mild inflation rate in recent months adds to the Federal Reserve's flexibility in setting interest rates, said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs. ''It is giving the Fed flexibility to keep rates where they are or bring them down if the economy were to weaken,'' Mr. Hatzius said.

HEADLINE: As Dollar Crumples After Long Swoon, Tourists Overseas Reel

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Reporting was contributed by Victoria Burnett in Madrid, Elisabetta Povoledo in Rome, Sarah Plass in Frankfurt, Eamon Quinn in Dublin and Alhan Keser in Paris.

DATELINE: HEIDELBERG, Germany, July 17 

 BODY:
A day after Michael Kingsley arrived in this romantic university town, he was in no mood to savor the cobblestone streets, the half-timbered houses or the flower-bedecked windows -- to say nothing of the camera-ready castle on the hill.
 Mr. Kingsley had left his camera battery and charger in a hotel room in London, and he knew that as an American tourist, buying replacements here was going to sting. The damage: $143. Back home in Falls Church, Va., he said, the same purchase would have set him back no more than $100.
 For Americans visiting Europe this summer, the steep decline of the dollar against the euro and the British pound has made eye-popping prices a lamentable part of the traveler's tale. (The Kingsley family's hotel room in London was $500 a night; five bite-sized chocolates at Harrods cost $10.)
 ''It's O.K.,'' said Mr. Kingsley, 59, with a resigned laugh. ''I'll just have to work a few extra years to pay off this vacation.'' His wife, Laura, did her best to soothe him. ''It's just play money,'' she said. 
 By now, five summers after the dollar began its long swoon against the euro and the pound, American travelers are used to $5 cups of coffee and triple-digit dinner checks in Europe's great capitals. But the dollar's latest plunge -- to $2.05 to the pound and to a record of $1.38 to the euro -- has turned mere sticker shock into a form of suspended disbelief for many tourists.
 For Kaelon Kroft, a custodian from San Bernardino, Calif., it was the cost of Coke that shocked him most in Paris. ''We just paid 9.5 euros for a can of Coke at a cafe,'' he said. ''At our hotel, the bar was serving a glass of Coke for four euros.''
 ''That's over five bucks,'' his wife, Kristi, added. Actually, at the current exchange rate, it is a fizzy bubble or two over $5.52.
 The Krofts and the Kingsleys both scaled back their European holidays to limit the pain of the currency pinch. But neither family seriously thought of canceling the vacation, and their glass-is-half-full determination to make the best of things was echoed in interviews with American tourists from Ireland to Italy.
 It is also reflected in the tourism statistics in France, Germany, Spain and other countries, which show that the number of Americans visiting Europe has increased this year, even as the value of the dollar has eroded. Travel experts say this speaks both to the resilience and rising affluence of American tourists, as well as to the perennial appeal of Europe as a destination.
 ''Americans who visit Europe tend to be more educated, with higher incomes, so they are less affected by the exchange rate,'' said Joachim Scholz, a researcher at the German National Tourist Board. ''Even backpackers have more money than they used to, if you look at the price of hostels.''
 Americans spent $3.8 billion on travel-related services in Europe in the first quarter of this year, a 5.5 percent increase from the quarter a year ago, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. They spent $22.8 billion in 2006, nearly 10 percent more than in 2002, when the dollar was close to parity with the euro.
 That should be a relief to innkeepers and restaurateurs here, because many currency experts say the dollar -- pulled down by the combination of a persistent trade deficit with the rest of the world, a slower American economy and an unexpectedly vigorous Europe -- has not reached bottom against the euro.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief currency strategist at CMC Markets in New York, described the dollar's decline as ''pervasive.'' He predicts that it could trade at $1.42 to the euro by the end of this year. The outlook for Americans in Britain is better: Mr. Laidi thinks the dollar is close to its nadir against the pound.
 Across the Atlantic, the weaker dollar has encouraged a European travel boom to the United States. And the currency changes are spurring a shift in trade, with American exports to the rest of the world picking up even as European officials are becoming louder in their complaints that the cheaper dollar is undermining the global competitiveness of their manufacturers.
 In the last 12 months, the dollar has declined 8.9 percent against the euro and 9.9 percent against the pound. But the erosion has been most striking over the last few weeks, after many Americans had already booked their European trips. Most appear to have held on to their bookings.
 ''A lot of Americans purchase their packages in the U.S., and pay in dollars, so they don't even notice,'' said Thierry Baudier, the chief executive of Maison de la France, the French tourism board. ''Once they arrive, it's too late.'' 
 Mark Trotter, a high school teacher from Fresno, Calif., taking 27 students on a tour of Madrid and Barcelona, said he watched with alarm as the dollar sank in the last two weeks. But nobody pulled out of the trip, which he leads each summer, and he said this was his largest group ever.
 ''I remember doing this trip for $2,100 as recently as 2003,'' Mr. Trotter said, standing beneath the stone columns in Madrid's main square. ''This year it cost $2,800. But in all honesty, parents don't even blink.''
 To be sure, tourists are making some adjustments to their itineraries or their spending habits. Paris has increasingly become a weekend destination for American tourists, Mr. Baudier said, reflecting a trend toward shorter European vacations. 
 In Ireland, a group of students from Virginia opted to skip a visit to the Waterford crystal factory, 100 miles south of Dublin. They are also cutting back on casual purchases. 
 ''I have to be much more aware of looking at the price of everything,'' said Erin Rogers, 21, still marveling at a $22 plate of Irish stew she ordered the previous evening. ''I didn't have a clear compass of just how weak the dollar was. It was a crash course in global economics.''
 The Krofts decided not to extend their stay in Paris, as they had hoped, because of the cost. Next year, Kristi Kroft said, their family of four would probably go to Hawaii or the Virgin Islands, where a dollar is worth 100 cents.
 Mr. Kingsley, a strategic planner with the Army Corps of Engineers, had plotted a grand tour of Europe that would have taken him, his wife, and their 33-year-old son, Josh, to London, Paris, Rome and Vienna, before ending up in Germany, to attend the wedding of a family friend.
 As the dollar wilted in recent weeks, Mr. Kingsley crossed off one city after another, eventually leaving only London and Germany. ''I would have loved to go to Vienna,'' Mrs. Kingsley said sadly.
 The currency squeeze is toughest on Americans who live in Europe and are paid in dollars. They suffer from erosion in their real income that, in many cases, is not fully compensated by their employers.
 ''It's scary,'' said Jennifer Aquino, who lives in Madrid and manages international alumni relations for Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. ''It makes you think twice about if you want to keep building a life in Europe.''
 Maddine Insalaco, who runs a landscape-painting workshop in Tuscany with her husband, Joe Vinson, said business had been crippled because their costs were in euros while their revenue was in dollars. ''It's a mom-and-pop operation,'' she said. ''We're too small to hedge our risks in terms of foreign exchange.''
 Worse, most of their clients are American, and as the euro has spiked, enrollment has dwindled. Still, Ms. Insalaco and other Americans are philosophical about the vagaries of currency markets. ''When the dollar was strong, no one was complaining,'' she said. ''We cashed in then.''
 Among some, there is even a sense that turnabout is fair play. Linda Miller, a frequent visitor to Europe from Honolulu, was browsing the other day in the gift shop at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin. 
 Recalling how she and her husband, Stephen, an eye surgeon, had lived large on earlier trips to Europe, Ms. Miller said, ''We have always thought that America got away with something.''

HEADLINE: Fed Trims Its Forecast For Growth

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Wednesday that the economy was poised for moderate growth for the rest of this year but that continuing problems in the housing market had prompted the Fed to slightly reduce its growth forecast.
 Separately, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that regulators needed to impose new rules on subprime mortgages -- those made to people with weak credit -- saying that the explosion of exotic mortgages in recent years was accompanied by lax underwriting standards, abusive lending practices and some cases of outright fraud. 
 Noting that the number of foreclosures has soared among people who took out subprime mortgages, Mr. Bernanke predicted that the problems ''likely will get worse before they get better.''
 The Fed chairman reiterated the central bank's basic message that the economy was likely to pick up speed in the second half of this year, after slowing to a crawl in the first quarter of 2007, but that inflation remained the Fed's ''predominant policy concern.''
 That reinforced the already widespread expectation that the Fed will leave its benchmark overnight interest rate of 5.25 percent unchanged for the rest of the year.
 The Fed slightly reduced its consensus forecast for growth -- an average of forecasts by Fed governors and regional Fed banks -- from estimates it released in February. The forecast calls for the economy to expand at a 2.25 to 2.5 percent rate in 2007 and by about 2.75 percent in 2008. 
 Those predictions are one-quarter of a percent lower than the Fed's forecast in February, and lower than what economists consider the long-run potential rate of growth of about 3 percent a year.
 Mr. Bernanke said the Federal Reserve continued to expect that core inflation -- excluding the volatile prices of energy and food -- would be about 2 percent in 2007 and as low as 1.75 percent in 2008. That would be inside the Fed's unofficial comfort zone for inflation, but Mr. Bernanke cautioned that the improvement was far from a sure thing.
 ''If energy prices level off as currently anticipated, overall inflation should slow to a pace close to that of core inflation in coming quarters,'' Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers.
 But Mr. Bernanke listed a number of risks that could make inflation more intractable, including a faster-than-expected increase in consumer spending, which could drive up product prices and labor costs. With unemployment still low at 4.5 percent, Fed officials worry that unexpectedly rapid growth would push up wages faster than productivity.
 Mr. Bernanke made it clear that policy makers remained focused on core inflation, but he acknowledged that gasoline and food prices pushed the overall rate of inflation to an annual rate of 4.4 percent during the first five months and severely pinched many consumers.
 A number of Democratic lawmakers at the hearing complained that Mr. Bernanke and the Federal Reserve had ignored the stagnation in real wages, after adjusting for inflation, that many workers in the United States experienced in recent years. Many also complained that the Federal Reserve had paid little heed to rising inequality and to the fact that corporate profits had climbed sharply since the last recession ended in 2001.
 ''Mr. Chairman, I believe we have an honest intellectual difference here,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''I believe that the single most pressing economic issue facing the country today is the excessive and growing inequality.''
 Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that steep increases in energy prices had cut into workers' earnings. But he added that hourly wages climbed slightly faster than inflation last year, and he expressed hope that ''real'' incomes would continue to rise for most people. ''I do think we'll see improvements.''
 Mr. Bernanke also tacitly acknowledged that the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators had been too timid about reining in aggressive mortgage lenders that specialized in mortgages for people with weak credit or low incomes.
 The volume of such subprime mortgages exploded from 2002 through 2006, as more and more homebuyers stretched to keep up with soaring real estate prices. Many subprime lenders allowed people to qualify for much bigger loans than they would have been allowed under normal rules, sometimes by offering low initial ''teaser'' interest rates or loans that required no down payment. Many high-risk mortgages required little or no documentation from borrowers about their incomes.
 But delinquency rates have soared to 12 percent for subprime mortgages with variable interest rates, according to data cited by the Fed, and foreclosures are rising rapidly. 
 ''The recent expansion of the subprime market was clearly accompanied by deterioration in underwriting standards and in some cases, by abusive lending practices and outright fraud,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies announced plans to review the practices of a wide range of mortgage lenders to see if new rules or enforcement are necessary.
 Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers that the Fed and other federal bank regulators also hoped to propose new rules by the end of the year that would require greater disclosure of potential risks in certain kinds of loans and put new restrictions on potentially abusive practices.

HEADLINE: THE ENTREPRENEURIAL EDGE Community Investment in San Jose

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, the largest city in Northern California, recently invested $350,000 in a local company, Bentek Manufacturing, to help it grow and provide good pay and benefits for its 120 employees.
 San Jose's investment was part of a $3 million financing that includes participation by Pacific Community Ventures, an organization that invests pension and other institutional funds in companies that employ minority workers or provide work in low-income neighborhoods.
 San Jose's four-month-old Economic Development Catalyst Fund also joined Pacific Community Ventures in an investment in Mercados Suvianda, a new company that employs 200 workers at two supermarkets in San Jose and plans expansion. 
 Is the old adage that ''you can't fight City Hall'' changing to ''tap into City Hall for investment''? In a sense, yes, said Jeff Ruster, deputy director for economic development for San Jose. Four months ago, Mr. Ruster said, the city shifted from loans and grants to local companies ''to investments that bring the disciplines and rigors of venture capital to a business and require a financial return as well as a social return in terms of expanded employment and good wages and benefits.'' 
 Such community investment is a national and international trend. San Jose was adopting the model of Pacific Community Ventures, which has just raised more than $40 million for a new investment fund. The group was founded in 1998 by Penelope Douglas, a former business executive who is its president, and Bud Colligan of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. In the last nine years, the group has invested $14 million in 10 companies. ''We back established small companies typically in low income or rural areas,'' Ms. Douglas said. 
 Though a nonprofit organization, Pacific Community Ventures demands a profit in its investments. ''We differ from the big venture capital companies that earn a high return from technological wonders like Google,'' she said. ''But we must earn a return on investment in the high teens to be able to return a profit for our investors.'' 
 Its backers include the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, which in the 1990s pioneered the concept of investments meant to produce a ''double bottom line'' of social and financial gains.
 Pacific Community Ventures considers a return on investment of 18 percent acceptable. It has pursued such profits in Niman Ranch, an organic food company in Oakland; RadioVisa, a producer of Spanish-language radio in Los Angeles; and Timbuk2 Designs, a San Francisco marketer of sports bags, for which the group negotiated a payout for low-income employees when the company was sold in 2005. The organization also has a service that helps 94 companies throughout California with advice on marketing, finance and other business functions.
 Bentek is typical of the companies the group backs with investments. It is an engineering and manufacturing firm that makes and upgrades subassemblies for machinery that produces semiconductors for computers, wireless devices and radio frequency identification systems, or RFID. 
 Binh Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant, founded Bentek in 1985 and built it with the help of a largely Vietnamese American work force to about $40 million in annual revenue. He sold the company two years ago to Fundamental Capital, a San Francisco investment firm, which brought a fresh outlook and capital to help Bentek take advantage of rapid changes in the electronics industry. 
 The company's business is in a sweet spot right now, said Matt Pitchon, Bentek's president. ''The investment from San Jose will help us finance the growth we're seeing as our customers have to adapt to all this changing technology for advanced wireless devices and phones, hand-held computers and RFID.''
 Rapid change pays an added dividend as well, Mr. Pitchon said. ''You hear a lot about outsourcing of manufacturing to Asia, but the work we do is so complex and changing so rapidly that outsourcing is practically impossible.''
 Bentek meets the social requirements for community investment, Mr. Pitchon said. ''We have a full medical plan and 401(k) investment plan with company match. And we do a lot of employee training.'' Work force development and paying a ''living wage'' are prime objectives of community investment, said Mr. Ruster of San Jose. He defines a living wage as $12 to $13 an hour, double the federal minimum -- minimum wage in California is $7.50. 
 The venture idea has caught on nationwide and overseas. The Community Development Venture Capital Alliance is an organization that has grown to 100 member funds in all parts of the country and abroad since its founding in 1995. ''Collectively we have $1 billion to invest,'' said Kerwin Tesdell, president of the alliance, which invests with its member through a $6 million Central Fund. 
 Examples of its investments include SpringBoard Technologies, a computer repair and contract manufacturing company in Springfield, Mass., which was founded in 1993 by Tony Dolphin, who went out on his own after Digital Equipment closed a division that he worked for. He was backed by a $500,000 investment by the Boston Community Ventures Fund. An African-American entrepreneur, Mr. Dolphin works with a local community college to ''train inner city employees in basic skills and give them the knowledge necessary for career advancement.'' 
 Kelly Upchurch, a psychologist, started American Health Management in rural Kentucky a decade ago to bring daytime care and rehabilitation centers to the elderly. He was helped by a $90,000 investment from the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, which was formed 39 years ago to promote development in poor, rural counties in southeastern Kentucky.
 Today, Mr. Upchurch, who also received assistance in accounting and business planning from Kentucky Highlands, has seven care centers and has created more than 100 jobs in rural areas. 
 With all their emphasis on America's inner cities, rural areas and minority populations -- ''underserved'' communities, in development parlance -- these funds give an impression more of philanthropy than business. But that would be an out-of-date impression, according to a new study by the Milken Institute and the Ford Foundation.
 Amid America's changing demographics, minority-owned companies grew at twice the rate of all companies over the last 10 years, and the number of concerns owned by women grew even faster, the study found. 
 The economic potential is huge. If the purchasing power of ethnic communities were taken together, it would constitute the world's seventh-largest economy, the Milken Institute reported. 
 Realizing that potential is where community venture funds play a helpful role, said Mr. Tesdell of the alliance. ''Low-income communities tend not to have wealthy family members who provide financing for entrepreneurs. And small-business expansion and product development can't be done prudently with debt alone,'' Mr. Tesdell said. ''So community venture funds provide equity -- long-term investment. Community economic development is fundamentally about making things happen in the economy that would not otherwise happen.''

HEADLINE: Big Rise Seen In Demand For Energy

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18 

 BODY:
It started with a simple question by Samuel W. Bodman, the energy secretary: What does the future hold for supplies of oil and natural gas?
The query was made in October 2005 in a one-page letter sent to Lee Raymond, the former chairman of Exxon Mobil and head of the National Petroleum Council, a federal advisory group representing the oil industry.
 After nearly two years, Mr. Raymond has finally delivered his answer: Because the world's population is growing and living standards are rising worldwide, energy consumption globally is expected to rise by more than 50 percent over the next 25 years. But finding supplies to match that growth is going to be increasingly tough and will require huge new investments in coming decades. 
 The support for that conclusion is a 476-page study titled ''Facing the Hard Truths About Energy'' that involved 350 participants, suggestions from more than 1,000 people, submissions by 19 foreign governments from Australia to Saudi Arabia, and dozens of subcommittees.
 Some of the recommendations made by the petroleum council probably far exceed what the Bush administration was expecting, for example calling for a federal standard to manage carbon emissions and taking steps to moderate consumption.
 The report, which was made public in Washington on Wednesday, was billed as one of the most comprehensive analyses of the global energy challenge in decades.
 It also provides a sobering picture of the energy problem facing the United States and the world. The council's report warns of ''accumulating risks'' to energy production, including rising geopolitical barriers, inflation in costs, dwindling numbers of petroleum engineers and growing constraints on carbon dioxide emissions.
 Although it does not say so explicitly, the subtext of the council's study suggests that high energy prices might be here to stay.
 The study's release comes as frustrations grow over high energy costs. Congress is debating a proposal to bolster the development of alternative fuels and increase vehicle fuel efficiency.
 Unlike the Bush administration's energy task force, which was led by Vice President Dick Cheney in 2001 and fought efforts to disclose the people it consulted, the petroleum council's study makes no secret of who participated in its effort.
 The list of contributors to the petroleum council's report is a roster of top industry leaders and consultants, including senior executives from Exxon and Chevron. But the council also enlisted the help of private research centers, academic institutions, banks, government agencies and environmental groups like Resources for the Future and the Alliance to Save Energy.
 ''The study really reflects the zeitgeist of the times,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and an energy consultant who participated in the study.
 Still, some of the report's conclusions would hardly seem surprising given the authors. For example, it dismisses predictions from so-called peak oil theorists that the world's oil deposits are on the decline; quite the contrary, the industry's view is that the world's resources remain abundant.
 ''Fortunately, the world is not running out of energy resources,'' the report says in a 40-page summary. ''Coal, oil and natural gas will remain indispensable to meeting total projected energy demand growth.''
 But while the council calls for expanding and diversifying traditional energy supplies -- oil and gas, coal and nuclear power -- it also backs the development of alternative fuels, including biofuels.
 ''There is no quick fix,'' Mr. Raymond said at a news conference Wednesday. ''To assume that we have the option of not pursuing one of the sources of energy is a fake choice.''
 Strikingly, the report's first recommendation calls for the United States government to moderate energy demand by increasing vehicle fuel economy standards, the main sources of growth in oil demand around the world, and improve energy efficiency in buildings and homes.
 ''The world will need better energy efficiency and all economic, environmentally responsible energy sources available to support and sustain future growth,'' the report said.
 Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, who helped write the report, said: ''It is not the expected voice calling for demand moderation and the increase of energy efficiency. They are being honest about the situation. But everyone recognizes it is going to take more than just moderating demand, or increasing efficiency, or increasing alternative supplies, but it is going to take all these things. And we cannot afford to wait.''
 But perhaps the biggest surprise is that Mr. Raymond, who was well known for his skepticism about global warming when he was chairman of Exxon Mobil, has given his support to a study that says oil companies and governments need to address carbon emissions and offers some suggestions for how carbon dioxide can be trapped in underground reservoirs.
 The report says the government should ''provide an effective, global framework for carbon management, including the establishment of a transparent, predictable, economywide cost for carbon dioxide.''
 Mr. Bodman, who attended Wednesday's presentation, said, ''These are hard facts and hard facts require us to plan for hard choices, now and in the future.''
 Clay Sell, the under secretary for energy, said the administration would consider the report's recommendations but made not commitment to following any of them. The administration has resisted tackling carbon emissions saying any mechanism that would create a cost for carbon emissions would be too costly for the economy.
 Oil prices have risen sharply in recent years as the growth in demand, mainly from China and the United States, has outpaced the growth in oil production. The result has been a very tight global market, with very little spare capacity to bring online.

 BODY:
 WHEN considering President Bush's new plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, it would be wise to bear in mind that because political initiatives in the Middle East are cursed with such a high failure rate analysts sometimes use the odds as a substitute for craft. After Anwar Sadat's spectacular trip to Jerusalem in November 1977, the press, mistaking cynicism for wisdom, was skeptical. After all, in the first 25 years of its existence, Israel had had to fight Egypt four times. But the past was no guide to the future, for in the last 30 years the peace of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat has been unbroken.
 Yet, at the time, few people were able to see the way ahead even as it was clearly illuminated by the facts. Educated opinion was attentive to the vicissitudes of negotiation rather than to the structural imperatives that would eventually prevail. Nearly bankrupt, its population swelling, recently divorced from the Soviet Union, irrelevant to the third world and having reclaimed its honor by partial success in the 1973 war, Egypt was predictable. So were its rivals: a front of radical Arab states and the Palestinians. 
 Israel and Egypt, knowing their interests and set upon their course, formed, as it were, the innermost of three concentric circles. Surrounding them was a second circle, the Arab rejectionists, which were divided, militarily weak, geographically separated and economically impotent. Except for the Soviet bloc, which did not have the agility to make up for its lack of position, the major powers that formed the outer circle were overwhelmingly in favor of rapprochement. And in the end, they used their combined strengths to break the middle circle of rejectionists against the solid center formed by the principals. A similar metaphysics has now emerged in the Middle East.
 The United States has fought the war in Iraq as if history, strategy, maneuver, preparation, foresight, fact, integrity and common sense did not exist. Nonetheless, the effect of the war has been to shatter the politics of the region and create opportunities, one of which is the potential for a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
 Some quarters of government, burnt by the predictable failure of the current administration to transform the political culture of the Middle East into that of the Vermont town meeting, deny this potential, as if by analogy. But the analogy is invalid. The conditions are not the same, the task is entirely different and, unlike the United States, Israel has no timetable (implicit or otherwise) for withdrawal from the region -- as its enemies well know.
 As America blunts its sword in Iraq, it has relieved Iran of much anxiety in regard to its own vulnerabilities, set up a predominantly Shiite government in Baghdad, and made the Arab world more receptive to Iranian views. This Shiite ascendancy is comprised of a resurgent though weak Iran, Hezbollah's Shiite rump state in Lebanon chastened by the war it ''won'' a year ago (with such a victory, defeat is unnecessary), and the alignment with Iran of Syria and Sunni radicals like Hamas. 
 Contrary to the received wisdom, last summer Hezbollah overplayed its hand. Israel emerged shaken but with few casualties and an economy that actually grew during the hostilities. It took 4,000 of the vaunted Katyusha rockets to kill 39 Israelis, they did little material damage, and not one has been launched in the year since the war. Israel showed that upon provocation it could and would destroy anything in its path, thus creating a Lebanese awakening that has split the country and kept Hezbollah fully occupied. Though Hezbollah is rearming, it remains shy of Israel.
 Hamas, too, has overplayed its hand, which has provided the opening from which a Palestinian-Israeli peace may emerge. For the first time since 1948, a fundamental division among the Palestinians presents a condition in which the less absolutist view may find shelter and take hold. 
 Mahmoud Abbas, the Fatah leader and Palestinian president, is weak in many ways, but he has decisively isolated the radicals. Hamas loyalists in the West Bank (according to the latest polling, less than 25 percent of the population) face a different demographic than they did in Gaza, and a different economy that can be richly watered if Israel is wise enough to do so. Surrounded and penetrated by the Israeli Army and Palestinian Authority forces, they are not what they once were.
 In economically besieged Gaza, Hamas is corralled by Israel, Egypt and the sea, its apparent strength exaggerated by Mr. Abbas's decision not to fight on this battlefield but rather to profit by its loss, much as did King Hussein in regard to the West Bank in 1967. 
 The starving and oppressed Gazans who watch Hamas fire rockets, the chief effect of which is to summon Israeli tanks, may soon see a prosperous West Bank at the brink of statehood and at peace with its neighbors and the world. The quarantine of Gaza will cast a bright light upon the normalization of the West Bank. And although Hamas leaders portray Mr. Abbas as a collaborator, it is they who may be held to account for keeping more than a million of their own people hostage to a gratuitous preference for struggle over success.
 The sudden and intense commonality of interest between the Palestinian Authority and Israel is the equivalent of the Israeli-Egyptian core of 1977. But today, the Arabs, in the second circle, have largely reversed position. Fearful of Iran's sponsorship of war, chaos and revolution, they will apply their weight against the rejectionists. 
 Egypt, the Persian Gulf states and Jordan have so much to contend with at home and in the east that they cannot afford an active front in their midst, and are therefore forming ranks against Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, bringing most of the rest of the Arab states with them. 
 This is extraordinary and it is where we are now: on the verge of a rare alignment of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the leading Arab nations and the major powers. Though it is true that one of Moscow's chief interests is to keep the Middle East roiled so as to preserve the high oil prices that are now Russia's lifeblood, when the region moved from Soviet to Western arms Moscow was relegated to the periphery, where it remains. Though Europe is militarily paralyzed, it wields great economic incentives; and though the United States has of late been a graceless lummox drunkenly knocking everything awry, its powers remain pre-eminent and its will constructive.
 The principals, the important Arab states and the leading powers of the West are arrayed against a radical terrorist front that, unlike the one in Iraq, is geographically fractured, relatively contained, terribly poor and very much outnumbered. Anything for the worse can happen in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and usually does; but now the chief pillars of rejectionist policy lie flat and the spectrum of positions is such that each constructively engaged party can accommodate the others. 
 In the heat of a failing war, historical processes have unfrozen. If Israel and the Palestinian Authority can pursue a strategy of limited aims, concentrating on bilateral agreements rather than a single work of fallible grandeur, they may accomplish something on the scale of Sadat's extraordinary demarche of 30 years ago. The odds are perhaps the best they have been since, and responsible governments should recognize them as the spur for appropriate action and risk.

HEADLINE: Settling Down in a City in Motion

BYLINE: By EMILY PRAGER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
 THE first week I lived in Shanghai, I was walking down Nanjing Street, in front of Cartier, and a man tried to sell me tiger paws. I was near one of the main high-end shopping plazas, a glittering mass of high-rise office buildings and luxury stores, when the man -- rustic looking, darkly tanned and wild-eyed -- approached me. Nearby, on a cardboard box, I saw his wares: the dried-out skins of indeterminate animals. He walked up to me and thrust out the two giant paws, clearly those of a long-gone big cat. He peered at me expectantly and waited for his money. I looked down at the moth-eaten paws and up at the diamonds in Cartier's window, and I felt as one often does here, like part of a Surrealist painting. 
 I left Manhattan a year ago, after a lifetime there. I was annoyed at spending $20 for a hamburger, depressed by designer boutiques on Bleecker Street, weary of the hovering specter of Al Qaeda, and still grieving over the demise of the Thalia. I was getting old waiting for the real estate bubble to burst and the city to regain its vibrancy. I decided to move myself and my 12-year-old daughter, Lulu -- whom I had adopted as a baby in China -- from the old capital of the world to the new: to make a home in Shanghai, a city of the future.
 I knew something about Shanghai, having been here on trips several times in the last few years. The city was always so excited it could hardly contain itself. It is a microcosm of the Asian boom, stuffed with people giddy on hope and thrilled to be changing. It recalls the greatness of New York in the early '70s, except for one thing: Like the rest of China, Shanghai was largely closed to the outside world, and real economic growth, for nearly 50 years after World War II. It is a place where every car on the road is brand new and every pet recently acquired, but the person you just met might trace his family back 70 generations. The modernity and polish that Manhattan learned between 1945 and 1995, Shanghai is cramming for as fast as it can, and it's fascinating to watch.
 But visiting a city is one thing; making a home in it is quite another. 
 The first order of business was to find a place to live. I had researched brokers on the Web and called one when we arrived. She came right over with a van and took us on a tour of the city. Rental brokers in Shanghai, it seems, are your hosts and hostesses. Not only do they find you lodging but they introduce you to the city, serve as advisers and translators, and continue to look after you and your every need for the duration of your lease. This was invaluable to me because it has taken me a year to learn basic survival Mandarin. 
 Having looked for apartments in New York in recent years, I was dreading doing it in Shanghai. But the day my agent showed me a fully furnished, 2,500-square-foot apartment in the best part of town renting for $1,500, I was glad I'd come. Of the 10 places she showed me, nine were great. The choice was between apartments built in the 1920s and '30s -- Art Deco and Forest Hills-style Tudor, woody and charming -- and those in brand-new high rises -- ''concrete palaces'' as they're called -- that were light, spacious and airy. (The only worry was the ever-present dish-disinfector, a machine for sterilizing plates after washing them in iffy city water, but my agent assured me that it was no longer necessary.)
 I couldn't make a decision, but it brought me back to the time when apartments in New York cost $150 a month and were yours for the taking. I would have to decide by considering who I wanted to be: Should I go with the Huangpu River view in the artsy section of Hongkou not far from the Bund, or the 1,600-square-foot servants' quarters of a turn-of-the century Chinese mansion in quiet but stuffy Changning? 
 Then the agent called with another possibility, a little lane house in the former French Concession, an area of the city that was conceded to the French government after the Opium Wars. It is the Greenwich Village of Shanghai, with streets lined with plane trees, cafes and faded art deco apartment buildings, behind which are labyrinthine lanes with three-story concrete or brick houses, mostly from the '20s and '30s. I decided to go with the old instead of the new. 
 Many single-family houses in Shanghai were opened to the poor after the Communist revolution of 1949, and made into multi-family dwellings, sometimes with as many as five people living in a single room. My little house had recently been leased from the government on a 70-year lease hold by the landlady, a Singaporean woman, and turned back into a one-family house. Four floors in all, with a tiny concrete-walled garden in back, it still has original features like a scholar's room, a small square room behind a half-height wall on the second floor which the householder traditionally rented out to a scholar for his studies, and a balcony over the lane off the master bedroom. Lane houses usually have a rooftop space to hang out laundry or to gaze at the moon during the fall Moon Festival, but in this house, the space had been turned into an attic bedroom. When my daughter saw this woody aerie, the deal was done. 
 WHEN you rent a place in Shanghai, the landlord gives you presents. This is a terrific shock for a New Yorker. My agent told me I could ask for special furniture, TVs, gym memberships -- the landlady would actually take me shopping. 
 The kitchen already had an oven, a selling point since the majority of Chinese do not use them, preferring to cook in woks on burners. Each room had its own air conditioning and heating unit, and in each of the two modern bathrooms, there were heat lamps for the winter. 
 I was flummoxed by what to ask for. Finally I requested a washing machine and window screens to keep out mosquitoes. Otherwise, I took the place unfurnished, thinking I would buy secondhand furniture and get a look at the town in the process. My rental agent was so upset by my reticence that she insisted that the owner throw in a big TV and pay for the satellite service for a year.
 I assumed we could move in immediately -- we'd had enough of our cheap hotel -- but the landlady told me that the house was not ready. It had been painted, but waxing the floors would take a full week. In Shanghai, floors are highly waxed, layer upon layer, rather than polyurethaned. A result is that spilled liquids bead on the surface and are not absorbed. A gleaming floor is a sign of prosperity. You never wear shoes inside the house, and you provide slippers for your guests. 
 We moved in on Sept. 1, and I set about assembling a new life. I went out to search for secondhand furniture and quickly found that there was none. There were some antiques, but the kind of thing we Americans call secondhand furniture did not exist during those 50 years that China was closed to the world. With an entire family living in one room, there wasn't much space or money for more than a loft-type platform and maybe a table and chair. Furniture was kept until it fell apart.
 I ended up going to one of the new Westernized Chinese furniture stores and spending $250 for a fat yellow leatherette couch and two fat armchairs that look like giant toads in my living room. They are remarkably comfortable. 
 There are two types of life coexisting in Shanghai: the Westernized life which is becoming more or less like New York's, and the old lane life still lived by a good many of the city's inhabitants, now including myself and my daughter. 
 Each lane is a perfect little ecosystem. There is a lanekeeper who watches over the lane and a lane sweeper who comes morning and evening to clean it up, to whom I contribute about $5 a month. At the end of each lane is a little house with square windows, which covers garbage bins on one side of a wall and a communal sink on the other. 
 I can also leave garbage outside my door against the lane wall. The first time I did , I was embarrassed: I put out a big garbage bag stuffed with unnecessary junk while my neighbors had almost no garbage at all. It was clear they used no paper products and ate every bit of food. I have not bought paper towels or anything that I can do without since. 
 There are recyclers who travel the lanes in bicycle carts and collect boxes, making their living by taking them to recycling stations. They ring their bicycle bells to announce their arrival and you bring out your brown paper or cardboard boxes or bags. They fold every bit ever so neatly and tie it all up with string. Sometimes their stack is four feet tall and four feet wide, a huge burden delicately balanced as they ride slowly away. 
 There are also bottle collectors and tinkers who announce their presence through loudspeakers or in singsong voices. There are fruit and vegetable sellers who wander through and sing of their wares. My neighbors, who include retirees and office workers, go in and out of their houses all day long to buy and haggle and chat. There are, as in New York, little brown city sparrows that chirp loudly, and many people own songbirds, which they hang outside to take the air. 
 People buy fresh food daily. They buy clothes directly from clothes carts or in markets. Things like nail clippers and cotton swabs are sold from carts in the street outside the lane, as are dishes and cups and most other household items. I went to buy some string one day and the man cut me a 12-inch piece. People buy only as much as they need. They do not hoard and their homes are not full of items they never use. 
 My house is very solid and I never hear my neighbors. In all but two of the other houses on the lane, three or four families still live in very close quarters. (People seem amused and curious, rather than resentful, about the difference in the ways we live, but I am often embarrassed by it.) Windows are always open, even in winter, but the ethic is that one does not look in. Privacy in China is mental rather than physical. You make yourself unaware of who's right next to you, whether it's someone shelling beans or having an argument or brushing his teeth in his underwear. 
 People sit out in the lane during the day and chat and laugh. In the evening, if it's warm, families set up tables and barbecue. Young men who don't seem to have much to do stand around and smoke. Sometimes, men play cards. At the entrance to the lane, where it meets the street, there is a barber shop, as well as a stand selling slippers, sandals and knockoff disco CDs, which boom through ancient speakers. The amazing thing about the lane is that once you are inside it, you hear only its own sounds. 
 I learned more about my lane when I brought my dog over from New York. Once we had gotten a bit settled, I hired a pet relocator and my dog, Skippy, a 15-pound miniature pinscher, was flown to Shanghai. He went by KLM and stopped at a doggy hotel in Amsterdam where he spent the night and, I hope, for what I paid, saw the sights and ate in one of the city's best restaurants. He spent a week in quarantine here and was then delivered to our door, his little eyes spinning in his head. 
 It is against the law to walk a dog in the city between 7 in the morning and 7 at night. To have a dog at your house, you need a license, which costs $200 and includes a checkup and rabies shot, but which most people cannot afford and consequently don't get. Pets are new to Chinese people and they don't know very much about them. Dogs are not neutered and they are walked without leashes. Many people are terrified of dogs, particularly given the country's serious rabies problem.
 Twice when I was walking Skippy, young women caught sight of him and screamed in terror at the top of their lungs. Because having a pet is so new, there is a video showing how to pick up after a dog and wash his paws after his walk, which appears many times a day on a huge video screen on Huaihai, the city's other main shopping street.
 The first night I walked Skippy was the first time I went out the back door to the lane behind our house. I discovered that it was totally dark. My neighbors on either side were home but, it seemed, had no electricity. It was pitch black inside their houses. Only the sound of a transistor radio playing Chinese opera emanated from the buildings. (It is a tribute to the safety of the lane and Shanghai in general that I walk the dog down that lane every night in total darkness without any fear.) In the morning when I walked him, I learned that some of my neighbors also have no plumbing. I watched them bring their chamber pots out into the lane to a special truck. 
 AS I thought about my plumbing, it occurred to me that I had no idea how to pay my water bill. I had a bank account, but there are no checks in China.
 Having money and regularly using banks is still new here, and the banks are reorganizing and trying to cope. My rental agent told me to take my bills to the post office or a convenience store, both of which are open seven days a week, as are many banks. I pay my water, electricity, cable, DSL and phone bills in cash.
 Once I forgot to pay the water bill and the water was turned off immediately, but unlike in New York, it was turned back on immediately -- with no penalty -- as soon as I paid. 
 Most other bills in Shanghai are paid up front, even for meals in many restaurants. Many people use debit cards instead of cash. Credit cards were recently introduced, and just last week banks announced that they will issue and accept checks, but only for people's wages. 
 When I go to the bank, I take a number and sit on a metal bench until my number is flashed. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to three hours. The tellers do everything from opening accounts to regular transactions, and each step requires a sealing with a chop -- a name stamp -- which is very time consuming. 
 But there is a grace about living here that I love. People do things here that machines do in America. Instead of a parking meter, there is a person who takes your money and helps you park. When you buy a plant at the nursery, a man comes and plants it for you. When you buy a computer, a person comes to set it up and another person arrives to install the programs. Designers use patterns for clothing and shoes from the 1930s. It is not unusual to see a female office worker in a 1930s day dress and high-heeled sandals holding a parasol to keep off the sun. 
 Thirty years from now, Shanghai will probably be just like New York. But I don't care about that now. When I finish writing this, I'm going down to Xiangyang Park, past the poor men from the north who are just arriving to sell animal skins, to find the group of my neighbors who set up a boom box at twilight for ballroom dancing. They don't mind if I join in. The more the merrier.

HEADLINE: Goldman Sachs Gets Deal For 2nd Jersey City Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Goldman Sachs Group received approval yesterday to build its second tower on the Jersey City waterfront, a 30-story, $560 million office building that would house employees moving across the river from New York and accommodate the future growth of the firm.
 The approval came in a vote by the Municipal Council to grant a property tax break worth roughly $4 million a year for the project, which had already been approved by the planning department. Goldman said it would probably begin construction late in 2009, about the time it completes a $2.4 billion headquarters one mile to the east, at Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan. 
 The deal in Jersey City comes less than two years after Goldman promised to retain 9,000 employees and add 4,000 in the coming years in Manhattan, in return for one of the most generous subsidy packages in New York City ever granted by state and city officials. 
 The new Goldman tower in Jersey City would hold about 3,500 workers and add to that city's rapidly growing skyline. 
 But it raises questions about the wisdom of granting corporations tax breaks in return for jobs. Critics of the practice contend that Goldman Sachs, one of the most profitable investment banks on Wall Street, may be unable to fulfill all its promises to New York and New Jersey. 
 Goldman's first tower in Jersey City, at 30 Hudson Street, is only 60 percent full today and could accommodate 3,000 more workers. 
 ''Goldman has perfected the art of grabbing subsidies on both sides of the river,'' said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, a group that conducts research on economic development. ''We can only hope that elected officials can get equally good at ensuring that Goldman lives up to its job promises. Too often, taxpayers get stuck with the tab and don't get the jobs that were promised.''
 Peter Rose, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said the company was planning for the future and had made a substantial investment in both Lower Manhattan and Jersey City. The property tax abatement that Goldman Sachs just received in Jersey City, he said, is available to any company moving there.
 ''We have to look at the economics of where we put a building,'' Mr. Rose said. ''We may be a profitable firm. But that doesn't mean we don't watch our expenses. This is a win-win for Jersey City and Goldman Sachs.''
 The firm says it has 9,000 to 10,000 employees in New York and 3,662 in Jersey City.
 New York City officials expressed mixed opinions. ''The great news is that Goldman Sachs is continuing to grow,'' said Robert C. Lieber, president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation. But, he said, the commitments Goldman made in New York ''have consequences if they're not upheld.'' 
 The tax break for Goldman provoked a lively debate yesterday at the Municipal Council's meeting. 
 It was generally acknowledged that Goldman was a model corporate citizen. But the Rev. Kevin Agee, pastor of the Calvary C.M.E. Church, said it was ''morally reprehensible to allocate tax abatements to folks who are billionaires and millionaires while the poor, and even the middle class, gets shafted.''
 Elnora Watson, president of the Urban League of Hudson County, said she was grateful that Goldman Sachs donated $7,500 to her group last year, but she opposed the abatement. She said the Council should work harder to ensure that jobs go to local residents, a sentiment also expressed by other speakers. 
 Raj Patel, who owns a travel agency in Jersey City, said that he pays full property taxes and an additional $960 a year for a special improvement district. ''These people are getting freebies,'' Mr. Patel said. ''It doesn't make sense.''
 But the president of the Municipal Council, Mariano Vega Jr., said that Goldman Sachs had done a lot for Jersey City since it opened its first tower about four years ago. Aside from the jobs and tax revenues, he said, the company has contributed to programs for affordable housing, recreation and education. And he said that Jersey City needed to provide incentives for companies if it wanted to compete with Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and other locations.
 The Council ultimately voted 6 to 1 in favor of the deal.
 Viola Richardson, the sole council member to oppose it, said that she was not against Goldman Sachs, but that it was no longer necessary to provide incentives to get companies to move to the waterfront. 
 Goldman Sachs has long been a downtown stalwart. In 1999, the company bought three development sites at the former Colgate toothpaste factory in Jersey City. Five years later, it built 30 Hudson, at 42 stories the tallest building in the state, after bargaining for tax breaks worth more than $160 million. 
 Goldman Sachs initially planned to move equity sales and trading operations to the tower from Manhattan. But executives rebelled against the plan, and the company has been slow to fill the tower, which cost $1.3 billion to build. 
 A short time later, Goldman announced plans to build a 42-story headquarters on a site in Battery Park City, which would have a view of its Jersey City operations. 
 Grateful for the commitment downtown after the attack on the World Trade Center, state and city officials offered the company $1 billion in tax-free bonds and about $30 million in tax breaks.
 But after snags in the negotiations, state and city officials enhanced their offer by providing $1.65 billion in bonds and $140 million in tax breaks and cash, as well as a sharp reduction, worth an estimated $9 million a year, in Goldman's payments in lieu of taxes.

HEADLINE: Gaza's Economy, Already Fragile, May Collapse Unless Crossings Are Reopened, U.N. Reports

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Gaza, and Isabel Kershner from Ramallah.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 18 

 BODY:
s already weak economy could collapse unless its main commercial crossing with Israel is reopened, Gaza businessmen and United Nations officials warned on Wednesday.
 The Karni crossing has been shut since June 12 because the Palestinians who operated it were affiliated with Fatah and fled after Hamas took over Gaza in bloody fighting. But both Israel and the Fatah leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, have been in no hurry to help Hamas by working to regularize Gaza's economic life.
 Karen AbuZayd, commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which deals with Palestinian refugees, said in an interview, ''Without Karni the Gaza economy will collapse unless it is opened for exports and not just for imports, so we don't punish this whole people.'' 
 Her agency is pressing both in Ramallah, Mr. Abbas's headquarters in the West Bank, and in Israel to reopen the crossing, she said. The agency is already providing food aid to 825,000 refugees in Gaza, while the World Food Program, another United Nations agency, is feeding an additional 250,000 people who are not refugees, she said.
 ''Further aid dependency is what we're worried about'' among the population of 1.4 million to 1.5 million, said Ms. AbuZayd, an American. 
 Her Gaza director, John Ging, said, ''If present closures continue, we anticipate that Gaza will become nearly a totally aid-dependent society, a society robbed of the possibility of self-sufficiency and the dignity of work.'' 
 While Israel is processing needed imports of food, fuel and medicine, the smaller crossings that are open require that containers be unloaded on one side of the border and reloaded on the other, adding $300 a ton to costs and restricting the flow.
 Some commercial goods for grocery stores are being imported through deals between Israeli suppliers and Gazan merchants. But imports of building materials like concrete for construction and raw materials for factories have been held up, throwing Gazans out of work.
 More than 68,000 workers have lost their jobs since mid-June, more than 80 percent of the private sector employment, said Nasser al-Hilou, a prominent Gazan businessman. The refugee agency halted $93 million worth of construction projects for lack of building materials, and put workers on leave.
 And even if factories can produce, they cannot export. Gaza is full of vegetables and flowers grown for export markets that are being sold cheaply or are rotting.
 ''There is no starvation in Gaza, but there is no prosperity or life in Gaza either,'' Mr. Hilou said. ''Gaza needs trade, not aid.''
 Mr. Ging appealed to the so-called quartet of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, which work for Middle East peace and plan to meet on Thursday in Portugal to help open Karni. 
 If Gaza's private sector goes bankrupt, he said, his agency will be unable to meet the demand.
 In security terms, bringing items into Gaza is not a big problem for Israel. Exports are a different matter. Without Karni, with its sophisticated scanners, every item would have to be gone over carefully, if not by hand then with smaller scanners, to ensure that no explosives or weapons are being smuggled.
 Having no Palestinians on the Gaza side of Karni whom Israel trusts has so far been an insurmountable problem for exports. Israel refuses to have any relationship with Hamas. Hamas has offered to bring Fatah back to Karni or to hire a Turkish company to operate the Palestinian side, but Israel says the Palestinians must resolve that issue.
 For now political considerations seem most important, with Mr. Abbas trying to consolidate the West Bank with the help of Israel and the United States. Asked if Israel and Egypt were keeping Karni and the Rafah crossing from Egypt shut in part because Mr. Abbas asked them to, Miri Eisin, the spokeswoman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel, said: ''Our clear-cut policy is to do it in coordination with President Abbas. We're not doing anything Abbas opposes, and we've opposed nothing he's asked us to do. We both agree on the complete sidelining of Hamas.'' In Ramallah, meeting with the European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, Mr. Abbas suggested on Wednesday that he was considering calling for early presidential and legislative elections through the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Council. Mr. Abbas has called a rare meeting of the group for Wednesday evening and Thursday as a replacement for the elected legislature. Under the Palestinian basic law, only the legislature can mandate early elections.
 It is hard to imagine how Mr. Abbas could hold an election without the agreement of Hamas, which controls Gaza and could also disrupt voting in the West Bank.
 Qadura Fares, a politician close to the jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, said that Mr. Abbas was describing ''an idea.'' He added: ''It's a decision, but it doesn't mean the decision will be implemented. Any election has to be agreed upon by Hamas.''
 If Hamas feels further isolated in a declining, impoverished Gaza, the thinking goes, it may be more willing to allow new elections, so long as Mr. Abbas also puts the presidency at stake.
 In Israel, the comptroller-general issued a stinging report, charging that Mr. Olmert and the army had failed to protect the civilian population during last summer's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. More than 40 Israeli civilians died in Hezbollah rocket attacks. The country's leadership, the report said, ''failed severely in the decision-making process, preparedness and implementation of their treatment and care of the civilian population.''
 Mr. Olmert responded, ''It is impossible to promise complete protection to every citizen'' in a war of rockets and missiles.
 He and his government are already unpopular because of the war but got what may be another reprieve on Wednesday when the Winograd commission, looking into the larger question of war management, said it might postpone its final report to allow people to respond first to accusations made against them.

HEADLINE: For a Condo Hotel, Try South Beach Bend

BYLINE: By CHARLES PASSY

 BODY:
IN the last few years, condo hotels have emerged as a tempting choice for vacation-home buyers. The opportunity is hard to resist: when you're not lounging in your plush suite, enjoying all the amenities of a hotel, you can put it in a rental pool and share in the proceeds. And you may also see your property appreciate sharply over time.
 But if that promise hasn't quite lived up to recent expectations in some established condo-hotel locales -- most notably Florida, where the market has faltered -- it has found new life elsewhere. 
 When Jerry McKenna, a sculptor from Boerne, Tex., decided to buy into the condo-hotel concept, he wasn't thinking South Beach. He was thinking South Bend. 
 A proud Notre Dame alumnus and regular football game attendee, Mr. McKenna was looking for an alternative to paying for hotel rooms, which can run as high as $500 a night with a three-night minimum on game weekends, or buying a house near the campus and worrying about the upkeep. When he learned about the Waterford Estates Lodge, a 200-unit condo hotel being fashioned from a former Ramada Inn a few minutes north of the campus, he thought it would be a good fit. It offered all the amenities a hotel guest and Notre Dame booster would ever want, including an Irish pub, without the household chores associated with second-home ownership.
 ''I came back to Texas and described it to my wife, and she said, 'We ought to look into that,' '' Mr. McKenna recalled, noting that the price was right: $129,000 for an extra-large studio, plus maintenance fees and taxes just above $300 a month. And that does not factor in the possible financial return. ''The fact there was some income to be derived when we weren't there was a pretty good incentive,'' Mr. McKenna added. 
 HIS story is hardly an isolated example. Other second- or even third-tier destinations are playing an increasingly important role for condo-hotel developers. Some are niche locales that aim for buyers with particular interests, like attending college football games or playing slots in a waterfront-area casino (a condo hotel is planned for Biloxi, Miss.). Others are family-oriented drive-to vacation areas, like the Wisconsin Dells, northwestern New Jersey, Pigeon Forge, Tenn., or Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 And still others are not really second tier, but they do not fit the fun-in-the-sun profile of earlier condo-hotel markets. New York, for example, is now home to many condo-hotel projects, including the Plaza Hotel's new Pied-a-Terre residences, where units can go as high as $5 million. 
 In many ways, this second wave of condo hotels is simply catching up with the first markets, industry experts say. 
 South Florida was a natural place for the boom to start. The area has always been politically friendly to developers, and until recently, it has proved a gold mine for real-estate speculators. 
 But demand has fallen there and in other more established condo-hotel markets, like Orlando and Las Vegas. In those locales, where prices for prime units can easily top $1 million, several projects have been scrapped and sales have stalled at others. For example, Robert Falor, a condo-hotel developer, has seen one of his biggest South Florida projects, the combined Breakwater and Edison hotels in Miami Beach, go into bankruptcy in the last year.
 Combine that market slump with concerns about possible lawsuits in established markets from dissatisfied condo-hotel owners, who have not seen the occupancy rates nor the appreciation they anticipated, and it raises the question of whether this is the right sort of real estate to consider in second-tier cities.
 Buyers cannot expect the same annual occupancy or average nightly rental rates in South Bend (where the numbers respectively equate to 53 percent and $83, according to Waterford's developer, Mike Brenan) as in South Beach or Miami Beach overall (71.5 percent and $213.96, according to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau).
 ''Once you're in a highly seasonal area with few heavy-in-demand dates, there's more risk to the project,'' said Patrick Ford, president of Lodging Econometrics, a Portsmouth, N.H., lodging real-estate consultant. 
 Still, there ''is pent-up demand for product'' in areas that have long lacked this sort of vacation-home option, said Dante Alexander, president of the National Association of Condo Hotel Owners, a nonprofit trade association based in Scottsdale, Ariz.
 Jay Gustafson, a Minneapolis computer-network engineer, has already had handsome returns on condo-hotel units he has owned in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and he has similar expectations for the one he recently purchased in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. In his best example, Mr. Gustafson was able to make a profit of nearly $150,000 on a three-bedroom suite he purchased for $370,000 at the Kalahari Resort in the Wisconsin Dells and sold a couple of year later. Plus, in the intervening period, he remained in the black month after month, with his share of the rental receipts more than offsetting his expenses -- mortgage, maintenance and taxes. (Typically, the developer or a management company splits nightly revenue from a condo down the middle with the unit owner.)
 In addition, on periodic visits, he, his wife and their four children enjoyed the resort's amenities, including water-park rides, golf outings and spa treatments. ''It was kind of hard selling it,'' Mr. Gustafson said.
 Now, the family is looking forward to a trip to Pigeon Forge: Mr. Gustafson has bought a three-bedroom unit for around $300,000 at the Water Resort, a soon-to-open condo hotel connected to an indoor water park. The purchase was primarily as an investment, he said. Other buyers say that although Pigeon Forge is not the sexiest of destinations, the Dollywood theme park, other attractions and Great Smoky Mountains National Park make it a natural draw for families. ''The visitors you get here are a little different than what you might have at South Beach,'' said Bobby Stogner, a Knoxville banking executive who also purchased a unit at the Water Resort.
 Still, the idea of buying a condo hotel strictly for turning a profit, whether in the short term from rentals or the long term from resale, does not sit well with many who follow the industry. For starters, condo hotels are prohibited by federal regulations from marketing themselves as investments unless they are registered as such. And they offer no guarantees regarding resale value or rental income.
 IF you don't want to spend any time at the unit, I have to believe there are other places to put your money,'' said Irvin Sandman, chairman of the hospitality practice of the Seattle law firm Graham & Dunn.
 In Florida, some buyers were eager to sign on mainly as get-rich-quick investors, leading to an oversupply of units. Lodging Econometrics reports that in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale area, there are 17 condo hotels being developed; in Orlando, there are 14. (Overall, Lodging Econometrics reports that there are 166 condo hotels in the pipeline throughout the country.)
 Joel Greene, president of Condo Hotel Center, a Miami brokerage, said that his sales were down by 30 percent to 40 percent in the last year. But he said he was optimistic about the second-tier markets -- not just in the United States, but also in places like Dubai and the Dominican Republic. 
 He and others in the industry say they are also convinced that the right kind of condo hotel in an oversupplied market can still sell. At the Residences at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, for instance, all but 50 of the project's 1,727 units, priced from around $500,000 to $2.5 million, have sold. Buyers say they like the fact that the property is right on the Strip. ''Proximity is the No. 1 thing,'' said Cary Porter, a San Francisco-area real estate agent who purchased two units.
 Conversely, at the Waterford Estates Lodge in South Bend, there is no promise of glamour. But because of the its particular appeal to Notre Dame fans, it has sold reasonably well, too. After a couple of years on the market, 60 percent of the 200 units, priced between $99,000 and $140,000, have been bought. Mr. Brenan, the developer, says he hopes the remaining ones will be gone by the end of the football season. 
 He is already shifting his focus to developing condo hotels in other college football towns: Gainesville, Fla. (University of Florida), Ann Arbor, Mich. (University of Michigan) and Lansing, Mich. (Michigan State). 
 ''It's somewhat an emotional purchase,'' he said. ''It gives these alums a place to call their own.'' 
 Or, in the case of Jerry McKenna, the Notre Dame fan, it may give his five children a place to call their own. He said he had already willed his hotel suite to them -- with one provision: they can't sell it for at least 20 years after his passing. It's his way of guaranteeing that the cheering will never end. ''They're all big Fighting Irish fans anyhow,'' he said.

 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROKEN ENGLISH' (PG-13, 93 minutes) This low-key comedy, about a romance-scarred professional woman named Nora Wilder (Parker Posey) who invigorates her life with help from a handsome, sensitive, fedora-clad Frenchman (Melvil Poupaud), is a textbook example of an Indiewood film: a Hollywood fantasy wrapped in plain brown paper. Written and directed by the first-time feature filmmaker Zoe Cassavetes, daughter of the pioneering independent director John Cassavetes, ''Broken English'' seems blithely unaware of the bait-and-switch that it will ultimately pull. 
 (Matt Zoller Seitz) 
 'CAPTIVITY' (R, 98 minutes) This latest example of torture as entertainment uses the abduction and abuse of a vain supermodel (Elisha Cuthbert) to remind us that attractive women need to be kept in their place. Arriving in theaters front-loaded with a controversial billboard campaign (depicting the ''Abduction,'' ''Confinement,'' ''Torture'' and ''Termination'' of its star), as well as a rare censure from the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by its marketing. Yet despite the controversy, this dreary game of punish-the-tease is no more than a desperate attempt to cling to the buzz of ''Saw'' before fans are distracted by the next shiny power tool. 
 (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'DRAMA/MEX' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Amid all the sweaty sex, shouting and cynicism, this Mexican drama seems to be trying to say something about its country of origin, though it's hard to know exactly what. (Dargis) 'EVAN ALMIGHTY' (PG, 89 minutes) Your average Sunday school lesson about Noah and the flood is likely to be funnier, smarter and more theologically coherent -- to say nothing of cheaper to produce -- than this drab, timid attempt to wring laughs from religion. (A. O. Scott)
 'FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER' (PG, 95 minutes) The only thing that rises in this stinker are low expectations. (Dargis)
 '1408' (PG-13, 94 minutes) In this stylish but derivative adaptation of a Stephen King short story, John Cusack plays a writer investigating a series of grisly deaths in Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan. Mikael Hafstrom directs with old-fashioned restraint and a stylish use of intense close-ups, and while the Dolphin is no Overlook (the hotel in ''The Shining''), its old-world creepiness is exactly right. (Catsoulis)
 'GHOSTS OF CITE SOLEIL' (No rating, 85 minutes, in English, Haitian and French) In making this intimate documentary about street fighters in Haiti at a time of political turmoil, Asger Leth had remarkable access, but in the end he relies more on attitude than on insight. (Scott) 
 HAIRSPRAY (PG, 107 minutes) It's no surprise that this musical -- adapted from the Broadway show that was adapted from the John Waters movie -- is goodhearted. It's about fighting prejudice by singing and dancing. The surprise is that it's actually good, including the singing and dancing. (Scott)
 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX' (PG-13, 138 minutes) The fifth installment in the series brings the young wizard into political-thriller territory, and also into a struggle with his own anger and isolation. Imelda Staunton joins the impressive roster of great British actors who have taught Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. (Scott) 
 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis) 'INTERVIEW' (R, 83 minutes) Diverting if dishonest cat and mouse, with Steve Buscemi (who also directed) as a self-serious journalist who says he doesn't really want to interview Sienna Miller's tabloid celebrity. (Dargis) 
 'INTRODUCING THE DWIGHTS' (R, 104 minutes) You don't really want to meet them -- at least not the mother, a needy stand-up comedian egregiously overracted by Brenda Blethyn. Her sons are sweet enough, though, and one of them has a charming girlfriend. (Scott)
 'JOSHUA' (R, 105 minutes) Poised self-consciously between art and entertainment, ''Joshua'' is an effective family drama cloaked in the stale tropes of the demon-seed thriller. When a new baby enters the lives of a wealthy Manhattan couple (Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga), their 9-year-old son, Joshua (Jacob Kogan), a musical prodigy with an unhealthy interest in embalming, becomes even more weird. Buffing this tacky premise to an industrial-strength gloss, the director, George Ratliff (who also wrote the script with David Gilbert), taps into something dark and guilty in being a parent, but it's Mr. Rockwell's spectacular turn as the harried paterfamilias that simultaneously binds the film and pushes its boundaries. The story might get away from him, but his grip on the character never falters. (Catsoulis)
 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott)
 LIVE-IN MAID (No rating, 83 minutes, in Spanish) This small, perfect film from Argentina follows two women -- an upper-class dowager (Norma Aleandro) and her housekeeper (Norma Argentina) -- whose relationship is altered, for good and for ill, by economic distress. (Scott)
 'A MIGHTY HEART' (R, 108 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's jolting film about the failed search for the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is a surprising, insistently political work of commercial art. As Mariane Pearl, Angelina Jolie stars without stealing the show. (Dargis)
 'MY BEST FRIEND' (PG-13, 95 minutes, in French) This sentimental comic fable about Francois, a middle-aged antiques dealer (Daniel Auteuil) in search of true friendship is sustained by the director Patrice Leconte's eye for detail and his cast's discipline and intelligence. Dany Boon is Bruno, the gregarious taxi driver and trivia buff who seems to be the man of Francois's dreams. (Scott) 
 'OCEAN'S THIRTEEN' (PG-13, 113 minutes) The gang's all here, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure. Steven Soderbergh shoots and directs, while George, Brad and the rest hustle and flow. (Dargis) 
 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 
 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'RATATOUILLE' (G, 110 minutes) A flawless work of popular art from Brad Bird and Pixar. A portrait of the artist as a young rat with haute cuisine dreams. (Scott) 
 'RESCUE DAWN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) The writer and director Werner Herzog (''Aguirre: The Wrath of God'') has remade his 1997 documentary, ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly,'' as a bruising P.O.W. escape picture. Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, an assimilated German-American Navy pilot who is shot down over Laos during his first Vietnam War mission, and survives torture and starvation in a prison camp before plotting a daring escape. The movie showcases Mr. Herzog's eye for terrifyingly beautiful landscapes, and a rare understanding of the deep platonic love that blossoms between men in dire circumstances. (Seitz) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 
 'SICKO' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Michael Moore's polemic against American health care -- and, more pointedly, in favor of a state-supported system -- is maddening, moving and funny. An excellent spur to further debate. (Scott)
 'SURF'S UP' (PG, 90 minutes) Treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's ''Happy Feet'' comes this ho-hum computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards. As a young Rockhopper penguin (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) heads for his first professional surfing competition, he learns about love, perseverance and that winning isn't everything. Though infused with a friendly blue-collar vibe, the movie suggests that a moratorium on penguins might be called for. (Catsoulis) 
 'TALK TO ME' (R, 118 minutes) The life of Petey Greene, a real-life Washington radio host, inspired this rousing, raucous movie, which rises above biopic conventions, thanks to two first-rate performances: Don Cheadle as Greene and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Dewey Hughes, the uptight station manager who was Greene's partner and friend (Scott) 
 'TIME' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Korean) Stephen Sondheim once said that melodrama and farce were his two favorite forms of theater because ''they are obverse sides of the same coin.'' Kim Ki-Duk, the Korean writer and director, has minted a cinematic example of that coin with ''Time,'' a tale of big-city 20-somethings and the masks they wear (both figurative and literal -- the plot revolves around elective plastic surgery, some of which is shown in gory close-up). Mr. Kim flips between soapy melodrama and dry, self-aware comedy. The effect is thrilling and disorienting, like walking on a trampoline. (Seitz) 'TRANSFORMERS' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Based on the popular children's toy, Michael Bay's bumper-to-bumper pileup of big cars, big guns and big breasts is part car commercial, part military recruitment ad. (Dargis) 
 'YOU KILL ME' (R, 92 minutes) With its shadows and gallows humor ''You Kill Me'' goes about as dark as a comedy can go before turning into tragedy or self-parody. John Dahl directs, and Ben Kingsley stars with a bullet. (Dargis)
 Film Series
 SIGNORE & SIGNORE: LEADING LADIES OF ITALIAN CINEMA (Tonight through Sunday) Continuing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, this series is devoted to the great and glorious female performers of the Italian cinema. This weekend: the beloved Neapolitan character actress Tina Pica stars as a controlling grandmother in Dino Risi's 1957 film ''La Nonna Sabella'' (Friday); Sophia Loren dresses down and wins the Oscar she deserved for Vittorio De Sica's 1960 wartime drama, ''Two Women'' (Saturday); and Claudia Cardinale portrays a lower-class beauty who moves in on a wealthy provincial family in Valerio Zurlini's magnificent 1960 film ''The Girl with the Suitcase'' (Sunday). BAM Cinematek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Dave Kehr) 
 IT'S ONLY A MOVIE: HORROR FILMS FROM THE 1970S AND TODAY (Tomorrow and Sunday) A two-month retrospective, devoted to comparing and contrasting the politically motivated horror movies of the '70s with the more visceral version of the genre in wide use today comes to an appropriate finale this weekend at the Museum of the Moving Image with a sensitive blend of old and new. Tomorrow the offerings are Brian DePalma's 1976 ''Carrie'' (in an archival 35-millimeter print), James Wong's blackly comic 2006 ''Final Destination 3'' and John Carpenter's paradigm-shifting 1978 ''Halloween.'' On Sunday the Cornell film professor Amy Villarejo will lead a discussion of gender and sexuality in the horror film between a screening of ''The Last House on the Left,''Wes Craven's 1972 grindhouse remake of Ingmar Bergman's ''Virgin Spring,'' and Neil Marshall's recent quasi-feminist shocker, ''The Descent.'' Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr)

 ANGEL OF DEATH (Tonight) If the name suggests a hardcore band rather than a jazz trio, relax; that's precisely what they want you to think. In fact, the group dynamic of the multireedist Andrew D'Angelo, the keyboardist Jamie Saft and the drummer Mike Pride is informed by post-bop protocols and rooted in improvisation. At 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen)
 DAVID BUDWAY TRIO (Wednesday) David Budway may be better known in some circles as a singer-songwriter than as a jazz pianist. But he's a formidable player, as he'll prove here with the rhythm team of John Benitez on bass and Antonio Sanchez on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., Cachaca, 35 West Eighth Street, near MacDougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 388-9099, cachacajazz.com; cover, $10, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
 BENEFIT FOR JEWLIA EISENBERG (Sunday) Jewlia Eisenberg, the leader of a smartly subversive band called Charming Hostess, recently suffered injuries from a bicycle accident; this avant-garde all-star affair is meant to offset her medical costs. The lineup will include the alto saxophonist John Zorn, the harpist Shelley Burgon, the cellist Okkyung Lee and assorted others. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; suggested donation, $20. (Chinen)
 JOHN ELLIS BAND (Tonight) John Ellis is a saxophonist drawn to loose-limbed funk, but he also has an interest in spacious modern jazz. His band here features a guitarist with similar inclinations, the versatile and thoughtful Mike Moreno.

 ROBERT GLASPER TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) As a pianist and front man, Robert Glasper exudes a jittery sort of charisma; as a composer and bandleader, he's disarmingly self-possessed. His trio with the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Chris Dave specializes in a headlong propulsion that has as much to do with present-day hip-hop as with 1960s-vintage post-bop. (Through July 29.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

 LAGE LUND 5 (Tonight) The guitarist Lage Lund favors a sleek and streamlined dynamic, but he doesn't shy away from grit. This group, with the tenor saxophonist David Sanchez, the pianist Frank LoCrasto, the bassist Orlando Le Fleming and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, seems likely to challenge as well as support him. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15. (Chinen)

 TED POOR AND BAD TOUCH (Monday) Mr. Poor is a sharp young drummer who has had the effect, in recent months, of galvanizing any group in which he plays. He takes a leadership role here, with some accomplished peers: the saxophonists Chris Speed and Loren Stillman and the bassist Todd Sickafoose. At 8 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)
 FLORA PURIM AND AIRTO (Tuesday through Thursday) Flora Purim, a lilting singer, and Airto Moreira, an incantatory percussionist, are the First Couple of Brazilian jazz; here they enjoy the accompaniment of Marcos Silva on piano, Gary Brown on bass and Grecco Buratto on guitar. (Through July 29.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. 
 (Chinen)
 JALEEL SHAW TRIO (Tuesday) The alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw has a progressive take on bebop, and a way of assembling bruising rhythm sections like this one, with Matt Brewer on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Louis 649, 649 East Ninth Street, at Avenue C, East Village, (212) 673-1190, louis649.com; no cover. (Chinen)
 MATT SHULMAN TRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) On ''So It Goes'' (Jaggo), his second album, Matt Shulman further polishes a trumpet-and-vocals package vaguely suggestive of a postmillennial Chet Baker. But the most impressive thing about him is his genuine engagement with supporting players like the bassist Matt Clohesy and the drummer Jason Wildman. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)
 ERNESTO SIMPSON (Monday) Mr. Simpson's drumming has lately been a vital and renewable resource in Latin-jazz circles; his cosmopolitan trio includes a fellow Cuban, the pianist Manuel Valera, as well as a Cameroonian, the bassist Richard Bona. At 9 and 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., Cachaca, 35 West Eighth Street, near MacDougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 388-9099, cachacajazz.com; cover, $10, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
 TYSHAWN SOREY NEW QUINTET (Tuesday) Tyshawn Sorey plays the drums with an almost brutish physicality, but also with an impressive sense of scale and equipoise. And he has lately been producing serious results as a composer, a side of his personality that figures prominently here. At 9:15 and 10:40 p.m. and midnight, Puppets Jazz Bar, 294 Fifth Avenue, near Second Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 499-2627, puppetsjazz.com; cover, $5. (Chinen) LOREN STILLMAN QUARTET (Sunday) Loren Stillman, an alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz conventions, leads a quartet with the guitarist Nate Radley, the bassist Dave Ambrosio and the drummer Ted Poor. At 9 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, myspace.com/konceptionsatbar4; cover, $5 suggested donation. (Chinen)
 KEVIN TKACZ'S SPECIAL NEEDS (Tonight) The bassist Kevin Tkacz features his own compositions in this trio with the trumpeter Shane Endsley and the drummer Gerald Cleaver, both justifiably busy figures on the left-of-center New York scene. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, near Third Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $10; $8 for students. (Chinen)
 CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Wednesday and Thursday) Last year the trumpeter Charles Tolliver released a solid Blue Note album featuring this band, an upgraded edition of his hard-driving orchestra of the 1970s. It appears here in the middle of an extensive tour, which means that the parts should be road-tested and precision-honed. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
 STEVE TURRE QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Steve Turre, the peerlessly proficient trombonist and conch shell player, brings both virtuosity and restraint to the conventions of small-group hard bop. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $28. (Chinen)
 TWICE TOLD TALES (Tonight) This expressive and experimental quartet, conversing mainly in terms of free improvisation, consists of the tenor saxophonists Tony Malaby and Louis Belogenis, the bassist Trevor Dunn and the drummer Harris Eisenstadt. At 8, Seaport District Cultural Association Performance Space, Front Street at Beekman Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 393-9191, seaportdistrict.org; $10. (Chinen)MICHAEL WEISS TRIO (Thursday) The pianist Michael Weiss, an accomplished sideman and more than capable bandleader, convenes a solid trio with the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Bryson Kern. At 8 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing near the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students. (Chinen)

HEADLINE: China's Growth Accelerates to 11.9%, and Food Prices Spur Inflation

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 19 

 BODY:
China said Thursday that its economy grew 11.9 percent at an annual pace in the second quarter, the fastest pace in more than a decade, and that inflation rose sharply last month, stoking fears that the nation's economy was overheating.
 The quarter's explosive growth, compared with the period a year earlier, was fueled by a huge trade surplus, booming retail sales and heavy investments in new factories, roads, bridges and real estate projects. 
 Analysts say that the authorities in Beijing are under mounting pressure to curb the trade surplus and ease pressure on the economy by increasing interest rates or allowing the currency, the yuan, to further appreciate against other currencies.
 ''They do need to tighten, but the question is how,'' said Frank F. X. Gong, chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''Aggressively hiking interest rates is not the answer.''
 The government's economic statistics continued to startle analysts, who are frequently required to revise their growth estimates in a country where all major cities seem to be in the midst of building booms.
 For the first half of the year, China said its economy grew at a pace of 11.5 percent, far outpacing analysts' and government projections after two years of double-digit growth. The government had forecast that the economy would grow about 8 percent this year and had promised moves that would help ease the country's widening trade surplus.
 But economic growth is stronger than ever, and the trade surplus surpassed $112 billion in the first half of 2007, up about 85 percent from the period a year earlier.
 In Washington, members of Congress are trying to put greater pressure on China to revalue its currency and import more American goods to reduce the two countries' trade gap.
 China has been reluctant to move too quickly to lift the value of the currency, fearing the effect on businesses, and the government has not succeeded in reducing its trade surplus, particularly with the United States.
 Another concern was underlined Thursday when Beijing announced that inflation had reached its highest level in years. Consumer prices jumped at a 4.4 percent rate in June, almost entirely from rising food prices.
 The prices of eggs and pork have increased more than 20 percent in the last year, largely because of tighter grain supplies and the outbreak of a swine ailment called blue-ear pig disease, the government said. The disease is also known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. 
 Many analysts say that inflationary pressure may be even greater when measured by a broader range of goods, and that this could signal real problems for the country, particularly if food prices continue to rise.
 ''This is not benign,'' said Hong Liang, an economist at Goldman Sachs. ''In a developing country, this gets back to wages very quickly.''
 The problem remains how to tame China's growth, a boom that began at less steep rates 20 years ago.
 No major economy in the last century has grown at the pace now under way in China. The 11.9 percent growth in the second quarter was the fastest since 1995, when China said its output increased 12.5 percent. China is on pace to overtake Germany this year as the world's third-largest economy, behind the United States and Japan.
 ''Even if we are very bullish on China,'' Ms. Hong at Goldman Sachs said, ''if they grow above 10 percent, there's going to be a problem.''
 The government has tried dozens of measures in the last few years, including interest rate increases to slow the economy, moderate export growth and tame a wild stock market. But most have either failed or succeeded only moderately.
 Mr. Gong at JPMorgan said China was already signaling that it would allow the yuan to appreciate more quickly in the second half. He said China should import more agricultural products from the United States, which could help ease the trade deficit and also help slow rising food prices.
 Ms. Hong, however, expressed worries about an economy growing at an ever-faster pace when measured month to month. ''The government needs to tighten policy and slow the economy,'' she said. ''Hopefully they can find some new tricks.''

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cezanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) 
 (Grace Glueck)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter) THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met's esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father, an architect, and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine hold a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art -- which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. At 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org.
 (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org.
 (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS, ' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ,' through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging, and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (See above.) 
 (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Uptown
 'MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR' Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ash Can realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery's consistent desire to, as he once said, ''eliminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.'' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: SoHo
 JIM ISERMANN: 'VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007' This exhibition sets out to be a mini-retrospective of Jim Isermann's vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer's showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Aug. 4. (Goodbody)
 'NEW ECONOMY' This has been a busy year for Joao Ribas, who became a curator at the Drawing Center and now has organized ''New Economy,'' a show that looks at art practices in the global information economy. As you might expect, the Internet is addressed, but old-economy titans like Karl Marx and Adam Smith get some play too. Over all, however, the show's premise feels somewhat dated. Mr. Ribas also has a weakness for the kind of critical-theory jargon that peaked a decade or two ago, quoting Peter Drucker's 1994 book, ''Post-Capitalist Society,'' and following that up with a description of the ''postindustrial economic order'' as a ''knowledge-driven form of post-Fordist capitalism.'' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org, through July 28. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 COLBY BIRD AND JOSHUA FIELDS This two-person exhibition manages to look both like a one-person show and a group show. The works are disparate, rough around the edges and tilted a little too steeply toward the boys-will-be-boys end of the spectrum. Mr. Bird's sculptures include a refrigerator precariously packed with malt liquor; a kind of maw made of fluorescent lights and ceiling tile; and tumbleweed fenced inside a real barbed-wire fence. Mr. Fields focuses on Kurt Cobain's suicide note; Chris Farley's birth and death certificates; various feats of urination; and, in the best work here, a fictional album titled ''Suicidal Tendencies.'' Two copies of it rotate on turntables on opposite sides of the gallery, making only scratching sounds and no discernible progress. There's plenty of serious intent, ingenuity and talent here, but the ideas are mostly received. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com, through next Friday. (Smith)
 'CONCRETE WORKS' What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the pieces create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie's gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty's photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a ''discussion'' of Pollock's drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through next Friday. (Schwendener)
 SARAH PETERS In an impressive first show, this artist revisits several pictorial conventions of colonial America -- the portrait, the mourning picture and the landscape -- with antic results. Her weapon of choice is black ballpoint pen backed by pencil, deployed in a fidgety yet gossamer cross-hatch style whose precedents include Edward Gorey and the early work of Jim Nutt and Sue Williams. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 643-3152, through next Friday. (Smith)
 ROLE EXCHANGE This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy's fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith) STRANGE MAGIC The camera-based art of Liz Deschenes, Anne Collier, Amy Granat, Eileen Quinlan and Sara VanDerBeek has found that there are all sorts of new tricks to be conjured inside the triangle defined by the 1980s practices of photo appropriation, rephotography and set-up photography. That all the artists are women harks back to the breakthroughs of the late 1970s, when numerous women used the camera to reimagine Conceptual Art. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through July 28. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN CREED: FEELINGS Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of bean-bag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an anti-gravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS BILDER' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ... If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: 'ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) 
 Last Chance
 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semigeometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)
 'UTOPIA IN NEW YORK' A tasty summer sampler of paintings at the Robert Steele Gallery in Chelsea by a dozen artists from Utopia, an Aboriginal-owned desert reservation the size of Rhode Island. The show includes such well-known figures as Gloria Petyarre, Barbara Weir and Minnie Pwerle. Most depict traditional motifs and designs for native flowers and vegetation, like the root pattern of a yam, a staple food, but others are more abstract and bear a visual resemblance to international art movements like Optical Art and 1970s painterly abstraction. But what gets you most about these paintings is the color, radiant and intense. Robert Steele Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 243-0165, robertsteelegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)

HEADLINE: Earnings Decline at McClatchy and Dow Jones

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
AS newspapers suffer from falling advertising revenue, the McClatchy Company and Dow Jones & Company yesterday became the latest companies in the industry to report sharply lower second-quarter earnings.
 McClatchy reported earnings of $39.9 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $44.1 million, or 94 cents, in the quarter a year earlier, when it was a much smaller company. The company more than doubled in size last year with the acquisition of Knight Ridder, whose papers have performed worse this year than those McClatchy held a year ago.
 Total second-quarter revenue was $580 million, up from $212 million. 
 The company has a large presence in California and Florida, with The Sacramento Bee and The Miami Herald, where the real estate market has slumped badly. That caused a 19 percent drop from last year in revenue from real estate ads, and steep declines from related businesses like home improvement and furniture.
 ''We expect declines in this revenue category to continue because of the difficult comparisons'' to a strong 2006, Gary B. Pruitt, McClatchy's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. ''We expect no substantial improvement in advertising trends before the fourth quarter.''
 Analysts have warned that newspapers appear to be going through a fundamental change, with advertising shrinking fast despite a growing economy, as readers and advertisers migrate to the Web. 
 Shares of McClatchy rose 13 cents, to $26.41.
 Dow Jones reported earnings just over $21 million, or 25 cents a share, down 26.8 percent from $28.8 million, or 34 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. That figure included two extraordinary items: a charge for stock-related compensation expenses because of the News Corporation takeover offer and another for the reorganization of the consumer media unit. 
 Excluding those items, the company's earnings were 45 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations. 
 Shares of Dow Jones closed down 25 cents yesterday at $55.40. 
 Total revenue rose to $529.7 million, from $456 million on stronger income from circulation, especially from online subscriptions. 
 But ad revenue at Dow Jones was down 2.8 percent, and looking ahead, Richard F. Zannino, the chief executive, told analysts yesterday, ''July will be soft.'' 
 The Wall Street Journal, which makes up a large part of the company, continued to be hit hard by falling business-to-business technology advertising. Print ad revenue at The Journal in the United States fell 6.8 percent for the quarter.
 ''Essentially the whole of the decrease came from three advertisers: Cisco, Apple and I.B.M.,'' said L. Gordon Crovitz, publisher of The Journal.
 Perhaps more worrisome was the ad picture at The Journal online, which had regularly experienced double-digit jumps in past quarters. This quarter, ad revenue rose just 2.7 percent.
 But some smaller Dow Jones properties are having a banner year, like Barron's, where ad revenue rose 26.3 percent, and The Journal's overseas editions, up 40.9 percent.
 The Journal added a Saturday paper in 2005, with the expectation that it would lose money in its first years. Yesterday, Mr. Zannino said the Saturday issue is ''tracking a little bit behind plan,'' but that he is pleased with how it has drawn consumer advertising.
 Despite significant cost-cutting, both Dow Jones and McClatchy have experienced shrinking profit margins, to the mid-single digits for the first half of the year. Mr. Pruitt said his company had cut expenses by almost $60 million for the quarter, or 12 percent, more than half of that from consolidation with Knight Ridder operations.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 21, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the quarterly earnings at the McClatchy Company and Dow Jones & Company misstated the context for a statement about declining advertising revenues from L. Gordon Crovitz, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The statement, ''Essentially the whole of the decrease came from three advertisers: Cisco, Apple and I.B.M.,'' refers only to the decline of online technology advertising at The Journal. It does not refer to advertising over all at the paper.

HEADLINE: Harley Profit Is Up 19% on Overseas Sales

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Harley-Davidson, the biggest United States motorcycle maker, said yesterday that second-quarter profit rose 19 percent on increased demand overseas for the company's cruiser models. The shares fell as domestic sales slid. 
 Net income climbed to $290.5 million, or $1.14 a share, topping analysts' estimates by 1 cent. Revenue gained 18 percent to $1.62 billion, the Milwaukee-based company said, while United States retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles dropped 5.5 percent.
 A sluggish economy, rising interest rates and declining property values in much of the United States cooled demand for the Harley cruisers, which can sell for as much as $35,000 when customized.
 James L. Ziemer, Harley's chief executive, said in a conference call that he was disappointed with the results. ''We're looking for improved retail sales in the second half,'' he said.
 Shares of Harley-Davidson fell $1.78, or 2.9 percent, to $59.37.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Hint at Toll From Housing Slump

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The economy could be in for a sluggish spell in coming months as the housing slump takes a toll on businesses and consumers.
 The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators, released yesterday, signaled economic weakness with a 0.3 percent decline in June, more than the 0.1 percent analysts were expecting. The index had risen 0.2 percent in May after dropping 0.2 percent in April. The report is intended to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months. 
 ''The leading index has slowed in recent months, suggesting a possible softening of the overall pace of economic activity later in the second half of this year,'' the Conference Board's labor economist, Ken Goldstein, said.
 The board's report tracks 10 economic indicators. The index was dragged down in June by a drop in building permits as well as by unemployment claims, consumer expectations, vendor performance and interest-rate spread.
 Positive contributors were weekly manufacturing hours, new orders for nonmilitary capital goods and stock prices. Manufacturers' orders for consumer goods and material, and the real money supply, held steady.
 Brian Bethune, an economist with Global Insight, said that while the report captured the weakness in the housing market, it failed to reflect the economy's bright spots. ''It's not picking up the strength of the global economy, the momentum of corporate profits driven by overseas sales and employment conditions,'' Mr. Bethune said. 
 That should offset some of the weakness in housing, he said. The Labor Department reported yesterday that initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in two months. Claims fell to 301,000, a decline of 8,000 from the previous week. The second straight weekly decline in jobless claims pushed the less volatile four-week moving average of claims down to 312,000 last week on a seasonally adjusted basis.
 The job market has been relatively steady despite an economic slowdown that pushed down overall growth to 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
 The index of leading economic indicators has bounced up and down in the last few months, with offsetting increases and decreases suggesting that economic growth was likely to continue, but at a slow pace in the near term.
 With the latest report, the cumulative change in the index over the last six months has been a 0.7 percent drop, the Conference Board said.

 'GLENN LIGON: UNAUTHORIZED' Famous for conceptual work that relishes and parodies racial stereotypes and cultural insensitivity, the gay African-American artist Glenn Ligon, 47, has not had a solo show in New York for four years. He returns, to the Bill Hodges Gallery, with a blistering assembly of works in various mediums from the last couple of decades, among them a pair of closely observed black-and-white screen prints on canvas of the back of his shaved head, above. They resemble studies in phrenology, a pseudoscience sometimes used to justify racism. There is also a nice selection of black-and-white text paintings, including ''Untitled (Crowd/The Fire Next Time)'' (2000), a photographic image of an African-American crowd at a demonstration on the Mall in Washington in 1995 overlaid with a silkscreen in glistening coal dust of an excerpt from ''The Fire Next Time'' by James Baldwin. The text reads: ''Something in me wondered, 'What will happen to all the beauty? 
,' '' in this context suggesting a gentle satire of protest rallies and the civil rights cause. Mr. Ligon's appetite for traversing racial stereotypes finds vivid expression in his narratives, etchings on handmade paper purporting to be the title page of testimonials on his intrepid life and adventures among white people in the art world. They make you laugh, but like all good socially or politically engaged art, the pieces also have the underappreciated virtue of momentarily letting the viewer see the world through someone else's eyes. (Through Aug. 25, Bill Hodges Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, 212-333-2640, billhodgesgallery.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling -- more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted one word and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cezanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)
 THE MET: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA, through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th-century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met's esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) 
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father, an architect, and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine hold a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art -- which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. At 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: 'PARADISE IN PRINT,' through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed ''green gold'') are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby's 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon's ''Birds of America''; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse's book ''Flora of America;'' and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin's extraordinary ''Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,'' published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS, ' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Smith)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ,' through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging, and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Uptown
 'MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR' Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ash Can realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery's consistent desire to, as he once said, ''eliminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.'' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 OK 7/13,20 'AUTOMATIC' Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, through July 28. (Smith)
 Galleries: SoHo
 JIM ISERMANN: 'VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007' This exhibition sets out to be a mini-retrospective of Jim Isermann's vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer's showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Aug. 4. (Goodbody)
 'NEW ECONOMY' This has been a busy year for Joao Ribas, who became a curator at the Drawing Center and now has organized ''New Economy,'' a show that looks at art practices in the global information economy. As you might expect, the Internet is addressed, but old-economy titans like Karl Marx and Adam Smith get some play too. Over all, however, the show's premise feels somewhat dated. Mr. Ribas also has a weakness for the kind of critical-theory jargon that peaked a decade or two ago, quoting Peter Drucker's 1994 book, ''Post-Capitalist Society,'' and following that up with a description of the ''postindustrial economic order'' as a ''knowledge-driven form of post-Fordist capitalism.'' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org, through July 28. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 COLBY BIRD AND JOSHUA FIELDS This two-person exhibition manages to look both like a one-person show and a group show. The works are disparate, rough around the edges and tilted a little too steeply toward the boys-will-be-boys end of the spectrum. Mr. Bird's sculptures include a refrigerator precariously packed with malt liquor; a kind of maw made of fluorescent lights and ceiling tile; and tumbleweed fenced inside a real barbed-wire fence. Mr. Fields focuses on Kurt Cobain's suicide note; Chris Farley's birth and death certificates; various feats of urination; and, in the best work here, a fictional album titled ''Suicidal Tendencies.'' Two copies of it rotate on turntables on opposite sides of the gallery, making only scratching sounds and no discernible progress. There's plenty of serious intent, ingenuity and talent here, but the ideas are mostly received. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com, through next Friday. (Smith)
 'CONCRETE WORKS' What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the pieces create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie's gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty's photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a ''discussion'' of Pollock's drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, through next Friday. (Schwendener)
 SARAH PETERS In an impressive first show, this artist revisits several pictorial conventions of colonial America -- the portrait, the mourning picture and the landscape -- with antic results. Her weapon of choice is black ballpoint pen backed by pencil, deployed in a fidgety yet gossamer cross-hatch style whose precedents include Edward Gorey and the early work of Jim Nutt and Sue Williams. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 643-3152, through next Friday. (Smith)
 ROLE EXCHANGE This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy's fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)
 STRANGE MAGIC The camera-based art of Liz Deschenes, Anne Collier, Amy Granat, Eileen Quinlan and Sara VanDerBeek has found that there are all sorts of new tricks to be conjured inside the triangle defined by the 1980s practices of photo appropriation, rephotography and set-up photography. That all the artists are women harks back to the breakthroughs of the late 1970s, when numerous women used the camera to reimagine Conceptual Art. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through July 28. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN CREED: FEELINGS Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of bean-bag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an anti-gravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS BILDER' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES ... If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: 'ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of over-reaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through July 29. (Schwendener) 
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) 
 Last Chance
 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semigeometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)
 'UTOPIA IN NEW YORK' A tasty summer sampler of paintings at the Robert Steele Gallery in Chelsea by a dozen artists from Utopia, an Aboriginal-owned desert reservation the size of Rhode Island. The show includes such well-known figures as Gloria Petyarre, Barbara Weir and Minnie Pwerle. Most depict traditional motifs and designs for native flowers and vegetation, like the root pattern of a yam, a staple food, but others are more abstract and bear a visual resemblance to international art movements like Optical Art and 1970s painterly abstraction. But what gets you most about these paintings is the color, radiant and intense. Robert Steele Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 243-0165, robertsteelegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Genocchio)

HEADLINE: Dow Caps a 4-Month Surge, Closing Above 14,000

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed just over 14,000 yesterday for the first time, capping a four-month rally that has been driven by corporate buyouts, strong corporate profits and companies buying back their own shares.
 The stock market has charged past concerns about surging mortgage default rates, rising oil prices and higher interest rates. Measured in terms of corporate profits, stocks are the most expensive they have been in almost two years, although they still have not reached the frothy levels of the late 1990s.
 ''It's not as attractive as it was,'' Tobias Levkovich, the chief equity strategist at Citigroup, said about the stock market. ''But it's not unattractive.'' 
 This new market reality -- and the litany of worries associated with the housing market that have aroused skeptics for some time -- are raising concerns about whether stocks can continue their ascent. Markets have also become more volatile relative to the recent past, with days of big increases followed by sharp drops.
 Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known gauge of the stock market, tracking 30 large companies, rose 82.19 points, to close at 14,000.41. The Dow is up 12.3 percent for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which provides a far more comprehensive view of the market, closed up 6.91 points, to 1,553.08, and is up 9.5 percent for the year.
 The Dow and the market over all were led higher by I.B.M., which reported stronger than expected quarterly profits, and Exxon Mobil, which climbed as oil prices closed in on $76 a barrel. Technology, utility, energy and industrial stocks were broadly higher. Financial stocks, however, had another rough day on worries about fallout from subprime mortgages.
 Profit at large companies had been expected to start slowing significantly this year but have held up better than many analysts had predicted. The earnings forecasts that companies and analysts devised early this year might have been too pessimistic, market specialists suggest. 
 ''The economy is mixed but not as weak as when a lot of people made their earnings expectations at the end of the first quarter,'' said Leo P. Grohowski, chief investment officer at U. S. Trust, a division of Bank of America that serves wealthy clients.
 Corporate profits have also received a notable boost from the declining value of the dollar against other currencies, which has made United States exports cheaper overseas and magnified the earnings of overseas subsidiaries of American companies.
 The dollar has fallen 4.6 percent against both the euro and the British pound this year. It is also down against the Australian and Canadian currencies. (The exception has been the Japanese yen, which has fallen against the dollar and the euro.)
 And while profits have been growing, companies are not spending as much on adding production capacity, buying equipment or acquiring other companies as they did in the late 1990s. Rather, they are spending more on their own shares. In the first three months of the year, companies in the Standard & Poor's index bought back $118 billion of their own shares. In 2006, the number of shares outstanding among the 500 companies in the index fell by 1.53 percent, the first decline in 10 years.
 Private equity firms have announced deals worth $326 billion in the first six months of this year, up from $139 billion during the same period in 2006, according to Thomson Financial.
 ''When credit is fairly available, when interest rates are fairly low and stock prices are not expensive and when top line growth is pretty good because of world growth,'' said Robert C. Doll, vice chairman at BlackRock, the asset management company, ''that is a recipe for companies buying equity.''
 The price to earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has climbed to 18.3, up from 16.6 in July 2006. The ratio has averaged 15.7 since 1935 and 22.8 since 1988, according to Howard Silverblatt, chief index analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 The record set by the Dow yesterday falls short, on an inflation adjusted basis, of the peak it reached in January 2000, 11,722.98. To match that, the Dow would need to climb roughly 315 points.
 The recent stock market rally has not pulled in individual investors. Flows into domestic stock funds have remained anemic. In the first six months of this year investors put just $19 billion into domestic stock funds, 0.43 percent of the total assets in such funds, according to AMG Data Services, a research firm. By contrast, flows into nondomestic funds were $84 billion, about 5.6 percent of assets.
 Investors may be drawn by the stronger performance of markets in Europe and Asia, and the increasing ease with which they can participate in those markets. Returns on foreign investments have also been helped by the weakening dollar.
 The biggest concern of market specialists, they say, has to do with the cost and availability of credit.
 The economy has in recent years become reliant on low interest rates and lenders' willingness to extend credit to everyone from powerful private equity firms to home buyers with weak credit.
 After spiking to 5.3 percent in June, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is the benchmark that sets interest rates for mortgages, bonds and business loans, has fallen back to 5.01 percent. That is still above the 4.7 percent yield from January. The national average interest rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has climbed to 6.73 percent, from 6.18 percent in January, according to Freddie Mac.
 Richard Bernstein, chief United States strategist for Merrill Lynch, said he believes investors would be increasingly risk averse, especially if interest rates rise further. 
 ''It's important for people to realize that markets act in a transition phase,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''We think we are going through one of those periods.''

HEADLINE: Fed's Notes Say Inflation Worries Swayed Rate Policy in June

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19 

 BODY:
Concerns about inflation continue to underpin the Federal Reserve's stand against changes in interest rates, according to minutes of the Fed's meeting last month that were released Thursday. 
 During the deliberations June 27-28, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his colleagues at the central bank noted some improvements in underlying inflation readings, but this was ''not seen as convincing evidence that the recent moderation of core inflation would be sustained,'' according to the minutes.
 Core, or underlying, inflation excludes volatile energy and food prices.
 High food and energy prices have increased the overall inflation rate, and Fed officials wondered whether that would affect the mind-sets of consumers, businesses and investors, leading them to act in ways that could worsen inflation.
 Fed members also continued to say that the economy would make its way safely through the housing slump, and they were hopeful for a rebound in economic growth. The economy grew at a pace of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, the slowest in more than four years. 
 ''Although the housing market remained a key source of uncertainty about the outlook,'' the minutes said, ''Fed members thought it most likely that the overall economy would expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke, appearing Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee, gave the same forecast of moderate growth, tempered by problems in the housing market. He also repeated the assurances he gave to a House panel on Wednesday that regulators were acting to protect would-be homeowners from abusive mortgage practices.
 Lawmakers have blamed lax oversight by regulators as a factor in the troubles in the housing market.
 The Fed minutes also addressed labor issues, stating that the fact that the job market has remained healthy even as the economy has endured a yearlong sluggish spell ''was something of a puzzle.'' The trends seemed to be connected with slower productivity growth recorded by United States companies, the minutes said.

HEADLINE: Why the United Nations Belongs in Iraq

BYLINE: By ZALMAY KHALILZAD. 
Zalmay Khalilzad, ambassador to Iraq from 2005 to April, is the United States ambassador to the United Nations.

 BODY:
AFTER meeting with President Bush on Tuesday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that the Iraqi situation is ''a problem of the whole world'' and that the United Nations is prepared to contribute to the ''Iraqi government and people to help them overcome this difficulty.'' 
 The United States recognizes the global importance of stabilizing Iraq and supports this forward-leaning approach to enhancing the United Nations' role. The United Nations possesses certain comparative advantages for undertaking complex internal and regional mediation efforts; it can also help internationalize the effort to stabilize the country. 
 In coming weeks, the United Nations will appoint a new envoy for Iraq and renew the Security Council mandate for its mission in Baghdad. As special envoy and ambassador to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005, I saw how the United Nations could play an enormously helpful role when represented by talented envoys who are given the right mandate, and when supported by the major powers. In Iraq, the United States supports a larger United Nations role because we believe that with the right envoy and mandate it is the best vehicle to address the two fundamental issues driving the crisis in Iraq. 
 First, the United Nations has unmatched convening power that can help Iraq's principal communities reach a national compact on the distribution of political and economic power. In the role of mediator, it has inherent legitimacy and the flexibility to talk to all parties, including elements outside the political process. 
 A new United Nations envoy should have a mandate to help Iraqis complete work on a range of issues: the law governing distribution of hydrocarbon revenues, the reform of the de-Baathification law, the review of the Constitution, the plan for demobilization of militias, an agreement for insurgents to give up their armed struggle. The envoy should be empowered to help resolve the status of Kirkuk and disputed internal boundaries and to prepare and monitor provincial elections. Also, the mandate should make it possible for the United Nations to explore potential third-party guarantees that may be needed to induce Iraqi factions to reconcile. 
 In this role, the United Nations has an added advantage by virtue of its role as co-leader with the Iraqi government of the International Compact for Iraq, an agreement that commits Iraq's leaders to key political steps and policy reforms in exchange for economic and other support from the international community. The influence that the United Nations has over the release of any assistance will give its envoy significant leverage to encourage compromises among Iraqi leaders. 
 Second, the United Nations is also uniquely suited to work out a regional framework to stabilize Iraq. Several of Iraq's neighbors -- not only Syria and Iran but also some friends of the United States -- are pursuing destabilizing policies. The United States supports a new mandate that creates a United Nations-led multilateral diplomatic process to contain the regional competition that is adding fuel to the fire of Iraq's internal conflict.
 This process should build on the work of the expanded neighbors conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in May, where regional powers, as well as members of the Security Council and the eight industrialized nations, began a dialogue on Iraq and established a set of working groups on security, energy and refugees. Going forward, this dialogue should be institutionalized at the ministerial level under the leadership of the secretary general. Also, the United Nations envoy for Iraq should convene a contact group at the subministerial level that will meet regularly to determine whether specific agreements are being carried out. 
 To do this work, the United Nations will need additional political, financial, logistical and security support from states with interests in the region. In addition, the coalition will need to maintain forces in Iraq to build on the initial positive security results of our new strategy in Iraq, and to work with the United Nations to ensure that the coalition's military strategy supports the internal and regional mediation efforts. The United States recognizes its responsibilities and is prepared to do its part. 
 While reasonable people can differ on whether the coalition should have intervened against Saddam Hussein's regime, it is clear at this point that the future of Iraq will have a profound effect on the region and, in turn, on peace and stability in the world. The United States endorses Mr. Ban's call for an expanded United Nations role in Iraq to help Iraq become a peaceful, stable country -- one that will be a responsible partner in the international community and a force for moderation in the region.

HEADLINE: Investment Unit Helps Lift Bank of America Profit 5% in Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation, the second-largest United States bank, said yesterday that quarterly profit rose 5 percent, as private equity and investment banking gains offset lower retail banking earnings and worsening loan quality. 
 Second-quarter net income increased to $5.76 billion, or $1.28 a share, from $5.48 billion, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding items, profit was $1.30 a share, 10 cents above the average analyst expectation, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7 percent to $19.56 billion, topping the average Wall Street estimate of $18.49 billion.
 Fee income rose 17 percent, while lending income fell 3 percent. Expenses rose 4 percent to $9.09 billion.
 The chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said on a conference call with analysts that revenue was ''a bit better than our expectations.'' Bank of America generates more of its business domestically than its main rivals, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.
 Mr. Lewis said the bank remained ''a little concerned about domestic consumption spending, given the prolonged housing subprime issues and higher fuel prices.''
 Still, he said, ''we're well positioned going into the second half of 2007, with additional upside in 2008.''
 Bank of America shares fell 9 cents, to $49.27.
 On Wednesday, JPMorgan, the third-largest bank, said profit rose 20 percent to $4.23 billion. Citigroup, the largest bank, is expected to report results today.
 Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., set aside $1.81 billion over all for credit losses, up 80 percent from a year earlier, while net charges rose 46 percent, to $1.5 billion.
 Some of the charges stemmed from credit cards, including accounts from the former MBNA Corporation, which the bank acquired last year for $34.2 billion.
 Rising credit losses helped push down profit from consumer and small business banking, the bank's main business, by 23 percent to $2.46 billion.
 This offset benefits from programs that offer free online stock trades and eliminate some fees on mortgages.
 Profit from the corporate and investment banking unit rose 5 percent, to $1.67 billion, including a 27 percent increase in investment banking income. Equity investment gains, meanwhile, soared to $1.83 billion, from $699 million, including $600 million from the sale of private equity funds to Conversus Capital.
 Wealth and investment management profit rose 6 percent, to $619 million, as fees and asset flows increased. The bank recently paid $3.3 billion for the US Trust private banking business of the Charles Schwab Corporation.
 Mr. Lewis reaffirmed his commitment to buying all of ABN Amro's LaSalle Bank business for $21 billion. He played down speculation that he would keep the Chicago-area business and close operations in Michigan, where the economy is weaker.
 ''We expect to have the entire company,'' he said. ''We like it as it is.''

HEADLINE: The House's Duty on Energy

 BODY:
The centerpiece of a generally constructive energy bill passed by the Senate last month was the first meaningful increase in fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks in 30 years. The House version does not include such a provision, a serious shortcoming that Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts will try to remedy with an amendment when debate begins. His amendment is vital. It is also a no-brainer. Without it the bill will fall embarrassingly short of what it could and should do to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil as well as its contribution to global warming. 
 There is an element of risk here for Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker who must decide whether to allow a vote on the amendment. It is vigorously opposed by John Dingell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who for years has had great influence over energy policy in the House, and by some members of her Democratic caucus. Approval is not a sure thing. 
 But taking risks is what leaders are for. Moreover, apart from her fortitude, Ms. Pelosi's credibility is on the line. She has proudly described the bill, a compendium of ideas from nearly a dozen House committees, as her ''Energy Independence Day'' package. But this country already imports 60 percent of its oil, and the bulk of that goes to transportation. Thus, any serious attempt to make the country independent of foreign oil -- or, at the very least, less dependent -- requires the very fuel-efficiency provision the bill is missing. 
 Mr. Markey is not asking for the moon. His amendment would raise mileage standards from a fleetwide average of about 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon 2018. The National Academy of Sciences has said that this target can be achieved in a cost-effective manner without loss in performance or safety. By 2025, the country would also be saving 2.3 million barrels a day -- roughly equal to current imports from the Persian Gulf. 
 The timing is right. A report last week from the authoritative International Energy Agency in Paris predicted that worldwide oil demand will rise faster than expected over the next five years while production declines -- threatening supplies, increasing prices and placing an even greater emphasis on conservation of existing fuels and the development of alternatives.
 In its present form, the bill contains positive elements for which Mr. Dingell and other committee chairmen can rightly claim credit -- tax credits for clean energy, requirements for more efficient appliances and buildings, environmental safeguards that would protect sensitive public lands from the effects of oil and gas drilling. Some members of the House are urging that the wiser and less contentious course would be to pass this bill now and leave the fuel economy question for another day. 
 From where we sit, though, delay is incredibly risky. The Senate, the polls, the experts all say that the moment for strong action -- a moment Ms. Pelosi cannot afford to miss -- is at hand.

HEADLINE: Something New in Mount Vernon: A Mayoral Challenge

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., July 19 

 BODY:
The last time the mayor's post was up for grabs here, in 2003, the incumbent, Ernest D. Davis, did not have to do much heavy lifting to secure his re-election: No one ran against him for the Democratic nomination, and he faced no significant threat from the Republicans in the general election.
 There are no term-limit laws here, and Mr. Davis, a soft-spoken man with dreadlocked salt-and-pepper hair, has overseen this majority-black city of 70,000 for 12 years with a blend of shrewd politics and Southern charm. He has an up-and-down record of accomplishments, but when he fails, he is often shielded from criticism by a loyal cadre of supporters, who speak of him with the reverence often bestowed on an illustrious relative. 
 But for Mr. Davis, 69, who will be seeking a fourth term this fall, victory may not come as easily as it has in the past. 
 The city is under federal investigation for suspected mismanagement of housing subsidies, and Mr. Davis is being challenged in the primary by Clinton I. Young Jr., 56, his former political protege. Mr. Davis hand-picked Mr. Young in 1995 to run for the seat he had to vacate on the Westchester Board of Legislators to run for mayor. 
 ''I thought I was picking someone with likemindedness who would be groomed to take over the city eventually so that the residents wouldn't miss me,'' Mr. Davis said in an interview. ''I'm not going to cower now and leave my city in the hands of someone who needs on-the-job training.''
 During a campaign event on Wednesday, at a church parking lot in the city's struggling South Side, Mr. Young had the help of a longtime friend and native son, Denzel Washington, whom he met while playing basketball at the local Boys and Girls Club.
 Sounding a bit like a politician himself, Mr. Washington told a gaggle of fans and reporters who surrounded him as he walked toward the dais, ''I like the mayor we have in Mount Vernon, but I'm here to support Clinton Young.''
 Mr. Davis has called Mr. Young, who was on the local Board of Education for 10 years and has been a county legislator for 12 years, an ''inexperienced'' politician whose mayoral run reflects his ''narcissistic behavior,'' not his commitment to the city. 
 Mr. Young has said the mayor ''has fooled residents with his grandiose ideas,'' a reference to Mr. Davis's plan to build a hotel, a sports arena and a retail complex downtown, an old campaign promise he has so far not fulfilled.
 ''People should look at how many promises the mayor has made and how many have become reality, and they'll realize it's time for him to go,'' Mr. Young said.
 The federal investigation may be Mr. Davis's most vulnerable spot. Last year, the state took over the administration of the local Section 8 housing program after a federal audit found that the city had billed the government for nearly $2 million in unused or improperly used rental vouchers.
 Then, in May, federal prosecutors subpoenaed records from the city's Urban Renewal Agency, which was in charge of disbursing the housing subsidies. No one knows for sure who or what is the target of the investigation; Mr. Davis is chairman of the agency, but said he was not under investigation.
 ''In terms of wrongdoing, we didn't do anything. Nobody stole any money,'' he said. ''It was mismanagement. We were paying too much to the landlords, and the program was just poorly run.''
 At least some voters are beginning to wonder if Mr. Davis has been in office too long. ''I voted for him the first time, I voted for him the second time, I voted for him the third time, and I think that's as much as I'll vote for him,'' said Robert Moore, 63, who moved here from North Carolina more than 40 years ago. ''I feel like we need a change, a fresh start.''
 ''He may not have done anything wrong,'' Mr. Moore added, ''but there's too much suspicion going around.'' 
 Mr. Davis is quick to point out his accomplishments, including the privatization of a public housing project, which led to marked improvements for the 497 families who live there, and the construction of retail chain stores along Sandford Boulevard after a four-year court battle with a neighboring community that opposed the project. 
 The stores, which opened in 2005, have created 1,000 jobs and generated $1 million last year in sales-tax revenue, the mayor said. He called that a substantial sum for a city whose economy depends largely on its small businesses, mom-and-pop stores and light manufacturing.
 ''Success breeds success,'' he said. ''And, remember, I know what this game is about. It's about people having confidence in investing in this place.''
 To counter a recent spate of violence, including two shootings and a stabbing involving teenage victims during one week in April, Mr. Davis will be swearing in 24 police officers next week and has authorized hiring 24 more.
 But Mr. Young said putting more police on the streets is ''a Band-Aid solution.'' ''We need more recreational services for our young people,'' he said.
 The winner of the Democratic primary on Sept. 18 will face Janet W. Snyder, a businesswoman who is chairwoman of the Mount Vernon Republican Party. Democrats outnumber Republicans here by seven to one; the last Republican to hold the mayor's post here, August Petrillo, died in office in 1976.
 ''I know it's an uphill battle, but I think voters feel we need balance and accountability,'' Ms. Snyder said. ''They have three choices: They can vote for two career politicians or they can vote for me.''

HEADLINE: Life Stirs, But Fitfully, In the Heart Of the City

BYLINE: By ETHAN WILENSKY-LANFORD; Cara Buckley and Terry Pristin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
''Wow, when did you see it so dead over here?'' said Anthony Americo, smoking a cigar at his perch yesterday on an overpass above Park Avenue. He was looking down just after 8 a.m. at the ''frozen zone,'' the Midtown blocks where no unauthorized workers or residents were allowed.
 Before him, there was an eerie stillness. City officials said that 125 businesses in the zone were closed yesterday as workers cleaned up after a steam pipe explosion on Wednesday. 
 While the city has not yet given an estimate of the blast's economic effect, John Tepper Marlin, a former chief economist for the city comptroller's office, estimated the lost business income at $10 million to $30 million through last night.
 Yesterday morning, the regular bustle continued alongside a rare clearing of inactivity. Grand Central Terminal was as busy as usual, and travelers milled about the lobby of the Grand Hyatt hotel as if it were any other day. At the same time, Mr. Americo, a building contractor, was unable to get to his nearby job site, and in front of him dust and debris coated the vacant streets and sidewalks. 
 And on the edges, there was confusion.
 ''I work there,'' Vaja Gabashvili, 48, a sculptor, told three police officers who were standing guard at 38th Street and Park Avenue. He told them he needed to pick up tools from his studio at 117 East 39th Street for a job uptown. ''You let everybody else in but me!''
 He threw his arms in the air as he spoke. He called his boss, who was just around the corner, but the officers would not take the call. They were busy, guarding the zone. 
 ''You're not going,'' one of the officers said. ''It's for your own safety.''
 Newmark Knight Frank, a brokerage company with offices at 125 Park Avenue and at 110 East 42nd Street, normally has hundreds of employees in both buildings, said Barry M. Gosin, the chief executive. But both buildings were closed yesterday.
 ''We'll work from our BlackBerrys,'' Mr. Gosin said. ''Our phones are down. That's the biggest part.'' 
 Buildings on the edge of the zone opened their doors for those who showed up.
 ''Half the building is empty,'' said Michelle Lopez, 29, a security guard at 100 Park. ''People come in and they leave right away.''
 By midmorning, the police had put on pink breathing masks. They continued to turn away hundreds of people still trying to enter the zone. 
 Two young women who live on 40th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues said they had to spend Wednesday night at a friend's house in Greenwich Village. They returned in the morning to get medication and change their clothes before work, but officers would not let them pass.
 ''It's still frozen,'' an officer told them at 40th Street and Park Avenue.
 Nancy Kahn, who works at an advertising company at 100 Park Avenue, said she had intended to play host to a visitor from Dallas, who had arrived just after the explosion.
 But the visitor was turned away from the building on Wednesday night after it had been evacuated. Then she got covered in mud thrown up by a passing taxi. The last thing Ms. Kahn had heard, she was at the airport trying to get on a standby flight back to Texas.
 ''This was supposed to be her big day to observe how our New York office functions,'' said Ms. Kahn, who has worked at the company for 17 years. ''We are obviously not functioning well today.''

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Major Overhaul of the Federal Student Aid Program

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO; Jonathan D. Glater contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, July 20 

 BODY:
The Senate approved a major overhaul of federal student aid early Friday, cutting taxpayer subsidies to student lenders by more than $18 billion and funneling most of the money into increasing federal grants for low- and middle-income students and easing repayment terms on federal loans.
 The bill passed by a bipartisan majority of 78 to 18 after the vote was temporarily delayed by a flurry of largely unrelated amendments, a reflection of the lingering rancor over the debate on Iraq this week. The House passed its version of the legislation last week, and the differences must now be reconciled. 
 The White House, which had threatened to veto the House bill, had a more measured response to the Senate's version, objecting mainly to provisions that ease repayment of only some loans and grant loan forgiveness for public service employees. But the administration said it expected to ''resolve these issues through the legislative process.'' 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the education committee, said, ''In the face of the global economy, college education is more important than ever, but it's never been more difficult to afford.'' The cost of attending college has tripled over the last 20 years, Mr. Kennedy added, even as the buying power of the main federal grant for low- and middle-income students shrank.
 But critics complained that the bill would cut too deep into lender subsidies and create new entitlement programs that would, over time, swell the federal deficit.
 Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, argued that the measures were really aimed at dismantling the federally guaranteed loan program, which involves private lenders, and replacing it with a direct loan program, which costs taxpayers less, according to Congressional research. 
 The bill, Mr. Alexander said, ''is doing something through the back door that I really don't think we should be doing through the front door.''
 Like the House measure, the Senate bill eases the repayment burden for student borrowers. It limits monthly payments on direct student loans to 15 percent of a graduate's discretionary income and offers complete loan forgiveness after 10 years to public service employees. 
 It raises the maximum Pell grant more than the House bill did, to $5,100 by next year and $5,400 by 2011. And it creates a category of stipends, Promise Grants, which would make up the difference between Pell grants and any family or college contributions to cover the full cost of attendance for the neediest students.
 Arguing that the bill would jeopardize small and medium-size companies, lenders tried to stave off some cuts through a last-minute amendment sponsored by Senators Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, that would have cut the loss of government subsidies to lenders by about $3 billion. 
 Supporters maintained that the amendment would have eased the pain for lenders without sacrificing aid to needy students. But critics, backed by a report by the Congressional Budget Office, disputed that claim. The measure was defeated, 61 to 36.
 Both the tone of the debate and the results of the vote reflected the decline in fortune of the student loan industry after inquiries by Congress and the office of Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general revealed improprieties in the industry. 
 Mr. Cuomo's office said on Thursday that it had reached an agreement with one of the 10 largest student lenders, the College Loan Corporation of San Diego. 
 In the agreement, the attorney general's office said it had found that the company had provided a range of benefits to colleges and universities, including conducting counseling sessions on behalf of the institutions that federal law requires for students with federally guaranteed loans. The sessions are intended to offer objective information, but were instead used by the lender ''as marketing opportunities,'' Mr. Cuomo found.
 The College Loan Corporation also provided staff at no charge to assist financial aid offices at busy times and gave gifts of meals and entertainment to college employees who served on its advisory board, the agreement said.
 The company signed a ''code of conduct'' developed by Mr. Cuomo's office that bars lenders from giving anything of value to a college or university in exchange for help marketing loans to students. 
 ''We're pleased this matter is resolved with the New York State attorney general,'' Tracy Neumann, senior vice president of the company, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: How They Did It. The Show, That Is.

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
THE typical Off Broadway production these days involves great expectations, followed by unforeseen logistical difficulties and frustration, then eventual disappointment and an all-too-hasty conclusion.
 None of that, of course, has anything to do with ''My First Time,'' a new Off Broadway play in which four actors recount stories about people's first sexual experiences. Nothing, nothing at all. It's been sold out so far. 
 Why, what were you thinking? 
 Anyway. 
 The play, which began previews last week at New World Stages and opens July 28, is simply set up: four actors take turns reciting stories, in whole or in part, that appear on myfirsttime.com, a Web site that invites people to post reminiscences of their first sexual encounters. 
 The site was started in 1996 by Peter Foldy, a Los Angeles-based filmmaker, and his friend Craig, who does not want his full name used because he doesn't want his conservative family to know about his involvement with the project (seriously).
 Mr. Foldy had some success in the 1980s with a ''Porky's''-type movie he wrote called ''Hot Moves.'' So he and, um, Craig decided to make another movie, this one about a group of teenagers talking about their sexual initiations. Craig recommended starting a Web site to solicit story ideas. 
 The movie never materialized, but the Web site quickly took off, and in the 11 years since it has grown to include nearly 50,000 stories, some that seem to be mere fabricated pornography, but others that sound too humiliating, comical, bizarre or sad to have been made up. There are stories of rape and incest, and stories by frustrated virgins in their 40s and angry, betrayed women. Disappointment, both comic and poignant, is a pretty pervasive sentiment. 
 A few years ago Ken Davenport, a producer and creator of the Off Broadway shows ''Altar Boyz'' and ''The Awesome 80s Prom,'' became interested in creating a documentary play along the lines of ''The Vagina Monologues.'' The idea of a play about people's first sexual encounters occurred to him and, not patient enough to go out and do interviews, he decided to start a Web site. He learned he was not the first with the idea. 
 After introducing himself to Mr. Foldy and Craig via e-mail, Mr. Davenport negotiated the rights to turn some of the stories into a play. (A 2003 series on Showtime was based on the Web site, though it involved steamy re-enactments.) 
 The play, which lacks the political ambitions of ''The Vagina Monologues,'' includes some of the more extraordinary stories from the site, but the lines that draw the strongest audience reactions are not in the script. Before each performance audience members are asked to fill out cards that pose various questions: ''Are you a virgin?'' ''What was your partner's first name?'' ''How would you describe your first time: Incredible, Good, Not Good, Awful.'' The cards are collected (names are not asked) and read at points throughout the show. 
 The final question -- ''If your first sexual partner were here right now, what would you say to him/her?''-- reliably elicits showstoppers, such as these actual audience responses at a recent performance: ''How could you do that to your fiancee?'' and ''Are you still having sex with men now that you have a wife?'' 
 Mr. Davenport's ''Altar Boyz'' continues to be a lesson in the harsh economics of Off Broadway. It has an ardent fan base, good reviews and a relatively low running cost, and as of this weekend it will have played 1,000 performances. Yet given the high costs and uneven audiences of Off Broadway, it still has not made back all of its original $1 million investment.
 So Mr. Davenport is trying new things with ''My First Time,'' for which he raised only $175,000 to capitalize. He's running the show just three nights a week and doing all the advertising, marketing and group ticket sales out of his production office.
 The economical go-it-alone approach was shaped from lessons learned on and off Broadway, said Mr. Davenport, a former company and general manager. ''I don't think I ever worked on a Broadway show that recouped,'' he said.
 Already somewhat of an Off Broadway P. T. Barnum, Mr. Davenport is also cooking up publicity stunts like the recent virgins-get-in-free night, which received attention from news outlets worldwide. It's no accident, he acknowledged, that he chose to open the show in the slow-news month of July.
 Who's in the audience? At a recent Saturday-night performance, which was packed, three grandmothers from Dix Hills, N.Y., sat together in row F. One of them, who would not give her name out of fear that her grandchildren would read this, said that the show was fun, if a little juvenile for her tastes.
 So what did she expect? 
 She said she thought the performers would actually be acting out some of the stories.

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Seek to Close Sao Paulo Airport in Wake of Brazil's Worst Airline Disaster

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 19 

 BODY:
Government prosecutors on Thursday were seeking an injunction to shut down the airport here after the worst airline disaster in Brazilian history, arguing that the airport is a menace both to passengers and residents. 
 The death toll from the crash of TAM Flight 3054, which skidded off a short, slippery runway at Congonhas Airport on Tuesday night and exploded as it plowed into an office building and gas station, has now reached 188. As many as a dozen people are still missing and presumed dead, and the charred and fragmented state of the bodies that have been recovered has slowed identification and burial.
 Prosecutors filed briefs to require Congonhas, the country's busiest airport, whose main runway has been closed since the crash, to cease all operations ''until a complete refurbishment of both its runways can be completed and there is certainty they are fully secure.'' Marcio Araujo, who as solicitor general acts as a public ombudsman, called conditions at Congonhas ''a calamity, multiplied by the lethargy of the authorities and the greed of the airlines.'' 
 Those complaints were echoed in a sharply critical statement issued Thursday by the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations. ''Air safety is currently compromised and is a danger to the traveling public'' because ''warnings on the conditions at the airport in Congonhas have been repeatedly ignored by the authorities,'' especially the Brazilian Air Force, it said.
 In February, prosecutors obtained a court order prohibiting large planes from landing at or taking off from Congonhas, which is surrounded by residential and commercial areas, citing similar safety concerns. But that ruling was quickly overturned on the grounds that the harm to the Brazilian economy, 40 percent of which is concentrated in Sao Paulo State, would be enormous.
 On Thursday, Gen. Jose Carlos Pereira, the director of the government agency that runs airports here in Latin America's largest country, advanced a similar argument. He acknowledged that the airport was ''being used excessively'' and that a reduction was needed in the number of takeoffs and landings, usually more than 600 a day, but dismissed the idea of closing the airport as impractical.
 ''Where are 20 million people going to fly from?'' asked General Pereira, whose agency has been given 72 hours to respond formally to the injunction request. ''What would this mean in terms of chaos in the air?''
 With the plane's flight data recorder, or black box, recovered and on its way to the United States for analysis, aviation experts here were focusing on an airport videotape that shows the plane trying to land in rainy conditions. The tape was released by the air force, which has been widely criticized for its management of the country's commercial aviation system since 154 people were killed in a midair collision over the Amazon last September.
 The video recorded Flight 3054 speeding down the runway, covering the last section in 3 seconds, as opposed to the normal 11 to 13 seconds, and showing no sign of having turned on reverse thrusters to slow the plane. To some analysts, the plane's initial failure to brake, combined with its later acceleration suggest that mechanical failure or pilot error may have been the principal causes of the crash, rather than the condition of the runway.
 As debate continued about the causes and how to solve the larger crisis, criticism of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's apparent passivity was growing. Mr. da Silva has been keeping a low public profile since Friday evening, when he was booed several times at the opening ceremony of the Pan-American Games in Rio de Janeiro, and has let his cabinet ministers bear the brunt of public explanations and criticisms.
 ''No one wants President Lula to pilot the plane,'' said Lucia Hippolito, a political science professor and analyst. ''They want him to steer the country,'' which means that ''some sort of manifestation is necessary.''

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Friday with an article about the search for victims of a Brazilian airliner crash in Sao Paulo misstated the circumstances of the crash. The airliner, TAM Flight 3054, skidded off a short slippery runway and hit an office building and gas station; it did not collide with another aircraft in midair. As the article noted, a Brazilian airliner collided in midair with an American corporate jet last September, killing 154.

PERSON: Kenji Miyamoto 

HEADLINE: Kenji Miyamoto, 98, Leader of Japan's Communist Party

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Kenji Miyamoto, a Japanese Communist who emerged from jail in 1945 to lead his party on a jagged postwar course in which it renounced Russian and Chinese Communism -- and even the phrase Marxist-Leninist -- in favor of more popular bread-and-butter issues, died Wednesday in Tokyo. He was 98. 
 His death was announced by a Communist Party official, Agence France-Presse reported.
 Mr. Miyamoto, who occupied top party posts from 1958 to 1977, joined the party in 1931 after graduating from what is now called the University of Tokyo. He was convicted two years later of conspiring to beat and kick a police officer to death, a charge he adamantly denied. He was released after World War II, when his sentence was annulled by imperial decree. 
 But the episode came back to dominate the news in Japan in 1988 after Koichi Hamada, chairman of the budget committee in the House of Representatives, publicly called Mr. Miyamoto a murderer. Japanese decorum required that Mr. Hamada apologize, which he refused to do. After pressure mounted for a week, Mr. Hamada did so.
 After the war, Mr. Miyamoto led the Communists' campaign in the 1949 elections, in which the party won 35 seats. The Communists lost ground a year later, just before the outbreak of the Korean War, when Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, supreme commander of the Allied powers, barred Mr. Miyamoto and 23 other members of the party's central committee from public service. 
 The Communists rebounded, however, overcoming that rebuke as well as their unpopularity with many Japanese over the party's rabid opposition to Japan's imperial family. Fielding candidates in subsequent elections, the Communists reached their height in 1979, when they won more than 8 percent of the seats in the lower house of Parliament.
 The independent path along which Mr. Miyamoto led his party drew wide attention, with many comparisons to Italy's Communist Party. In 1958, Mr. Miyamoto abandoned his support for violent revolution in favor of what he called ''smiling Communism,'' with its emphasis on issues like inflation, housing and education.
 In 1966, he visited China as it was going though the radical social changes of its Cultural Revolution. ''The situation'' there, he said, ''is abnormal.'' Two years later, he denounced the Soviet Union's invasion of what was then Czechoslovakia. At a political convention in 1990, Mr. Miyamoto said he had never supported the line of old European Communists. He said the collapse of Communism in Europe did not represent a failure of Socialism, but a defeat of Stalinism and subsequent Soviet regimes. He consistently opposed the United States-Japan alliance.
 The party did not release information on survivors.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an obituary on Friday of Kenji Miyamoto, the longtime leader of postwar Japan's Communist Party, rendered incorrectly the name of the American general in charge of the Allied occupation, who barred Mr. Miyamoto and 23 other party members from public service just before the outbreak of the Korean War. He was Gen. Douglas MacArthur; he had no middle name and did not use the initial A (or other initials often ascribed to him, including B, C and S). The error most recently appeared on June 29 in an obituary of Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister in the 1990s. Five articles in 2005 included the ''A'' (on May 29, June 20, June 28, July 29 and Aug. 26), and the ''A'' has been used in 19 other articles since 1987.

HEADLINE: Beyond 'Moby-Dick': When America Went A-Fishing for the Whale

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Long before Ahab set out after Moby Dick, Americans pursued the whale. And long after Ishmael survived the wreck of the Pequod, they chased and hunted as far afield as the Arctic Ocean as the whales became fewer. Changing fashions and the discovery of petroleum doomed the industry to obsolescence, but the knights-errant of the high seas pushed ever onward, anachronisms from the age of sail surviving into the machine age.
 In ''Leviathan,'' Eric Jay Dolin dutifully chronicles the long history of whaling in North America, from the voyages of Capt. John Smith, who, like many after him, ''found this Whale-fishing a costly conclusion,'' to the last voyage of the Wanderer, a whaler that set sail from the once-teeming port of New Bedford, Mass., in 1924 and promptly wrecked in the shallows before a crowd of curious onlookers. 
 The subject throbs with romance and cries out for big-screen treatment. Mr. Dolin, a pedestrian writer, settles for television-size drama, delivering a History Channel version of a story meant for Imax.
 Still, anyone whose knowledge of whaling begins and ends with ''Moby-Dick'' will get a solid education from Mr. Dolin, who fills in the historical record and sets the stage for the glory years when men like Melville set out from Nantucket, New Bedford, Sag Harbor and dozens of other ports on voyages lasting as long as four years. 
 As Mr. Dolin makes abundantly clear, they pursued a natural resource, like the oil drillers of the modern era, balancing risk against reward and, driven by scarcity, sailing to ever more remote and dangerous regions.
 Colonial Americans simply looked for whales on the beach, cast ashore by storms. Drift whaling, as it was known, became a prominent feature of the colonial economy. In the 1640s, Southampton, Long Island, wrote the first drift-whaling ordinances, requiring two citizens to search the beach for whales after every storm and two others to cut the carcass, taking a double portion of blubber for their pains. Blubber was transformed into oil or candles.
 Drift whaling led to shore whaling, the pursuit of whales swimming close to shore, an industry that established the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts as the whaling capital of the nation. The profits were as big as the fish, ''with a single good-size whale providing each member of a whaleboat's crew with a payday equal to that which a shore-based worker might earn in a half a year,'' Mr. Dolin writes. When the population of shore-swimming whales declined, whalers set sail for the open seas, and the golden age of whaling began, the decades-long hunt for sperm, right, bowhead, gray and humpback whales in waters thousands of miles beyond American shores.
 It was a dicey proposition. The great whaling tycoons of Nantucket made great fortunes, and many a maid dreamed of landing a whaling captain as a husband. But the crews who signed on for whaling voyages never knew what they might earn, or how long they might be away, since a ship kept sailing until the hold was filled with whalebone and barrels of whale oil. Each sailor was assigned a percentage of profits, called a lay. (Melville was allotted a 1/175 lay.) If everything went exactly right, the rewards could be substantial. If not, crew members returned in debt, dunned for the food they ate and the clothes on their backs. 
 Americans were the best whalers in the world. During the Revolutionary War, Britain tried to steal expertise by pressing American sailors into service with its own whaling fleet, and France later offered inducements for Nantucket's finest to emigrate. It was no use. During the golden age of whaling, from about 1815 to 1860, Americans dominated the industry, their ships accounting for 735 of the 900 whalers worldwide in 1846. 
 This was the period, Mr. Dolin writes, ''when the whaling industry spawned most of its greatest stories of human drive, perseverance, success and failure, and when the American whalemen, harpoons in hand, attained mythic status.''
 Some of the stories were preposterous. One harpooner supposedly jumped on the back of a whale and rode it across the seas, and another, after being swallowed by a whale, was found days later, shaken but alive, when the whale was hauled aboard a boat and cut up. 
 The reality was colorful enough. The multicultural mix aboard ship described by Melville was accurate. In colonial times, American Indians were hired to do the menial jobs, their numbers later joined by black Americans, who received equal pay for equal work, a radical notion. 
 ''A coloured man is only known and looked upon as a man, and is promoted in rank according to his ability and skill to perform the same duties as a white man,'' one black sailor reported. From time to time, women disguised as men slipped aboard, where they joined a polyglot crew drawn from the four corners of the earth. 
 The desertion rate of 50 percent or more speaks for itself, with crews sometimes being replaced several times over in the course of a single voyage. Sailors dreaming of riches earned, on average, 20 cents a day. ''We have to work like horses and live like pigs,'' one sailor complained to his diary.
 The discovery of oil in Pennsylvania in 1859 sounded the death knell for whaling. Corsets and stays kept the whaling industry profitable, on a small scale, into the early years of the 20th century, but when the hourglass figure fell out of fashion, a thrilling chapter in American history came to a definitive close. 
 When a handful of New Bedford natives took roles in ''Down to the Sea in Ships,'' a silent melodrama with a whaling theme, filmed in 1922, they did so in sorrowful tribute to an industry and a way of life that were passing from the American scene forever. Like Ishmael, they alone were left to tell the tale.

HEADLINE: Sober North Dakotans Hope to Legalize Cannabis Without the Kick

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: OSNABROCK, N.D. 

 BODY:
David C. Monson seems an improbable soul to find at the leading edge of a national movement to legalize growing hemp, a plant that shares a species name, a genus type and, in many circles, a reputation, with marijuana. 
 As Mr. Monson rolls past his wheat, barley and shimmering yellow fields of canola, he listens to Rush Limbaugh in his tractor. When he is not farming, he is the high school principal in nearby Edinburg, population 252. When he is not teaching, he is a Republican representative in Bismarck, the state capital, where his party dominates both houses of the legislature and the governor is a Republican.
 ''Look at me -- do I look shady?'' Mr. Monson, 56, asked, as he stood in work boots and a ball cap in the rocky, black dirt that spans mile after mile of North Dakota's nearly empty northern edge. ''This is not any subversive thing like trying to legalize marijuana or whatever. This is just practical agriculture. We're desperate for something that can make us some money.'' 
 The rocks, the dirt, the cool, wet climate and a devastating crop fungus known as scab are part of what has landed North Dakota, of all states, at the forefront of a political battle more likely to have emerged somewhere ''a little more rebellious,'' as one farmer here put it, like California or Massachusetts. 
 Though federal authorities ban the growing of hemp, saying it contains tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive substance better known as THC in marijuana, six states this year considered legislation to allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, and Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, introduced a bill in Washington that would let states allow such crops. In state legislatures, the advocates of hemp note that it contains mere traces of THC, and that hemp (grown in other countries) is already found here in clothes, lotions, snack bars, car door panels, insulation and more.
 But no place has challenged the government as fiercely as North Dakota. Its legislature has passed a bill allowing farmers to grow industrial hemp and created an official licensing process to fingerprint such farmers and a global positioning system to track their fields. This year, Mr. Monson and another North Dakota farmer, with the support of the state's agriculture commissioner, applied to the Drug Enforcement Administration for permission to plant fields of hemp immediately. 
 ''North Dakota is really pushing the envelope on this one,'' said Doug Farquhar, the program director for agriculture and rural development at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legislatures in Maine, Montana, West Virginia and other states have passed bills allowing farmers to grow industrial hemp, said Alexis Baden-Mayer, the director of government relations for Vote Hemp, a group that presses for legalization, but those laws have not been carried out given federal drug law. 
 The Controlled Substances Act, federal authorities say, is unambiguous. ''Basically hemp is considered the same as marijuana,'' said Steve Robertson, a special agent for the D.E.A. at its Washington headquarters. ''We're an enforcement agency. We're sworn to uphold the law.''
 In the wide-open spaces of this state, an independent streak often runs through the politics, especially when it comes to federal mandates. But the fight over hemp is not political or philosophical, people here say. It lacks any counterculture wink, any hint of the fear some hemp opponents express that those trying to legalize hemp secretly hope to open the door to the plant's more potent cousin.
 This battle is decidedly, and Midwesternly, pragmatic. In 1993, scab, a fungus also known as Fusarium head blight, tore through this region, wiping out thousands of acres of wheat, a prized crop in North Dakota, where agriculture remains the largest element of the economy. Hard rains left water pooling in fields, giving scab an opening. The fungus has turned up in varying degrees ever since, even as farmers searched for a cure. On a recent afternoon, as rain pounded his 710 acres, Mr. Monson gloomily yanked the head off a stalk of his wheat, revealing for a visitor whitish, shriveled seeds -- the telltale signs of scab.
 When Mr. Monson began his efforts in the late 1990s, some here balked. He remembered John Dorso, a former Republican leader, rolling his eyes and asking Mr. Monson if he knew what he was getting mixed up in.
 But hemp, Mr. Monson argued, offered an alternative for North Dakota's crop rotation. Its tall stalks survive similarly cool and wet conditions in Canada, just 25 miles north of here, where it is legal. And it suits the rocky soil left behind here by glaciers, soil that threatens to tear up farm equipment for anyone who dares to plant crops like beets or potatoes beneath ground.
 Years and studies and hearings later, few here have much to say against hemp -- a reflection, it seems, of the state's urgent wish to improve its economy. Recent hemp votes have passed the legislature with ease, though some questions linger. How big a market would there really be for hemp? What about the worries of drug enforcement officials, who say someone might sneak into a farmer's field of harmless hemp and plant a batch of (similar-looking) marijuana?
 Such fears, Mr. Monson insisted, are silly in North Dakota, which is the third least-populous state, with fewer than 640,000 people. This is the only state where voter registration is not required. (Everyone would know, the logic goes, if someone who did not belong tried to vote.) ''You can't go down to get the mail around here without someone knowing,'' Mr. Monson said.
 But Blair Thoreson, a Republican state representative who has voted against hemp measures, is less sure. ''Everyone here knows everyone,'' Mr. Thoreson said, ''and yet we've had a huge problem here with homegrown methamphetamine labs, too.''
 Roger Johnson, the state's agriculture commissioner, said hemp fields would be the worst places to hide marijuana. Under state rules, Mr. Johnson said, such fields must be accessible for unannounced searches, day or night, and crops would be tested by the state. Also, he said, a field of hemp and marijuana would cross-pollinate, leaving the drug less potent.
 ''We're not wide-eyed liberals,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''The D.E.A., they're the crazy ones on this. This sort of illogical, indefensible position is not going to prevail forever.''
 After receiving the first state licenses to grow hemp this year, Mr. Monson and Wayne Hauge, a farmer from Ray, on the opposite side of the state, filed applications with the D.E.A. in February. 
 Since then, the drug agency has not said yes or no. Given North Dakota's growing season, it is too late to plant anything new this year. So in June, the two men-- with financial help from Vote Hemp, the advocacy group -- filed a lawsuit against the agency. 
 Mr. Robertson said in July that the agency was still reviewing the applications, but that he could not say much beyond that because of the litigation.
 Like Mr. Monson, Mr. Hauge, who is 49 and farms barley, chickpeas and lentils on land his great-grandfather homesteaded in 1903, said his efforts were about economics, not politics -- or drugs.
 ''I don't advocate smoking anything,'' said Mr. Hauge, who, when he is not farming, is a certified public accountant.
 ''I guess I'm not really known as much of a joker,'' he added.

HEADLINE: After Six Years, the Global Trade Talks Are Just That: Talk

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
Soon after Sept. 11, 2001, the United States helped start a round of global trade talks aimed at getting rich countries to lower trade barriers so that poor countries could prosper by exporting goods, not terrorism. But it was never that simple.
 Six years later, the trade talks are on life support, suffering from so many disputes that like the victim in Agatha Christie's ''Murder on the Orient Express'' almost everyone could be guilty of killing them off. 
 There are disputes pitting Europe against the United States, rich countries against poor countries, and farming countries against industrial countries. 
 But a major new factor in the deadlock is a global economic realignment that has vaulted China, India and Brazil into the top tier of the world's emerging markets, much to the concern of other developing countries like Mexico, Chile and Thailand. 
 India and Brazil are refusing to lower their tariffs out of fear of export-driven economies like China's. A second tier of developing countries that are trying to compete with India and Brazil are complaining that they are being shut out by India, Brazil and other rapidly developing countries. Meanwhile, the poorest of the poor countries in Africa and elsewhere charge that the richer emerging market economies, which portray themselves as champions of the poor, are actually ignoring their needs.
 ''There is no value in blaming any single country over the state of our negotiations,'' Peter Mandelson, the top European trade negotiator, said in an interview. ''But this is not a classic North-South conflict. It is also South-South. The developed countries and the emerging economies have a responsibility to help the poorer countries.''
 Failure of the global trade talks is widely seen as potentially damaging to the world economy, which is powered by more than $10 trillion in trade of goods and services annually. The World Bank calculates that a new trade deal could add hundreds of billions of dollars to the world's income.
 This week, the World Trade Organization in Geneva tried to resolve the trade impasse by proposing compromises by all sides. On Friday, Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, urged the parties to heed the call for a middle ground. ''The global community should stay focused on the prize,'' he said, adding that ''all economies should be able to benefit'' from a deal. 
 It was a pointed appeal, because Mr. Zoellick served as the United States trade envoy when the current talks were started in Doha, Qatar in 2001, as a ''development round'' to aid the poor. 
 The impasse has grown bitter, however.
 Last month, Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, charged that India and Brazil displayed ''a lack of flexibility, indeed a rigidity'' in refusing to lower farm and industrial tariffs in a way that could benefit not just the West but other poor countries.
 ''There are some folks who may want to portray this as a north-south breakdown,'' Ms. Schwab said. ''I think nothing could be further from the truth.''
 In an interview Friday, after returning from meetings with nearly 40 envoys of African countries in Ghana, Ms. Schwab said that while South Africa was backing the position of India and Brazil, the other African countries were in desperate need of a trade deal. The onus, she said, was on the richer developing countries to make it happen.
 ''The Doha round is a development round, but that means something different than it would have meant 15 years ago,'' she said. ''It means that obviously the developed countries need to do the most. But the most rapidly growing developing countries need to do the next most because of the benefits they derived from an open trading system.''
 But the Indian trade minister, Kamal Nath, has stood firm, suggesting that the United States and Europe were intransigent in keeping farm subsidies and other trade barriers high, hurting the world's poor. India charges that American farm subsidies especially keep American farm products artificially competitive against imports.
 Though Mr. Nath maintained that trade talks were still mired in a conflict between rich and poor countries, recent developments suggest that a cleavage has indeed opened up among developing countries, with some emerging economies not wanting China, India and Brazil to speak for them.
 India and Brazil, for instance, call for phased-in reductions of tariffs on manufactured goods that would leave the highest tariffs at roughly 30 percent, though there were hints they could live with a level of 25 percent.
 The United States and Europe, which would reduce their own industrial tariffs to a few percentage points, say that India and Brazil have taken a hard line because of a fear of imports from China and other export-driven economies. India fears more specifically that its auto industry could be nearly wiped out by Chinese imports.
 A new bloc of exporting countries are proposing a more conciliatory approach by suggesting a range for tariffs of the upper teens to the low twenties for the most protected products. This new ''middle ground'' bloc is led by Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, China, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Thailand.
 Brazil is considered pivotal in future negotiations because many analysts say it stands to gain the most from a trade deal as a superpower exporter of industrial goods and also a wide range of food products, from sugar to fruits and vegetables. Its position is considered likely to be more flexible than India's.
 Celso Amorim, the Brazilian foreign minister and trade envoy, has been less willing to attack the West than Mr. Nath, but he denies that there is a rift between Brazil and India and other poor countries. ''We are on the same wave length in terms of unity and mobilization,'' he said in Geneva this month.
 The United States, meanwhile, is still under pressure to do more on its own to reduce its farm subsidies. Current law allows the United States to subsidize farm products, if it so chooses, to nearly $50 billion a year. But in the last three years, world food prices have been so high that American subsidies have not come close to that level.
 Last year, for example, the United States paid $12 billion to subsidize farm products that compete with imports from other countries. That is the level at which India and Brazil want the United States to keep its so-called trade-distorting subsidies in the future.
 The Bush administration argues that $12 billion was unusually low and that its offer of a ceiling of $17 billion was below the levels of much of the last 10 years. Ms. Schwab has also hinted that the United States might reduce the level further if it saw flexibility from India and Brazil. 
 Outside the picture are the 60 or 70 poorest countries that stand to benefit the most from a trade deal, including countries in Africa and the poorest parts of Latin America and Asia. In a speech in Africa last week, Ms. Schwab said that 70 percent of the tariffs paid by poor countries went to other poor countries.
 Ms. Schwab has also repeatedly called on China to show more leadership in promoting an international trade deal. But many trade experts say that China is deliberately lying low to avoid stoking fears of its products in the developing world.
 ''A lot of developing countries are seized with the idea that if they undertake tariff reductions, they're going to be overrun by Chinese goods,'' said William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council in Washington, a lobbying group. ''It's going to be hard to disabuse them of that fear.''

HEADLINE: Getting Hezbollah to Behave

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS NOE. 
Nicholas Noe, a founder and the editor in chief of Mideastwire.com, is the editor of the forthcoming ''Voice of Hezbollah: The Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.''

 BODY:
Beirut, Lebanon
 ONE year after Israel's devastating 34-day war with Hezbollah, it seems as though both sides are readying themselves for another round. Recent statements by American and Israeli officials, as well as the United Nations, assert that Hezbollah has largely re-equipped and refortified, compliments of Syria and Iran. On the other side of the border, the news media report that the Israeli Defense Force has done the same, with, of course, the help of American military aid. 
 Given what may be a regional movement toward conflict, the United States and Israel would do well to pause and take stock of the nonviolent alternatives that Hezbollah itself says would lead it to shun military action. Indeed, the best way to contain Hezbollah may be to give it some of what it says it wants. 
 Since its official founding in 1985, Hezbollah has seen its argument, not to mention its capacity, for violence repeatedly buoyed by what the group calls the ''open wars'' waged by Israel against it (and invariably against the rest of Lebanon, too) in 1993, 1996 and again in 2006.
 In contrast, when the confrontational approach has receded -- most notably after Israel ended its 22-year occupation of Lebanon in 2000 -- Hezbollah's ability and desire to use violence receded as well. 
 And therein lies an alternative strategy available to Israel and the United States: gradually and peacefully containing Hezbollah violence by undermining public support for resistance operations.
 For without widespread public support from Lebanese of all religious persuasions, Muslim and Christian alike -- especially now that the Syrian enforcers have ostensibly left Lebanon -- violent operations would not only be extremely difficult, Hezbollah leaders acknowledge, but also domestically hazardous for their Shiite base. 
 This is precisely the reason that Hezbollah, since the 2000 Israeli withdrawal, has reduced its overt military presence and taken part in Lebanese politics in ways that it once would have avoided as corrupting or unnecessary, including a cabinet portfolio in 2005 and a surprisingly sturdy alliance in 2006 with the main Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun. This may be also why Hezbollah has been so uncharacteristically quiet in the confrontation between the Lebanese Army, which is enjoying a surge of public support at the moment, and Qaeda-inspired militants at the Palestinian refugee camp Nahr al Bared in northern Lebanon. 
 Undermine the rationale for violence directed at Israel -- a rationale which, like it or not, is accepted by a great many Lebanese -- and you have gone a long way toward reducing Hezbollah's ability to act violently both along the border and even farther afield (that is if the American assertions of Hezbollah involvement in Iraq are to be believed).
 In the meantime, you will have also pushed Hezbollah further into the muck of ''normal'' Lebanese politicking -- an unflattering arena in which the Party of God is already uncharacteristically flip-flopping a- round, hurling accusations of ''collaboration'' at one moment while at the next suggesting the formation of a ''national unity'' government with some of those same ''collaborators.''
 For this oblique form of containment to work, however, the United States must first address what Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has long termed the ''four bleeding wounds'' that engender public support for his party's use of violence against Israel. 
 These are the handing over of maps of the land mines the Israelis left in South Lebanon during the occupation; the return of all Lebanese prisoners; an end to Israeli overflights of Lebanon (which are arguably unnecessary in any case); and, finally, Israel's relinquishing of the disputed Shebaa Farms area, which, according to a report last week in the Israeli daily Haaretz, the United Nations may declare as Lebanese by the end of the month. 
 As Mr. Nasrallah put it shortly after the last successful prisoner exchange with Israel in 2004, ''These fools do not learn from their past mistakes: when they withdrew from Lebanon, they continued to occupy the Shebaa Farms and kept our brothers in custody.'' By doing that, Mr. Nasrallah said of the Israelis, ''they opened the door for us.''
 Of course, one could argue that even if these ''bleeding wounds'' were removed, Hezbollah would simply invent other excuses to justify attacks. That's certainly plausible, given that the Party of God views ''resistance'' as a fundamental principle, but the point is that these new excuses would undoubtedly be viewed as such: as false choices presented by one party bent on accomplishing its own narrow, even non-Lebanese interests.
 And that possibility is one that would only further restrict Hezbollah's actions, just as it finds itself already restricted by its ever-expanding web of political alliances. 
 By heeding Mr. Nasrallah's advice and removing the ''bleeding wounds,'' the United States and its allies in Europe could then help to unleash exactly the kind of broad-based political, economic and military reform that would further convince Hezbollah and its supporters that the use of violence has become both unnecessary and, ultimately, counterproductive.
 In the process, Israel and the United States too might also finally begin to learn some of the lessons of their past and present mistakes in Lebanon.

HEADLINE: Future Energy That Generates Profits Today

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ALTERNATIVE energy is considered to be good for the environment and good for the soul, but not so good as a way to make money. Generating power from renewable sources like wind, the sun and the earth's own heat has a reputation for being unprofitable without government subsidies or sky-high energy prices.
 But for shareholders of a specialist mutual fund, it has been an easy way to generate smart returns. Guinness Atkinson Alternative Energy has returned close to 40 percent so far this year, better than all conventional energy funds in the database of the research firm Morningstar. 
 The rising cost of fossil fuels undoubtedly accounts for part of the performance. There must be more to it than that, however, because the fund showed healthy gains earlier in the year when mainstream energy prices were falling.
 Edward Guinness, the fund's co-manager, points out that demand is surging continually for wind turbines, solar panels and similar devices as consumers come to recognize that supplies of conventional energy will diminish or become harder to locate. At the same time, the industry has become more adept at managing the growth and profiting from it.
 ''These are serious going concerns with good management teams taking them through a period of fast growth,'' he said. Unlike other technologies of the recent past that captured investors' imagination, like biotechnology and the Internet, Mr. Guinness estimates that 85 percent of the three dozen or so companies in his portfolio will be profitable this year.
 ''As energy prices rise, more technologies become financially viable, which allows them to manufacture in scale and bring costs down,'' he explained. ''The field opens up more and more for alternative energy to play a substantial role'' in supplying power.
 Mr. Guinness, whose firm also runs much larger portfolios focusing on traditional forms of energy, favors three segments of the renewable sector: wind, solar and geothermal. The business model for the last one resembles the oil industry a century ago: invest money upfront, stick a hole in the ground and bank the profits as the earth's heat is transferred, usually through steam or superheated saltwater, to electricity generators.
 The fund owns stocks of two companies that do this on an industrial scale, Ormat in the United States and Geodynamics in Australia. A third holding is W.F.I. Industries, a Canadian company that amounts to a geothermal boutique, supplying pumps and pipes that are buried in backyards to power individual homes.
 Wind was one of the first renewable sources to be commercially viable. Turbine manufacturing is especially profitable today, Mr. Guinness said, because demand is outstripping supply, sending prices higher.
 He anticipates 25 percent annual sales growth for the sector over the next five years. His preferred vehicles for capturing it are the Danish company Vestas, regarded as the industry leader, and Gamesa in Spain.
 Solar is less profitable but Mr. Guinness finds its long-term growth prospects more auspicious. He anticipates 30 percent to 40 percent annual sales increases.
 ''Solar could grow a hundredfold over 15 years,'' he said. ''It's an incredibly attractive area to invest in.''
 He has doubled the solar component of his portfolio in recent months to 30 percent of assets. His choices include SunTech Power and Q-Cells, solar cell makers based in China and Germany, respectively, and MEMC Electronic Materials, a Missouri company that produces silicon wafers used to coat the cells.
 TWO other holdings that do big business in solar are the Renewable Energy Corporation in Norway and the Colorado company Solar World.
 Mr. Guinness added that he was shunning some of the larger solar businesses, like SunPower and Energy Conversion Devices, because their valuations are too rich. He is also wary of whole segments of the renewable energy industry, like fuel cells, which show little likelihood of winning in the marketplace, and ethanol because the plant materials used to make it are too expensive. 
 But he emphasized that he considers them exceptions in a field with a future that holds much promise and opportunity for those who want to do good and to do right by themselves financially, too.
 ''We see ourselves at the foothills of a long period of steady growth at high levels,'' Mr. Guinness said. ''We're just now beginning to enter the sweet spot where costs are going down and the technologies are becoming economically viable with fossil-fuel technologies. That is going to support significant demand growth.''

HEADLINE: A Blockbuster Seller Overseas: Stakes in Corporate America

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
AMERICAN companies have never been more popular overseas than they are now.
 That is true, at least, when it comes to foreign investors sending money to the companies.
 The United States Treasury Department reported this week that foreign investors put $68.6 billion in American corporate bonds in May and $42.5 billion in American stocks. Both figures were the largest ever for a month. 
 The monthly figures can be volatile, but in this case they were continuing trends already in place. The accompanying charts show monthly figures averaged over six months, a period long enough to filter out random volatility. Both of them are also at records.
 The investments in stocks may be the most interesting, if only because foreign investors have a poor reputation for market timing almost everywhere. They tend to get in to markets when they are hot, and to flee after they cool off. That has historically been true of American investors overseas and of foreign investors in the United States.
 Until this year, the biggest one-month investment by foreigners in American stocks came in February 2000, when they put $27.6 billion to work. That figure was not exceeded until April of this year, when the investments just topped that figure, totaling $28.1 billion before leaping in May.
 Early 2000 was among the worst times ever to get into the American market, however. The technology stock bubble began to deflate in March, and share prices fell sharply until they hit bottom in late 2002. Foreign investors were slow to realize the party was over, with inflows that averaged $14 billion a month in the last half of 2000.
 But by 2002 foreign investors had had enough. During the six-month period ended in February 2003 -- the period when prices hit bottom and began to recover -- foreign investors put very little money into American stocks.
 Bond investors do not have as bad a record as market timers, although the first significant rise in foreign bond purchases shown in the chart -- in the mid-1980s -- came as the dollar showed surprising strength. Many of those buyers ended up with dollar-denominated assets just as the dollar was falling. The latest rise in bond investing has come when the dollar is relatively weak against the euro, but doing well against the Japanese yen.
 It should be noted that the Treasury figures show the country from which investments were made, which can be different from the residences of the actual investors. Much of the money going into American stocks comes from the Caribbean, the domicile of many hedge funds, and even more comes from Britain, where money managers draw money from investors around the world. 
 China, which these days has huge amounts of dollars to invest, has been a growing investor in American corporate bonds, but has not yet shown much appetite for American stocks. And Japan, which was a heavy buyer of American stocks when prices were low in 2002, has become a net seller of shares this year.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Offer Assurances To Calm Investors' Jitters

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The jittery credit markets made investors sweat this week as the country's biggest banks reported second-quarter earnings. But Wall Street's message was served up like a cold glass of lemonade: Relax, we'll work through this even as we put away more money to cover future loan losses.
 Although the big banks reported generally strong second-quarter results, investors appeared to be bracing for tougher times. Shares of Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan fell slightly yesterday on a day that the Dow Jones industrial average declined 149.33 points. 
 ''There is more emotional fear out there than rational analysis going on,'' said David A. Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in New York. On conference calls this week, bank executives chose their words carefully as they addressed those anxieties.
 Concerned about the shaky subprime securities market? The banks said they were monitoring it and reducing their exposure. ''We are on a track that is a positive track,'' Citigroup's chief financial officer, Gary L. Crittenden, said. ''But this is a very uncertain environment.''
 Hung up about ''bridge'' loan losses if the banks cannot find investors to buy the high-risk, buyout financing? The banks were not happy but not fretting. ''If we get stuck with the loans, we won't like it but we'll be O.K.,'' said James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, one of the biggest providers of buyout financing.
 What about a slowdown among American consumers? For the most part, the banks said they are not seeing it. ''From all that we can see, they are holding up very well,'' Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said. ''As long as you have unemployment and wages growing, you are going to have a relatively healthy consumer.''
 Over all, the big banks in the second quarter posted some of their strongest results ever, spurred by their investment banking businesses. Yesterday, Citigroup reported second-quarter net income of $6.23 billion, up 18 percent from the same period a year earlier.
 Citigroup's growth was fueled by a 34 percent surge in international revenue, in part from a string of small acquisitions that its chairman and chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, has made a centerpiece of his strategy. Mr. Prince also made some progress in his effort to rein in expenses, though the bulk of an expected $2.1 billion in cost savings for 2007 will come later this year. 
 Citigroup's consumer operations in North America, however, continued to struggle as profit fell 15 percent, to $2.7 billion, because of deteriorating credit conditions.
 Other banks also posted strong quarters. On Thursday, Bank of America said its earnings rose 5.2 percent, to $5.76 billion, after a solid performance from its investment bank and unusually large private equity gains. JPMorgan announced that its profit rose to $4.2 billion, up 20 percent after a blow-out quarter from its investment bank.
 Even so, there are signs that risk is spreading. The housing market is in its worst slump in more than a decade. Consumers who bought homes they were stretching to afford are falling behind on their payments as interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages reset.
 Executives at Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo acknowledge deterioration in the credit quality of home equity loans, particularly those sold by third-party distributors and in regions of the country where home prices are weak or flat.
 In response, the banks are setting aside more money to cover potential losses. Citigroup put away $2.52 billion in the second quarter to cover bad loans, up 75 percent from last year. Bank of America increased its reserves by 80 percent; at JPMorgan, there was 300 percent increase. 
 But some of the biggest sources of worry stem from the banks' potential exposure to the subprime securities market. Those fears were exacerbated earlier this week when Bear Stearns announced that the value of two hedge funds backed by subprime mortgages worth $1.5 billion had disintegrated.
 Delinquency rates among subprime borrowers in the first quarter reached their highest levels since 2002, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. At the end of March, 13.8 percent of all subprime loans were 30 days past due and 5.1 percent were in foreclosure. In the same quarter a year ago, 11.5 percent were 30 days past due and 3.5 percent were in foreclosure.
 A JPMorgan forecast projected that by the end of 2008, nearly half of the economy's $500 billion in risky adjustable mortgages facing higher interests rates would have trouble refinancing, five times the amount this year. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Crittenden of Citigroup said that he expected conditions to ''deteriorate in the second part of the year'' but was confident of the company's ability to manage the risks. In anticipation, he said, the bank cut its $26 billion portfolio of high-yielding mortgage and other asset backed securities in half to reduce its exposure.
 Investors were also concerned about so-called equity bridges, which provide upfront cash to private equity firms in buyout deals. The loans, which carry high interest rates, provide short-term financing until longer-term, junk-bond debt can be sold to investors. But banks are on the hook if no buyers can be found.
 JPMorgan said it was dealing with a ''couple'' of so-called hung bridge loans. Citigroup acknowledged four deals where it was unable to sell the risky debt, and said it could find itself in similar situations. 
 Mr. Crittenden said he anticipated that would result in a reduction in revenue, but told investors that the difficulty placing the debt was related to pricing, not credit.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about efforts by Wall Street banks to reassure investors that the financial industry is strong rendered incorrectly a word in a quotation from Kenneth D. Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Bank of America, who commented on consumer spending. He said, ''As long as you have employment and wages growing, you are going to have a relatively healthy consumer.'' He did not say ''unemployment.''

HEADLINE: White House and Military Say Iraq Report Will Be Ready in September

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and DAVID S. CLOUD; Stephen Farrell and Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting from Baghdad.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
The White House and senior military officers vowed Friday that an important assessment on progress in Iraq would be delivered by the Sept. 15 deadline set by Congress, even if it takes weeks longer to compile a more complete judgment on the current troop increase.
 A day after the No. 2 American commander in Iraq said it would take ''at least until November'' to complete a full assessment, Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said neither the White House nor military officers in Baghdad were asking for more time before reporting to Congress on progress in Iraq. 
 ''We're not trying to sort of change the ball game,'' Mr. Snow said. ''We understand what the reporting requirements are. But I think as we've also demonstrated, there have been significant results,'' he said, ''and it is worth people taking a measure of what's going on.'' 
 Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the American commander who made the comments on Thursday, issued a statement from his headquarters in Iraq clarifying his previous remarks.
 ''There is no intention to push our reporting requirement beyond September,'' the statement said. ''Nothing I said yesterday should be interpreted to suggest otherwise. My reference to November was simply suggesting that as we go forward beyond September, we will gain more understanding of trends.''
 Yet two other American generals in Iraq appealed Friday for more time to carry out the troop increase in their respective areas west and south of Baghdad.
 In an interview, Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, commander of the Third Infantry Division, which has been deployed into the volatile areas south of Baghdad, reiterated his fears that lessening the American combat commitment before next summer could allow insurgents to retake old ground before the Iraqi security forces can do the job.
 General Lynch said it would take until fall just for American troops to finish clearing the areas south of Baghdad of insurgents, and that it would take until next summer for the Iraqi security forces ''to meet that sustained security presence.'' 
 An American pullout any sooner, he said, risks losing the hard-fought ground that United States soldiers have gained over the past few months. Since April 4, he said, 56 men under his command have been killed. ''It would be wrong to have fought and won that terrain, only to give it back,'' he said.
 Maj. Gen. Walter E. Gaskin, the commander of American forces in western Anbar Province, warned that the Iraqi government and security forces would not be ready to take over security responsibilities for two years. General Gaskin said his forces had ''turned the corner'' in Anbar, where Sunni tribes have turned on the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
 Meanwhile, Gen. James T. Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps, said Friday in an address at the National Press Club in Washington that a premature withdrawal could fuel Islamic extremists, spread terrorism and force the United States back into Iraq, according to The Associated Press. The A.P. also reported that Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, had said Iraqi security forces would be unlikely to assume control of the country by the end of the year, a goal of the Iraqi government.
 President Bush said Friday that Congress had an obligation to give American troops the time and money to carry out the administration's strategy.
 After a meeting with military veterans and family members, Mr. Bush went to the White House Rose Garden to say, ''It is time to rise above partisanship, stand behind our troops in the field and give them everything they need to succeed. ''I also ask Congress to give our troops time to carry out our new strategy in Iraq,'' he added. ''Like all wars, the fight in Iraq has had frustrating setbacks. It has also had important successes.''
 While administration officials and military commanders describe the Sept. 15 report as an update on trends in Iraq, many senior members of Congress -- including some top Republicans -- view the date as the deadline for deciding on the future course of the war.
 Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who serves as Senate minority leader, said Friday that ''September is the month that we're looking at. There may be various generals or various politicians or others who want to mention some other key time. But I think the key time for the vast majority of my members is September, and it certainly is for me.''
 However, senior Pentagon officials and military officers say there is yet no formal plan for the future mission in Iraq, since no decision has been made for the duration of the troop increase nor for what duties would be assigned to those troops who remain on the ground.
 Also on Friday, Pentagon officials said that the former Soviet republic of Georgia, which is developing stronger ties with the United States, has agreed to send one military brigade to Iraq.
 The officials said that a brigade in the Georgian military has a few thousand troops, smaller than an American brigade, and that final details are now being worked out for the unit's mission and possible equipment needs. The unit may deploy to Iraq as early as next month.
 In other developments, State Department officials said that three new provincial reconstruction teams would begin work in the Baghdad region starting in September.
 By last year, there were 10 of the teams, which assist in economic and political development at the local and provincial level, and 10 more were organized after Mr. Bush's announcement of a troop increase in January.

HEADLINE: Veteran Democratic Bulldog Guards House Turf on Energy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20 

 BODY:
He just turned 81, his voice has become frail and his hands often shake uncontrollably. In recent weeks, he has walked with crutches because of leg pains. But make no mistake: Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan has not mellowed.
 As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, first elected to Congress in 1955 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, Mr. Dingell has probably fought more fights, intimidated more adversaries and pushed through more legislation than any other Democrat in the House.
 But House Democratic leaders, hoping to pass an ''energy independence'' bill this month, have had to delay taking the measure to the floor for weeks. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies want a hefty increase in fuel-economy requirements for cars, light trucks and S.U.V.'s, but they are finding that it is not easy to maneuver around Mr. Dingell, who wants a smaller increase that would be less painful for Detroit automakers. 
 The power struggle pits a towering committee chairman, long accustomed to running his own show, against the first female House speaker, who has her own ambitious agenda. 
 When Ms. Pelosi, of California, created a new committee on energy independence and global warming in January, Mr. Dingell attacked it as a potential encroachment on his turf. Though she assured him the new panel would have no legislative authority, he remarked that it would be an ''embarassment'' and ''as useful as feathers on a fish.''
 Behind the scenes, Mr. Dingell fumes that Ms. Pelosi and other comparatively young House leaders are trying to dictate his schedule and his priorities. He grumbles about colleagues who are too ''ideological,'' too impatient and too unrealistic about the costs of slowing global warming. He implies that Ms. Pelosi cares more about being ''green'' in California than about blue-collar workers in Michigan. 
 ''I've had conflicts with speakers before,'' he said in a lunchtime interview, as he wolfed down a peanut-butter sandwich in an antechamber next to his committee's hearing room. ''This is not the first time.''
 Were younger House leaders trying to push him aside?
 ''Let them try; let them try,'' he replied. ''They won't be able to do it.''
 The first big showdown will be the pending energy bill, which House leaders originally hoped to pass soon after July 4. Mr. Dingell's committee has approved a measure that omits any change in fuel-economy requirements. Ms. Pelosi and many other Democrats want to add a tough requirement, much like one the Senate passed in June, as an amendment on the House floor.
 But they are loath to try until they are sure they have enough votes to win. If they cannot muster the votes, House Democrats figure they can adopt the Senate measure during a House-Senate conference. But even that is dicey: Mr. Dingell is likely to be the senior House Democrat in that conference.
 Despite the open conflict, environmentalists say Mr. Dingell can be either a crucial ally or an implacable foe -- and no one knows which he will be this time. 
 ''This is a completely different place now, and I don't think John gets that,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia.
 MoveOn.org, the liberal political activist group, recently ran radio advertisements in Mr. Dingell's district accusing him of being a ''dinosaur'' -- a ''dingellsaurus'' -- on environmental issues.
 Last month, Mr. Dingell infuriated Ms. Pelosi and many Democrats on his own committee by drafting an energy bill that would have blocked California and other states from passing their own restrictions on carbon-dioxide emissions from automobiles.
 After an outcry from many Democrats and a sharp no from Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Dingell postponed what he called the ''more controversial'' issues until his committee took up a global warming bill in the fall. 
 Gone was any requirement for higher mileage in cars and S.U.V.'s, which Ms. Pelosi wanted. Gone was any prohibition against states setting their own emission rules for cars, which Mr. Dingell wanted. Gone were all the subsidies for coal-based diesel fuels, which Democrats from coal-producing states wanted. What is left is a comparatively bland bill that would impose higher efficiency standards for electrical appliances, machinery and buildings, increase loan guarantees for companies producing renewable fuels and provide research money for new energy technology.
 By contrast, the Senate last month approved energy legislation that would increase average mileage standards to 35 miles per gallon for cars and S.U.V.'s alike by 2020. Cars now must average 27.5 miles per gallon, and light trucks and S.U.V.'s need to get 21.6.
 Even environmentalists say Mr. Dingell is a masterful legislator who has helped pass landmark environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste sites.
 ''I use him as a sterling example of an effective legislator,'' said Philip Sharp, a former Democratic representative from Indiana who served for years on Mr. Dingell's committee and is now head of Resources for the Future, an environmental policy research group. And despite his own misgivings about rules that might hurt automakers, Mr. Dingell was instrumental in a major expansion of the Clean Air Act in 1990 to reduce pollution that causes acid rain. ''I've gotten more legislation passed on conservation and the environment than anybody else in this place,'' Mr. Dingell boasted. ''I know how to build legislation from the center.''
 He also knows how to keep his adversaries off balance.
 In a nod to his environmental critics, Mr. Dingell vowed to come up with a major bill in the fall to reduce heat-trapping gases 60 percent to 80 percent over the next four decades. But a few days later, he declared that his legislation would include a steep ''carbon tax'' on fuels that emit carbon dioxide -- an approach that many Democratic leaders view as political suicide -- in part to highlight the unpopular cost of slowing global warming. 
 Three weeks ago, Mr. Dingell took pains to look collaborative as he stood next to Ms. Pelosi at a news conference to promote a package of ''energy independence'' measures drafted by almost a dozen separate committees. ''Let me say how proud I am to work with you and work under your leadership,'' Mr. Dingell said. ''I do want to congratulate you, Madame Speaker, on the work that you are doing.''
 But where Ms. Pelosi says global warming is her top domestic priority, Mr. Dingell as recently as December expressed doubt about the scientific consensus on global warming. He has not seen ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the Oscar-winning documentary on global warming starring former Vice President Al Gore. 
 Today, Mr. Dingell says he is convinced that global warming is an urgent problem, but doubts that most people understand the enormous costs involved in addressing it. 
 ''First of all, I think the scientific question has been resolved,'' he said in an interview. ''Second of all, I think the political question has been resolved. Our problem now is to write the best legislation we can.''
 Beyond tactical calculations and nose-counting, Mr. Dingell almost certainly has his eye on bargaining for other kinds of Congressional support for automakers. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have all pleaded for help in reducing health care and pension costs for employees and retirees -- a cost that has been estimated at about $1,000 per vehicle and is not borne by car companies in most other countries.
 Mr. Dingell is cagey about what he truly wants to accomplish. ''We'll see to it that we produce the rules that are needed,'' he said. ''We'll see to it that it doesn't cost jobs and doesn't hurt the economy. We'll see to it that we don't throw away jobs or our industrial leadership.''
 But when pressed to name his own personal wish list, he balked.
 ''Do I know what the hell is in this bill?'' he retorted when pressed about his goals. ''No, I don't know. The process will produce it. I'm going to lead so they can come up with sound policy.''

STRIKE POSSIBLE AT DELPHI A union representing more than 2,000 hourly workers at the Delphi Corporation, the auto parts maker, said it had told the company that it planned to terminate its contract, a first step toward a possible strike in October. The International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers-Communications Workers of America said the notification was delivered in a letter earlier this week. A union executive, Willie Thorpe, said in a statement that given the current state of the talks, ''a strike is a real possibility, and we need to act accordingly.'' He added, however, ''There is still much time to change our course.''
 Lindsey Williams, a spokesman for Delphi, said that talks continued with the union. He said the company, based in Troy, Mich., did not plan to comment on communications between it and the union. On Thursday, Delphi made more progress toward emerging from bankruptcy protection when a court approved a settlement with the United Auto Workers. Delphi's emergence from bankruptcy is expected before the end of the year. The settlement with the U.A.W., Delphi's largest union, cuts wages for many longtime workers but secures thousands of jobs at plants that once were in jeopardy. Deals still need to be reached with five other unions, including the electronics and communications union. (AP) 
 WHIRLPOOL PROFIT The Whirlpool Corporation, the appliance maker, said profit rose 77 percent on an increase in Latin American sales and lower tax payments, but an unexpected increase in the cost of raw materials sent the shares down 4.2 percent. Second-quarter net income increased to $161 million, or $2 a share, from $91 million, or $1.14, a year earlier, the company said. Excluding a 27-cent benefit from a reduced tax rate in the quarter, profit would have been $1.73 a share, missing analysts' estimates by 14 cents.
 Whirlpool said costs for raw materials and fuel would jump a record $570 million this year, more than the $500 million the company predicted in April. Whirlpool has closed plants and is laying off at least 4,500 workers, including 730 in the quarter, to lower expenses since its acquisition last year of the Maytag Corporation. Revenue rose 2.5 percent, to $4.85 billion, missing estimates of $4.95 billion. North American revenue dropped 6 percent. Sales in Latin America gained 29 percent, to $822 million, while European revenue rose 10 percent, to $900 million. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 PROFIT AT SURGICAL TOOL MAKERIntuitive Surgical, a maker of robotic surgical systems, reported an 84 percent increase in quarterly earnings helped by an increase in sales of instruments and accessories, and raised its 2007 revenue growth outlook. The company said it now expected total revenue to grow 45 to 50 percent over 2006, compared with its previous forecast of a 40 percent growth. It had reported total revenue of $372.7 million in 2006. The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes the da Vinci surgical systems, which are used for urology and gynecology surgeries. 
 For the second quarter, the company earned $30.7 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $16.7 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 61 percent, to $140.2 million. Revenue from the instruments and accessories segment rose 76 percent, to $45.8 million, for the quarter. Sales of the company's primary product, da Vinci surgical systems, rose 54 percent, to $74.1 million. (REUTERS)
 DRUG MAKER ACQUIRED A Swedish pharmaceutical company, Meda, agreed to buy MedPointe for $520 million in cash and 17.5 million new shares. MedPointe's main shareholders, the private equity firms the Carlyle Group and the Cypress Group, will keep a total stake in Meda of about 6 percent. ''The acquisition establishes Meda as a world-class specialty pharma company with full marketing coverage both in the U.S. and Europe,'' Meda said. The combined entity will have revenue of about $1.4 billion. MedPointe, which focuses on allergy/respiratory and pain relief treatments, had 2006 net sales of $252 million. Its biggest products are Astelin, a nasal spray, and Optivar, which treats allergic conjunctivitis. (AP) 
 BIOVAIL DRUG SETBACK The Biovail Corporation, the Canadian drug maker, said regulators in the United States had turned down the company's application to market a new form of the antidepressant Wellbutrin XL. The shares fell the most in a year. The Food and Drug Administration questioned the design of studies submitted in support of approval, the company, based in Mississauga, Ontario, said in a statement. Company officials will meet with the agency to discuss a resolution, a Biovail spokesman, Nelson Isabel, said.
 A new, patented successor to Wellbutrin XL, Biovail's lead product, would help the company fight growing generic competition. Wellbutrin XL otherwise may be overtaken by cheaper copies, said Claude Camire, an analyst at Paradigm Capital in Toronto. The drug contributed $420 million to Biovail's $1.1 billion in total sales in 2006, he said. Stock in Biovail fell 22 percent. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 NEW FLU VACCINE PLANTSanofi-Aventis has finished building an influenza vaccine plant that eventually will triple the company's production of shots in the United States. The $150 million plant will make 100 million shots annually as soon as the end of 2008, Wayne Pisano, senior vice president of commercial operations for Sanofi's United States vaccine unit, said at a news conference in Swiftwater, Pa., where the plant is located. When the new plant opens, Sanofi will close and retrofit another plant nearby that makes about 50 million shots a year, using $77.4 million from the United States and $25 million of its own money. Sanofi-Aventis is based in Paris.

 BRITAIN'S ECONOMY GROWS British economic growth unexpectedly quickened in the second quarter as manufacturing rebounded, evidence that higher interest rates had yet to cool expansion. Gross domestic product increased 0.8 percent, compared with 0.7 percent in the first quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. The annual growth rate was 3 percent, the same as the previous three months. The report, the first for second-quarter growth among the Group of 7 countries, may bolster the case for the Bank of England to keep raising the benchmark rate, after five increases, to 5.75 percent. The economy has now expanded for 60 quarters, driven by a boom in London's financial services industry. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HEADLINE: China Raises Rates Again

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
China raised interest rates yesterday for the third time since March to try to cool the fastest pace of economic growth in 12 years and to restrain inflation. 
 The benchmark one-year lending rate will rise 0.27 percentage point to an eight-year high of 6.84 percent tomorrow, the People's Bank of China said. The deposit rate will increase by the same amount, to 3.33 percent, and a tax on interest income will be cut on Aug. 15 to encourage saving.
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao failed to slow lending and investment fueled by record exports, propelling second-quarter growth to 11.9 percent over the period a year earlier. As well as raising interest rates, the government has ordered banks five times this year to set aside larger money reserves. Consumer prices rose the most in 33 months in June, factory and property spending have surged, and the leading stock index has almost doubled in value this year.
 The yuan fell 0.14 percent against the dollar, to 7.5740, extending its decline after the announcement, which came in the final minutes of trading. China is under pressure to allow faster currency appreciation to slow the flood of money into the economy from exports and ease trade tensions with the United States and Europe.

HEADLINE: Businesses Near Blast Worry About Repayment

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN; Cara Buckley, Colin Moynihan and Dalton Walker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Three days after a steam pipe explosion shut down parts of Midtown Manhattan, a big question for those affected by the blast is whether and how they will be compensated for property damage and economic losses to their businesses. 
 The losses could run into tens of millions of dollars, economists say. Thousands of people have been shut out of offices and shops near the explosion at Lexington Avenue and 41st Street since Wednesday.
 Con Edison, which owns the underground steam system, has said it will pay for damage, including replacing clothing worn by people who were showered with mud and debris. Chris Olert, a Con Ed spokesman, said the company also agreed to pay for all of the cleanup, both in buildings and on the streets and sidewalk. He said the company did not have an estimate of the total cost. 
 Con Ed has not indicated whether it will reimburse businesses for financial losses caused by the closing of the ''frozen zone'' around the explosion site. Mr. Olert said that businesses could submit requests for reimbursement, and that the company's lawyers would review them on a case-by-case basis. The company's critics, however, are bracing for a fight, contending that Con Ed is likely to try to limit its payments. 
 Because the explosion involved the steam system, Con Edison is not bound by state regulations on reimbursements in the case of electricity failures, according to James Denn, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission in Albany. (This month, the maximum reimbursement under state law for economic damages caused by electrical failures rose to $9,000 from $7,000 for businesses.) 
 To help businesses shuttered by the steam explosion, Robert W. Walsh, the commissioner of the city's Small Business Services Department, said the city would be offering interest-free $10,000 loans. Mr. Walsh said about 125 street-level retail shops were affected by sealing the area near the blast. 
 But the loans from the city and reimbursements from Con Edison may cover only a fraction of the actual economic losses. 
 ''They are going to end up denying all of those applications,'' said Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, referring to requests for reimbursements. Mr. Gianaris, who represents neighborhoods in Queens affected by last July's nine-day blackout, said, ''We learned that the hard way.'' 
 Con Ed paid out $13.8 million on 40,478 claims from that power failure, Mr. Olert said, but Mr. Gianaris contends that those payments were far from sufficient. 
 The city has not yet produced an estimate of the blast's economic effect, though John Tepper Marlin, a former chief economist for the city comptroller's office, said the lost business income could be between $10 million and $30 million through Thursday night. 
 Leo Goswami, 50, who owns a news shop, Optimo, at 334 Lexington Avenue, just up from East 39th Street, said he was already racking up losses.
 ''The nutshell is that for small-business owners, this is an economic disaster,'' he said as he stood in front of his shop. ''Our margins are so small, it takes a month to recover for every business day lost.''
 Mr. Goswami, who said he has not missed a day's work since he opened 20 years ago, guessed that he was losing $1,000 a day. Theo, 57, and Stelios Groutas, 54, brothers who own Scotty's Diner next door at 336 Lexington Avenue, said their daily losses topped $5,000. Raj Najpal, who owns Bombay Grill, at 344 Lexington, said he was losing about $2,500 every day his restaurant was shut.
 Con Edison said yesterday that it had restored steam service to 13 of the 18 customers who lost steam power in the explosion. It expects to restore steam to the rest over the next few days. Mr. Olert said the company's crews would start working inside the crater today, once the red tow truck that fell in it is removed. City officials said they were uncertain when the area closest to the crater would return to normal.
 The driver of the tow truck, Gregory McCullough, remained in critical condition at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital yesterday.
 A woman who was believed to have been with him in the truck cab, Judith Bailey, 31, suffered less serious injuries and was in far better condition but also remained hospitalized at NewYork-Presbyterian. They apparently were returning from the Bronx, where they dropped her car off, and were heading to Brooklyn, where she lives.
 Shortly after 3 p.m. yesterday, Ms. Bailey was seen walking down a corridor of the eighth-floor burn unit accompanied by a female friend or relative. She seemed to move without pain, and politely declined to comment.
 Once Mr. McCullough's truck is removed, Con Ed plans to stabilize the gas and power lines around the site and then replace the damaged parts of the ruptured steam main. Afterward, the company will begin analyzing the damaged parts to learn what caused the explosion, Mr. Olert said.
 Engineers from the state Department of Public Service, which oversees utilities, have begun a preliminary investigation into the explosion, said Mr. Denn, adding that they would go into the crater as soon as possible. The engineers will report their findings to the Public Service Commission. ''They are very qualified to review and make determinations to try to reconstruct what happened,'' he said. 
 For business owners on the Midtown blocks now sealed off by police tape, the wait for answers and reimbursement continues. 
 Mr. Goswami managed to open his shop yesterday, even though it is in the restricted zone. He sold newspapers or bottles of water by fetching the goods and then handing them to customers over the police tape. He said he was desperate to make even a few dollars to offset his losses.
 Mr. Goswami's monthly rent for the shop is $3,000, the Groutases' is $16,000, and Mr. Najpal's $9,700. They all live in different neighborhoods in Queens, but have formed a tight friendship over the years by working on the same Midtown block. 
 Theo Groutas was especially worried about being closed over the weekend, usually his most lucrative time. He and his brother have been fielding calls from their 25 workers.
 ''Savings? I have no savings, I've been using my Visa,'' Mr. Groutas said. ''To have money, I have to work.''

HEADLINE: West of Broadway, and Hudson River, Stage Is Their World

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: BASKING RIDGE, N.J. 

 BODY:
In a public park just beyond the volleyball court, in the mosquito-mottled twilight of a summer evening, a group of middle-aged men sat around in tights. They did not say much; many of them were strangers. Some were nervous. Opening-night jitters.
 But those sweet jitters are, after all, among the reasons one becomes an actor. Why these guys -- office dwellers by day -- cope with the tights and the mosquitoes, and give night after night to performing Shakespeare. 
 Over in New York and New England, the serious-minded festivals and summer stock theaters are in full flower, but the New Jersey suburbs are a showcase for the amateur. 
 Central New Jersey is swarming with community theaters, dozens of them, almost all populated by unpaid actors picked up through the old-friend network or listings in newspapers and online. (The Cranford Dramatic Club is auditioning actors for ''The Rocky Horror Show,'' reports njtheater.com, and there are still parts open for ''La Cage Aux Folles'' in Lakewood.) 
 Founded 25 years ago, the Trilogy Repertory Company here in Basking Ridge operates year round, but its showpiece is the summertime Plays in the Park series, presented at the Pleasant Valley Park outdoor theater. 
 Each summer, Trilogy puts on one classic play and one musical; this season, in a little exercise in synergy, ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' whose final show is Saturday night at 8, will be followed by the musical it inspired, ''Kiss Me Kate.'' 
 As usual, the play brought out the regulars: Ed Schroeder, 59, a retired economics professor with a bookish air (playing Gremio); Hugh Wallace, 43, an optician and ambitious actor-director (Petruchio); Christian Winans, 47, a gregarious, cowboy-hat-wearing, pony-tailed office manager (Pedant); and Hank and Jaye Barre, a husband-and-wife team who have been with the company almost from the beginning (he plays Grumio; she directs). 
 Credits for Mr. Barre, 61, a wry and avuncular man who works as a financial adviser, include a corpse in a television commercial for the Tri-State Computer Fair, the official town crier of Bernards Township and, he said, every buffoon to be found in the Shakespeare canon. Ms. Barre, 62, is the drama coach at Ridge High School here and somewhat of a visionary at Trilogy, having directed a production of ''Peter Pan'' that, yes, included all the flying. 
 The impressive set for ''Taming'' featuring three rotating buildings, was built mainly by fathers who like to play with power tools, Ms. Barre said. Over the years, with financial support from the town, the outdoor theater has gradually come to look more like a serious playhouse, with a sound system and professional lighting. The backstage -- really just a back porch shielded by curtains -- just got that awning; the stage itself was finally refloored.
 ''When we did 'Brigadoon,' the poor dancer on the concrete floor,'' Ms. Barre recalled. ''He was never the same.''
 In the nervous hour before places were called, while most of the actors were simply waiting, the show's young leading ladies -- Jenna Myers (playing Bianca), a music theater major at Ramapo College, and Christine Marquet (Katherina), a drama student at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University -- did stretching exercises. 
 For them, this whole experience was a kind of warm-up, a flexing of muscles for, perhaps, some major regional theater work, a few New York credits, maybe Broadway, maybe Hollywood. They have a plan -- just as many of the other actors here had, once.
 ''I think probably everybody here thought about it at some point,'' said Joann Cullinane, 51, a chef at the International Seafarers' Center in Port Newark. She was playing two roles (a widow, and Curtis -- well, Constance, because the group wanted another role for an actress). But, faced with what she called ''that starving artist thing,'' Ms. Cullinane and the others reconsidered. Now, she said, ''they say, 'You know, I can do community theater and when I retire. ...' '' 
 Not that community theater is for the half-hearted. The audition process can be cutthroat; one keeps hearing that it is infused with -- and this word is said with a grimace and a shaking of the head -- politics. 
 ''It's hard to get cast in these shows,'' said Scott Avery, 56, who is playing Hortensio, a first-timer at Trilogy. ''A lot of these groups have cliques.''
 On opening night about 7:30, a few hundred people, old and young, had gathered on the grass in front of the theater, sitting on lawn chairs and blankets.
 The cast gathered on the back porch for Ms. Barre's precurtain notes: Think about your first line. Make sure your words are understood. Don't forget there's a pool party at Nancy's the next night after the show. 
 Mr. Wallace, who plays the leading role, Petruchio, gave his script a last-minute look. Mr. Winans handed out scratch-off lottery tickets, his little tradition. ''We had a prop girl win $60 once,'' he said. 
 Then: ''Places, Act I!'' 
 The porch fell into whispers. 
 An hour or so later, Act IV was under way, the shrew was being tamed and one could hear the sounds of audience laughter. Tim Murphy, 54, a hefty man with a friendly smile who plays Baptista, sat backstage, half in costume, waiting to go on. 
 At Queens College, Mr. Murphy was a star actor. He recalled teachers' telling him he had what it takes, encouraging him to pursue a career in acting. But he thought about that starving artist thing. And he didn't try. 
 He married, moved to New Jersey, got a nice job and eventually became a second vice president at New York Life. In 1999, he started doing community theater, just to scratch the old itch. 
 Then, in 2003, during a production of ''Sordid Lives'' at the Darress Theater in Boonton, he discovered something: This is what he really wanted to be doing all along. That same year, he and his wife divorced, he said, adding softly that it might have had something to do with this discovery. 
 Though he has kept his job, Mr. Murphy has pursued acting more vigorously. A few days before the opening night of ''Taming,'' he was playing Willy Loman in a production of ''Death of a Salesman'' at the Nutley Little Theater, and he is preparing to make his directorial debut in September with ''Barefoot in the Park'' in Dover. ''I guess this year has been living the kind of actor's life,'' he said. ''It feels really good.''
 He is planning to send his resume and head shot to the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey, a professional company and a step up on the acting tier. Soon, perhaps, he may retire and do this full time. He smiled hesitantly. ''I kind of think of it as Act II,'' he said.
 Suddenly Mr. Murphy got up and raced for his costume. Mr. Winans, in the role of stage manager, saved everyone by signaling from across the deck. It was time to go on. 
 Mr. Winans, along with Mr. Wallace and the Barres, is one of the Trilogy fixtures, having been with the company since the early 1980s. He has done nearly every job, from acting and stage managing to lighting work. ''I'd love to say I could give it up,'' Mr. Winans said. ''But it's probably more of an addiction than the drugs or anything else I used to do.''
 Growing up he was an athlete. But at Fairleigh Dickinson University, an older student persuaded Mr. Winans to get involved on stage. That older student later left for New York and made a career working behindthe scenes. Mr. Winans graduated with a degree in theater, but held on to his day jobs. He used to ask himself if he should have at least tried to go into the business professionally, like that other guy. Used to.
 ''I called him about six years ago,'' Mr. Winans recalled. ''And he said he hated theater. And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Because it's my job.' '' 
 Mr. Winans took a long drag on a cigarette in the cool darkness behind the theater. ''That made me think I did the right thing,'' he said. ''Because I still love it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about performances of Shakespeare in the suburbs misidentified the stage manager for Trilogy Repertory Company's production of ''The Taming of the Shrew'' in Basking Ridge, N.J. He is Jared Forsythe -- not Christian Winans, who played Pedant, as the article noted. Also, a picture caption misstated the profession of Hank Barre, one of the actors, in some copies. He is a financial adviser, not a drama coach.

 BODY:
Ever since he signed a five-year deal that could be worth as much as $250 million, David Beckham has pledged to lead a soccer crusade in the United States and push soccer, once and for all, into the American psyche. 
 This push will be as intriguing to watch as Beckham's performance on the field. 
 Major League Soccer enjoyed one of its finest moments Thursday night without its biggest star making so much as a kick. Beckham was nursing an injured ankle, so the American public didn't see him do his thing. Some critics wonder if that will ever happen. Still, Thursday's game between the M.L.S. All-Stars and Celtic FC wasn't about playing; it was about presence, and Beckham's was magnetic. 
 This was a good night for soccer: a sold-out crowd, a great stadium and a close game. Two Hispanic players -- one born in the United States, the other outside it -- scored a goal in the 2-0 victory for the All-Stars.
 Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner, said the nationality of the two goal scorers underlined the league's persistent theme. ''We are a league that represents the New America,'' Garber said. The New America, he added, is ''diverse, young and increasingly Hispanic.''
 Soccer has caught on in the United States, largely in sprawling suburbs where two decades of youths have grown up playing the sport. 
 For the United States to reach the next level in international competition, the sport must consistently draw from a larger and heretofore untapped pool of talent. That pool, experts say, is located in Inner City, U.S.A., where the games of choice have been football, basketball, track and field and baseball. 
 If soccer can tap into this market, the sport will achieve the traction it desperately wants and needs in the United States. The conundrum for soccer executives in the United States is how to attract new -- and much-needed -- talent to the sport.
 Importing Beckham is a major step. But the key to reaching an untapped pool of inner-city talent could lie in the hands of Victor MacFarlane, an African-American real estate developer who, along with his partner, the investor William Chang, paid $33 million for D.C. United this year. 
 MacFarlane, 56, was born in Ohio and played football, basketball and baseball. Soccer wasn't on his radar until his five children began playing. His son became a serious soccer player and played through high school. 
 Buying D.C. United was a combination of love of sport and love of the memories that sport provided. As a business opportunity, MacFarlane said he believes that soccer's popularity ''will jump the pond.''
 We'll see about that, but I do believe that the key for soccer to gain traction in the inner city is to bring the sport to the people, making soccer part of the economic and cultural ecostructure of the community. 
 MacFarlane and Chang want to build a privately financed, 27,000-seat, soccer-only stadium at Poplar Point in the southeast section of Washington. They also want to build a sports academy that will have an academic curriculum to complement soccer.
 ''You have to bring the sport to the community,'' MacFarlane said. 
 Garber said yesterday that soccer has two distinct ''minority'' initiatives in the United States, in terms of both fan development and player development. One initiative is aimed at Hispanics, the other at African-Americans. 
 ''Hispanics love the game, soccer is their game,'' Garber said. ''We want them to make our league their league.'' 
 African-Americans are not as broadly involved with soccer, as fans or as players. Basketball and football, with their extensive recruiting networks, traditions of providing college scholarships for top athletes and lucrative compensation at the professional level, appear to have a cultural chokehold on the African-American community.
 This is changing, however, and soccer could benefit. The N.B.A., with its pursuit of globalization, has opened the door for soccer, which covets the inner-city talent pool college and professional basketball have in some ways taken for granted. 
 I asked Garber how soccer, in its quest for new talent, would avoid the strip mining that took place, especially in basketball and football, in which young black athletes were carted out of the community. What will the community receive in return for growing yet another sports enterprise, in this case soccer? 
 ''We want to introduce this great game to kids who have not been exposed,'' Garber said. ''It's a game where you don't have to be big, you don't have to be a great athlete. As long as you can touch the ball with your foot, you can play.''
 To the point about strip mining, Garber said: ''We are generations away from producing a David Beckham. We want to create an opportunity for them to be part of 18 million kids who play the game and love the game.''
 The continued quest to grow soccer in the United States is an intriguing venture. Beckham is one answer, but investors like MacFarlane hold the key.

 CORRECTION:
A Sports of The Times column on Saturday about ways in which the United States could improve in international soccer competition by tapping inner-city talent referred incorrectly to the nationality of two players who scored for the Major League Soccer All-Stars in their 2-0 victory over Celtic FC on July 19. Both players -- not just one -- were born outside the United States. (The players, not named in the column, were Juan Pablo Angel and Juan Toja, and both are from Colombia.)

HEADLINE: Record Failures At Oil Refineries Raise Gas Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil refineries across the country have been plagued by a record number of fires, power failures, leaks, spills and breakdowns this year, causing dozens of them to shut down temporarily or trim production. The disruptions are helping to drive gasoline prices to highs not seen since last summer's records.
 These mechanical breakdowns, which one analyst likened to an ''invisible hurricane,'' have created a bottleneck in domestic energy supplies, helping to push up gasoline prices 50 cents this year to well above $3 a gallon. A third of the country's 150 refineries have reported disruptions to their operations since the beginning of the year, a record according to analysts.
 There have been blazes at refineries in Louisiana, Texas, Indiana and California, some of them caused by lightning strikes. Plants have suffered power losses that disrupted operations; a midsize refinery in Kansas was flooded by torrential rains last month. 
 American refiners are running roughly 5 percent below their normal levels at this time of the year.
 ''You have a system that is taxed to the limit,'' said Adam Robinson, an energy research analyst at Lehman Brothers. ''This is what happens when spare capacity is eroded.''
 After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted the nation's energy lifeline two years ago, oil companies delayed maintenance on many of their plants to make up for lost supplies and take advantage of the high prices. But, analysts say, they are now paying a price for deferring repairs.
 As a whole, refining disruptions have been considerably higher than in previous years: they averaged 1.5 million barrels a day in the first quarter, compared with 700,000 to 900,000 barrels a day from 2001 to 2005. In the days after the hurricanes, refiners were forced to briefly halt as many as five million barrels of production.
 In 2006, when refiners were still reeling from the impact of the hurricanes, disruptions in the first quarter averaged 1.35 million barrels a day.
 Many factors have led to the rise in gas prices, including disruptions in oil supplies from places like Nigeria and Norway. But analysts say the refining bottleneck in North America has been one of the main drivers of higher energy prices this year.
 The refining crunch has pushed wholesale gasoline prices up 35 percent this year and has contributed to a 23 percent gain for crude oil prices. Oil futures in New York closed at $75.57 a barrel on Friday. 
 Some critics of the industry have theorized on Internet blogs that the squeeze on gasoline and other refined products points to a deliberate effort among oil companies to bolster profits by keeping supplies tight. But experts point out that the companies have little incentive right now to hold back on fuel supplies.
 ''Every refinery would like to run as much crude as possible but they simply can't,'' said David Greely, senior energy economist at Goldman Sachs, who in a recent report compared the drop in domestic refining with an ''invisible hurricane.'' ''These are more complex systems. There are more chances for things to go wrong. And when things go wrong, they tend to back up the system.''
 Meanwhile, refiners have been scrambling to meet a raft of environmental regulations, phase out toxic additives, add ethanol to the fuel mix and introduce new ultralow sulfur standards for gasoline and diesel. Industry insiders attribute much of the fragility of refining operations to the difficulty of making these cleaner fuels.
 Refiners spent $9 billion from 2002 to 2006 to make low sulfur diesel. But producing these cleaner fuels means processing crude oil more intensely through the refining process, at higher pressures and temperatures. This, in turn, leads to more chances for glitches or breakdowns, refiners say. 
 ''It's a marvel we can continue to run refineries the way we do these days given the many requirements and specification changes we have,'' said Charles T. Drevna, executive vice president of the refining industry's main trade group, the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. ''There comes a time when the piper has got to be paid.''
 This year's problems have raised alarms about the safety of refining operations, especially after a deadly accident at a BP refinery in Texas two years ago that killed 15 workers. The federal Chemical Safety Board issued a highly critical report blaming a broken safety culture at BP. But the board's chairwoman, Carolyn W. Merritt, who has spoken out about safety problems at refineries, said there was a pattern in many other refinery incidents that the board had investigated.
 ''There is a lack of investments in modern equipment,'' Ms. Merritt said. ''The overwhelming preponderance is that if you have inadequate engineering and equipment, poor process safety management, and poor staffing, you're set up for a catastrophe.''
 Ms. Merritt, who was appointed by President Bush and will retire after her five-year term ends in August, also said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration does not conduct enough inspections. ''There is no enforcement,'' she said. 
 OSHA defended its record and said it had inspected almost 500 refineries from 1994 to 2004. The agency also said it would inspect all refineries under its jurisdiction within the next two years. ''OSHA inspections of refineries have proven to be effective,'' the agency said. 
 Meanwhile, demand has been rising relentlessly, providing little respite to the nation's aging energy infrastructure. Even as consumers complain loudly about high prices, they show no signs of scaling back. Gasoline consumption reached 9.66 million barrels a day in the first week of July, the second-highest level on record.
 ''The cushion that used to be available five to seven years ago for these unplanned perturbations is no longer there,'' said Jeet Bindra, Chevron's president of global refining. ''When a refinery has a hiccup, there are consequences on supplies.''
 Part of the problem, analysts and refiners said, stems from the hurricanes two years ago. In Louisiana and Mississippi, many refineries were flooded, and about a quarter of the nation's refining capacity was shut for weeks.
 ''Since refining has become such a wonderful business, refiners have delayed maintenance,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''But when they do go down, they stay down for longer and they discover all sorts of problems.''
 In late March, for example, a fire at a large compressor at a BP refinery in Whiting, Ind., caused a hydrogen-treating unit that removes sulfur from some oil products to shut. That meant BP had to turn off a crude oil unit for early maintenance. Two weeks later, a brief power disruption damaged another distillation tower. And in July, a third crude oil tower was shut briefly so operators could fix a small leak. Since the first incident, the 405,000 barrels-a-day refinery has been running at about half its capacity.
 Not all refining disruptions are the result of similar incidents. Refineries typically schedule yearly maintenance that sometimes requires them to halt production entirely. But even these long-scheduled shutdowns can now take longer to complete. 
 No refineries have been built in the United States in over three decades, because refiners say they are too costly. Instead, they have been expanding their existing refineries.
 All this is happening as the industry goes through another golden age. After 20 years in the doldrums, the refining business has never been so good for oil companies. Refining margins -- the difference between the price of crude oil and the value of refined gasoline made from it -- have shot up as much as $25 abarrel for some types of crude oil, compared with about $5 a barrel just a few years ago.
 But with a third summer of high gasoline prices, lawmakers are debating legislation they claim would punish oil companies for exploiting the tight supply situation and engaging in ''price gouging.'' At the same time, they are pressing refiners to produce more fuel.
 ''Refiners want to keep running in today's economic environment,'' said Mr. Drevna of the refiners association. ''But when they shut down they are accused of gouging the system. When they don't, they are criticized for overrunning their facilities.''

HEADLINE: The Week Ahead: Television

BYLINE: By Mike Hale

 BODY:
Cinemax may not have the most high-minded reputation, but under its ''Reel Life'' banner it's one of the steadiest exhibitors of serious documentaries. This Thursday it presents the television premiere of ''THE BLOOD OF YINGZHOU DISTRICT'' (7 p.m.), the winner of this year's Oscar for best documentary short. Ruby Yang's film tracks the lives of Chinese children who have been orphaned because their parents sold their blood and died of AIDS. Four years ago Cinemax presented another documentary about AIDS in China, the unforgettable ''To Live Is Better Than to Die,'' as grim and unadorned a depiction of disease, poverty and death as you're ever likely to see on American television, and ''Yingzhou District'' plays like a sequel, following the children victimized by the blood-selling crisis into the next sad chapter of their lives. 
From rural China to rural America: another top purveyor of documentaries, the PBS series ''P.O.V.,'' offers ''PRISON TOWN, U.S.A.'' (10 p.m. Tuesday on most stations; check local listings). It looks at how the incarceration boom in the United States has affected the economy and, just as profoundly, the psychology of Susanville, Calif., a small town where four large prisons have replaced the lumber industry as the leading local employer. 
 The best of the Cartoon Network's original series, ''HARVEY BIRDMAN, ATTORNEY AT LAW,'' has its final day in court (11:45 p.m. Sunday) after 39 15-minute episodes. The show may have faded since the inspired early episodes -- Dr. Quest suing Race Bannon for custody of Johnny and Hadji; Apache Chief suing for damages when a latte spilled in his lap impairs his superpower -- but the third-rate-superhero-as-inept-lawyer premise has always been funny, and the voices (Gary Cole, Stephen Colbert, Paget Brewster) are first rate to the end.
