HEADLINE: New York Water Tunnel Work Increased

 BODY:
In a move that is expected to create 200 new jobs, the city's Department of Environmental Protection plans to speed construction of the city's third water tunnel by awarding $250 million in additional contracts for the project in 1993, city officials said yesterday.
Officials of the environmental agency said they planned to increase the amount of water tunnel contracts scheduled to be let next year to $350 million from $100 million to help stimulate the region's sagging economy and to save money on construction costs, which are now extremely low because of the weak economy. 
 The city's water-supply system, which consists of two huge tunnels running down the Catskill Mountains, is more than 100 years old. The third tunnel will allow the city to shut down the first two, inspect and repair them. The third tunnel, which is being built in four stages at a total cost of $5 billion, will carry water from the Kenisco Reservoir in Valhalla, N.Y., to points through the city.

HEADLINE: Pact Seeks Looser Curbs On Exports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The United States reached tentative agreement today with Europe and Japan to loosen international controls on exports of advanced telecommunications equipment, Administration officials said. The pact represents a basic shift in American policy toward the former Soviet republics.
The officials said the products covered by the agreement included high-quality fiber-optic cables, which can be used for long-distance calls and computer data transmissions. The Pentagon and American intelligence agencies have long opposed such sales. But the United States has decided to strengthen the economies of the republics and lay a strong base for American business activity there, an official said. 
 Because of the tension between economic concerns and military security, telecommunications exports are among the most bitterly fought export-control issues within the Bush Administration and within Western industrialized countries. At stake is a choice between the economic gains from developing a multibillion-dollar market and the risks involved in both improving the military capabilities of the 12 republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States and, through the resale of equipment, aiding potential American adversaries like Syria and Iraq.
Sales to the Baltic republics are already legal. Today's agreement would not cover China and North Korea, officials said.
Britain, Canada, France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States all subscribed to today's tentative agreement at a meeting in Paris. The accord was reached by senior negotiators, and it left unresolved some technical details still to be worked out by experts in communications engineering.
To take effect, the pact needs the endorsements of nine other member countries of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom. The committee is to meet this summer, and the endorsements should not be a significant obstacle because none of the countries is a major exporter of telecommunications equipment, an official said.
Still, today's accord may not go far enough to persuade Western telephone companies to begin investing in the former Soviet Union. For a fiber-optic cable across the region to be financially attractive to Western investors, the allowed transmission speed would have to be increased 12 times, said Ed Mattix, a spokesman for U S West Inc., a regional Bell telephone company based in Englewood, Colo.
 
Setting Speed Limits
 The best Western transmission technology available is 38 times faster than the current limit on exports to the former Soviet republics and a dozen times faster than the proposed new limit.
The Commerce Department, the German Government and many United States companies, led by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, have pushed for a revision of cold war-era restrictions as a way to help the former Soviet republics restart their economies and to open a potentially enormous new market.
Advocates of the sales point out that more and more small countries that do not belong to international export-control organizations now have the ability to produce and export fiber-optic and other advanced telecommunications equipment.
The Defense Department and intelligence agencies in the United States have blocked most exports until now, contending that the sales could endanger national security by making American espionage more difficult and by improving the ability of foreign communications systems to survive conventional and nuclear war.
Today's agreement would allow shipments of extremely clear, hair-thin glass fibers that can carry light signals for miles with little distortion or fading. The pact would also triple existing limits on the speed of computerized transmission equipment used to create and receive the light signals at the ends of a cable.
A controversial shipment of fiber to Russia last year from eastern Germany would be clearly legal under today's pact, as would the sale of even better quality fiber, an Administration official said.
 
Esponiage Is a Factor
 The Defense Department and intelligence agencies have opposed the shipment of fiber-optic equipment mainly because it would make American electronic eavesdropping more difficult. Long-distance communications in the former Soviet republics now rely heavily on microwaves beamed from tower to tower across the countryside, and these microwaves are easily tapped by satellites and other means.
Fiber-optic systems, on the other hand, are extremely difficult to tap without physical access to the system. In the war with Iraq last year, allied aircraft repeatedly bombed sites in Baghdad and elsewhere that concealed fiber-optic cables and transmission equipment, in a partly successful effort to sever the cables and force the Iraqi military to use radios that could be tapped more easily.
Objections from the Defense Department and intelligence agencies forced former Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher to reject on June 5, 1990, a plan by an international consortium including U S West to build a fiber-optic cable spanning the Soviet Union. The cable would have allowed cheaper communications between Europe and Japan.
Cocom did authorize in October the construction of a long-distance telephone link from Denmark to Moscow. High-speed fiber-optic cable will be used from Denmark to St. Petersburg and a lower-speed microwave link from St. Petersburg to Moscow.
 
Pressure From Germany
 Germany, which is rapidly reclaiming Eastern European and Russian markets lost during World War II and wants to be able to ship more-sophisticated products, has turned the loosening of export controls into a test of bilateral relations with the United States, said an Administration official who insisted on anonymity.
"You've got the Germans coming in continually, putting pressure on the Administration," the official said. Most of the German urgings have been made quietly through diplomatic channels because of recent discoveries by United Nations inspectors that German companies sold large quantities of equipment to Iraqi military installations, the official added.
The German Embassy declined to comment.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Texas;
Tsongas and Buchanan Enter Enemy Territory

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 5

 BODY:
President Bush comes from Texas, among other places. Gov. Bill Clinton comes from Arkansas, just next door, and people here have always had a predilection for backing friends and neighbors.
So this Tuesday's Presidential primary in the nation's third-largest state represents a formidable challenge for their principal rivals, Patrick J. Buchanan in the Republican race and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts in the Democratic contest. Not quite like selling refrigerators to Eskimos, but close. Yet both challengers are trying, because the potential payoff is so big: 121 Republican delegates and 214 Democratic delegates, roughly a tenth of the number needed to win the nomination. 
 "It's not parochialism so much as style and a commonality of interests that motivates us," said Arnie Vedlitz, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University. "We're not sure we've quite arrived yet, and one sign of that is a deep-seated suspicion of people from the East and West Coasts, especially when they're kind of remote or they preach."
Mr. Buchanan has the harder job, although his inexperienced state chairman, Terry Young, said on television this week that the conservative commentator had "an excellent chance" of winning in 8 out of 10 regions of the state. However much Easterners may snicker about Mr. Bush's claims to hail from several places at once, most Texans consider him one of them, and he has a fabric of relationships here that stretches back 45 years.
 
Bush Backers Talk Big
 The President, who took 64 percent of the vote in the Texas primary four years ago against a stronger field than this year's, is confident enough to have scheduled no further stops in Texas after his three-day swing through the state last week. Nor, so far, has he bought any television advertisements.
Ernest Angelo Jr. of Midland, the state's Republican national committeeman, predicted that neither Mr. Buchanan nor David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and Louisiana state legislator, would win a single delegate in Texas. Bush campaign aides think his vote here could reach 75 percent, which would be by far his best showing in a major test this year.
"I think we'll deliver the coup de grace," said Fred Meyer, the state Republican chairman. "I think the President will win big and end the other two guys' campaigns."
Still, Mr. Buchanan plans to open a Texas drive at the Alamo in San Antonio tomorrow and to campaign as well in Dallas, one of the most conservative large cities in the nation. His fiercely aggressive television commercials are already appearing across the state, and Karl Rove, an experienced Republican consultant with ties to the President, says that here as elsewhere Mr. Buchanan will get some votes from people "seeking vengeance for the Sin of 1990" -- Mr. Bush's decision to accept a tax increase as part of a budget deal after promising not to.
 
Tsongas Aides Talk Small
 The biggest threat to the President is not meeting the high expectations. Losing a third of the vote to Mr. Buchanan in his home state would constitute a real embarrassment.
Expectations condition Mr. Tsongas's outlook as well. He said at a rally in San Antonio on Wednesday night that he has a "silver medal strategy" for Texas, which meant simply coming in second. That may be pure tactics, an attempt to set the crossbar so low anyone could jump it.
Robin Rorapaugh, Mr. Clinton's campaign manager in Texas, set it high for her man. She said in an interview that "I really think we have a real good chance to win all the delegates."
Under the Democratic rules, which make shutouts much harder than the Republican rules, that would mean keeping Mr. Tsongas or any other rival candidate from getting 15 percent of the vote, not only statewide but in any of the 31 state senatorial districts.
Few others think Mr. Clinton can do it, especially with the withdrawal today of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who had made some headway here with the backing of Lieut. Gov. Bob Bullock. That should make it easier for the anti-Clinton vote to coalesce around Mr. Tsongas, as should the negligible campaigns mounted here by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
A poll taken for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram showed Mr. Clinton at 41 percent, Mr. Tsongas at 18 percent, undecided at 33 percent and the rest scattered. The survey of 920 likely voters, conducted Feb. 21-24, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The major issue, all the polls indicate, is the economy.
"Texas may be better off than a lot of other states, and the worst of our recession is behind us," said Robert Slagle, the state Democratic chairman. "But it's still no cup of tea. A lot of people here have taken some pretty dramatic hits."
 
The Minority Vote
 But what has put Mr. Clinton in a commanding position is not so much his economic plan but his strength in East Texas, adjacent to Arkansas, where a big chunk of the remaining traditional Democratic rural vote is concentrated; his appeal to black and Hispanic voters, who may constitute 40 percent or more of the Democratic primary electorate, and the increasingly liberal character of that electorate with the defection of so many conservatives to the Republicans.
"There's nothing there for Tsongas in the black community," said Hazel Obey, one of the state's most prominent black Democrats, who said she thought Mr. Clinton would have collected the most black votes here even if Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who is black, had remained in the race. "We know Bill, and he gets along well with Texans, black, brown and Anglo."
 
Focusing on Austin
 As for Hispanic voters, who play an especially strong role in the Rio Grande Valley and in San Antonio, they are also considered safely in Mr. Clinton's bag. Much of that is due to the work of one of the best Hispanic organizers in the state, Billy Leo of Hidalgo County.
Mr. Clinton also has much the best statewide organization, led by Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
The Arkansas Governor, who has budgeted at least $500,000 for television spots here, will outspend Mr. Tsongas in that area by a sizable amount, which could be important given Mr. Tsongas's woeful lack of recognition here.
For Mr. Tsongas, the best opportunities probably lie in and around Austin, where the University of Texas and a large number of high-tech companies provide the kind of prosperous, highly educated voters among whom the former Senator scored well in Maryland and New Hampshire. The hundreds of electronics firms around Dallas and Houston, from Compaq computers to Texas Instruments, mean more such voters in those two cities' suburbs.
"It's come down to a smart, slick, articulate candidate and one who's just as smart, not as articulate but not as slick, either," said George Christian, the old political hand who was one of Lyndon B. Johnson's press secretaries. "There'll be some people who'll vote against slick."
Enough will do that, asserted Bob Krueger, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission and chairman of Texans for Tsongas, that the former Senator is "going to run a strong second and get his share of delegates."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Rise on New Sign of Recovery

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities continued to slide and interest rates moved higher in active trading yesterday.
The market's defensive tone was reinforced by a drop in initial unemployment claims during the week ended Feb. 22. The drop was bigger than expected and reinforced concerns among traders that February employment data scheduled to be released today by the Labor Department might provide further evidence that the economy is on the mend. 
 "I think there is a growing sentiment that the economy has got a couple of quarters of growth in it, and the market is repricing itself to reflect that," a government bond trader said.
 
Negative Psychology
 Prices fell after the unemployment claims numbers were released, but some Wall Street analysts said the market was overreacting to the figures because the drop came during a holiday-shortened week.
Still, the analysts acknowledged that current market psychology was so negative that traders were inclined to sell securities on any sign of economic strength, no matter how questionable that evidence might be.
"The market is very, very intolerant of anything with a plus sign on it," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "But I don't think the economy is robust enough to sustain a 3 percent recovery with interest rates on the rise. That is not the prevalent view right now, though."
Selling pressure intensified after the results of an auction of one-year Treasury bills were announced. Demand for the new bills was not terribly strong, and the securities were sold at an average discount rate of 4.37 percent, sharply above the 4.01 percent average rate at the last one-year bill sale on Feb. 6.
 
Clearly in a Bad Mood
 The market's bad mood became clearer as the afternoon wore on and as traders failed to react positively to comments from Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Rostenkowski said chances were slim that a fiscal package to revive the weak economy would be enacted before the November elections.
Market participants have worried for months that such a package would prove overly stimulative and reignite inflation.
A report from the Federal Reserve Board that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended Feb. 24 also failed to generate any reaction from credit market participants.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10014/32 , down 19/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 7.90 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100, down 1/2 point, to yield 7.50 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9918/32 , down 7/32 , to yield 5.61 percent.
 
Higher Rates on Bills
 Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.04 percent late yesterday, up two basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.16 percent.
In other developments, details were released of two high-yield junk-bond issues that were priced Wednesday night.
Foodmaker Inc. offered a total of $300 million worth of securities through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The largest part of the offering consisted of $175 million worth of noncallable seven-year senior notes. The 9.25 percent securities were priced at $100, or par.
The remaining $125 million were sold as senior subordinated notes that mature June 1, 2002. These 9.75 percent securities, which are also noncallable, were priced at $100, or par.
The Foodmaker issue is rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
And the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation offered $250 million worth of 10-year senior notes thorugh an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 9 1/4 percent notes were priced at $100, 1.82 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated Ba-1 by Moody's and BBB-minus by Standard & Poor's.
 
New York City Offering
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Prudential Securities Inc. released the final prices on an offering of $106.2 million worth of zero-coupon securities offered as part of New York City's debt sale on Wednesday. Because they could be purchased in increments as small as $5,000 face amount, the zero-coupon securities were marketed heavily to small investors.
Prudential, which acted as lead manager on the New York City offering, said yields range from 6.75 percent on bonds maturing in 1997, 7.30 percent in 2002, 7.60 percent in 2007 and 7.65 percent in 2012. The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about 1/4 point in light trading.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants reported that prices of most issues dipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes With Gains; Gold Has Modest Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained against major world currencies yesterday but finished below its highest levels of the session in uneventful trading.
Gold prices posted modest increases. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $351.40 an ounce, up 80 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York said gold rose $1.05 an ounce, to $351.45. 
 Currency market analysts said the dollar traded within a fairly tight range. The dollar failed to move significantly above key technical levels pierced during Wednesday's strong advance, they said.
Some market participants pared holdings of dollars in anticipation of today's report on unemployment in the United States. The report will be closely examined for signs that confirm or contradict recent evidence that the economy is rebounding.
"I don't think anything special happened" yesterday to influence the dollar, said John Carvelli of ABN-AMRO Bank N.V.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 132.00 Japanese yen, from 131.50 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it dropped to 131.85 yen. By the time trading was done for the day in New York, the dollar was quoted at 131.90 yen, up from 131.75 on Wednesday.
The British pound fell in London to $1.7165, from $1.7240 late Wednesday. Sterling fetched $1.7170 in New York, compared with $1.7240 Wednesday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.6720 German marks, up from 1.6690; 1.5260 Swiss francs, up from 1.5215; 5.6820 French francs, up from 5.6715; 1,253.50 Italian lire, up from 1,252.00, and 1.18725 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1903.
Gold prices made minor movements on world markets.
In London, the late bid for gold was $350.65 an ounce, up from $349.80 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $350.50 from $349.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 76 cents an ounce to close at $351.47.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Sales Up In February

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Monthly sales reported by the nation's largest retail chains, one of many factors in the fever chart of a troubled economy, indicated yesterday that an unusually large number of Americans were buying again in February, a sales month that is normally sparse.
Sales were strong not only at traditionally robust retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, but also at stores with more checkered records, like the J. C. Penney Company and Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates Bloomingdale's and other chains. 
 Most stores were reporting overall percentage sales gains in the double digits, compared with the depressed period a year ago when consumers were preoccupied with the Persian Gulf war.
 
Strength in Same-Store Sales
 But the smaller and better number to watch -- sales at stores open for at least a year, or comparable store sales -- showed strength as well. Even stores reporting a drop in sales tended to attribute the decline to one-time events, like flooding in California or the waning popularity of certain toy lines.
The results, the second straight monthly sales increase following the bleak Christmas season, were encouraging to analysts. Store traffic, the number of people wandering through the stores, was up substantially, analysts said. And sales of consumer goods that are normally the first to be shunned when the economy falters, like home furniture and men's suits, seemed to be picking up.
"It's premature to extrapolate from two months, especially when they're low-volume, peanut numbers," Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said. "That said, it could be the beginning of a general recovery, just could be. At this point, you don't know whether you're coming or going."
 
Store Executives Cautious
 Store executives were cautious about trumpeting a recovery, partly because of continuing heavy discounting during the month, as well as anxiety that consumer confidence could take a sudden drop if huge layoffs or other disheartening news recurred. They said that sales in the Easter season, the next six weeks up to April 19, would be key but that they did not expect large gains.
"We aren't looking for anything big in the spring season, and it may be flat or down," said Kenneth M. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation in Minneapolis. The chain's Target and Mervyn's stores appeal to discount shoppers, and its Dayton Hudson and Marshall Field stores appeal to wealthier shoppers.
Compared with results in 1991, February sales gains appeared strong, but they were less impressive when matched with those of 1990. Dayton Hudson, for example, posted comparable-store sales gains of 6 percent in February, in contrast to a decline of 1 percent in February a year ago. But the gain in February 1990 was also 6 percent, followed by 7.5 percent in March and 6.8 percent in April. If this year's gains are that strong in the next two months, analysts said, it would be a considerable surprise.
Neither analysts nor store executives expect a sustainable recovery until the second half of the year, possibly as late as September.
 
Wal-Mart the Leader Again
 As has been increasingly the case among retailers, Wal-Mart posted the group's strongest showing in February, with a sales gain among comparable stores of 20 percent, while overall stores were up 34 percent.
Salomon Brothers follows an index of 10 big retailers, including Wal-Mart. The other nine retailers reported gains in comparable-store sales in February ranging from one-tenth of 1 percent for the Mercantile Stores Company to 8.9 percent for Sears, Roebuck & Company, similar to January's range -- from 2.7 percent for the Woolworth Corporation to 8.2 percent for Dayton Hudson.
The K Mart Corporation's same-store sales rose 4.3 percent, and total sales 9.9 percent. Federated Department Stores, reporting its first monthly sales results since emerging from bankruptcy proceedings last month, said same-store sales rose 10.2 percent while overall sales grew 3.8 percent.
Other auguries were favorable as well. A survey released earlier this week by Telecheck Services Inc., which helps merchants verify whether a shopper's check is good, said February retail sales indicated that consumer spending was up 9.5 percent. The Midwest, Southeast and West showed double-digit increases, but the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions showed modest declines, according to check authorization data from a survey of 10,000 of Telecheck's 100,000 subscribers.
Checks account for 35.2 percent of all consumer transactions, according to the Nilson Report, a credit-card research concern. They are the second-most popular means of payment after cash, which accounts for 47.7 percent.
 
Some Analysts Elated
 Some analysts were elated by the figures for February retail sales. "There's gold in them thar hills," said Kurt Barnard, president of Retail Marketing Report, a New York-based retail newsletter. "I had anticipated better February results because the gulf war had distorted last year's sales." But, he added, the reports had been better than he expected.
"What we see here is the first glimmer of a germinating recovery," he said.
Store executives were wary. Robert D. Huth, chief financial officer of the Melville Corporation in Rye, N.Y., said, "Two months do not a trend make, especially when you have a number of factors clouding the picture."
Melville is an unusually diversified retailer, with businesses in prescription drugs, apparel, footwear, toys and household furnishings. It reported a gain in comparable store sales of 4 percent and an overall gain of 5.6 percent.

Retailers' Figures

HEADLINE: Hartford Plan on Welfare Is Met With Tales of Woe

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 5

 BODY:
Joseph Comfort, a former carpenter for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, fell 125 feet from a catwalk at the New Haven Coliseum in 1980. He came to the Capitol today to plead with state lawmakers not to cut the welfare program, which he said had saved his life over years of recovery and the fruitless search for a job.
"I'm a licensed plumber, I'm a carpenter," said Mr. Comfort, 38 years old, who said he has been repeatedly turned down even for dishwashing jobs, because employers fear his medical problems will recur and force them to pay worker's compensation. "I'd clean toilets if somebody would reach down and say, 'Joe Comfort, here's a job,' " he said in an interview. 
 Mr. Comfort told his story in three minutes at a public hearing before the General Assembly's Human Services Committee. The committee had already been battered for more than three hours by tales of misery, frustration and anger over sweeping cuts in welfare spending proposed last month by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
Mr. Weicker proposed cutting $1.1 billion in state spending for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The Legislature is considering various bills to put that plan into effect, one of which would evict "employable" people from general assistance after six months. Several other bills would restrict eligibility for the welfare program for families, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
The proposed legislation would also change the formula for putting money into general-assistance welfare, requiring local communities to pick up 33.3 percent of the costs, compared with the current 10 percent.
 
Anger and Anguish Showing
 The bills have evoked deep support and bitter criticism, and both were in evidence today. There were angry and anguished exchanges between lawmakers and municipal officials, who said the state would either be betraying a trust to the weakest members of society or betraying the towns if they shifted the burden of paying for welfare.
"I find this proposal deplorable," said Walter M. Pawelkiewicz, the First Selectman of Windham, who said his already stressed community in eastern Connecticut could be driven to bankruptcy by a change the welfare formula.
"Don't just come in and say, 'Don't cut this,' " responded Senator James T. Fleming, a Republican from Simsbury and the committee's ranking minority party member. "Give us an alternative."
"All I'm saying is that we are in serious trouble and these people are not going to have anywhere to go if the town of Windham shuts down," Mr. Pawelkiewicz said.
Much of the concern about the welfare overhaul, which has been mirrored in varying degrees from New Jersey to California, arose from an awareness that the cuts would occur in the midst of a deep recession. Several lawmakers said they feared people would be judged "employable" only to find that there were no jobs.
"I'm so troubled by this," said Representative Cristel H. Truglia, a Democrat from Stamford. "The sense of hope that people are losing is so frightening to me. What's going to happen?"
 
More Could Become Homeless
 The Commissioner of the Department of Income Maintenance, Audrey Rowe, whose agency supervises the welfare system, supported the bills. But she conceded under questioning by the committee that pressures to seek work would increase for welfare recipients and that a greater degree of homelessness could result.
"Our proposal mandates that Connecticut serve only the most needy," Ms. Rowe said. She said that over the years, the general assistance program had expanded to become "a repository for individuals who are underserved by other agencies."
"It must return to its original purpose," she said. "To provide the most basic, immediate and temporary help to those in dire circumstances."

HEADLINE: Stocks Down Sharply, With Dow Falling 27.06

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed sharply lower yesterday, in heavy but cautious trading. Investors were tentative in advance of today's February employment data and because of pressure from a weak bond market and concern over rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 27.06 points, 3,241.50.
The February unemployment report is the first of the key economic numbers due out this month that are expected to give the market a sense of the economy's strength. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 208.94 million, virtually unchanged from 208.91 million shares traded on Wednesday, as losing issues outpaced gainers by 1,267 to 486, or a nearly 3-to-1 ratio. The composite index dropped 1.74 points, to 224.92.
Edwin Walczak, first vice president and chief investment officer for Vontobel U.S.A., the United States base of the Swiss Private Bank, said that the market appeared directionless most of the day until the bond market began to dribble away and stocks followed.
"I think this reiterates that this high-multiple market requires low interest rates to sustain itself, and at this juncture, in the absence of proven economic growth and improved corporate earnings, the bond market has begun to govern the performance of the equity market," Mr. Walczak said.
 
Index of 500 Stocks Down
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, fell 2.82 points, to 406.51, with the American Stock Exchange index off 3.15 points, to 410.24. Heavy trading on the Nasdaq took the composite down 8.32 points, to 621.97, while the Russell 2,000 dropped 2.58 points to finish at 208.69.
Stocks fell at the opening bell, partly continuing Wednesday's selloff, which saw the Dow lose 21 points as well as weak bond prices. A larger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims helped ease some of the early selling. It was considered good news for equities, but it also lowered bond prices and pushed up yields, raising concern among stock investors about climbing interest rates.
Birinyi Associates, the Wall Street research firm, said program trading played a large role in taking the market down; the total impact of the programs on the Dow was a 21.79-point drop, it said.
In other trading activity, shares of Merck & Company finished unchanged at 151 1/4, following Wednesday's selloff after rumors of a negative report about its widely sold cholesterol drug Mevacor. Robert Hodgson, an analyst with Cowen & Company, repeated his "buy" recommendation, especially on any weakness in the shares.
A day after its credit rating was lowered by Moody's Investors Service, I.B.M. shares continued to trade lower, closing at 86 5/8, off 3/4.
Micro Healthsystems, which makes bedside computers for hospitals, moved up sharply in trading yesterday. It appears that the stock is among a few being recommended as "buys" over the next six months by money managers who took part in a dart board versus managers contest held by The Wall Street Journal for a number of years. Jonathan Steinberg of Financial Data Systems Inc., who has finished first in six of 10 tries, picked Micro, and it appears that he has a following. The stock was up 3 1/4, to 19 3/4.
The Gap fell 2 3/8, to 46, even though the specialized retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents a share, up from 40 cents a year ago, and higher than the mean 57 cents analysts had expected. Robert Buchanan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, repeated his "buy" recommendation, but investors were disappointed by its February sales.
Sunrise Technologies rose 1 3/4, to 14 3/4, after it said the United States Food and Drug Administration had cleared its Holium laser product for surgery.
In trading yesterday, the Dial Corporation was down 1/8, to 50 1/8. On Tuesday the shareholders of Dial approved a spinoff of its commercial finance subsidiaries and mortgage insurance business, with the GFC Financial Corporation as the parent company. The spinoff schedule called for Dial common stock to continue to trade through March 18, with the right to receive the GFC stock distribution of one GFC share for every two shares of Dial. March 4 was the record for distribution, the same day GFC stock began trading on a when-issued basis. And in when-issued trading yesterday the stock was at 22 1/2, up 3/4.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless-Benefit Claims Fell 21,000 in Mid-February

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Unemployment lines were shorter in mid-February as the number of workers seeking jobless benefits for the first time fell by 21,000, the Government said today, offering further hope the economy was improving.
But some economists said the number of claims may have been distorted by the Washington's Birthday holiday, when unemployment offices were closed. 
 The Labor Department reported that the number of people filing initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to 437,000 in the week that ended Feb. 22, down from 458,000 the previous week.
Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin said the report on weekly claims -- coupled with other recent reports of rising home sales and improvement in manufacturing -- "indicates that the economy is pointed in the right direction and may be starting to gain momentum."
The Labor Department will report on the employment picture for all of February on Friday. Many economists expect to see a small increase in the number of new jobs created, but no improvement in the nation's 7.1 percent unemployment rate.
Nevertheless, the four-week moving average number of claims, which economists say provides a clearer picture of unemployment trends, also fell, to 445,250, from 448,500 in the previous period, the department said.
"We do seem to have crested," Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, said. Jobless claims hit about 500,000 a week last year in the midst of the recession.
"I think we are in the bottoming-out stage and there is going to be a pickup," he added. "But I don't see anything to suggest that it will be anything other than a draggy recovery."

HEADLINE: Gap Report for 4th Quarter: Net Up 48.5%, Sales Up 28.6%

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 5

 BODY:
Continuing to defy the recession, the Gap Inc. today reported sharply higher sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and year. But the price of Gap shares declined after the company advised securities analysts that sales growth would moderate in 1992. Based in San Francisco, the Gap is the No. 2 clothing brand in the United States, after Levi Strauss.
For the quarter ended Feb. 1, the Gap said it earned $83.9 million, or 59 cents a share, up 48.5 percent from $56.5 million, or 40 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Sales rose 28.6 percent, to $803.5 million, from $624.7 million in the 1991 fiscal year. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange today, the Gap's stock closed at $46 a share, down $2.375. Analysts said the decline reflected concern that growth would moderate in the coming year, to a figure in the mid-20 percent range. Supporting that estimate, sales growth at stores open more than a year, known as comparable- store sales, slowed to 7 percent in February, down from 12 percent in the fourth quarter, and 13 percent for the whole year.
 
'A Reality Check'
 The market reaction today "is a bit excessive, but not surprising," said Jean M. O'Neill, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. "This is a bit of a reality check. Earnings aren't coming down, but a lot of investors may have expected an upside surprise."
Ms. O'Neill said the Gap suffered a bit because it entered February fully stocked with spring fashions when many of its competitors were still selling winter merchandise at heavy discounts. In colder climates, the spring clothing did not sell well, but it was well received in California and the South, she said, adding, "They did such a good job during Christmas they had to bring spring out a little too soon."
For several years, the Gap has advised investors to expect a 20 percent rate of growth, but it has always outperformed its own predictions by a wide margin. "Investors had become conditioned to believe that earnings would exceed management's stated goals," said Donald L. Trott, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. "The Street has now gotten the message that this is reality."
 
Up 59% for the Year
 For the year, the Gap had earnings of $229.9 million, or $1.62 a share, up 59 percent from $144.5 million, or $1.02 a share, in the previous year. Sales rose 30.6 percent, to $2.52 billion, from $1.93 billion in the year ended Feb. 2, 1991.
"Our ability to generate these results during difficult economic times is a credit both to our strategy and to all our employees," Donald G. Fisher, the Gap's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "They are the ones to be congratulated for making Gap, Gapkids and Banana Republic so successful in 1991."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Next: Cold War Of the Capitalists?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE easing of East-West tensions and the end of the cold war raised hopes for a long spell of world peace and economic development. But in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet empire have come political shocks, like the war in the Persian Gulf and the civil war in Yugoslavia, and a world economic slump.
Is this just a painful transition period the world is passing through before getting to what President Bush has called "the new world order" -- and, if so, how do we get there from here? Or, to borrow from Gertrude Stein, is there a there there? 
 To grapple with such issues, and related problems of political structure, international markets, population growth, technology, ethics and values and ecology, the United Nations Development Program has just published a five-volume work, "Change: Threat or Opportunity?" to which more than 80 political leaders and scholars contributed.
In unveiling the encyclopedic work at United Nations headquarters in New York this week, one of the authors, Prof. Lawrence R. Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, a Nobel laureate in economics, took the hopeful view that the present troubled time is indeed a period of transition toward a new era of more rapid growth.
But, with the stronger growth that lies ahead, there is also likely to be greater economic instability. "The world economy will probably experience more cyclical sensitivity throughout as the market system spreads," Mr. Klein said. During the present transition period with economic restructuring in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, nearly every country is undergoing a painful readjustment.
"Nevertheless," Mr. Klein said, "the present recessionary and near-recessionary corrections taking place in many countries are just that -- corrections."
When a number of countries enter their expansionary cyclical phases, he predicted, "they have the potential for enjoying an unusually good prospect for the medium term because of the expansionary effects of the Single Market in Europe and the need for making large capital transfers, East to West and North to South."
The development of new areas of the world, combined with a strong inventory of technological advances, will lay the foundations for an expansionary period that could last through the end of the century. The decade of the 1990's, Mr. Klein said, could be more favorable for economic advancement than the 1950's and 1960's -- history's most rapid period of world economic growth.
But other contributors to the five-volume work put far greater stress on the threats than the opportunities ahead. Shafiqul Islam, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, warned that the 21st century may experience "a capitalist cold war."
The challenge is to develop a new strategy, he said, not for containing Communism, but for containing capitalism -- that is, "to manage the breakdown of the postwar bipolar order and prevent the deadly fallout of a capitalist conflict from derailing the transition to a new multipolar world." Mr. Islam is most alarmed over worsening frictions among the United States, Japan and Europe.
The capitalist country that stands to lose the most from this transition, he said, is the United States -- still the world's only economic and military superpower -- and potentially the most destabilizing force.
How America deals with its domestic weaknesses in the 1990's will determine not only its own position in the world order of the next century, but, more critically, how costly and destabilizing the capitalist cold war turns out to be.
Among the other dangers explored in the United Nations volumes are rapid demographic and technological changes. The population of the developing countries is growing rapidly; it will rise by one-fourth in the decade of the 1990's. Nearly one billion new jobs will be needed to accommodate new entrants to the labor force.
At the same time, population growth in the developed countries will slow to a crawl. As the aged population in rich countries increases rapidly, poor countries will have a flood of young people seeking work. Immigration will be resisted in the rich countries for nationalist, ethnic or racist reasons -- but urgently needed as the proportion of their labor forces relative to nonworking people shrinks.
Hanging over both rich and poor countries will be the worsening ecological threat, and the problem of how to combine rapid economic and industrial growth with containment of the environmental threat.
The United Nations' five-volume catalogue, edited by a Turkish scholar, Uner Kirdar, may not contain all the answers, but it looks at all the threats. And if the threats can be managed, they will be converted into opportunities for economic growth and social improvement.

Art in Order
When the Philadelphia Museum of Art opened its doors 64 years ago, Fiske Kimball, the founding director, wanted to display the works of art in a chronological manner that he envisioned as a "walk through time." But while the Philadelphia originally intended to give the public an orderly historical look at 900 years of art, it has instead tended to group collections as they have been donated to the museum. 
 All that is about to change. This summer, at a projected cost of $9.4 million, the museum will embark on its first reorganization and renovation. Over the next three years, all the European art -- which occupies nearly 50 percent of the gallery space and includes thousands of objects ranging from 830 European paintings to an entire French 18th-century Rococo salon -- will be placed in chronological order.
According to a master plan devised by the Philadelphia architect Robert Venturi more than 10 years ago, about 70,000 square feet of space will be renovated and 10 new galleries added. Jeffrey D. Ryan, the project architect, who worked with Mr. Venturi on the master plan and now works on his own in Houston, will oversee the renovation and consult with Mr. Venturi. Lighting for 83 galleries will be redesigned, too, by George Sexton Associates of Washington.
Restoration and conservation are also part of the museum's plans. Over 80 paintings and 150 decorative art objects will be cleaned and restored by a team of experts, some from the museum's staff and others who are being brought in for the project. In addition, new labels will be written for each work. And many objects that have never been on view are to be taken out of storage and put in the new galleries.
"During the reinstallation, no more than 20 percent of the galleries will be closed at a time," said Anne d'Harnoncourt, the museum's director. "We're determined to stay open and busy."
So far, $4.3 million has been raised for the project. The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund has given the museum $2 million. A challenge grant given in two installments and totaling $1,275,000 has come from the National Endowment for the Humanities. In January, the Women's Committee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art pledged $500,000.
Like all museums, the Philadelphia has had its day-to-day financial problems. "It's no surprise these days that it's hard to raise money for exhibitions," Ms. d'Harnoncourt said. "But that really has nothing to do with the reinstallation project." The director said she hoped to raise the remaining $5.1 million by June 1993 from foundations, corporations and private sources.
It's not just money that has made this reinstallation plan possible. Because of a court ruling three years ago, the museum will for the first time be able to rethink the presentation of the Johnson Collection, which has been the linchpin of its holdings.
The collection consists of 1,279 works, including outstanding Italian, Flemish, 17th-century Dutch and 19th-century paintings. It was bequeathed by John G. Johnson, a Philadelphia lawyer and art patron, to the City of Philadelphia. In 1933, it was placed in the museum under terms of an agreement that the collection be installed in a block of galleries separate from the rest of the museum's holdings. The Orphans Court in Philadelphia decided, however, that sections of the Johnson collection might be juxtaposed with other art.
"It means that works can be organized in relation to their period," said Joseph Rishel, curator of the Johnson Collection and of European paintings. "For example, Mr. Johnson's 17th-century Dutch pictures can be next to the museum's Dutch works. In nearby galleries a period room and decorative arts from the same period will be displayed together. The motivation here is logic and clarity."
When the first phase of the project is complete, the medieval galleries on the second floor will be transformed so that the early Italian and northern European paintings from the Johnson Collection will be installed in and around the museum's holdings of medieval and Renaissance architecture, sculpture and decorative arts.
 
Switching Galleries
 More gallery hopping has been reported this week: Both Joel Shapiro and Peter Halley are leaving prominent SoHo galleries for operations with a more uptown image. While both artists declined to discuss their departures, many art-world experts say they believe that given the rocky economy, both moves reflect a desire to join more high-powered and high-profile operations.
After 23 years with the Paula Cooper Gallery, Mr. Shapiro has decided to join Pace, which has galleries both in SoHo and on 57th Street. He is not the first artist to make such a move over the last few years. Robert Mangold and Donald Judd also left Ms. Cooper's gallery and are also now showing at Pace. Ms. Cooper did not return phone calls. But Douglas Baxter, Pace's director, confirmed the report. "We are thrilled to be working with Joel," he said. "Paula has represented him well, but after 23 years, the artist felt it was time his work was given another context."
Mr. Halley is leaving the Sonnabend Gallery and will be showing instead at Gagosian, which also has Madison Avenue and SoHo galleries. "It's entirely true that Peter is leaving us," said Antonio Homem, the director at Sonnabend. "I think it's quite a curious move. During the late 80's, we were careful to protect our artists from the negative effects of the secondary market and now Peter is joining Gagosian, who got where he is by dealing in secondary art."
Larry Gagosian says that market, the trade in second sales of contemporary art, is one of his gallery's strengths. "It benefits the artist," he said. "When someone has a painting to sell, my gallery is better positioned to place it." Mr. Gagosian said he was planning an exhibition of Mr. Halley's work at his new Wooster Street gallery. "It will be the first time we'll show paintings in that space," Mr. Gagosian said.
"I don't think galleries steal artists," Mr. Gagosian added. "Over time artists feel they've exhausted a relationship and then it's time for them to move on."
 
Wright Sale
 Three perforated cypress panels, a dome skylight, countless light fixtures, a door and window sashes, as well as an array of items ranging from copper trim strips to a pot rack -- all parts of the Usonian exhibition house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright -- will be auctioned by Leslie Hindman Auctioneers in Chicago from March 15 to 17.
In 1953, the Usonian house (a Wright term based on the initials U.S.) was built where the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is now on Fifth Avenue as part of an exhibition of 60 years of Wright's work; it was dismantled a year later. The proceeds from the Chicago auction will be donated to the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy.
"Fragments of the house have been floating around for nearly 40 years," said Carla Lind, executive director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. "While we're in the business of saving houses, we could never re-create the Usonian house from what is left. And anyway, the house was not meant to be lived in." These house parts were thought to have been destroyed. But in 1984, they were discovered by David Henken, a contractor and former Wright apprentice who erected the house. He stored most of the pieces in a storeroom in his own Pleasantville, N.Y., home. When they were discovered, Mr. Henken donated them to Channel 13 for its annual auction. Thomas Monaghan of Domino's Pizza bought the fragments at the auction. He then donated them to the conservancy.
Six years before he designed the Guggenheim building, Wright erected the two-bedroom Usonian house, which was designed to illustrate the architect's theories about affordable small residences. At the time, Wright estimated the design could be duplicated in the New York area for $35,000.
Now the dome skylight once used over the kitchen work area is expected to fetch $400 and the perforated panels have a presale estimate of $3,000 each. "The point of the auction," Ms. Lind said, "is to raise money to benefit other Wright buildings."

 BODY:
There's nothing funny about 200,000 human beings incinerated by nuclear weapons.
Ernest Hollings, usually a sensible Senator, shamed himself Monday by tastelessly quipping to South Carolina workers: "You should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it, 'Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan.' " 
 Senator Hollings says he wanted to show his exasperation with comments by Japanese politicians that disparaged American work habits. Such remarks are ignorant and provocative but they concern economic competition, not wholesale death. Mr. Hollings's riposte is totally out of line.
A half-century after the events, there's still debate about the wisdom of President Truman's decision to force a speedy end to World War II by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A parallel debate recently erupted in Japan over the morality of Tokyo's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Such self-examination honors both societies.
Both countries are entitled to decent respect for the innocent dead. That's what Senator Hollings has lost sight of. Unrepentant, he glories in his callous joke. In contrast to the hasty apologies from Japan that have followed every high-level insult made there, the Senator tells questioners: "I'm glad I said it." Even a belated apology would be welcome.

Banana Republic, U.S.A.

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
We have a Government of followers following followers, turning the United States inward and honing the mentality of a banana republic. This week inside Congressional hearing rooms, you could have heard the whines and wails of weakness.
Secretary of State James Baker went there to make the case for $900 million over two years for U.N. peacekeeping operations in places like Cambodia and Yugoslavia. Even that amount would fall far short of what the U.N. said it expected and needed from America. 
 Meanwhile, the Administration was already working behind the scenes to settle for much less than $900 million -- so that all could hide what little they would vote for the presumably unpopular task of peacekeeping.
But return to yesterday's hearing and listen to Fritz Hollings, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. Talking of Israel brushing aside U.N. forces in Lebanon a few weeks ago, the South Carolina Democrat said: "I've always thought maybe we ought to give the role over to McDonald's and Burger King because they walk right by and sell hamburgers as they go forwards and backwards."
To which Mr. Baker responded that "Some peacekeeping operations have been more successful than others."
On Tuesday, Harold Rogers, top Republican on the House Appropriations subcommittee, argued that it was unfair for the U.S. to pay 30 percent of peacekeeping operations since "we only represent 25 percent of the world's" economy. "And Cambodia makes the case," he said. "I mean, Cambodia is in Japan's economic sphere of influence."
Mr. Baker explained that paying more than others was what leaders did. Mercifully, he ignored the point about Japan.
Joseph Early, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House subcommittee, offered that peacekeeping is "good rhetoric . . . good theory. But we can't afford it."
How do you explain to someone who does not instinctively understand? How do you convey the unthinkable horror of the U.S. failing to do everything it can to stop the killing in Cambodia? Who needs to be reminded of the million Cambodians who died after President Nixon brought the Vietnam War fully to Cambodia? Who can imagine not finding a few hundred million dollars to prevent the resurgence of the dread Khmer Rouge?
Mr. Baker made all the right points. He told the lawmakers that "we have spent trillions of dollars to win the cold war and we ought to be willing to spend millions of dollars to secure the peace."
The Administration and a number of legislators know the peacekeeping money is a necessity, but no politician will lead the fight for it. The obvious place to find it is in the Pentagon budget, yet Mr. Bush rejects this. And no one wants to step out front on anything "foreign," particularly foreign aid.
So Congress and the Administration are working out an arrangement beyond public view. It revolves around a budgetary term known as "headroom," or money not spent as quickly as expected.
It seems that there is some $200 million to $300 million in headroom in the current fiscal year, mainly monies that had been earmarked for the shaky democracies of Eastern Europe. Most of this headroom will be reallocated for peacekeeping and buried in a legislative device known as a continuing resolution on appropriations. Those doing the bargaining will look for several hundred million dollars elsewhere for the coming fiscal year. They will settle for less than they know is required to do the job and trigger the necessary funds from other nations.
But that is the best they think they can do in the current political climate. Even then, everything must be hidden -- in rhetoric and legislative devices. The people must not be made too aware that their leaders are spending money to keep the peace. For otherwise the people will punish them -- or so these leaders assume.
Such leaders are not leaders. They are followers, of their own fear. That fear suffused Congressional hearing rooms this week. And it spreads the mindset of weakness and irresponsibility throughout Washington.
Americans are in pain. And our leaders must pull themselves together to address that pain. But pain is one thing and killing another. And unless our followers become leaders and regain some balance about foreign and domestic priorities, thousands upon thousands will perish.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Political Disease

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
In the very recent past, most intellectual conservatives understood, named and fought against a political disease they called moral equivalency. Now a sad number of them are suddenly suffering from it.
Moral equivalency is a disorder of that part of the mental process that governs ethical political thought and conduct. Those afflicted exhibit certain specific symptoms. 
 They cannot discern the essential differences between political good and political evil when choices have to be made. They magnify the faults and complications of democracy and glaze over the horrors of tyranny. They refuse to choose between freedom and oppression when the friends of freedom desperately need help.
They accept from authoritarian or despotic governments acts of bigotry and human indecency against which they would crusade in a free society.
This disorder led many Western liberals to equate the faults of capitalism with the villainies of Communism. It led them to decide that Moscow and Washington were equal threats to peace and liberty. At the moment, it leads the West to the bizarre conclusion that one democracy in the Middle East is a greater danger than the score or so dictatorships arrayed against it.
Now, angry with President Bush's deviations from their vision of economic conservatism, and disgusted with his floundering, conservatives are shutting mouths and eyes to the danger embodied by Patrick Buchanan.
That danger was put forward most plainly by that cool- and clear-minded columnist Charles Krauthammer. He wrote that Mr. Buchanan's combination of ugliness about immigrants, his fears for the future of "white Americans," his admiration of so many dictators, his contempt for democracy, his anti-Semitism, his adoption of the "America First" slogan so identified with Nazi apologists and now his Peronist denunciations of "vulture capitalism" summon up a word: fascistic.
The sorrow of current American political life is that many conservatives, in their anger about Mr. Bush and the recession, are tolerating a man whose values dishonor them, their party and the country. That is moral equivalency in emergency-room form.
Case example: The National Review, once the healthy pride of American conservative intellectualism, now is wan and pockmarked with the disease. It does not yet match The Nation, a carrier from the left, but it is getting too close.
William Buckley, founder and president of The Review, wrote that Mr. Buchanan had said anti-Semitic things. Then he promptly backed a protest vote in New Hampshire for the man, stunning friends who thought they would never see the day.
Now he says that since the protest point has been made in New Hampshire there is no use voting for Mr. Buchanan in other primaries. But the point his readers will remember is that Mr. Buckley believes Mr. Buchanan's mouthings acceptable enough to vote for him at least once.
John O'Sullivan, The Review's current editor, goes further. He advises Republicans to keep supporting Mr. Buchanan until "a milli-second" before Mr. Buchanan himself decides to support Mr. Bush, "probably" early April. For Mr. O'Sullivan, this is the delicious part: that strategy would avoid blame if Mr. Bush loses the Presidency and also would install Mr. Buchanan as first among equals in the 1996 Republican contest. See?
But Mr. O'Sullivan hints that if Mr. Bush looks "seriously unelectable" during the primaries he should be dumped in favor of a third conservative. Sure -- and the Buchanan to whom the moral equivalizers gave the prize of respectability would then meekly step aside for somebody maybe a little more refined.
I am sure that some of Mr. Buchanan's visceral viciousness must be distasteful to Mr. O'Sullivan, but he doesn't say so. Or am I really sure now?
Many Americans who vote for Mr. Buchanan as a protest may not yet have figured through the lasting impact. But the politicians, commentators and intellectual conservatives who know Mr. Buchanan's record and still give him respectability, urge votes for him or even remain silent, these all have made their choice.
Still, a cure exists for the moral equivalency that has stricken conservatives -- remembrance of times so recently past. To refuse it is a kind of intellectual suicide, a sin in itself.

HEADLINE: How to Cut Long-Term Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Burton G. Malkiel; Burton G. Malkiel, a member of President Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisers, is professor of economics at Princeton University.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, says he is worried about the "exceptional measure of uncertainty" regarding economic recovery in 1992. Consumers are overextended, investment is restrained by overbuilt commercial real estate and weakened lending institutions, and Government spending is constrained by large deficits.
Despite stimulative monetary policy, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high, especially in relation to inflation. Mortgage rates, for example, are around 9 percent. These high rates restrain home building and productivity-boosting business investment. 
 What's an economic policy maker to do? Many economists suggest, correctly, that the Treasury and Federal Reserve work to push long-term rates down and allow short-term rates to rise. This can be accomplished by having the Treasury stop the sale of long-term bonds and issue only short-term securities, while the Federal Reserve purchases long-term bonds in the open market.
The Treasury started in that direction by reducing its long-term offerings in February, but was far too timid. A major shift in financing strategy is needed, at least until relatively full employment is achieved.
This plan has generated criticism from academic economists and financiers. Academics cite the expectations theory of the yield curve, which states that long-term rates are so high because rates are expected to rise: Investors accept lower short-term rates while expecting to reinvest their funds at higher yields later.
If only expectations mattered, any attempt to twist the rates by altering the relative supplies of securities would prove worthless. Buyers would adjust their holdings so that the rate structure retained the shape consistent with expectations.
Forecasts of future rates do play an important role in shaping the yield curve, but to believe that expectations matter while relative supplies of debt instruments don't is to misread the evidence: More-liquid short-term issues usually sell at lower yields than longer-term bonds.
Besides, investors have various preferences in maturities and different expectations. Pension funds with long-term liabilities prefer longer bonds, while banks prefer shorter issues. Investors can be coaxed out of preferred maturities only if the rate structure differs from expectations and normal term premiums. Thus, changing the relative supplies of long-and short-term instruments will alter the structure.
Financers say the policy would unnecessarily surprise the markets, which charge for added uncertainty by raising rates; they point to the Fed's limited success when it experimented with such a policy in the 60's. But a predictable policy of ceasing long-term issues until the economy reached stated targets would not increase uncertainty. Moreover, the Fed never vigorously carried out the policy. And while it was replacing publicly available long-term securities with shorter-term issues, the Treasury was lengthening the maturities of the debt.
We can't be certain a coordinated Fed-Treasury policy would reduce interest costs. All future rates could be higher and the Treasury would have lost an opportunity to put out long-term paper at attractive rates.
But two arguments suggest that savings are highly likely. Long-term rates tend to exceed short-term rates substantially, so that, over time, short-term financing should be much cheaper. Moreover, if inflation remains restrained, as it should with continued temperate monetary policy, long-term rates could fall significantly to bring them in line with historical relationships to inflation. Thus, twisting the rate structure can lower bond yields, encourage long-term investment and save the Government money.

HEADLINE: Thousands Will Suffer From New York City Plan for Watershed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We read with fury "Drinking From Sewers" by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Op-Ed, Feb. 7), on the New York City water system and the need to insure its quality by installing filtration systems and imposing septic rules in the upstate watershed area, the city reservoir source.
There is another side to this story that no one down here wants to report on or think about. There is an elitist attitude that urban New Yorkers seem to have, that they are somehow more important than and should be served by their upstate brethren. 
 This is not new. One has only to recall the exploitation that took place at the sites of the Catskill reservoirs decades ago when towns were flooded, homes and industries destroyed.
 New York City is perhaps faced with an expensive problem, one that might cost $20 to $50 per capita, but upstate in the watershed area homeowners will face costs of at least $5,000 to $10,000 per house site or perhaps find that their land is now uninhabitable at any price.
The watershed area is exactly that. There is water everywhere. Underground and aboveground streams are unavoidable as they wind through millions of acres. Under the proposed plans thousands of homes will be unusable, farms and businesses unable to operate. In addition, the watershed area will be excluded from any residential or industrial expansion.
This is not a case involving a few greedy developers. This will affect tens of thousands of ordinary citizens.

HEADLINE: Southern Africa Hit By Its Worst Drought Of the 20th Century

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, March 6

 BODY:
As cornstalks lie withered on baked soil and dams show perilously low levels of water, southern Africa is in the grip of its worst drought this century, and meteorologists warn that it is spreading north to engulf the entire eastern side of the continent.
While drought is commonplace in certain regions of Africa, weather and food experts say this year's dry spell is extraordinary for its sweep through food-exporting countries, which normally escape severe drought.
 
Kenya Needs Imports
 "There is now a major drought from the Cape to Cairo that is really a serious, serious matter," said Harold Norton, the representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Kenya, who has worked in Africa for the last 25 years. "All the countries from South Africa to East Africa, all the way to Cairo, will be importing grains this year." 
 To feed its own people, Kenya, which usually exports food, will have to import 500,000 tons of food this year and ask for humanitarian aid to feed refugees from Somalia, Mr. Norton said.
With the nations of the former Soviet Union making bigger than ever demands on the West's food supply, Mr. Norton and officials of the United States Agency for International Development said allocations of food aid would have to be adjusted if the normally self-sufficient African countries are to be helped.
"The United States is beginning to reassess food needs worldwide in order to help southern Africa," said Ted Morse, the director of the United States Agency for International Development's office in Zimbabwe.
The failure of rains, accompanied by unseasonally hot temperatures for the planting seasons in South Africa and Zimbabwe, means that these two food-exporting countries will have to import vast amounts of grain for the first time in memory, food experts said.
In Zimbabwe, the hardest-hit country, acute water shortages are threatening the shutdown of industries centered around the town of Bulawayo, and schools have already started to close.
In the arid north of Kenya at Marsabit, cattle belonging to the nomadic Turkana and Boran tribes, are dying, and thirsty people stand by the roadside begging for water from passing vehicles.
An urgent warning by the World Meteorological Organization's drought-monitoring center for eastern and southern Africa says the coming seasonal rains will be weak in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia. The head of the center, Dr. Workneh Degefu, said poor rains in Ethiopia would also affect Egypt because the major source of the Nile River is in western Ethiopia.
The Sudan, which from time to time exports grain, will be importing food this year because of drought, Mr. Norton said.
Weather experts said the poor rainfalls resulted from the meteorological phenonmenon known as El Nino, which refers to unusually warm waters in the Pacific Ocean, which affect global atmospheric circulation.
Peter Usher, the head of the climate-change unit of the United Nations Environmental Program based in Nairobi, said that when El Nino occurs, there is often drought in northwest Brazil, East Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia.
So far, there is no evidence to suggest that global warming is affecting the weather in Africa, Mr. Usher said. "Shorter-term weather phenomena like El Nino are able to have a greater effect than global warming in Africa."
The long rains that usually come in December and January to aid planting in southern Africa did not materialize, he said. And the short rains, meaning more violent, abrupt rains across equatorial eastern Africa, were very weak in the latter part of last year, he said.
 
Food Reserves Already Low
 In southern Africa, the drought has hit at a time when food reserves were already low because of poor harvests last year. The Southern African Development Co-ordination Council said in a bulletin in January that all or parts of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe were affected by the drought and were suffering food shortages.
The region may have to import more than seven million tons of food from August this year to May 1993, compared with normal imports of two million tons, according to F.A.O. and A.I.D. estimates.
South Africa alone, usually the world's sixth-largest exporter of grain, will have to import four million tons of corn, according to the F.A.O. Estimates of the corn crop run as low as 25 percent of normal.
In neighboring Namibia, the deputy director of agriculture, Lutz Matthiesen, said 80 percent of the commercial corn crop had been lost. "Whether widespread rains fall in March and April or not will only make a marginal difference to the situation," he said.
But in Zimbabwe, where it is already difficult to buy corn meal, the dietary staple, the effects of the drought have extended far beyond the crops.
In Bulawayo, the western industrial center, water rationing in homes permits a little over 420 quarts a day. "That allows a small bath and some left over for washing," said Daniel Kinnear, an environmental expert who lives there. "People are obeying the rationing because they are scared."
Only 12 weeks of water supply is left in the local reservoirs, and industries, including the big textile mills, face closure, officials say.
The once vibrant Zimbabwean dairy industry is in ruins.
"In just two years we have been reduced from a sophisticated first-world dairy industry to one of subsistence and mere survival," said Alan Burl, the president of the Commercial Farmers Union.
About 30 percent of the commercial cow herd may be slaughtered because stockfeeds will have to be imported and thus will be too expensive, said Doug Pascoe, the director of the National Association of Dairy Farmers.
And Zimbabwe's food shortage has a ripple effect on surrounding countries. Mozambique, for instance, has relied on Zimbabwe's corn to feed the large number of people displaced by the civil war, and food for more than one million Mozambican refugees in southern Malawi has come from Zimbabwe.
Farther north, in Kenya, the drought has aggravated already low farm production caused by marketing or pricing factors, many say. In the capital, Nairobi, the effects of drought have been clear for the last month. Butter has disappeared from the grocery stores, and milk is difficult to buy because of low output in the dairy industry. Many residential homes are without water as the water authority tries to distribute what is left of the supply fairly.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Bush Brings Largess of Office Along on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PENSACOLA, Fla., March 6

 BODY:
If conservatives should be grateful to Patrick J. Buchanan for pushing President Bush to the right on issues like welfare and taxes, then state officials who have been waiting for Federal largess may also have to send Mr. Buchanan thank you notes.
As Mr. Bush charges across the country, his campaign forced out of the White House by Mr. Buchanan's challenge and showing new signs of fear and confusion, the President ends up at times looking like a political rich uncle visiting his poor relations. 
 Landing his enormous red, white and blue airplane in three or four states a day, Mr. Bush scatters plums as he goes: a $514 million reclamation project for Florida, a relaxation of regulations on natural gas for Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, the promise of new pollution control rules for Michigan, a boost for biotechnology companies in California.
White House aides deny that they are playing politics with the Federal purse, which has always been one of an incumbent's more formidable weapons as he seeks to drown out his opponents with Presidential noise.
But each of these gestures of Federal largess has been timed for Mr. Bush's campaign needs in the Republican nominating contest, and they are one of several indications of the Bush campaign's increasing anxiety as it tries everything it can think of to blunt Mr. Buchanan and get Mr. Bush on the offensive for the first time in this campaign.
Some Republican strategists say they are worried that Mr. Bush is squandering the power that his incumbency should give him in the campaign.
"With Bush, people just want to grab the guy and say, 'Damn it, act Presidential. Look strong. Act strong,' " said Edward C. Rollins, a former Republican Party official who is a frequent critic of the Bush White House.
So far, though, the President's campaign remains reactive. Mr. Bush has been following Mr. Buchanan around the country as the challenger chooses where to contest the President. Bush aides have been using television commercials in markets selected by Mr. Buchanan, going on the air in Texas today, for example, after Mr. Buchanan started advertising there.
Republican strategists say Mr. Bush is growing angry at the disjointed nature of his schedule and his speeches, and at his advisers' failure to help him reduce the voter discontent evident since the first primary in New Hampshire last month.
This has produced some signs of a fearful campaign. The fear is that Mr. Buchanan's showing reflects problems that Mr. Bush will encounter in the general election, and that its efforts to correct the situation are not working.
In response, Bush aides are searching for somewhere to fix the blame. The campaign complains one week that the White House is not producing policies to back up Mr. Bush's candidacy. The next week, the White House complains that the campaign has the President on the road too much.
Both seem convinced that their problem was not that things were going badly, but that outsiders, particularly the press, simply did not recognize that Mr. Bush was doing a good job and that his campaign was going strong.
 
Salty Words for the Press
 Today, an irritated Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, concluded that reporters traveling with Mr. Bush were writing critical articles because they sometimes skipped going to the events and stayed in the newsrooms set up by the White House, where they can listen to Mr. Bush's words on loudspeakers and watch him on television monitors.
"I'm sick of you lazy bastards," Mr. Fitzwater shouted this morning outside the press room in a Bible study center at Oklahoma Christian University near Oklahoma City. He ordered his staff to cut the audio line feeding Mr. Bush's remarks into the room.
Alarmed by the immediate news reports of his remark, Mr. Fitzwater later apologized for his language. But Republican strategists saw the outburst as a symptom of a campaign that cannot seem to regain its footing.
"Sometimes you just can't get good press, but you have to get through it," said a veteran Republican strategist. "I also don't like to see them contradicting each other and criticizing each other. Their view is very short term, the primaries, when they should be looking at the larger picture, November."
To help him through these hard times, Mr. Bush has been trying familiar political tactics.
To seem more in tune with his audiences, his speeches are peppered with regional and local references: allusions to the race car driver Richard Petty when he is in the Carolinas, references to Elvis Presley in Memphis.
Mr. Bush offers lectern-pounding denunciations of abortion to conservative Christian organizations, denounces Fidel Castro before Cuban-Americans and brings home builders to their feet by proposing a $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers.
 
Political Motives Denied
 White House aides deny they are playing politics with those tactics or with the Federal purse. But extending Government generosity has always been one of the primary tools available to incumbents and the timing of Mr. Bush's gestures have coincided with his campaign needs.
Today, in Oklahoma, he announced that he was relaxing regulations on the natural gas industry, important to the state. In Jackson, Miss., Mr. Bush announced that he was naming a state resident, James B. Huff, as head of the Rural Electrification Administration. When Mr. Bush arrived in Florida on Wednesday, the White House announced a tentative agreement on a $514 million program to clean up the wetlands of the Kissimee Basin.
Administration officials said the White House had put pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency to drop a new pollution control proposal that could cause Mr. Bush trouble in Michigan, where unemployment is high and Mr. Buchanan is expected to campaign.
Such actions have already drawn criticism. Mr. Buchanan accused Mr. Bush of catering to his political needs before the New Hampshire primary with three Federal initiatives that would create 400 jobs and pump more than $274 million in financial aid and loan guarantees into that state.
"These are legitimate needs that we're responding to and which people are concerned about," said Judy Smith, the deputy White House press secretary. "The President highlights these issues when he comes to the states."

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Increases to 7.3% In a Mixed Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate climbed two-tenths of a point in February to 7.3 percent, the highest since mid-1985, the Labor Department reported today. But other job data, notably a gain of 164,000 payroll jobs, pointed to a slight upturn in the economy.
Most private economists said they were encouraged by the sizable payroll jump, as well as by a lengthening of the average workweek and a sharp rebound in total production hours. Some contended that the recession -- by technical rather than popular definition -- probably ended last month if it had not done so previously. 
 But Democrats seized on the higher jobless rate in the report, the first look at overall economic performance last month, as evidence of continued economic weakness and worker hardship, a theme they plan to push forcefully during the campaign year.
 
 
'Grim News Indeed'
 "Very grim news indeed," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, at a hearing on the job figures.
Campaigning in Baton Rouge, La., President Bush was asked if joblessness would hurt him. "I don't know," he responded. "We've just got to worry about those who don't have jobs. It's a good argument for passing our program."
The President's top economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, emphasized the favorable elements of today's mixed report but was careful not to raise expectations too high.
 
Hard to Interpret
 "We're deeply concerned about the rise in the unemployment rate," he said in an interview. "While the gains in non-farm payroll jobs, the workweek, overtime and earnings are positive signs, the economy is not yet growing rapidly enough to prevent a rise in unemployment. Speeding, strengthening and insuring that growth is the President's first priority to get Americans back to work."
 By all accounts, this month's report was unusually hard to interpret, as reflected in bond prices that first tumbled, driving interest rates higher, and then regained the lost ground.
The report contained conflicting evidence, including a 74,000 decline in jobs as measured by the survey of households, compared with a gain more than twice that big for company payrolls, as measured in the separate survey of employers. This, combined with revisions and statistical aberrations, compounded the normal analytical task.
Generally, however, most economists agreed that the report depicted an economy moving ahead ever so slowly and unlikely either to slip back into recession or to grow fast enough in the foreseeable future to generate inflation pressures.
"It's positive," said Kathryn Eickhoff, president of a New York consulting firm carrying her name, adding that the economic "stirrings" cited recently by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had grown stronger. "But it's certainly nothing to get very excited about."
Private analysts said they also tended to think that today's report was sufficiently encouraging that it added no pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates yet again as a spur to the economy.
Nonetheless, the figures disclosed areas of increased job-market distress, including another substantial rise in the ranks of those out of work for long periods. While those idled for less than five weeks actually declined by 278,000, this was more than offset by a rise of 235,000 in those jobless from 5 to 14 weeks and a rise of 145,000 in those jobless for 15 weeks or more.
 
 
Jobless Spell Climbs
 The average jobless spell climbed to 17 weeks, from 16.4 weeks in January and 15.3 weeks in December. Moreover, the number of unemployed Americans expanded by 315,000 last month to 9,244,000, the highest level since December 1983 and 2.8 million above the total when the latest recession started in July 1990.
So while it appeared from one set of statistics that the economy was no longer throwing people out of work in recent weeks, neither was it generating enough jobs to absorb an ever-larger pool of people seeking them, including the hard-core unemployed. At the same time, however, the report also showed a rise of 541,000 in "job losers," those forced to leave their jobs, during February.
The labor force grew by another 241,000 last month, a major factor in raising the unemployment rate. The jobless rate typically continues to move higher during the early stages of recovery as people who had given up looking for jobs become hopeful enough to start searching again, and are thereby restored to the statistical work force.
Yet the figures show that there were 190,000 fewer of these jobless "re-entrants" last month, a total of 2.16 million, compared with 2.35 million in January. The number of unsuccessful new entrants to the labor force -- like college graduates and other first-time job hunters -- rose 33,000, to 823,000.
One partial explanation of what was happening was that the long-term jobless who had exhausted their benefits had been induced by the latest extension of benefits to visit their unemployment office to re-establish eligibility.
The household survey also showed a sharp increase of 1.7 points, to 20 percent, in the jobless rate for teen-agers, a group that has been hit especially hard over the last two years. Black teen-age men now have a jobless rate of 39 percent, or 42.4 percent without benefit of seasonal adjustment. The jobless rate for Hispanic people rose last month to 11.6 percent from 11.3 percent.
 
 
Longer Jobless Periods
 Over all, the number of people out of work six months or more has nearly doubled over the last year and the proportion of such jobless has risen to 1 in 5 from 1 in 10.
The department's survey of payrolls produced a far bigger expansion than analysts had predicted, but the 164,000 rise proved less impressive when subjected to close inspection. Of the total, 133,000 of the increase was reported as coming in retail trade, a result that analysts said was not credible in light of a decline of 158,000 before seasonal adjustment.
William G. Barron Jr., Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee that "recessionary forces have modified the seasonal patterns" for retailing.
Factory jobs rose 12,000 in February after five months of decline that averaged 40,000 each month. But there would have been another loss had it not been for the recall of 30,000 auto workers from layoffs.
At the same time, however, the length of the average private-sector workweek expanded a hefty 24 minutes, and factory hours and factory overtime also rose. This was a favorable sign, economists said, because longer hours are a precursor to new hiring, as employers seek to meet higher demand for their goods.
"I think they show the recession has finally ended," Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group, said of the data released today. "But the prospect is for no meaningful recovery," he added, with the unemployment rate probably rising for many months to come.

HEADLINE: Life at 'Jeff': Tough Students Wonder Where Childhood Went

 BODY:
New Yorkers and indeed the nation were shocked when two students were gunned down in the hallway of Thomas Jefferson High School in East New York, Brooklyn, on Feb. 26. Khalil Sumpter, a 15-year-old student, was arrested and charged with the slayings of Tyrone Sinkler, 16, and Ian Moore, 17.
For the 1,800 students who attend "Jeff," in one of the poorest and most violent sections of the city, murder and mayhem are as much a feature of teen-age life as pep rallies and proms. 
 To learn more about the lives, hopes and fears of these "children of war," as their principal calls them, The New York Times invited two diverse groups of Thomas Jefferson students -- 19 altogether -- to discussions last Saturday and Wednesday.
Even as city officials called for such measures as more metal detectors in the schools, many of the students said the problems went far beyond guns, ultimately to a kind of corrosion of the spirit.
The young people said they coped with life on the hard streets in ways that ranged from wearing bulletproof vests to pinning their hopes on careers that will take them far from East New York.
The following text was taken from the transcript of three hours of conversations with three reporters: E. R. Shipp, Felicia R. Lee and Mary B. W. Tabor.
MARIANA BRYANT: Last night we was looking through my junior high school yearbook and my friend pointed out a number of people in that book that was dead.
Q.: About how many would you estimate?
MARIANA: Ten, all guys from eighth and ninth grade.
CAROLINE GRIFFITH: There was a shooting around my building over this girl. I was on my way to school. Two guys were going with one girl, so after one found out then he just pulled out his gun and shot him. . . . The one that got shot was 17.
SEAN WILLIAMS: One of the guys that died from this school was Wesley. . . . He got shot in a barbershop right across the street on Pennsylvania. . . . I think he was 16.
He was caught on the wrong side of Pennsylvania Avenue, the demarcation line in long-running guerrilla warfare between those who live in the Linden housing project and those who live "on the other side."
NEREIDA TORRES: I had a boyfriend that recently died. He got killed right there across the street at a party over an argument and they decided, well, if they couldn't get him to fight . . . He wasn't a punk. Why you gone fight over an argument, something stupid? So they just decided just to come up and kill him. . . . They shot him in the neck.
NORVEN CHARLES: A couple of months ago there was a drive-by shooting and one of my friends died.
KAREEM SMITH: I already got shot. . . . I ran into this kid that I had a little problem with.
Q.: Larry, how many do you know who have been shot?
LARRY BUGETT: A lot. That's all I can say is a lot of people I know.
Q.: More than five?
LARRY: More than 20. People that's 18 and under. Cause we used to be in a posse called V.I.P.: Vanderveer International Posse.
Q.: Over what period of time were these people shot?
LARRY: Like two years, three years. Some is dead. Some crippled. Some of them is still selling. Some of them is in jail now.
Nearly all of the students agree that life was not nearly as rough for them when they were in elementary school.
SHAWN CAMERON: You'd fight in the morning, but by afternoon y'all laugh together, y'all best friends again and then it starts all over. Y'all going to the store buying each other things and talking about girls and everything and walk home together.
Now, it's like I could look at you wrong. We could have words right now and that afternoon you don't know what's gone happen to you when you walk out the door.
KAREEM: Now you get some beef, just get a burner and do what you got to do. Back in them days you used to fight and it used to be over.
KENAISHA WARREN: When I was young, I'm used to, like, go into the park, stay out late at night just playing with the kids. But now, you can't do that. If you go to the park, you're liable to get shot. . . . When I was young, if you don't get your way, you tell your mother. They settle it.
Now they got guns at age of 10 years old, going to elementary school, and elementary school is even terrible as high school. . . . Next we're gone hear that they're shooting in the elementary schools.
The students, boys and girls, say they have to walk the streets ever mindful that there are certain blocks that are unsafe for them because of ongoing gang rivalries and "beef" that someone may have with them personally. 
Q.: How do you know what the rules are, that you can walk on one side of a street and not the other side?
EUGENE ROBICHAUX: Examples. They make examples of people. They catch somebody and kill 'em and then you know: don't be over on this side.
Q.: Are you afraid that you could be the next victim?
MARIANA: I'm afraid. Right now it's a dispute between these two guys, a rivalry over two gangs. My brother said he was sitting in a barbershop and they came in there and shot through the window. . . . It gets to the point where I don't walk up that block no more because I heard the guys that cut hair there, they've got to wear bulletproof vests.
SHAWN: I got one.
Q.: Where did you get a bulletproof vest?
SHAWN: My uncle.
Kareem said that he also has a bulletproof vest that he bought for "a buck fifty" -- that is, $150 -- after telling his mother he needed the money for new sneakers.
KAREEM: I wear it on Fridays and Saturdays. . . . Sometimes I wear it when I'm going off my block, out my projects. Like if I'm going to Bed-Stuy to see this other chick, I wear my vest.
Q.: Isn't that an awful way to have to live, to have to wear a bulletproof vest when you leave home for parties or dates?
KAREEM: No, if you want to be safe.
Q.: Why don't you carry a gun?
KAREEM: Cause you'll get arrested for carrying a gun, not for wearing a bulletproof vest.
Q.: What about a knife?
KAREEM: I don't carry no knife. What am I going to do: stab the bullet?
Thomas Jefferson High School's reputation is now one of violence and hopelessness. It bothers many of the students that outsiders make no distinction between those who are thugs and those who are struggling to make it.
SHAWN: When you go out on the street, like, and say if a guy wants to talk to a girl, you tell them you go to Jeff, or vice-versa, if the girl say that she go to Jeff, then guys get queery and go, "Never mind. I don't want to talk to her." They want to change directions on you when you tell them what school you go to. They think you're part of the violence in the school.
Given its reputation -- one that goes back to when some of the students parents were there in the 1960's and 1970's -- and given the reality of life in East New York, few said they were surprised that two students could be shot to death in their school, even on a day the building was crawling with extra security guards and police officers in preparation for a visit by the Mayor.
AYANNA ROSS: Why would you be surprised? Look at the people that's in there.
MAESHAY LEWIS: It's like you have all these people from different areas like four blocks down, six blocks over, whatever . . . and they don't get along. It doesn't have anything to do with the school. It's like what happened during the summertime, during a vacation or on a weekend or something, and everyone comes into this one building and that's where it all just boils up.
KAREEM: It's a lot of guys in Jeff that think they're tough guys. They just want to be hardrocks.
MAESHAY: Like most of us here are involved in a lot of academic things and stay after school for certain things. People are like: "I'm not with that. You crazy? I'm not staying after school. What I look like doing that?" Everybody feel like they're going to be less of a man, less of a something, or they're not going to be down because they're trying to do something positive. It's like: "That's corny. You know you're never going to get anywhere." They all feel that it's hopeless. They feel that they're not going to get anything out of it.
But Shawn Cameron said he was surprised at the most recent shootings and, like many of his fellow students, angry that the Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, had failed them.
SHAWN: I was surprised because the school should have learned its lesson when the first guy got shot and Fernandez made a speech about how this won't happen and he was going to improve the security in the school, but three months later, there are two more people that's shot inside the school.
LARRY: If it wasn't for him, none of this would have happened. If he had tight, tight security. When Darrell Sharpe got shot, he should have put in security every day, not no once a week.
Q.: So do you all have faith in the Chancellor?
NORVEN: I don't have faith in no one. We can't depend on someone to protect us. We've got to protect ourselves. If we get searched in the doorway and we get outside and somebody got beef with us, we don't have nothing to protect ourselves. It's like we gone be killed.
[LAUGHTER]:
NORVEN: It ain't funny.
None of the students thought the metal detectors would improve safety or help save lives.
RETISHA MYATT: They might catch some of the people with the weapons, but if something's gone happen to you, it's gone happen to you. You can't stop it.
MAESHAY: It may not happen in the building, but it can happen when they come out the building, on the way to the building.
MARIANA: They have all these cops walking around with guns. One of the students may take it from them and use it on the other ones.
The daily presence of the metal detectors and the newly enforced rules about who can be in the hallways is succeeding in one thing: making even the good kids angry. They refer to the hallway pass they need just to go to the bathroom as "the Rikers Island pass."
SHAWN: Kids shouldn't have to come to school and get searched. It's like you're a common criminal in New York.
But there is a more deeply rooted anger that seems to lead to an ever-escalating level of violence. 
Q.: Why are people so angry, angry enough to kill?
SHAWN: The main reason is somebody in their family probably got shot or got murdered, and they just go out and have revenge on everybody they don't like.
RETISHA: I think it's peer pressure. It's a lot of guys that hang around other people just to be in the crowd. . . . Some people just got guns to have them and then a lot of them use them. Then the ones that do use them don't know how to use them. That's how a lot of innocent bystanders get killed, too.
Everyone wants some kind of "rep" or reputation -- and one way to earn one for being tough is to carry a gun, the teen-agers said. No one wants to be seen as a "herb" or wimp. 
SEAN: If a guy steps on your foot, it's one of your peers says, "Oh, you gone let that happen to you? He stepped on your foot." You know, you have the right mind that's like, "I'm gone ignore that." But your friend says, "You ain't gone do nothing about that?" That puts you to the limit. You be like "Ahh, what I'm gone do?" It gets you thinking and you say something: "Yo, what the hell are you doing?" or something like that. You start, you know, to break.
NATHANIEL EDWARDS: Say I was walking in the hallway and somebody bumped me and they meant to bump me. And now, me, I'm the herb. I will turn and I will walk away from them. Next day, he gone bump me again. Now it's a Friday, right? And he comes and bump me and he says, "Yo, what's up, man? If you keep walking away, we'll keep bothering you." . . . You can fight right there, but a gun gone come in sooner or later.
Disputes can start over what the teen-agers acknowledge to be "the stupidest things." Kareem Smith said he almost fought a friend who tried to grab his cheeseburger. Others have fought when someone stepped on their sneakers or looked at them the wrong way. Rumors -- "he said, she said," as Kenaisha Warren put it -- also lead to "beef." 
KAREEM: You get beef on a basketball court over a call or something. Be ready to fight. . . . People got shot over basketball right there at Gershwin. Got shot dead. Two times in the head. It wasn't in school but it was after they had played basketball.
Q.: Did you transfer to Jeff because you caught beef in Flatbush?
LARRY: In a way, yeah. They was threatening me and I didn't want to get killed. I'm too young to die.
Q.: Is there a difference in the way that girls settle disputes and the way that boys do?
NATHANIEL: Boys shoot and fight once in a while. But girls? When they get mad at each other, they all gone jump, a group jump one girl, or they get razors and they go and slice up the girl.
One way to assure status and protection is to join a "posse." Larry said that he was a member of V.I.P. until two years ago and, among other things, they stole money from kids who earned tips bagging groceries. 
MARIANA: Over here they don't really call it gangs. It's a posse. In L.A. it's a gang. But it's the same thing.
NATHANIEL: In L.A., right, they've got gangs and everybody is a brother and nobody will turn on nobody. But see out here, it's like they're all associates. Say we're all cool right now and then I would find a reason not to like him and then we're not cool no more and me and him got a beef. In gangs that don't happen. In gangs they're all brothers.
Members of posses are expected to seek revenge for any harm that comes to their friends.
KAREEM: If I can't get you and I see your boy, I'm tearing him up.
KNAISHA: That's how they all think: if I can't get one, I'm gone get another, and if I can't get none of them, I'll get they family.
KAREEM: Yeah, if I can't get you and I see your brother, your sister.
KENAISHA: See? And that's messed up. They're innocent. They don't know what's going on. Even if they little 3-year-old sister is just walking up the street, they shoot them. That don't make no sense.
KAREEM: If you can't get who you after, if you know who he deal with, get them.
Q.: Why?
KAREEM: Cause, if you upset, you got to take your anger out on somebody.
LARRY: Right.
Now Jefferson students are standing poised for the friends of Ian Moore and Tyrone Sinkler to avenge their deaths.
AYANNA: What happened to Ian and the rest of them, that ain't finished. It's still gone be more going on. Cause it ain't finished.
Q. Have you thought about transferring because Jeff is bad for your rep?
ALL: Nooooo.
MARIANA: That would be so stupid to transfer because this is my school, this is my community and this is where I live. I'm not gone transfer for nobody, 'cause if I transfer it's gone make me look stupid because I live in the community. That's like I'm running from where I live.
SEAN: We've all been together since we came from junior high school. We've just grown in this school. This is like our second house.
SHAWN: Everybody's thinking about, "Oh, people died there." They're not thinking about what the good kids are trying to do. . . . Everybody in this room right now, everybody tries to make this school a little bit better. We plan dances, social occasions, everything. Everybody trying to apply to colleges. Everybody tries to bust their rear just to survive outside. People working. People doing everything. Me, I'm in the drama program, and we're going to be doing a Broadway show at the end of the year. Everybody else in here is doing something. They're not going the bad way. We're the forgotten kids in here.
Thomas Jefferson has now become somewhat synonymous with the worst of urban education. And that bothers those who think of themselves as the "good kids," including seniors who have been applying for college.
SHAWN: How do we know that when they see "Jeff," they're not just throwing our applications out?
SEAN: I was being recruited by colleges all over the country, like U.C.L.A., Oklahoma, a lot of big schools. They've been coming out to Brooklyn. But every since these incidents been happening, they've been like, "Naw, I can't." I'm not trying to say it's ruining my career in football, but it's affecting, you know, the scouts. They don't even want to see me. They don't call.
Nearly everyone raised their hands and shouted "yeah" and "hell yeah" when asked if they wanted to leave East New York or the other Brooklyn neighborhoods where they live.
NATHANIEL: But wait. And go where? Ain't no place to go. You go to California and you can't even wear colored clothes out there. They've even got that in Texas. You can't go nowhere.
CYNTHIA SOUTH: There's places that you can go. I mean, it won't be totally safe like how you would want it to be, but it would be better than where you are now.
NATHANIEL: Where would that be?
SEAN: Maine. Rhode Island. Up North.
[LAUGHTER]:
There are not many role models for these teen-agers -- not even the Mayor, who had hoped to inspire the students with his own life's story on the very morning that the shootings occurred.
MARIANA: I think he has to make an appearance, but what he says is going to happen doesn't really happen.
CYNTHIA: But sometimes there is no money to make those things happen.
ANNETA PHILLIPS: He could raise the money.
CYNTHIA: We're in a recession now, so there is no money.
TOSHA PAULLEY: There is money.
MARIANA: They know that they're supposed to help us, but they're not pushing the issue. There's money there.
NATHANIEL: Listen, listen. It's like this. If you were someone's bigger brother and you tell them, if somebody do this to you, you do that to them, who you gone listen to? Somebody who come to the school and tell you, "Stay away from drugs and don't fight" or do you listen to your older brother?
MAESHAY: Yeah, if you see a drug dealer out there doing nothing but selling drugs and getting money and getting clothes, then you're going to be like, "I want to do that." It's all about today. If they had all the money they needed, several of them said they would build community centers to offer much-needed recreation to young children and teen-agers. Shawn would hire "certified peacemakers in the neighborhood."
TOSHA: It might seem like a dream, but if I had all the money, I would take all the money and build a big magnet that would attract all these guns and destroy them.

HEADLINE: William E. Simkin Is Dead at 85; Federal Labor Mediator in 1960's

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
William E. Simkin, who helped prevent national strikes and resolved thousands of labor disputes as the Federal Government's chief labor mediator and as a leading private arbitrator, died on Wednesday at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 85 years old.
He died of natural causes, his family said. 
 Mr. Simkin was the longest-serving director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, from 1961 to 1969. He expanded its scope and influence and played a critical role in averting or settling strikes in vital industries like airlines, automobile manufacturing and steel mills.
As the Government's chief labor peacemaker, he projected a soothing image that fit the part. A pipe smoker and lifelong Quaker, he was unflappable and patient and spoke with a deep but slow and soft voice. The labor mediator Theodore W. Kheel called him "a giant among neutrals in labor relations, who was trusted by both sides and had that essential ingredient of common sense."
 
Called Out of Retirement
 As a private arbitrator, Mr. Simkin was entrusted by labor and management in some of America's biggest businesses with deciding critical but deadlocked issues. The companies included Goodyear, Greyhound, National Can, Bethlehem Steel and others in the automobile, newspaper and clothing industries.
In the 1970's, Mr. Simkin was called out of retirement to grapple with a nearly century-old Indian tribal rivalry between the Navajos and Hopis over two million acres in Arizona. He helped resolve the dispute.
Born in Merrifield, N.Y., Mr. Simkin grew up in nearby Poplar Ridge. He graduated from Earlham College, where he was student president.
In 1928 he became principal of the high school in Sherwood, N.Y.. From 1930-32 he taught science at the Friends School in Brooklyn while studying economics at Columbia University.
His career evolved when he went to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania from 1937-39 as an instructor and student under Dr. George W. Taylor, who became his mentor and asked him to help arbitrate a dispute in the hosiery industry. He began arbitrating full time, with a break from 1942-45 working for the National War Labor Board, heading its shipbuilding and steel commissions.
President John F. Kennedy appointed him mediation director, and President Lyndon B. Johnson retained him.
At the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, he stressed preventive programs to settle disputes before they became crises, started joint training of management and labor officers on grievances, revived a labor-management panel to help settle strikes and strengthened relations with state mediators.
He taught at Harvard University's business school from 1969-73 and wrote a major book in his field, "Mediation and the Dynamics of Collective Bargaining" (B.N.A., 1971). He was a former president of the National Academy of Arbitrators.
He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Commons; two sons, Thomas, of Arlington, Va., and Peter, of Seattle; a brother, Robert, of Poplar Ridge, six grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Cambodia Mission Chief Sees Team as a Catalyst

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
His job is unparalleled in the annals of the United Nations. When Yasushi Akashi leaves New York this weekend for Cambodia as a special representative of Secretary General Boutros Ghali, his assignment is to bring new economic and political life to the killing fields.
As head of the newly created United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Mr. Akashi will lead a team of thousands of professionals and volunteers who will oversee every aspect of Cambodian life from the police to banking, while setting the stage for elections in 1993. 
 "This is the most dramatic instance of what the international community can do in the post-cold-war age," Mr. Akashi said in an interview this week after meeting Congressional skeptics and critics of the mission. "If we can overcome this challenge, the U.N. will come out a much stronger body."
Setting up a transitional international administration in Cambodia is the most ambitious and expensive project of its kind undertaken by the United Nations, with a budget likely to run into billions. The team will work with the Supreme National Council drawn from the four warring Cambodian factions that signed a peace treaty in October.
The appointment of Mr. Akashi, a 61-year-old career United Nations official and author, also illustrates the growing visibility of Japan and a new breed of Japanese internationalists in United Nations operations.
As he arranges the return of at least 360,000 Cambodian exiles, Mr. Akashi will work with Sadako Ogata, a fellow citizen who is now the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They speak to each other frequently, in Japanese, though both are also fluent in English and French.
 
Cambodia as Japanese Outlet
 "Japanese interest in Cambodia is extensive and genuine," Mr. Akashi said. "We want to show our sense of international responsibility."
He plans to stop in Tokyo on his way to Phnom Penh to make a few motivating speeches. "Cambodia is a good outlet for Japanese with humanitarian concerns," he said.
"This appointment clearly signals the arrival of Japan on the international stage as a major player in the resolution of regional conflicts," said Representative Stephen J. Solarz of New York, chairman of the House subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific.
"If this is coupled with Japan's willingness to contribute more to the peacekeeping operation, that would be a great accomplishment," said the Brooklyn Democrat, who is a strong supporter of a full appropriation for the Cambodia effort.
"What is at stake here is the fate of a nation that has suffered more than any other in the 20th century," Mr. Solarz said after meeting Mr. Akashi.
In the Senate, Frank R. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said the United Nations had found the right person for a historic task.
Mr. Akashi speaks with a sense of urgency.
"The rainy season is coming in May, and this will hamper movement," he said. "And we have to bring in everything from outside, from vehicles to office equipment to prefabricated buildings."
In a country saturated by war, the United Nations team will have to disarm 200,000 troops and an equal number of militia members. It will have to find and destroy arms caches and root out mines. All of this will have to be achieved in an atmosphere where lawlessness is increasing, Mr. Akashi said.
A health care system, schools, a press, broadcasting and banks -- all targets of the Khmer Rouge and to some extent the Vietnamese-backed Communists who followed -- will have to be rebuilt from scratch. An electoral system and government institutions have to be created.
More than 12,000 United Nations staff members have volunteered to go to Cambodia with Mr. Akashi, who has been Under Secretary General for disarmanent affairs and Under Secretary for public information. He called their willingness to take posts of extreme hardship "touching and moving." In most cases, families will not accompany them.
Mr. Akashi sees his job as an opportunity for the United Nations to learn on the job how to deal with local conflicts.
Conscious of the need to preserve what fragile sense of national sovereignty has survived in that battered nation of seven million people, he insists that his team will limit itself to acting as a catalyst for Cambodians, who will have to do much of the work of rehabilitating their country. Many experts fear that so large an international presence will foster a sense of dependency.
"We cannot replace Cambodians," he said. "We have the opportunity to create a democracy that we and they devise for them. But they have to know that we cannot be there for good."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Prices Fall; Jobs Data Have Little Effect

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most leading currencies yesterday in choppy trading. The foreign exchange markets reacted with ambivalence to new United States economic statistics.
Gold prices moved modestly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $349.50 an ounce, down $1.90 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $349.25, down $2.20 from Thursday. 
 An eagerly awaited report on February employment failed to inspire prolonged buying or selling of the dollar.
Figures released in the morning, showing the nation's business payrolls expanded by an unexpectedly large 164,000 jobs, touched off a temporary round of dollar buying abroad and at home. But the buying proved short-lived.
Other data in the Labor Department report offset the positive economic implications of the February growth in non-farm payrolls, the strongest gain since May 1990.
The department reported that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent in February, from 7.1 percent in January, the highest rate since July 1985.
Dealings in the dollar slowed by the afternoon in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.63 Japanese yen, down from 132.00 yen at the Thursday close. Later, in London, the dollar rose to 131.65 yen. By the time trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 131.85 yen, down from 131.90 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7200, from $1.7165 late Thursday. The pound brought $1.7190 late in New York, compared with $1.7170 late Thursday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.6690 German marks, down from 1.6720; 1.5155 Swiss francs, down from 1.5260; 5.6700 French francs, down from 5.6820; 1,251.00 Italian lire, down from 1,253.50, and 1.1914 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18725.
Gold prices were lower overseas, as well as in domestic trading. Gold fell in London to a late bid of $349.60 an ounce, from $350.65 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $349.50, from $350.50 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold dropped 22 cents, to $351.25.
Silver posted small gains. Bullion settled at $4.152 an ounce on the Comex, up from $4.133 on Thursday. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $4.16 an ounce, up from $4.14.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Saying Clinton Is Cynical, Tsongas Goes on the Attack

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., March 6

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas unleashed his harshest attack yet tonight against Bill Clinton, assailing his Democratic rival as a "pander bear" who "will say anything, do anything to get votes."
Taking the offensive four days before Florida's high-stakes primary on Tuesday, Mr. Tsongas landed here after campaigning in the West and immediately declared that "we're going to take the gloves off." He went on to say "the American people are going to find out how cynical and unprincipled Bill Clinton is." 
 The former Massachusetts Senator said he was largely reacting to Mr. Clinton's comments at a debate Thursday night in Dallas, where the Arkansas Governor said he would support development of the Seawolf submarine, an attack submarine.
 
'Only to Win Votes'
 The Navy had originally planned to buy three or four Seawolfs a year. But the program's size has been cut sharply, so that the Navy will buy no more than one Seawolf a year.
He said Mr. Clinton knew that the Seawolf "won't be built" but supported its development "only to win votes" in Connecticut, where it is manufactured.
"I'm glad he did it now," Mr. Tsongas said, "so people see the real Bill Clinton for what he is."
At an airport news conference in Nashville tonight, Mr. Clinton said he had always supported building additional Seawolf submarines. "Why would I be pandering to the voters in Connecticut? If they're not going to vote for Senator Tsongas, nobody is. And they're not voting anytime soon." The Connecticut Presidential primary is March 24.
"It wasn't me who went to New York and said I'd be the best friend Wall Street ever had," Mr. Clinton said of the accusation of pandering. "It was Senator Tsongas."
 Mr. Tsongas also lashed out at Mr. Clinton, who on Thursday said in Denver that "We can not put our fairness under the guise of promising growth. It won't work, it's not America." The remark was erroneously quoted in some news accounts as, "It's not American," prompting part of Mr. Tsongas's harsh attack on Mr. Clinton.
"To say my economic plan is not American," Mr. Tsongas said. "That's a code word. There's nothing more cynical -- it's the ultimate example of cynicism." He also said that "people who are ethnic will understand what I am talking about."
Mr. Tsongas's comments to reporters tonight on the airport tarmac here signaled a new aggressiveness from a candidate who has repeatedly condemned Mr. Clinton and others for negative campaigning.
His attack also shows that Mr. Tsongas is seizing on an offensive strategy to win votes in Florida on Tuesday, the Southern state where his campaign advisers believes he has his best chance for an upset victory against Mr. Clinton, who is favored in most of the 11 contests that day.
With its large population of transplants from the Northeast and large Greek-American enclaves, Mr. Tsongas believes he can do well here.
"This is going to be a real battle," Mr. Tsongas said, "and boy am I ready."
Mr. Tsongas's attack came on the same day that his campaign launched a television attack on Mr. Clinton in Florida. In a 30-second commercial, the Tsongas campaign goes after Mr. Clinton, with the announcer saying "some people will say anything to be elected President."
Mr. Tsongas defended the commercial at a news conference in Phoenix earlier today. "It's not a change in strategy," he said. "We are simply responding. I'm simply in a counterpunch mode. He attacks and I have to respond."
Gerald Austin, a senior aide to Mr. Tsongas, said he had no apologies for the campaign's newfound aggressivness. "A campaign is a war," he said.
Mr. Tsongas was clearly aiming his attack at the local television news shows when he arrived in Florida. In an interview aboard the plane, he mentioned Mr. Clinton's citing of Seawolf at the debate but was not nearly as heated in his criticism. He also said he felt ncomfortable with the attack advertisements his campaign was preparing.
But, he said, "If I don't respond people will say this is Dukakis revisited."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Roots;
Tsongas's Passion: Restoring Hometown to Glory

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., Feb. 29

 BODY:
The day before the New Hampshire Presidential primary, Paul E. Tsongas, wearing a battered jacket and baseball cap, sat down in an ice cream parlor in his hometown here to review plans for a bookstore envisioned as the centerpiece of a downtown renovation plan.
When he learned that the project was stalled, Mr. Tsongas was incensed, and immediately called the official who was holding it up. Suddenly the logjam was broken. 
 "It shows Tsongas's state of mind, that he could be thinking about this the day before he won the New Hampshire primary," said Kendall M. Wallace, the general manager of The Lowell Sun, who was with Mr. Tsongas in the ice cream shop that day. "His roots go very deep here, and he's a very driven man who can be very tough when he thinks he's right."
For more than two decades, since he first entered politics as a member of the City Council in 1969, Mr. Tsongas has been the driving force behind the rebirth of Lowell, a city of 103,000 people about 30 miles northwest of Boston, say a variety of local residents, both friends and critics.
And Mr. Tsongas's experiences here have also shaped his pro-business political philosophy, with its stress on economic growth to rebuild America. In his 86-page campaign manifesto, "A Call to Economic Arms," Mr. Tsongas wrote that his memories of Lowell's decline "left me with an inability to view economic dislocation casually."
 
'Paul Was a Visionary'
 Once the nation's largest manufacturing center, Lowell sank into slow decline after World War I as its prosperous textiles companies moved south in search of cheaper labor and its cavernous red brick mills were left standing empty.
"A lot of people had lost faith in the city and were discouraged," said James L. Milinazzo, a former city planner who has been involved in the restoration of Lowell since 1978. "But Paul was a visionary, a person with ideas, who also wasn't afraid of playing hardball when he had to."
Mr. Tsongas has conducted his drive to revive Lowell -- some say it is an obsession -- no matter where he has been: first as a member of the City Council, then as a member of the United States House of Representatives, later as a Senator and since 1984 as a private citizen of Lowell.
Among the crusade's accomplishments, it has attracted almost $600 million in private and government investment, more than half of it private; it has enticed new high-tech companies to locate here, and it has spurred the creation, in the city's crumbling downtown, of the first urban National Park. The park, financed originally by $40 million from the Federal Government under a bill sponsored by Mr. Tsongas when he was a Senator, now includes eight renovated mill buildings recreating the mills, the water wheels and canals around them and the city in the 19th century. Last year the park brought 711,748 tourists to Lowell.
 
Bringing in Investment
 Together with several local officials, Mr. Tsongas devised a number of imaginative schemes to increase investment in Lowell and insure that local businesses participated in the city's reconstruction. First, the Lowell Development and Financial Corporation, a joint public-private group, was formed in 1975 when Mr. Tsongas persuaded the city's 11 banks to put up about $300,000, or one-twentieth of 1 percent of their assets, toward a fund for improving the blighted downtown. At the time, the banks were the unhappy owners of numerous foreclosed factories and homes, but individually they were powerless to revive Lowell.
"It was a very innovative idea, to get bankers who had never worked together before to do something for the good of the city," said Jim Cook, the corporation's executive director.
In 1978 came the move to establish the National Park, and to persuade Wang Laboratories, then a booming high-tech business, to locate in downtown Lowell.
The final piece of the revitalization effort came in 1979, when Senator Tsongas and the city manager, Joseph Tully, sat in a local restaurant and drew up a master plan for the city on a place mat. Out of these ideas grew a permanent planning agency known as the Lowell Plan, which shares some of its functions and staff members with the Lowell Development and Financial Corporation.
Both groups have focused on winning Federal Urban Development Action grants for Lowell, then devising ways to use the money to attract private investment. For example, when Mr. Tsongas wanted to persuade Wang to build its headquarters in the city's new industrial park, the development corporation got a $5 million Federal grant that it then loaned to Wang as an inducement, Mr. Cook said.
In the last decade Lowell has received about $50 million in similar Federal grants, which have also been used in the construction of a large parking garage, a 250-room Hilton Hotel and the rehabilitation of old houses around the city for affordable housing, said Mr. Cook.
Today the corporation's initial capital of $300,000 has been expanded to $28 million, making the agency a significant force in the city.
In addition to the mechanisms the planners devised to attract money to the city, Mr. Tsongas himself maintained a forceful presence. Both in Lowell and in Washington, he met with business leaders regularly to goad them into keeping the momentum for redevelopment going.
Mr. Tsongas's forcefulness has also produced some enemies. "He was a United States Senator becoming an officious meddler in local affairs," said Henry Mroz, a former school superintendent, who accuses Mr. Tsongas of being behind a campaign to force him out of office in a dispute over what to do with an empty school building. "He wanted to have his finger in the pie in every aspect."
Despite Wang's troubles, most people here acknowledge that Lowell is far better off than it would have been without the redevelopment effort led by Mr. Tsongas.

Candidates' Big Hurdle: Conversation

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 6

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates for President were forced to confront a new and startling challenge Thursday night. At the start of their nationally televised debate, Peter Jennings of ABC News said he wanted to curtail his role as moderator and let the candidates take charge.
"We have decided that this evening," he said, "as much as possible they shall conduct their own debate, that they should be the ones to press each other for specific answers." 
 Conduct a debate? Press each other for answers? But this meant they would actually have to listen to other humans and ask questions. These skills tend to atrophy in powerful politicians. By the time they become Presidential candidates they have been pontificating for so long to so many captive audiences that they have lost the ability to carry on a polite conversation.
 
A Rarew Opportunity
 So the debate presented a rare opportunity to see who could talk with, not at, people. It would have been even more interesting if ABC had succeeded in its plan to let the candidates conduct the debate with virtually no supervision. But that last-minute proposal so unnerved the candidates that some threatened to walk out, and Mr. Jennings agreed to provide some questions and guidance.
Generally, though, he let them talk at will. What they said was familiar, but the way they said it was not. And after 90 minutes, perhaps the question to ask was: Which of these men would you be willing to sit down with to continue the discussion? For many viewers that would probably be Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Sometimes he talked too much, but at least he seemed to enjoy taking part in a discussion.
By contrast, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts was the debater most likely to get ditched by everyone else after the debate. In previous debates Mr. Tsongas's lack of glibness had seemed appealing because of the way he combined self-deprecating humor, a silly smile and a thoughtful, confident zeal as he explained why America needed his economic plan. But on Thursday he skipped the humor, and the zeal turned into self-righteousness.
Instead of smiling, he wagged his finger incessantly and sternly delivered long-winded sermons. He looked primly imperious when the others criticized him. Instead of debating differences in economic policies, as Mr. Clinton tried to do, Mr. Tsongas tended to meander off and offer platitudes.
Mr. Jennings tried vainly to have Mr. Tsongas deal with Mr. Clinton's criticism of his proposed cut in the capital gains tax. "Can you at least address the question of what he has to say about your economic proposals?" Mr. Jennings asked. "He says you sound like President Bush."
"Well," Mr. Tsongas replied, "I was endorsed Sunday by The Atlanta Constitution. That's not a newspaper in my backyard. What they said was that I had a pro-growth, economic growth policy with a progressive social agenda."
What The Atlanta Constitution had to do with the capital gains tax or anything else was not clear. Nor was it clear a few minutes later when Mr. Tsongas had an exchange with former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, an exchange remarkable in that it is the sort of thing that passes for conversation between politicians.
"You are taking a pro-business position," Mr. Tsongas said, after Mr. Brown described his flat-tax proposal.
"Accompanied with my pro-justice, pro-empowerment-of-working-people position," Mr. Brown replied.
"Well, I quote The Atlanta Constitution when they endorse me: pro-economic growth with a progressive social agenda," Mr. Tsongas replied. "I'm proud of that. I'm very proud of that."
Mr. Brown's recent victory in the Colorado primary did not seem to have diminished his indignation at the political system. But most of the time Mr. Brown seemed only to be getting in the way, because he kept interrupting to issue and vague promises that were undebatable. How do you argue with someone who claims to be "pro-justice"?
Overnight ratings from metropolitan areas showed that the debate attracted 18 percent of the television audience, tying with the "Tonight Show" on NBC for the first half hour and ahead of the other two networks for the remaining hour.
 
Clinton's Best Performance
 The candidate likely to benefit most from that exposure is probably Mr. Clinton. In the previous debates he had come across as the most poised and articulate of the candidates, and Thursday may have been his best performance yet.
Like the others, Mr. Clinton may have spent most of the 90 minutes reciting parts of his standard speech, but at least he made a pretense of packaging the excerpts as answers to questions.
His enthusiasm was sometimes off-putting, and it became downright incredible toward the end of the debate, when he said that he wished Senator Bob Kerrey, who ended his candidacy Thursday, was still with them.
It was difficult to believe Mr. Clinton really wished his one-time rival was still there to share the microphone, but it was unusually polite. He deserved some credit just for being aware of Mr. Kerrey's absence from the discussion. Many politicians would never have have noticed there was one less person in the room for them to talk at.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Another Candidate?;
Billionaire in Texas Is Attracting Calls to Run, and $5 Donations

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
For the umpteenth time, H. Ross Perot is insisting that he does not want to be President. But by opening the door a tiny crack to his possible candidacy in this election year, the Texas billionaire is attracting telephone calls, letters and money to his Dallas office -- all urging him to run.
Call it just one more sign of voter disaffection with Washington politics as usual. In any case, Mr. Perot will probably not be appearing in television commercials, kissing babies or standing in front of an American flag, bemoaning the Federal deficit. 
 "I'm not going to be one of these people who hires handlers and image makers," Mr. Perot said. "What you see is what you get."
Theoretically, anyone from any state who wishes to support him as an independent candidate still has enough time to sign a petition calling for his name to be placed on the Presidential ballot. The earliest deadline is in Texas on May 11.
Mr. Perot's "candidacy," if it could even be called that, grew out of his appearance on the CNN program "Larry King Live" on Feb. 20. Since selling the data processing company he founded to the General Motors Corporation in 1984 for $2.5 billion, Mr. Perot has frequently spoken out publicly in favor of political and economic change.
Mr. King and callers questioned Mr. Perot about why he does not run for political office if he feels so strongly that the nation's economy and education system need fixing.
After stating several times during the talk show that he was not interested in becoming a politician, Mr. Perot, 61 years old, finally hedged his refusal. "If voters in all 50 states put me on the ballot -- not 48 or 49 states, but all 50 -- I will agree to run," he said. He also said he would not accept more than $5 from each supporter.
A week after appearing on the talk show Mr. Perot's secretary, Sally Bell, said that she had received calls from people in 46 states promising support, as well as many $5 contributions.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Blacks;
Clinton's Talk of Racial Unity Falls on Eager Ears

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., March 6

 BODY:
Oleta Hill, 36 years old, went to see Bill Clinton the other day in Jacksonville, Fla., in a quandary. She had voted for Jesse Jackson in the past and had not yet heard enough about any of the candidates to form a hard opinion on whom to vote for next Tuesday.
So Ms. Hill, an engineering clerk with BellSouth Telecommunications, was surprised when she heard the Arkansas Governor speak at a lunchtime forum. 
 "If he really believes what he's saying, we've got the ticket," said Ms. Hill, who is black. "His being a white person, I was surprised to hear it."
What Ms. Hill heard that day, layered within Mr. Clinton's basic economic campaign speech, was talk of racial unity that strikes a chord with black voters unaccustomed to hearing such appeals stated so unambiguously by white Presidential candidates.
 
Sounding Like Jackson
 "I began to hear a little Jesse Jackson coming out in him," she said.
Mr. Clinton, who received 70 percent of the black vote in Georgia and 55 percent of the black vote in Maryland on Tuesday, is in a position to inherit what is left of Mr. Jackson's 1988 support. But there is a flip side. Without Mr. Jackson in the race, as surveys of voters in Georgia showed, many black voters might simply stay at home.
Even so, Mr. Clinton decided early that he would undertake what amounts to a naked plea for black votes that some black officials and black audiences have found appealing, even when the Governor is asked to justify his position on issues like capital punishment and welfare changes, on which he differs with many prominent blacks.
He explains away these differences by noting that the death penalty, which he favors, more often punishes those who commit crimes against black people, and that his plan, in which he advocates making more recipients work, is based on suggestions he has received from people on welfare.
It is the sort of political finesse that Mr. Clinton brings to many thorny matters and on which he must increasingly rely to hold his Southern support base.
"Every time we have permitted ourselves to be divided by race in this region, we have been kept dumb and poor," he said at a recent speech at traditionally black Morehouse College in Atlanta, repeating a line that always draws applause from white and black audiences in the South. "The cheap politics of division in the 1980's have kept America divided."
By assiduously courting black politicians like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and Representative Maxine Waters of California, all former supporters of Mr. Jackson, Mr. Clinton has sought to lay claim to a credibility on matters of race that has so far eluded his Democratic rivals.
Mr. Schmoke, for example, recently vouched for Mr. Clinton at his church in Baltimore by talking of the summers he spent with his grandparents in Hope, Ark., a small town where Bill Clinton happened to be growing up. Mr. Schmoke recalled standing in segregated lines to get into the movies and watching as white youngsters entered and sat separately.
"I wonder if, irony of ironies, one of those times when I went to the movies there, he was on one line and I was on the other," Mr. Schmoke said.
When Mr. Schmoke endorsed Mr. Clinton that day, evoking memories of segregation, and then going on to praise Mr. Clinton for rising above the racial limits of his Southern upbringing, he played into one of the candidate's recurring themes: that he can appeal to both black and white voters.
 
Pragmatism Among Blacks
 Mr. Lewis told the audience at Morehouse that Mr. Clinton would "inspire those who have been left out and left behind," adding: "He will move us all ahead. With this man, no one, absolutely no one, will be left behind."
Much of this support is rooted in cold-eyed pragmatism. Many black politicians and campaign workers reached political maturity after laboring in two Jackson campaigns and were unwilling to sit out this year. Mr. Clinton, they figured, at least talked about black people.
"Bill Clinton and I may not agree on every little thing, but we do agree on one thing," Representative Waters said last week at a Beverly Hills fund-raiser. "Bill Clinton can beat George Bush, and can take back the White House."
"I am committed to a mission of success this year," Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta said last week. "I believe we do not have another four years to wait around."
And now that the field has narrowed, with the withdrawal of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who attracted a small number of black supporters, the choices seem even more limited for some black voters.
Only Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, whose South Carolina primary strategy depends on winning former Jesse Jackson supporters, has competed for black voters as energetically as Mr. Clinton. But his campaign is running out of money and has failed to catch fire across the board.
And Mr. Tsongas, when asked about civil rights, invariably talks about his Peace Corps experience in Ethiopia. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, talks about growing up in the segregated South.
"I just never took Tsongas seriously," said Gregory A. Samms, a lawyer who helped escort Mr. Clinton on a walking tour through Miami's predominantly black Liberty City neighborhood on Wednesday.
After hearing Mr. Clinton speak last week, Terrence Johnson, a Morehouse junior from Fort Wayne, Ind., said, "A lot of black people migrated from the South and know that tradition."
The Governor alluded to that strength today at a Dallas news conference. "I believe that the connections are deep and strong," he said when asked about his support among blacks who live in or migrated from the South.
Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker, predicted: "In the end, black voters are going to vote cultural affinity and acute economic distress. Paul Tsongas has nothing to say to poor voters."
Mr. Clinton recognizes the potential that the black vote could hold for him this time. When his state government schedule forced him to return to Little Rock last week, he sneaked away on the night of the South Dakota primary to attend a meeting of black church leaders in Memphis.
There he heard the Rev. Kenneth S. Robinson, the pastor of St. Andrew A.M.E. Church, exhort a sanctuary crowded with members of the clergy in a sermon titled "Use What You Got to Get What You Want." The sermon was really about Moses and Pharaoh, but Dr. Robinson did not miss the chance to note the reason Mr. Clinton was there.
"You got political power," he said, as the ministers murmured in assent. "That's why we have a guest here tonight. We've got power."
Mr. Clinton fares especially well in black churches, where he adopts some of the rhythmic cadence of black preaching and injects references from Scripture into his standard speech and refers easily to his own most recent political troubles. "The Scripture says, let him who is without sin cast the first stone," he said at a Memphis worship service last week. "All I can say is, in the last month, I've met a lot of perfect people."
Mr. Clinton has said that he considers himself "uniquely qualified" to deal with racial divisions. Many of his black supporters are less lofty in their assessments of why they will work for Mr. Clinton.
"I'm interested now in getting back to the White House," said Calvin Smyrie, a black Georgia state representative and former Jackson supporter. "Anything that distracts me from that, I will not tolerate."

HEADLINE: New York City Jobless: 10.9%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Unemployment in New York City, a dismal picture throughout the recession, hit 10.9 percent in February, the highest level for that month in 16 years, the Government reported yesterday. With 89,000 more people joining jobless rolls, February unemployment in New York State and New Jersey also rose to their highest levels in nine years.
Experts said the grim unemployment figures reflected a continuing weak economic performance in the region and warned that the numbers were likely to get worse before getting better. 
 "We're not seeing any bottoming out," Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in releasing the figures. "It's more of a problem in New York City, but to a large extent it involves the entire region. In New Jersey, things looked better in January. These numbers are something of a setback."
The New York City unemployment rate, which is not seasonally adjusted, has been swollen by the loss of 50,000 jobs in the private sector in the last three months. It rose by half a percentage point in February, from 10.4 percent in January -- the highest level for a February since 1976, and up by almost 50 percent in the last year, from 7.3 percent in February 1991.
"The city is still posting hefty declines," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "No sector is able to buck the tide of decline, and the tide shows no sign of yet turning."
In New York State, the unemployment rate in February rose half a percentage point, to 8.9 percent from 8.4 percent in January and 6.2 percent one year ago. Mr. Ehrenhalt said the ranks of the unemployed in the state grew by 39,000 last month to more than 200,000 in the last year.
In New Jersey, unemployment increased by eight-tenths of a percentage point last month, to 7.6 percent from 6.8 percent in January and 6.3 percent a year ago. It was the state's worst February figure since 1983, and the biggest change in the national report among the 11 biggest states. Mr. Ehrenhalt said 35,000 people joined the unemployment rolls last month, 60 percent of the 58,000 who lost their jobs in New Jersey in the last year.

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Rules to Lift Sales of Gas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
President Bush announced his support yesterday for four regulatory changes that he said would raise demand for natural gas and help an industry that has been badly hurt by low prices.
The gas industry applauded the announcement, which came shortly before the primary election in Texas, a leading gas-producing state. But environmentalists and consumer advocates said it was not clear whether the changes, all of them under discussion in Washington for months or years, would mean that more gas would be sold, at least in the near future. They also said that one proposed change could cut gas sales and increase pollution. 
 The changes are intended to lower costs or remove regulatory barriers. They could result in greater use of natural gas in cars and power plants.
 
2 Problems Not Addressed
 Edwin Rothschild, an energy expert at Citizen Action, a consumer organization, said some of the proposed changes were desirable because they would promote use of natural-gas vehicles, lowering pollution and reliance on imported oil. But the natural-gas industry's real problems, he said, are two phenomena beyond White House control: warm weather and recession.
"I don't see this as stimulating a lot of demand quickly," he said.
But the president of the American Gas Association, Michael Baly 3d, said his industry was "deeply grateful."
Possibly the least controversial proposal was the President's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency would soon issue an emissions standard for natural-gas vehicles that would help them compete. Federal standards for gasoline vehicles set a limit on hydrocarbon emissions as a way to control smog, but proponents of natural-gas vehicles complain that natural gas itself, while a hydrocarbon, is not an ingredient of smog. So the E.P.A. will issue a standard for emissions of hydrocarbons other than natural gas.
There are now no standards for the vehicles. Mr. Baly of the gas association said yesterday, "If you want to start mass-producing these, major equipment manufacturers want a standard."
 
 
A Greenhouse Gas
 But even if emissions of unburned natural gas do not contribute to smog, they are still a pollutant, environmentalists say, because natural gas is a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming.
David G. Hawkins, an air-pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that allowing natural-gas emissions because they did not cause smog was "an example of tunnel vision," adding, "You could say the same thing about CFC's," which destroy the earth's protective layer of ozone.
The White House also said that the environmental agency would change the rules on when changes to a power plant become so extensive that the plant is considered new, and therefore subject to stricter pollution standards. Named after a case involving the Wisconsin Electric Power Company, the "Wepco fix" -- as it is known on Capitol Hill -- would allow utilities to make major changes to dirty old plants without becoming subject to the strict regulations governing new ones. But the fix was rejected by Congress in the debate over the Clean Air Act.
If utilities were not subject to rules on new sources of pollution, according to the gas industry, they might take inexpensive steps that would significantly reduce pollution, like "co-firing" coal with natural gas. In co-firing -- when the two fuels are burned together in the boiler -- chemical reactions reduce the total pollution, although the plant is still dirtier than a new one.
 
 
The Opposite Case
 But environmentalists say the Wepco fix might not help gas sales at all. Without it, they say, many utilities would be forced to scrap dirty coal-fired plants and build new ones that run entirely on gas; with the fix, they can continue to rely heavily on coal.
A third change would give gas-pipeline companies the option to be regulated under an incentive system, rather than the cost-based system that now prevails, but the details have not been established.
A fourth would remove a regulatory wrinkle that some people have said could hurt natural-gas vehicles: the issue of interstate regulation. In theory, according to some natural-gas executives, if a car were fueled with natural gas in one state and driven to another, the sale would be interstate and thus subject to Federal regulation, although in practice the issue has not arisen, experts said.
The proposed change would make it clear that sales of natural gas for vehicles were not subject to Federal regulation.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries and Caucuses;
Smaller States Also Figure In Super Tuesday Strategies

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton established himself as the favorite son in several states that border his native Arkansas so early in the Democratic Presidential campaign that now, as Tuesday's voting approaches, he is running against high expectations.
In Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi and Missouri, Mr. Clinton wrapped up the endorsements of the local Democratic leaders and set up considerable campaign organizations before any of his rivals established a presence in those states. As a result, even a strong second-place finish by another candidate could embarrass Mr. Clinton. 
 "If Clinton does not get 60 percent of the vote, it won't say much for his candidacy," said Joseph Parker, a professor of political science at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg.
 
Rivals Seek Weak Spots
 Similarly, President Bush has lined up so many assets that a significant showing by Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, would indicate weakness in states that have been key building blocks for past Republican Presidential victories, including his own.
So far, the most notable challenges to Mr. Clinton and the President are developing in Tennessee, where former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts is jump-starting an effort in the Democratic race, and Mississippi, where Mr. Buchanan's supporters claim they have a chance for an outright victory.
Though Texas and Florida are the major prizes in next week's Super Tuesday contests, the smaller states will help determine whether Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton emerge from the Southern primaries with comfortable leads.
In Mississippi, Clarke Reed, chairman of the Bush campaign, is willing to concede Mr. Buchanan 30 percent of the vote. "It looks like that's his bottom-line protest vote," he said. "I don't think Pat will do any better, but that doesn't mean we aren't working hard to keep his numbers down."
 
Effort in Mississippi
 For a state that he carried with more than 60 percent of the vote in both the 1988 primary and general elections, Mr. Bush is indeed making an effort in Mississippi. Vice President Dan Quayle was there on Wednesday; the President's son, George W. Bush, made an appearance on Thursday, and Mr. Bush held a rally at the State Capitol yesterday.
Jeff Giles, a coordinator for the Buchanan campaign, said, "Mississippi is one Super Tuesday state that we might carry because the economy is bad and because there is a tremendous conservative Democratic vote that is mad enough at Bush to vote Buchanan."
That capacity for protest was demonstrated last November when Kirk Fordice, a conservative Republican businessman, won an upset victory in the Governor's race over the Democratic incumbent, Ray Mabus.
Mr. Bush was favored by 77 percent of the respondents in a poll conducted in Mississippi this week by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research Inc. Mr. Buchanan was favored by 12 percent and David Duke of Louisiana received a 5 percent share with 6 percent undecided. The survey questioned 268 people who said they were likely to vote in the Republican primary and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus seven percentage points.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Clinton has the backing of virtually all the top Democratic officeholders, including Representative Mike Espy, the state's only black Congressman.
In Tennessee, a Mason-Dixon poll taken last week showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Tsongas by a three-to-one ratio. Richard Chesteen, a County Commissioner in Obion County in rural northwestern Tennessee, said: "Being from Arkansas, Clinton is by far the favorite, and about everything you hear the local Democrats talking about is Clinton. He is middle of the road enough that he can pull the black vote and the conservative whites can still say, 'At least he's a Southerner.' "
Even so, Mr. Chesteen, a Democrat, said, "Tsongas has had a problem getting locals to identify with him, but now you hear people saying he surprised everyone by doing better than expected."
Tennessee provides an unusual setting for the economic debate between the top two Democratic contenders because until recently it prospered by attracting major investments from big American and Japanese corporations.
Mr. Tsongas' pro-business policies could exercise a special appeal, said Jane Buffaloe, state chairman for the Tsongas campaign. "Tennessee has been as hard hit as any state by the economic decline," she said, "but people here rely on big business and they have a strong interest in foreign trade."
The other Democratic candidates, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, appear to have found only limited constituencies for their liberal messages in Tennessee and these other conservative states.
"Turtlenecks don't go over big around here," said Mr. Chesteen, referring to a favorite item in Mr. Brown's wardrobe.
In Oklahoma, Mr. Tsongas's filing papers and check were not in proper form and his name will not appear on the ballot. A Mason-Dixon poll conducted last week showed Mr. Clinton with almost half the vote, but more than a third were undecided. This despite the early endorsement of Mr. Clinton by the governor, two congressmen and about 60 other state officials.
In Missouri Mr. Clinton has been endorsed by more than half of the Democratic members of the State Legislature along with other top officials. That should give him a decisive advantage in this state, where delegates will be chosen by party caucus. Mr. Bush has a similar edge, having the backing of local Republicans.

HEADLINE: Investors Quit Mexico Bank Deal

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 6

 BODY:
After a giddy $10 billion string of sales, the euphoria disappeared from Mexico's bank privatization effort today with the disclosure that a leading investor had overbid for a leading bank and had to back out of the deal.
The investor, Eduardo Creel Cobian, surprised the Mexican financial world only four days ago, when it was announced that he and 40 partners had bought control of Banco Mexicano Somex for $845 million. The winning bid amounted to nearly 29 times what Somex, a medium-sized institution with a reputation for weak management and bad loans, had earned in the previous year. 
 More stunning, however, was Mr. Creel's terse admission Thursday night that with some of his backers balking at his offer, he would have to retract it and lose his $16 million deposit. The Government immediately awarded Somex to the second-highest bidder, an investor group associated with the brokerage Invermexico, which had offered $603 million.
 
Concessions on Trade Talks
 The setback in the privatization program came as Government officials here said that concessions by Mexico appeared to have brought it closer to an agreement with the United States and Canada on how financial services would be regulated under a North American Free Trade Agreement.
The officials, who agreed to discuss the subject on condition of anonymity, said Mexican negotiators had softened their initial refusal to allow American and Canadian banks and brokerages to operate subsidiaries here before 1998. Mexico had also sought a 10-year transition to unrestricted competition to give the newly privatized banks time to prepare themselves.
Now, the officials said, Mexico has offered to let the foreign institutions begin operating here in 1995 under the same terms as Mexican banks. It would limit the market share of American and Canadian banks for only seven years.
"The initial response was quite positive," a Mexican official said. "If the Mexican proposal is accepted, we are willing to concede full national treatment and allow 100 percent foreign ownership, which is not done in other places."
 
Little Interest Now
 Although negotiators for all three countries have fought hard on the issue, Mexican and foreign bankers here say only a handful of American and European banks are now interested in establishing significant Mexican operations.
The image of Mexican bankers and brokers cowering at the thought of foreign challengers has also been increasingly at odds with the extraordinary prices fetched by the first dozen banks to go up for sale in the last nine months.
The Government has never disclosed how much it hoped to earn for the 18 banks that President Jose Lopez Portillo nationalized as the country's economy collapsed in 1982. But CS First Boston, which advised Mexico on the privatization, told the Finance Ministry at the outset that it was unlikely to take in more than $7 billion or $8 billion for the lot.
That projection was based in part on the rough average of 14 times past earnings, for which Government-owned banks have been sold in France, Portugal, Italy and Southeast Asia. So far, the prices of Mexico's banks have averaged about 21 times earnings. And even with the lower figure finally accepted for Somex, the total is already about $10 billion. The remaining six banks are to be sold in coming months.
"Nobody was expecting these multiples to be paid," one foreign banking analyst said today. "But the banking sector in Mexico has immense capacity for growth. Potentially, they're not so wrong."
Under the Government's control, Mexico's financial sector has already been expanding at about twice the rate of economic growth. Last year, the value of Mexican loans rose 32 percent in real terms.
Mexico's new bankers have looked to Europe for lessons about competition. In Spain, they note, the drubbing that Spanish banks were supposed to take upon entering the European Community in 1986 came four years later -- and only to the foreign institutions that had failed to wrest much of the retail market away from the Spaniards.
What notes of caution have been sounded were apparently not heard by Mr. Creel, a youngish former stockbroker who had led investor groups in bidding for three of the larger Mexican banks. On two previous occasions he had virtually tied other bidders with his offers, only to lose the banks in decisions by the Finance and Budget Ministry's bank-divestiture committee.
 
Some Investors Had Doubts
 In his quest for an 82 percent share of Somex, Mr. Creel and his partners bid 4.63 times the bank's book value. "Although we received support from some investors," he said in a statement, "others displayed doubts about the reasonableness of the proposal."
If such eventualities are not difficult to understand, given the secrecy with which would-be bankers have tended to guard their bids, the episode was also widely interpreted as an embarrassment for the Government. "I'm sure Guillermo Ortiz is screaming in his office," one European banking analyst said, referring to the Finance Under Secretary who heads the bank divestiture panel.
But in an interview at his office just after Mr. Creel left on Thursday night, Mr. Ortiz was doing no such thing.
"He miscalculated," he said of Mr. Creel. "He made a mistake -- a costly mistake."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 19.90, to 3,221.60, on Job Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices closed lower yesterday after a stronger-than-expected February job report. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.90 points, to 3,221.60. The closely watched market barometer lost 46.07 points for the week and is now at its lowest level since Jan. 13, when it was at 3,185.60.
Equities were pushed lower in the afternoon by bouts of program selling, which tend to exaggerate market movement on sluggish days. Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm that tracks program trading, plotted three buy programs and one sell program that combined to pull the Dow down by 17.67 points. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 192.3 million shares traded, down from 208.9 million on Thursday. The composite index fell by 1.13 points, to 223.79, and losing issues outpaced gainers by 1,100 to 602.
 
Other Indexes Also Down
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks declined by 2.07 points, to 404.44, while the American Stock Exchange index fell 2.29 points, to 407.95. In heavy trading on the Nasdaq, the composite index lost 6.02 points, to 615.95; the Russell 2,000 was off 1.45 points, to 207.24.
Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst for MMS International, an economic analysis and research firm, said stocks had turned on the employment report for February, which was encouraging economic news. But he said the gain in jobs was strong enough to dash any lingering hopes of another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
"Yet, not too strong as to suggest a robust economic recovery necessary for a strong rebound in corporate profits," he said. "As a result, the market pulled back across the board, making it the third consecutive session where the number of declining issues was over 1,000, normally a sign of short-term intermediate weakness in the market."
 
Investors Seem Frustrated
 Investors, having focused on the report all week, seemed frustrated by the strong number. The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate of 7.3 percent in February was the highest in nearly seven years, but the number of people on non-farm payrolls, on which the markets habitually focus, rose by 164,000 in February, 10 times the consensus forecast.
Elsewhere, Jack Salzman, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, put Scotts, the lawn care products company that went public in January, on the firm's recommended list, based on the stock's price. It closed up 1/2, to 19 1/2.
Dean Eberling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, gave several brokerages a buy rating, citing among other things strong retail and underwriting businesses in today's low-interest-rate environment. He raised his 1992 earnings estimates on Merrill Lynch, which slipped 1/8, to 57; Paine Webber Group, which was down 1/2, to 23 1/4, and Morgan Stanley Group, which fell 1/8, to 56 7/8. Charles Schwab, to which he gave an "outperform" rating, was up 1/8, to 34 1/8.
 
Gain for Freddie Mac
 The share price of Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, surged 7 1/4, to 120, after its board approved an offering of preferred stock, a 3-for-1 stock split and a dividend increase in the first quarter to 57 cents, from 50 cents. The split and offering are subject to approval by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the regulatory authority.
Jerry Brimeyer, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, initiated his coverage of Roberts Pharmaceutical with a buy recommendation. He said he thought there was a lot of potential in six new drugs the company currently has in the late stages of development. The stock was up 1 1/4, to 32 3/4.

HEADLINE: Study Backs New Jersey's Growth Plan

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 6

 BODY:
New Jersey's pending growth management plan would not harm the state's economy, according to a comprehensive study released by the State Planning Commission here today, but would rather save billions in coming decades by discouraging scattered development.
The study concluded that the state would add about the same number of people and jobs with or without the broad land-use plan that is expected to be published this summer. 
 The savings would come from directing growth to areas where roads, sewers and schools already exist, eliminating the need for much new construction. The result would be more compact urban and suburban development and an avoidance of the sprawl that characterized much of the state's growth during the last decade.
 
A Political Twist
 Avoiding dispersed development would also make schools cheaper to run and municipal services cheaper to deliver, the study concluded, and reduce pollution by cutting down on runoff from development and the amount of driving people have to do.
The study was based on the planning assumptions of an interim version of the plan that was published last summer. The final plan, likely to closely resemble the interim plan, is to be adopted by the Planning Commission this summer.
"Implementation of the interim plan will be beneficial to New Jersey," said the report, which was produced by an academic team headed by the Center for Urban Policy Studies at Rutgers University. It added that the plan would "bring benefits to New Jersey and its citizens that traditional development will not."
The conclusion carries a paradoxical political twist, since the requirement for an economic impact assessment was added to the state planning process last year by skeptics of land-use planning who feared that the plan would stifle economic growth.
The final plan is expected to divide the state into five broad planning areas, from urban to rural. It would encourage zoning and planning authorities at the town level, where planning powers reside, to bring their land-use plans in line with the state guidelines.
Those guidelines propose encouraging development in the old urban centers, directing growth to outlying areas already served by adequate roads, sewers, schools and utilities, protecting environmentally fragile lands, such as forests and watersheds, and preserving open space, particularly farm land.
 
Keeping Urban Jobs
 New Jersey will add 520,000 people in 408,000 new households and create 654,000 new jobs by the year 2010, whether or not a state plan is in effect, the Rutgers study concluded. The difference between plan and no plan lies in how that growth will be distributed and the cost of accommodating it.
Without a plan directing development to existing centers of population, the study said, the state's urban centers would lose 20,000 jobs by 2010 as business continues to move to the outer fringes of development. With the plan reversing that traditional pattern of investment, said Robert W. Burchell, the study's principal investigator, those jobs would remain in the urban core and 40,000 additional jobs would be created there, reducing urban unemployment by as much as 1.5 percent.
Between now and 2010, the study calculated, the state and municipalities could avoid spending $740 million in road construction that would be needed to serve more dispersed development. An additional $440 million would be saved over the same period in reduced demand for new sewer and water construction.
Meanwhile, the study said, school districts stand to save $286 million a year in operating costs by using space more efficiently and serving more compact districts with planned growth, while municipalities would save $112 million a year by having to maintain fewer miles of roads and by servicing a more tightly built community.
 
Agricultural Owners Lose
 One of the few negative impacts from the plan acknowledged by the study would affect owners of agricultural land. They would lose $350 million through the year 2010 in foregone sales of land for development.
Farmers and home builders continue to condemn the idea of a statewide plan on grounds that it will stifle growth, but at today's meeting of the State Planning Commission, a broad spectrum of conservation, environmental and planning groups were joined by the head of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association in praising the clean bill of economic health delivered by the study.
"We find in surveys of companies moving to New Jersey that they are increasingly concerned about the quality of life in the state," said Bruce Coe, president of the association. "This report shows that the plan will be good for job creation in New Jersey, and from that standpoint we support your efforts."
 
Builders' Group Is Dubious
 But Patrick J. O'Keefe, head of the New Jersey State Builders Association, who was not present at this morning's commission meeting, questioned the study's assumptions about growth.
"Based on those assumptions, it is inevitable that the assessment would yield results that parallel the conclusions of the plan itself," he said in an interview.
Norman J. Glickman of Rutgers, the project manager for the study, seemed to anticipate Mr. O'Keefe's objection when he told the commission that the study included no foregone conclusions. "We carried out the research with the idea that the chips were going to fall somewhere," he said, "but we didn't know where they were going to fall."
Mr. O'Keefe called the impending state plan "a nightmare regulation." But state planning officials were insistent to the point of peevishness today that any state plan will be a guide to state agencies and local land-use planners, not an enforceable blueprint that will direct future growth.
Much of its impact would come from state regulatory agencies, which could prevent the roads and sewers and withhold permits for developments that conflict with the state plan. Gov. Jim Florio has said he would direct state agencies to do so.
Chart: "HIGHLIGHTS": The Impact of New Jersey's Plan
 
New Jersey's proposed state plan, a land-use guideline intended to curb sprawl, has been in development since 1986. It cleared a major hurdle Friday with the release of a study of its economic impact. The study concluded that the plan would save billions in development and other costs over two decades.
 
EMPLOYMENT
The plan would produce 62,000 new jobs in urban centers, reducing the urban jobless rate by 1.2 percent.
 
MONEY
The plan would generate $1.3 billion in construction savings through 2010. Of that total, governments would save $740 million in road construction costs and $440 million in sewer and water construction and treatment costs. In addition, school districts would save $286 million a year because they could use existing buildings and would serve more concentrated populations. And municipalities would save $112 million a year by maintaining fewer roads and serving more concentrated areas.
 
NONFARM LAND
The plan would save 127,000 acres of undeveloped land, reducing from 292,000 to 165,000 acres the amount of land consumed by development through 2010. Without a plan, 36,500 acres of environmentally fragile land would be developed; with the plan, that area would be reduced to 7,150 acres.
 
FARM LAND
Without a plan, 108,000 acres of farm land would be developed; with the plan, 78,000 acres would be consumed. But the owners of farm land would forego $350 million from the sale of land that would have gone to developers in the absence of a plan.
 
POLLUTION
The plan, by reducing stormwater runoff from new developments, would cut pollution by 4,560 tons.

HEADLINE: The Marriage May Be Over, But Tax Consequences Go On

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Many elements of divorce have important tax consequences. They include how property and retirement benefits are divided, whether payments from one spouse to the other are in the form of alimony or child support, and who claims dependency exemptions.
In its booklet "Divorce and Taxes," Commerce Clearing House, a tax information service in Chicago, says that though most decisions in a divorce are not made for tax purposes, good tax planning can save money during a stressful and costly period in people's lives. 
 "Marriage is an economic partnership," said Rita Stein, a lawyer in Mineola, L.I. "In the final divorce settlement, everything is a negotiation. Sometimes you can work out the tax ramifications so that they both benefit."
 
Draw Up a Balance Sheet
 A complete and accurate picture of both parties' financial situation should be gathered before the couple decide how to proceed, experts say. That starts with finding out how much income each spouse receives, as well as the most common expenses of each, like housing, personal expenses and automobile payments. In addition, a personal balance sheet should be drawn up of the couple's assets and liabilities.
For example, when dividing assets acquired during a marriage, one spouse can transfer property to the other without claiming any gain or loss on the property. But you can't avoid taxes forever. If the recipient of the property later sells it, he or she will have to pay taxes on the amount the property appreciated over the years.
As for a spouse's pension, it can be split either at the time of the divorce or when that spouse retires. There are pros and cons to each, depending on individual situations. Regardless of which approach is taken, the choice must be spelled out in a court order.
"Pensions are probably the most complex area of divorce decisions," said Victoria Felton-Collins, a financial planner in Irvine, Calif., and an author of "Divorce & Money" (Nolo Press, 1992, $19.95).
For instance, a homemaker would be better off seeking retirement contributions made with after-tax dollars, rather than contributions made with before-tax dollars, like a 401-(k)plan. That way, she does not have to pay taxes when she withdraws the funds.
Other factors to consider in structuring a divorce settlement to reduce taxes are alimony and child support. Alimony, which is also called maintenance, is taxable for the person who gets it and tax-deductible for the person who pays it. Child-support payments, however, are not taxable income, and they are not deductible for the payer. A key area of negotiation, therefore, is how much money should be designated alimony and how much should be child support.
 
No Posthumous Alimony
 "Alimony is subject to contingencies," said Myra Felder, a New York lawyer. For instance, to be considered alimony, the payment must be in cash or a cash equivalent like a check and the payer and the recipient may not be living together.
One of the most important contingencies is that alimony must end when the recipient dies. This is designed to prevent the payer from disguising other payments as alimony to benefit from the tax deduction.
Which spouse can claim a dependency exemption, amounting to $2,150 a child in 1991, is another tax matter. The general rule is that the parent with custody of the child for most of the year takes the deduction. But since such a deduction benefits the higher-income spouse more, sometimes a lower-income parent who has custody will waive this right in return for a comparable concession.
 
Who Has Custody?
 But for either spouse to be entitled to the dependency exemption, a number of conditions must be met. For one, the parents together must furnish more than half of the child's support during the year. Support includes such items as food, shelter, clothing, education and medical and dental care.
Also, one of the spouses must have custody of the child for more than half the year. In cases of joint custody, the parent who has physical custody of the child for the larger part of the year claims the exemption.
And after all the tax negotiations are through, remember this: your legal and accounting costs are generally not deductible.

HEADLINE: Misguided Machismo on the High Seas

 BODY:
For the U.S. to board North Korean ships, even those delivering Scud missiles to Syria and Iran, would be an act of war. The Bush Administration defies common sense to consider such rash action. And it would make a mockery of international law to use American warships that are helping enforce a trade embargo against Iraq, sanctioned by the U.N., to search ships headed for other countries not subject to embargo.
The Administration is right to protest North Korea's missile shipments; they will inject new instability into an already unstable region. The Administration is also right to warn that continued trafficking in such weapons jeopardizes improved relations with Washington, which Pyongyang needs to break out of isolation and reverse its economic decline. 
 But halting North Korean ships on the high seas, even without seizing their cargo, is wholly unjustified. Pyongyang's missile trafficking violates no international law or obligation to Washington. North Korea is not a signatory of the Missile Control Technology Regime.
The Administration has more appropriate political and economic tools for discouraging the missile trade that it has yet to use consistently. When China sold Syria and Iran missile technology, the Administration ignored the sale and renewed most-favored-nation treatment of Beijing. Impeding North Korean ships for similar arms trafficking would be hypocritical.
And it may well be harmful. Washington is trying to wean Pyongyang away from nuclear bomb-making by easing its sense of isolation and threat. Those who are itching to use force would prematurely derail that effort.
North Korean officials have now indicated they will open their nuclear facilities to international inspection by June. If they stick to that schedule, they will go a long way toward easing suspicions. It would be folly to drive Pyongyang off course with ill-considered talk of military machismo.

HEADLINE: Congress Can Put Executives on a Diet

BYLINE: By Martin O. Sabo; Martin O. Sabo is a Democratic Representative from Minnesota.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Ronald Reagan said a rising tide lifts all boats. But that is not the case when it comes to the salaries of American executives: their salaries have skyrocketed in the last decade, while the pay of average workers has stagnated. To try to reduce that discrepancy, the Income Disparities Act would link the pay of executives and subordinates for the purpose of tax deductions.
Recession-weary Americans find it hard to understand why, for example, Paul Fireman, Reebok's chief executive officer, earns $14.8 million a year, and Michael Eisner of Walt Disney pulls in $11.2 million. More unseemly is the $78.2 million that Steven Ross of Time Warner made in 1990 when stock options are included. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission recently joined those concerned about bloated paychecks by proposing that companies disclose executive pay and ordering them to give stockholders a vote on how much executives are paid. This came after President Bush's gaffe in taking a group of overpaid executives to Japan.
The outrageous pay of top American executives is part of the increasing polarization of incomes. Those at the top are doing better and better, while the rest of the country falls further behind. In 1977, the total after-tax income of the bottom 40 percent of all Americans was more than double the after-tax income of the richest 1 percent. By this year, the income of the top 1 percent of Americans is estimated to have grown so dramatically that their combined total roughly equals that of the bottom 40 percent. In other words, the richest 2.5 million Americans are making as much as 100 million others.
Linking executive pay to that of other workers is a means of reducing this polarization. The Income Disparities Act, which I have introduced, would disallow business tax deductions for executive salaries in excess of 25 times the salary of the lowest-paid employee in the same organization. (This is approximately the difference between the President's salary and the Federal minimum wage.)
This proposal doesn't cap executive pay. It would just mean that companies that want to compensate executives extravagantly wouldn't be subsidized through tax deductions for doing so. Most important, by linking the pay of those at the top with those at the bottom, we provide an incentive for executives to raise the salaries of their lowest-paid employees.
Why should Government interfere with corporate pay? According to the 1990 census, 12 percent of adults living below the poverty line were full-time workers. Working people increasingly need Government help to put food on their tables and roofs over their heads. So long as public resources are needed to support low-income workers, the Government has a compelling interest in business pay scales.
The Income Disparities Act has a strong precedent. For decades, tax code provisions have been used to influence economic behavior: for example, the mortgage interest deduction and business tax credit for research and development. In the takeover boom of the 1980's, there was a furor over unnecessarily lucrative buyouts of top managers at companies being taken over. In 1984, Congress set a formula for determining if a golden parachute was excessive and took away business tax deductions for any settlement over the allowed amount.
Tax law says that only "reasonable compensation" can be deducted. It doesn't define "reasonable." My bill defines anything in excess of 25 times the salary of the lowest-paid worker as unacceptable. (The $1 million cap on the deductibility of an executive's annual pay passed by the House on Feb. 26 also provides a definition.)
Obviously, good management is critical to business, and executives should be paid in accordance with their responsibilities. But there should be a relationship between the pay of executives and other employees who also contribute to the company's success. The Income Disparities Act acknowledges that businesses exist not only for shareholders and executives but also for their employees, clients and community.

CAPITAL IDEAS
The Improbable Origins
of Modern Wall Street.
By Peter L. Bernstein.
340 pp. New York: The Free Press. $24.95. 
 AS Wall Street villains go, a finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is far less colorful than such legendary speculators as Jesse Livermore or Daniel Drew, whose selling of stocks in times of trouble was blamed for price collapses of the past. But Hayne Leland, together with his followers, has rightly been given a large share of the blame for the 1987 stock market crash.
Mr. Leland developed the idea of "portfolio insurance" and persuaded many institutional investors that the way to lock in profits was to ride stocks up and then start to sell them when prices begin to fall. Just how Wall Street got to the point in 1987 where huge pools of money were riding on Mr. Leland's concept is one part of Peter L. Bernstein's "Capital Ideas," an often fascinating but occasionally difficult survey of the influence of a succession of economic theories on Wall Street.
That influence helps to explain many of the investment trends that have dominated the markets in the last two decades (and helped the theorists behind those trends to pick up several Nobel Prizes along the way). The junk bond debacle of the late 1980's, like the 1987 crash, had its genesis, at least in part, in economic notions that became widely accepted on Wall Street. The theories remain reasonable and insightful, but their practical limitations are now more obvious as well.
Mr. Bernstein, a former money manager and the founding editor of The Journal of Portfolio Management, himself played a significant role in bringing the economists' theories to the attention of money managers. He is sometimes gently critical of the thinkers he discusses, but mostly he admires their genius and dismisses older economists and money managers who were slow to appreciate the new insights. To Mr. Bernstein, the problems that have resulted are not nearly as important as the advances that have been made.
It may seem obvious that economists should focus on the way markets work, but for years, Mr. Bernstein says, many academics regarded the stock market as "a sideshow in the economic system, not worthy of serious attention." Harry Markowitz did pioneering work on the theoretical basis for portfolio diversification that Milton Friedman, during Mr. Markowitz's Ph.D. examination in the 1950's, complained was "not economics." Less than four decades later, that work brought Mr. Markowitz a Nobel Prize.
Early in the century, economists were interested in the stock market, and addressed some problems that later economists might have done well to consider. To cite one example, F. W. Taussig, a Harvard professor not mentioned by Mr. Bernstein, wrote in 1921 of the puzzling fact that there are often more buyers for a stock at higher prices than at lower ones. That, he noted, was "not readily explained under the familiar formula of supply and demand." For the most part, however, observations like Taussig's were not followed up by the generation of economists that came to maturity in the years after World War II.
"Capital Ideas" does consider some of the earlier economists, but its emphasis is on the stream of notions that flowed from Mr. Markowitz's work. First academics, then institutional investors, accepted them, and now they form the basis for financial training in business school. Among these ideas is the theory of indexing, which argues that money managers should give up trying to pick undervalued stocks and buy all stocks. Another is the insight, contributed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, a pair of Nobel laureates, that the value of a company is not related to its capital structure. That, combined with the fact the tax laws treat debt more favorably than equity, led to the belief that it was a good idea for companies to take on as much debt as possible, and contributed to the excessive leveraging of the 1980's.
There is no question that the economists discussed in "Capital Ideas" have changed Wall Street, and often for the better. Without the work of Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, who began as academics and later moved to Wall Street as investment gurus, it is hard to imagine that the market in stock options would have grown as it has. The Black-Scholes model was the first to come up with a rational way of pricing such options, and is now embedded in every trader's computer.
But the work described by Mr. Bernstein also led to Mr. Leland's invention of portfolio insurance, which assumed that there would always be buyers available for stocks when prices began to fall. No one recalled Taussig's observation that investors can flee when prices start to plunge. Portfolio insurance got its first big test in October 1987, with results few have forgotten.
Not all the proponents of portfolio insurance have learned the lesson. Mr. Bernstein quotes Mark Rubinstein, a partner of Mr. Leland, as denying that portfolio insurance was the problem. "After all," he declared, "the market was nice enough to provide proper conditions for more than 50 years." Which is a little like saying a rickety bridge stood for generations until the first large truck was driven over it.
"Capital Ideas" is not an adequate substitute for a study of financial theory, simply because Mr. Bernstein backs off when the mathematics gets too rigorous. But anyone who wants to understand the way institutional investors now make their decisions will find this book invaluable.

REINVENTING GOVERNMENT
How the Entrepreneurial Spirit
Is Transforming the Public Sector.
By David Osborne and Ted Gaebler.
405 pp. Reading, Mass.:
A William Patrick Book/
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.
$22.95. 
 THERE was a time in the history of this country when government bureaucracies were considered a welcome reform. Bosses like George Washington Plunkitt and William Marcy Tweed ran America's cities as their private fiefs, robbing the public as they cemented their political control. As Plunkitt of Tammany Hall put it, "I seen my opportunities and I took 'em."
To thwart such excesses and wrest government from the clubhouses, "reformers" introduced the merit system, devising criteria for hiring and promoting government workers and for awarding government contracts and grants. The reformers created Civil Service systems and strict procedures for the expenditure of public funds. Although politicians like former Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago still found ways to reward their friends and supporters, the reform procedures limited their opportunities.
But the reforms also undermined effective government, in the view of David Osborne and Ted Gaebler, the authors of "Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit Is Transforming the Public Sector," a lively, creative and important book that has already found its way onto the night stands of Presidential candidates like Bill Clinton. They observe: "In making it difficult to steal the public's money, we made it virtually impossible to manage the public's money. . . . In attempting to control virtually everything, we became so obsessed with dictating how things should be done -- regulating the process, controlling the inputs -- that we ignored the outcomes, the results. The product was government with a distinct ethos: slow, inefficient, impersonal."
Their prescription is "entrepreneurial government," which focuses on results, decentralizes authority, reduces bureaucracy and promotes competition both inside and outside government. Government's clients are redefined as "customers" who are empowered by being able to choose among providers of various services, including schools, health plans and housing options.
Mr. Osborne, the author of "Laboratories of Democracy," and Mr. Gaebler, the president of a public sector management consulting company, do not preach privatization as a panacea: "Those who advocate it on ideological grounds -- because they believe business is always superior to government -- are selling the American people snake oil." They maintain that business does better at performing economic tasks, while government does better on issues of fairness.
Their book offers scores of examples of how state and local governments have changed their procedures to become more responsive to their customers. In 1978, the authors explain, Phoenix awarded a contract for garbage collection to private companies. Six years later, the city's own Public Works Department, in competition with those companies, won back the job after streamlining its operation, at a savings to the citizens.
In Lowell, Mass., in the mid-70's, Paul Tsongas, then a Congressman, persuaded the city's bankers to set aside one-twentieth of their collective assets for low-cost loans to businesses wanting to expand or relocate downtown. He next developed the Lowell Plan, in which every important business in Lowell agreed to undertake a major project to improve the town. Partly as a result of these efforts, unemployment dropped from 16 percent to 3 percent in 10 years.
Some questions arise: Could entrepreneurial government presage a new era of the plundering of public funds? Is it a cover for union busting? Is it really impossible to devise a Civil Service system that will not produce mediocrity? Does the success of Operation Desert Storm refute the authors' contention that government bureaucracies are inherently unable to act swiftly and effectively?
Whatever the answers to these questions, Mr. Osborne and Mr. Gaebler do go into elaborate detail about how entrepreneurial government can work. They provide 10 principles that they say have guided successful localities, and 36 different ways of delivering public service. Their book offers both a vision and a road map, and it will intrigue and enlighten anyone interested in government.

STEALING THE MARKET
How the Giant Brokerage Firms, With Help From the SEC, Stole the Stock Market From Investors.
By Martin Mayer.
208 pp. New York: Basic Books. $23. 
 THE stock market has a better predictive record on economic trends than almost any economist. Yet no depression followed the market's 1987 crash, and no boom has yet followed its recent stunning rise. Could it be that the well-paid people on Wall Street are contemplating their navels?
Martin Mayer's "Stealing the Market" is an indictment of the way stocks are traded in the United States. It is no rehash of the crimes of Ivan Boesky but an investigation of the egg from which Mr. Boesky was hatched. It is a plea for the return of what in the business is known as "full disclosure," and what, outside the business, is known as honest and honorable dealing.
On the subject of Wall Street, Mr. Mayer is a man who can be trusted. His first book on the securities markets was written 40 years ago. This is his fifth (not counting "The Bankers," among others, which in 1975 sold as briskly as if it were a tale of sex and mayhem). If anyone knows more about money, banking and investments, that individual is keeping the information to himself.
Mr. Mayer's thesis here is that in recent years brokers have become their customers' adversaries and that information about the finances of traded companies (and even about the prices of the companies' stocks) is increasingly being suppressed. If the market's greatest benefit is the information it yields, the United States is fast becoming poorer, he argues, the roaring bull market of 1991 and 1992 notwithstanding.
It must be said that reading "Stealing the Market" is hard work. The techniques by which the modern lamb is shorn on Wall Street are complex, and Mr. Mayer does not withhold the details. He describes the advent of the futures markets in the 1980's and the role of computer technology in trading after the close of the market at 4 P.M. He investigates the vogue in index trading -- that is, dealing in stock-market averages rather than actual common stocks -- and the disreputable practice by which some brokerage firms buy and sell in competition with their clients. He lays into the greatest sophists advising Wall Street, the college professors of finance.
For the lay reader, Mr. Mayer's absolute mastery of his material is a mixed blessing. He writes, for instance: "The value of shares is a function of the expected future profits of the company; the value of control is a function of the market price of the assets that can be sold independently of the rest of the company -- and a function also of the difference between the discount rate applied to future earnings and the discount rate applied to a promised flow of receipts from debt instruments." That sentence is a fair test of the accessibility of the book as a whole. If it makes no sense to you, neither, probably, will many of the other sentences.
As for the growing numbers of the financially literate (indeed, given the levitation of the stock market, financially obsessed), Mr. Mayer's thesis is bound to be provocative. The book is dedicated to a favorite uncle of his, William W. Prager, who in 1936 was one of the authors of a Securities and Exchange Commission report on the stock market that might as well have been drafted last week. Mr. Prager and his colleagues concluded, in effect, that investors were all too ready to seek the main chance rather than suitable long-term investment. "This inclination impairs the value of the market as an accurate barometer of investment opportunities," the study said, "and thus tends to vitiate the judgments of even those buyers who do think in terms of underlying worth." Mr. Mayer's book is a thoughtful analysis of the same eternal disease.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton's Uncertain Journey

BYLINE: By Peter Applebome; Peter Applebome is Atlanta bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It's early December, and although very few voters have any idea who he is, Bill Clinton knows by the early buzz from the press and the party professionals that he's on the verge of becoming the hottest man in America. The rain is beating down on the roof of his limousine speeding along the New Jersey Turnpike, he's losing his voice and the plastic container of food in his lap is filled with cold rubber chicken and cardboard vegetables. But, talking politics in the back seat, Bill Clinton looks like he's exactly where he wants to be.
"Best campaign I ever ran," Clinton says in a hoarse drawl between cellular phone calls to campaign contributors. "Just a lost cause that almost won." He's talking about his first political campaign 18 years ago, when, as a shaggy-haired 28-year-old who had never run for office, he came within a whisker of unseating a popular Republican Congressman in a heavily Republican district. 
 "I just got in my little car and drove and had a hell of a time," Clinton remembers. "I was still in my 1970 Gremlin, and later I had a little Chevelle truck with Astroturf in the back. It's what I like about politics. You learn something. You hear another life story. It's like being able to peel another layer off an unlimited onion every day."
Since that December night, the layers -- real, imagined or projected on him by others -- have been peeled off Bill Clinton in a harrowing kind of hyper-politics, like a political lifetime compressed into four months. Since the Democratic campaign began to take form in the late fall, Clinton has gone from a little-known Southern Governor to a political phenom virtually anointed the Democratic nominee by the national news media to a left-for-dead victim of feeding frenzies about his sex life and draft history. Now he's like some kind of Robo-candidate, full of bullet holes but still plowing ahead, as he approaches this Tuesday's crucial primaries and caucuses in Texas, Florida and nine other states. Super Tuesday will determine 783 of the 4,287 Democratic convention votes.
To those who have followed his career, it's not entirely surprising that Clinton has found himself in the middle of this whirlwind or that, in the face of it, he is somehow still standing. A blend of contradictions, Clinton's politics are at once deeply personal and shrewdly calculated. The product of a tumultuous upbringing full of love and loss, seemingly running for office since high school, he was elected the nation's youngest Governor at the age of 32 and then came back after a humiliating defeat to win his job back.
At various times, he's been hailed as a cross between L.B.J. and Elvis. But just as often, he's been dismissed as too young to be Governor, too liberal to stay in office, too moderate to please the national Democratic faithful and now perhaps too scarred to become President. "He has run a balancing act all his political career," says Karl Rove, a Republican consultant who has observed Clinton from across the border in Texas. "The problem with a balancing act is that while you may look masterful on the high wire, you're not anchored to anything."
Many people have wondered -- given the longstanding rumors of past womanizing he knew would hit his campaign -- what made him run? But no one who knows him well wondered for a second. He ran because at every key moment in his life Clinton has charted a course, no matter how risky, and followed it. He ran because he had worked his way through enough mine fields to think he could overcome whatever lay in store. He ran because his whole life has pointed toward this campaign, and he thinks he'd be a better President than anyone else in the race.
But the making and unmaking and possible remaking of Bill Clinton is more than the story of a man on the high wire. Because of Clinton's combination of guts and guile, mission and ambition, there's a perverse logic to the way the news media both built him up and tore him down. But there's also a nightmarish glimpse of what politics has become in the bizarre coronation and demolition derby Clinton has starred in. It's his story in a particularly affecting way because, more than most people in public life, Clinton's politics cut to his soul. But to the degree we're all eager consumers of the news media's baroque choreography of scandal, avidly taking in whatever train wreck becomes the sensation du jour, it's the story of our political process as well.
 NOTHING SEEMS SUNNY AT 9 sunshine Court.
It is eight days before the New Hampshire primary, and Clinton and his wife, Hillary, are sitting in a house in Manchester in what's billed by his campaign as a meeting with a family facing foreclosure. The trouble is, the Ackerman family isn't really about to lose their home, and Clinton, fighting a cold and looking tired and distracted, knows the reporters jamming the house aren't here to listen to his views on banking reform. They're waiting, instead, for the candidate, whose campaign is floundering, to supply them with the sound bite of the day. Finally, Clinton, looking perfectly cool and composed for the cameras, addresses the press, presenting himself as the victim of a "Republican attack machine," promises to "fight like hell" and answers some shouted questions about his draft history. He then heads to another dismal event at a yogurt factory, where he looks even more preoccupied than he was before.
Flying to a fund-raising event in New York that night, he dozes while Hillary reads a book called "God and Other Famous Liberals." But once in front of a packed banquet hall at the New York Sheraton, Clinton suddenly lights up. "People know if they can make the election about my past or any other politician's past, if they can dump on people and kill their enthusiasm, their feelings and their hope, then the same old crowd gets to stay in power," he says. "No one that covers it will have to give up their cynicism, and nothing can change. If any one of us permits this election to be about anything other than the real big human issues, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves."
It's a strong speech, and he knows it. Back on the campaign plane, some of the old exuberance returns. "Who wants to play cards?" he asks, his voice still hoarse, pulling out six vials of antihistamines and cold pills. After Hillary brings him some vitamin C and amid bottles of Evian water, Ka-Me Onion Crunch rice crackers and Eagle Cheese Crunch, he launches into a spirited game of three-hand pinochle, shuffling the cards with the deft wrist flip of a Las Vegas sharpie.
On the ground in New Hampshire after midnight, it's off to a Dunkin' Donuts shop in Keene, where he and Hillary schmooze with the help before sitting down to a chili and bagel dinner. His mood darkens briefly upon spying a New York Post headline: "Gennifer & Bill Romped in Our Apt.: Ex-Roomie." But then after talking health care with some customers, the upbeat Clinton is back as he and Hillary head for the motel where they're to spend the night.
The day is a microcosm of the roller-coaster ride Clinton has been on since his campaign got going in earnest. One moment, he's giving a foreign policy speech at Georgetown University in Washington and people are coming up to his aides and shouting "I'm on," like the bandwagon scene in a bad political movie; the next, Hillary Clinton is making a face like a schoolgirl given a frog to dissect as she's offered a faxed copy of the supermarket tabloid story that kicked the campaign into the Geraldo Zone.
But somehow Clinton seems to be still hanging on -- partly, in his view, because he's been through so much already in his 18 years of running for office. "I think if I had one characteristic in my public life, it has been I have endured," he says. "I have really been committed to the long run. I'm not going to fold my tent and go away."
One of the most striking aspects of Clinton's now famous 1969 letter to an Army colonel in the University of Arkansas's R.O.T.C. program is his frank acknowledgement of his desire to maintain "political viability" -- an unusual concern for a 23-year-old anytime, but particularly at the height of the Vietnam War. In fact, Clinton's fixation with politics began much earlier. "Bill was the kind of person who would come up to everyone new in high school and say: 'Hi. How are you? My name's Bill Clinton, and I'm running for something,' whatever it was," recalls Glenda Cooper, a high-school classmate and still a close friend. "We always thought, well, someday Bill will be President."
Since early on, Clinton has been the product of two entirely different political talents: On the one hand, he is a chronic politician unable to leave a room without shaking every hand. On the other, he is an eye-glazing policy wonk, who gets genuinely excited at the end of a 16-hour day of campaigning when he's asked questions about subjects like stock depreciation compensation and passive-loss provisions in the tax code.
In Bill Clinton, the Arkansas Traveler meets the Progressive Policy Institute. Half of him comes out of the oldest tradition in Southern politics -- one-on-one campaigning, at pig pickings and V.F.W. halls, where elements of macho excess are almost expected. The other half, which comes out of Oxford and Yale Univerity Law School, led him to become an active member of an entire generation of young Democrats looking for a post-New Deal, post-Great Society vision for the party.
Addicted to card games of hearts, golf and crossword puzzles, a whiz on the tenor sax, Clinton has the look and loosey-goosey enthusiasm of a high school jock perched somewhere between eternal youth and paunchy middle age. But he also has the natural ease of a born politician -- touching, hugging, making eye contact so deep that recipients sometimes seem mesmerized. Tabloid rumors aside, Clinton embodies the parallels between the seductions of politics and the seductions of sex. As one Clinton watcher said recently: "It's not that Clinton seduces women. It's that he seduces everyone."
At 6 foot 2 and 230 pounds, with a full head of newly styled graying hair, intense blue eyes and a square jaw, Clinton can evoke the image of a bionic politician. But up close, there's not much bionic about him. Forever popping Sudafeds and Tums, he often seems in danger of losing his voice and appears to be in a constant battle with a red-nosed, baggy-eyed, puffy-faced condition that seems more at home on a cold-remedy ad than a political one.
Clinton's early success in this campaign reflected three things: a gift for strategy and pressing the flesh, a weak field of Democratic rivals and a message geared to middle-class voters, many of whom had deserted the party in the last 12 years. Combining traditional Democratic rhetoric about compassion and activist government with Republican ideas like school choice and "workfare," Clinton's campaign appeared to be the distillation of two decades of Democratic Party ferment.
"In 1988, you had a lot of candidates who had a piece of the new picture, but they were like the blind men looking at the elephant," says David Osborne, an occasional adviser to Clinton whose book "Reinventing Government" has made him a hot property in political circles. "Gore, Gephardt, Babbitt, Dukakis all touched part of the elephant, but they couldn't see it whole. This year there's one candidate who's seen the elephant whole, and that's Bill Clinton."
Others say Clinton's ability to craft the ultimate centrist message is the case to be made against him, not for him. "I think he's the best politician I've ever seen," says John Brummett, a longtime newspaper columnist in Arkansas, who, unlike most other critics there, comes at Clinton from the left. "I just don't know if there's much there in terms of abiding principle. Reinventing the Democrats is about one thing -- getting elected. That's what he's about."
It's Clinton as "Slick Willie," the smart politician who's too smart by half. Still, for someone often accused of being too slick, it's remarkable how much Clinton's campaign has touched the cultural and generational fault lines of American life. The most conspicuous example was undoubtedly the letter Clinton wrote about his draft status. In the numbing compression of soundbite journalism, the question became grossly oversimplified: draft dodger or no draft dodger? But it's hard to read Clinton's words -- his description of peers "still loving their country but loathing the military, to which you and other good men have devoted years, lifetimes of the best service you could give" -- and not feel both the passions and the pain of that era.
To some observers, the moving struggle of the 23-year-old student trying to come to grips with his ambivalence sets a standard the 45-year-old candidate cannot match. "The letter shows a candor and anguish that has shrunk," says Paul Greenberg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Pine Bluff Commercial and a harsh Clinton critic. "He is now a completely political man who has swallowed everything else. I don't see the anguish now. I wish I had known that 23-year-old."
To others, the trouble is not with Clinton himself, but with the way he's been overpackaged in the kingdom of spin that is Presidential politics. "There have been so many times in the campaign I've wanted to scream, 'Bill, let your gut instincts take over.' " says Betsey Wright, Clinton's longtime top aide and now a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government's Institute of Politics. "Nobody has better gut instincts than Bill Clinton. I think Bill is really on to something unprecedented in American politics -- that it may be O.K. to make mistakes if you learn from them."
But at other times, Clinton's campaign has seemed to come out of his gut. On Feb. 12, the night the letter was released, Clinton flew to Dover, N.H., to speak at the Elks Lodge there. He knew his campaign was on the verge of collapse. Speaking in a small packed room with the audience on all sides of him, giving his appearance the feel of an actor in a theater in the round, he spoke like a man at the edge of a cliff looking down. "This is the work of my life," he said in a pained voice, comparing his commitment to change with that of George Bush, whose campaign had been saved by the voters of New Hampshire four years earlier. "I'll tell you what I think the character issue in this election is. How can you have the power of the Presidency and never use it to help people improve their lives until your life needs saving in an election? I won't be like George Bush. I'll never forget who gave me a second chance, and I'll be there for you until the last dog dies."
It was both artful spin and politics so close to the bone it hurt to watch. In an interview the day before, Clinton had wondered how much the public can demand from people running for office.
"People have a right to expect that there's more than my mind engaged in this," he says. "But to say you have to keep revealing yourself in order to be in public life, I don't think that is a standard anybody can keep. I don't think a minister in a church can do that. I'm almost positive a politician can't. At some point, all of us hold something back, except in our most intimate relations."
 THE TWO EVENTS ARE like bookends of a relationship that is still raw for Bill Clinton long after his stepfather's death.
The first came when Clinton was in his early teens -- a moment that would change his life forever. His stepfather, Roger Clinton, was a quiet, amiable man by day; at night, the bourbon turned him so violent and abusive that he once fired a gun in the house. After one particularly ugly incident, Bill Clinton took his mother and younger half brother by the hand and issued a warning to his stepfather: "You will never hit either of them again. If you want them, you'll have to go through me." It was the stepfather who blinked, and though his drinking continued, the violence at home ended.
The second came when Bill Clinton was a 20-year-old undergraduate at Georgetown University. His stepfather was dying of cancer at Duke University Hospital, and Clinton would drive the 266 miles between Washington and Durham, N.C., on weekends to see him. Bill remembers one Easter weekend in particular, when he and his stepfather attended services together at the Duke Chapel, a soaring Gothic symphony of stained glass. It was then that each man finally came to terms with the other.
"It was, God, beautiful," Clinton recalls now, his voice softening. "I think he knew that I was coming down there just because I loved him. There was nothing else to fight over, nothing else to run from. It was a wonderful time in my life, and I think in his."
Hillary Clinton found herself profoundly moved by the reconciliation story, which she first heard from her future husband when they were dating classmates at Yale Law School. "Here was a young man, not even an adult yet, who was big enough and mature enough to love somebody who caused him and his family pain," she says.
Only a fool would try to tie too neat a ribbon around the conflicting elements that shaped Bill Clinton. He's the son of a father he never knew -- an outgoing, charismatic personality who died in an auto accident four months before he was born -- but was doted on from Day 1 by a strong-willed, quick-witted mother. He grew up in Hot Springs, Ark., a town that was part Bible Belt, part Las Vegas (complete with race track and casino gambling).
Clinton says that because of the recurring melodrama at home, he turned "40 at 14." A friend of Clinton's, also the child of an alcoholic parent, contends that children of drinkers fall into three groups: healers, hiders and jokers. Shaped both by the chaos at home and an aching sense of mortality from his father's early death, Bill Clinton became a healer. "He was my best friend," says his half brother, Roger Jr., now a 35-year-old singer and songwriter in Los Angeles. "He was my brother. He was my father. He was my protector."
That healing instinct comes to the fore not only in Clinton's private life but also in his public life -- in the way he works a room like a preacher, lacing his campaign speeches with personal stories of distress and pain. It also shows up in his compulsive need to please, to bring people together at some hazily defined, accommodating center -- as if he were still re-enacting in politics the role he played at home.
"I can feel other people's pain a lot more than some people can," Clinton says. "I think that's important for a politician. I think you literally have to be able to sit in the quiet of a room and accurately imagine what life must be like for people growing up on mean streets, people living their lives behind bars, people about to face death's door."
But politics is full of people who practice empathy on a large public scale and who can't always translate this gift into their private lives. Clinton is the first to acknowledge this limitation in himself. "In a funny way, I'm reluctant to commit myself, to reach out past a certain point and get involved with people, because you're always, in a subconscious way, aware that this can all be taken away."
He was born William Jefferson Blythe IV on Aug. 19, 1946. Relatives say he has his father's magnetism and good looks; they can even see Bill Blythe in his son's long fingers and the way he tilts his head. When he was nearly 2, he was left with his grandparents, who ran a grocery store in a black neighborhood in Hope, Ark., while his mother studied to be a nurse-anesthetist in New Orleans. At the age of 7, he moved with his mother and stepfather, Roger Clinton Sr., to the resort town of Hot Springs, where Roger's brother had a Buick dealership.
Growing up in a neat ranch house overlooking a field of peonies, Clinton was greatly influenced by his mother, who would be widowed three times in her life and is now remarried to Richard W. Kelly. A smart, voluble woman, she had an affection for the local race track and an opinion on everything, After a long day at the hospital, she'd rush in to the kitchen, muttering "It's just not right -- it's just not fair" about some outrage, idiocy or injustice she'd witnessed at work that day. Engaging her son in endless political discussions, she was, says a friend of Clinton's, consciously feeding his mind, pushing her precocious son toward a life far beyond Hot Springs.
Clinton thought fleetingly of careers in medicine, journalism and music, but after he met John F. Kennedy in 1963 as a delegate to the American Legion Boys Nation program, he never wavered from the idea of a political career. His politics defined by the antiwar and civil rights struggles of the 60's, he went to work for Sen. J. William Fulbright of Arkansas in Washington in 1967 and ran George McGovern's ill-fated Presidential campaign in Texas in 1972. When Clinton won the Arkansas Statehouse in 1978 at the age of 32, he became the youngest Governor since the 31-year-old Harold E. Stassen was elected in Minnesota in 1938.
As Governor, Clinton came in like a whirlwind. He had a program for every problem, from energy to education to economic development, and a passel of bearded young liberal aides to carry them out. He took on powerful timber and trucking interests and slapped on an unpopular license-tag tax increase to pay for a road program.
And then, suddenly, he was out of office, defeated by an obscure Republican named Frank White, a sour economy and the growing perception around the state that he was a little too full of himself. A year later, he went on television, apologized to the voters and asked them to give him another chance. In 1982, he made a successful comeback by unseating White, picking up 55 percent of the vote. He has been Governor ever since.
Clinton's record is a mix of genuine innovation and unfulfilled promise. In education, where he pushed through the nation's first teacher competency testing program, his achievements live up to their hype. But in other areas, particularly tax fairness and the environment, his record does not match his rhetoric.
Clinton's toughest decision in office was a personal one. In 1984, State Police officers learned his half brother, Roger Jr., was selling drugs. Without hesitation, the Governor approved a sting that resulted in his brother's arrest and conviction on drug charges. For about six weeks, while he and Hillary characteristically read everything they could find on drug abuse, he waited in agony for the arrest to occur.
It was a pivotal moment for both Bill and Roger Clinton. The whole family, including their mother and Hillary, sat through counseling sessions that opened up some of the rawest wounds from their youth. Roger Jr. says he felt betrayed by his brother at first, but then realized he had saved his life. Bill Clinton says that for the first time he was able to see how much he'd ignored the needs of those around him, how much his own ambitions had gotten out of control. "I finally realized how my compulsive and obsessive ambition got in the way," he says. "And I think that dealing with that helped me to achieve some better balance."
Still, no one doubts the intensity of Clinton's ambition today. Talking about what got him into politics, he harks back to his first race. "It taught me you've got to stand for something bigger than yourself," he says.
The question that lingers from his personal history is just what kind of politician it produced: a charismatic leader with a real passion for making government work for people or an eager-to-please politician whose positions come from his polls rather than his heart? Clinton's campaign so far has shown he can take a punch, make a speech and spout policy with the best of them. What's not clear is whether he meets his own standard: does he stand for something bigger than himself?
THE MOST GLARING IRONY about Bill Clinton's wild ride is this: after spending a lifetime honing his political skills, he's running for President at a time when the rules of the game are no longer clear. Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political science professor and author of "Feeding Frenzy," says Clinton's problems offer a textbook case in the way marginal issues now obliterate substantive ones in American politics. "I've said all along the standards are going straight down, and that's what we're seeing," Sabato says.
Once it was the party bosses who sized up candidates, picked at their entrails and decided their fate. Now that process is largely left to the news media -- a great unwieldy beast of mainstream newspapers, television news, supermarket tabloids and talk shows featuring Washington windbags. Clinton's troubles provide a particularly vivid example of how Byzantine the media food chain has become, how blurred the lines are between the bottom feeders and the "respectable" press, between entertainment and journalism.
But it's clear that a candidate who thinks he can inspire the country as President can't do it without inspiring confidence in himself first. It's clear that a candidate whose campaign preaches personal responsibility has to practice it as well. Clinton's problem goes beyond the muck. Having based his campaign on the notion of his electability, he now has to cut through the haze and give voters a reason to elect him.
Before his campaign is over, Clinton may yet find himself in the hot seat again -- as he did after a recent outburst against the Rev. Jesse Jackson over a misunderstood interview question. Even Clinton's supporters expect additional allegations about his private life. But some critical questions about his fate may be answered Tuesday. If he wins big in the South and can pull off a victory the week after in Illinois, where he has a formidable organization, his campaign could be back on track.
But after a lifetime of preparation for this race, Clinton says he's sure of only one thing: "Of all the people running, I'd be the best President. That's the only case I wanted to make to the voters."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Picking a Package for the Music Festival Season

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY; CLIFFORD J. LEVY works on the foreign news desk of The New York Times.

 BODY:
DRAWN by the promise of stirring performances amid celebrated surroundings, travelers from around the world descend upon the music festivals and concert halls of Europe each spring and summer, hoping to immerse themselves for a few days in opera, symphony, jazz and sightseeing.
But for many travelers, the charms of a famous music festival or an intimate Baroque opera house may be overshadowed by difficulties in getting to the event or in obtaining seats. Tickets, which can cost well over $100 for many events, are often sold out months in advance and schedules may be complicated. Language can be a problem, particularly for people going to out-of-the-way cities. And, as with tickets, hotels in the area of the event may already be reserved. 
 Mindful of these obstacles, some travelers entrust themselves to tour companies specializing in packages that include hotel reservations, meals, local transportation, sightseeing and, most important, good tickets to festivals and concerts. The tours are usually led by music-lovers who are eager to share their knowledge.
The tours may focus on one event, like the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, which celebrates the works of Wagner, or the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland; a particular geographic area, like the opera houses of Italy; or a theme, like Mozart's Europe. Some include lectures by musicologists and reading materials to help travelers' appreciation of the performances they attend. Besides being convenient, such tours provide a chance for devotees to meet others with similar tastes. Most packages are limited to 15 to 25 people.
The recession has forced many nonprofit organizations, like the Houston Grand Opera Guild and some of the jazz educational groups, to eliminate their more expensive activities -- like music tours of Europe -- and instead concentrate on events closer to home, so there are fewer music tours overseas by these agencies. The economic slump has also prompted tour companies to cut back their music packages to Europe. Even so, they are turning their sights to Eastern Europe, seeking tickets to concerts in cities like Prague, Budapest and Warsaw. While the accommodations may not be as luxurious as those in Western Europe, the singers and musicians are often excellent, tour operators say.
Most of the travelers booking these packages are over 35. Younger people often cannot afford such expensive trips and may prefer less structured travel. Most of these tours are expensive; few cost less than $2,500 for 10 days or so, without air fare to Europe. But the price usually includes fine hotels and meals at good restaurants.
The following is a listing of tour companies and some of the music packages they have scheduled for this spring and summer. Prices are for double occupancy without air fare and usually include rooms, most meals, tickets, guides, transportation in Europe and assorted extras:
Great Performance Tours, 1 Lincoln Plaza, Suite 32V, New York, N.Y. 10023; (212) 580-1400, offers three tours of Europe in the spring and three in the summer. Christopher T. Clark, the company's president, has been leading trips to the Continent since 1979 and is a former executive of the Metropolitan Opera and the Spoleto Festival in Italy.
The Vienna Festival package, from May 10 to 18, includes works of Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, Strauss and Tchaikovsky; the cost is $3,570. Other spring tours include the London Spring Festivals and the Hohenems Schubertiade in Austria. In the summer, there are tours of opera houses in Italy, the Munich Opera Festival and the Salzburg Festival.
Dailey-Thorp Travel Inc., 330 West 58th Street, New York, N.Y. 10019; (212) 307-1555, has been leading music tours to Europe since 1971 and has about 10 planned for the spring and summer. Its packages usually include lectures with music scholars and some of its guides have graduate degrees in music, said Mary T. Dailey, the company's president.
Among the spring tours are Cultural, Historical Russia, from April 4 to 18, with opera, concerts and ballet in St. Petersburg, Suzdal, Moscow and Helsinki; cost is $4,375, including air fare from New York. Another package, Music Festival on the Danube from May 14 to 25, features concerts in Prague, Bratislava, Budapest and Vienna; cost is $6,350.
The Metropolitan Opera Guild, 70 Lincoln Center Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10023; (212) 769-7062, sponsors two tours of Europe that are available only to its members, who pay annual dues of at least $50. Put together by Dailey-Thorp, they differ only slightly from the company's regular packages. The packages are Eastern European Odyssey from March 27 to April 13, featuring opera in Warsaw, Budapest, Bratislava, Prague and Berlin; cost is $5,140. A second package, from July 21 to Aug. 1, focuses on opera in Verona, Salzburg and Munich; cost is $7,975, which includes air fare to Europe.
Ovations International Inc., 2 Executive Concourse, Suite 206, Duluth, Ga., 30136; (800) 635-5576 or (404) 476-4007, was founded in 1985 and specializes in music tours of Italy; seven tours to Europe are scheduled for the spring and summer. Michael Paul Tisma, the company's president, said the average price for a 10-day package was $3,000 to $3,500. One tour, Sicilian Landscapes from May 18 to 28, focuses on opera in Palermo and Catania, with a performance of "Aida" and a recital by Marilyn Horne.
International Curtain Call, 3313 Patricia Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif., 90064; (800) 669-9070 or (310) 204-4934, is sponsoring seven music tours to Europe, one of which is already sold out, said Jerome J. Glaser, the company's director. A tour of Italy, from June 6 to 16, includes opera in Milan, Florence and Venice. A tour of France, from July 5 to 19, features performances of Rossini's "Barber of Seville" at the Paris Opera and visits to the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the Orange Festival in Avignon. Prices of the tours average $4,000.
Rudolph Travel Service Ltd., 77 Bloor Street West, Suite 1105, Toronto, Canada M5S 1M2; (416) 964-3553, features tours put together by its director, John Mainz, a German native who specializes in the opera houses of Germany and Austria. The company, which has been sending tours to Europe since 1971, has scheduled seven spring and summer packages.
The Vienna tour, from May 4 to 12, includes performances of "The Flying Dutchman" and "Don Giovanni"; cost is $2,895. Another package, from Aug. 3 to 17, combines visits to two of the region's most famous festivals, Salzburg and Bayreuth; cost is $7,950. Like other tour companies, Rudolph has built up connections with these festivals, so it is able to obtain what are very scarce tickets.
Now Voyager Tours, 101 Cooper Street, No. 6J, New York, N.Y. 10034; (212) 567-1924, is owned by a couple who have spent much of their adult lives studying Mozart. Norman Eagle, the company's president, said he and his wife, Betty, have visited nearly all the places where Mozart lived and performed, and they have crafted their experiences into tours of the composer's life and works. This year, Now Voyager is leading two Mozart tours, from Sept. 5 to 21 and Sept. 23 to Oct. 9. They cost from $3,041 to $3,679. The first includes three days in Prague, one of Mozart's favorites cities, and concerts at the theater where he conducted the premieres of "Don Giovanni" and "Prague Symphony."
Ciao! Travel, 2707 Congress Street, Suite 1F, San Diego, Calif., 92110; (800) 942-2426, offers packages to three of Europe's top jazz festivals -- Montreux in Switzerland, J.V.C. North Sea in The Hague and J.V.C. Grande Parade of Jazz in Nice, France. Ciao!, founded in 1987, sent 450 people to these events last year, said its owner, Bill Snider. Its packages, which include air fare from New York, hotel rooms and passes to the festivals, range from $1,399 for a four-day weekend at North Sea to $2,499 for a week at Montreux. The company's offerings are less structured than others' tours built around classical music; travelers are not guided from event to event, but they can consult an executive from Ciao! at each festival.
Montreux, from July 3 to 18, will once again be produced this year by Quincy Jones. North Sea, from July 9 to 12, will feature performances by Dizzy Gillespie, as well as a retrospective on Miles Davis.

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
The Haitian Beat Thrives in Times Of Suffering

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE; Daisann McLane writes about music for Vogue, Rolling Stone and The Village Voice.

 BODY:
Within a day after its release last month to radio stations in Port-au-Prince, "Kalfou Dangere" ("Dangerous Crossroads"), the new single from Boukman Eksperyans, had burned a fast track across the airwaves and into streets shattered by coup, terrorism and economic embargo. "Kalfou Dangere," the title track of Boukman's second album, to be released here in May, is a percussive assault on Haiti's "evildoers" that is steeped in the symbolism of voodoo and Haitian history. The song soon headed northward via teledyol, the grapevine that is the Haitian community's equivalent of a news service. Taped from radio broadcasts, then rebroadcast over shortwave and pirate radio stations in New York, "Kalfou Dangere," in only three days, became a hit from Port-au-Prince to Flatbush, Brooklyn. It also became an anthem for supporters of the democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Terrorized by military dictatorship, strapped by embargo, Haiti would seem to be the last place one would expect to find bands making pop records. But neither political nor economic suffering seems able to repress the surge of musical creativity that began to surface in Haiti six years ago, with the departure of Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier. According to Boukman Eksperyan's lead singer and composer, Theodore Beaubrun, nearly a dozen groups have released songs for this year's Haitian carnival season, which ended last Tuesday. 
 At least two distinct pop trends, one rooted in the country's past, the other determinedly modern, have emerged in the last few years. A third, Haiti's well-known dance music, compas, is waking up under the competitive pressure. The impulses behind this creative burst are as complex as the contemporary Haitian experience. Certainly the post-Duvalier political trauma has presented musicians with plenty of inspiration. But to attribute the boom solely to political events ignores a most important characteristic of modern Haiti: the diaspora. At least a million Haitians -- and many of the country's musicians -- live outside Haiti, in New York, Miami and Montreal.
Responding to this community's needs, Haitian music has become much more than entertainment. It's a radio of the heart, keeping Haitians, connected to their country, one another and themselves.
Politics propelled Boukman Eksperyans to the forefront of the Haitian new wave. In 1990, Boukman's metaphor-laced "Kem Pa' Sote" ("My Heart Doesn't Jump") was taken up by ecstatic crowds (who rewrote the words) and turned it into the battle cry of President Aristide's victory. With the release of "Vodou Adjae" ("Voodoo Trance Dance") by Mango Records shortly after the election, Boukman became the first Haitian group in years with an album on a major American label.
Boukman's is perhaps the most original music to come out of the Caribbean in the last few years. The music is a mixture of high-tech and traditional, in which searing Santana-like electric guitar and synthesizer riffs knife across the jumpy, uneasy drums and chants of rara -- Haitian street revelry. Voodoo rock, or rara rock, as some critics describe Boukman's music, is not completely new. In the 1950's, Haitian bands played "voodoo jazz," pop music based on the ritual rhythms of the Haitian religion and rara, its secular cousin. But Boukman's success with fusing the traditional and modern has sparked what amounts to a rara revival. "Figure out how many thousands of drummers there are in Haiti, then divide that number into units of three, and you'll get some idea of how far the voodoo-rock band boom can go," says Richard Morse, leader of a voodoo-rock band and promotor of Boukman's early performances.
Everybody is getting into the rara act. Bands like the New York-based Tabou Combo, which built its reputation playing compas, Haiti's most popular dance music, are now adding rara rhythms to their sets. A former compas session player, Clifford Sylvain, has gone further, naming his group Rara Machine and even lifting a song title from Boukman's album for the title of his new record, "Break the Chain," released by Shanachie Records.
The rise of rara rock has rekindled interest in the original form. For example, in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, a rum-fueled Sunday-afternoon jam of parading singers, drummers, and bamboo and tin horn players has been going strong for the last two summers. These raras attract young, culturally conscious Haitians (including Boukman members when they are in town), some with their hair in dreadlocks, others wearing straw hats and swinging the Haitian peasant sack, or macoute.
Part of the appeal of rara, and its newest incarnation, rara rock, is its subversiveness. Boukman's latest rara song shows how Afro-Caribbean music functions as a sanctioned channel for social protest. Why hasn't the Haitian military banned "Kalfou Dangere" from the radio or arrested the group, as it did the folk singer Manno Charlemagne several months ago? The answer lies in Afro-Haitian culture. Rara, like griot in Senegal and calypso in Trinidad, bestows upon its singer-composers the liberty to bash sacred cows, to speak the unspeakable. " 'Kalfou' is rara," says Theodore Beaubrun, "and besides, it's released for carnival. The military doesn't dare interfere with the people's expression at this time."
As Boukman and its followers reach back to traditional rhythms to create the sound of modern Haiti, other groups are jumping into the pop mainstream for inspiration. This "nouvel jenerasyon" (new generation) of musicians began to surface in the mid 1980's. The nouvel jenerasyon bands slowed the traditional compas rhythm, simplified the syncopation and substituted synthesizers for the familiar horns. But otherwise the groups are all over the pop-music map.
Members of the Phantoms wear mohawk haircuts and add Jamaican dancehall breaks in creole to their songs on their newest album, "Ouve Barie Ya" ("Open the Gate"), released by Josy Records. Riske, an all-female band based in Miami, specializes in a smooth, glossy synth-pop that is the Haitian answer to the Cuban-American Miami sound of Gloria Estefan. Second-generation Haitian New Yorkers like Zin and Partners have strong rhythm and blues hooks in their dance records, while the soprano Emeline Michel blends sophisticated jazz-rock with Brazilian and Afro-pop.
With so many elements that are uncharacteristic of Haitian music, it might look as if nouvel jenerasyon is simply a tag for crossover fever, which it sometimes is. But the restless invention of new forms and fusions springs from the experience of these younger Haitians struggling to define their identities both at home and in the multicultural seas of the United States and Canada. In this sense, the sparkling pop sounds of the nouvel jenerasyon have as much reason to be considered "political" as the most incendiary chant in rara rock.
Compas, on the other hand, is the best known Haitian music. Graceful and elegant, with a steady high-hat syncopation and its trademark intertwined lead and rhythm guitars, compas is still the most popular music with Haitian dancers. For the last 15 years, a handful of superb compas bands based in the emigre communities of New York and Miami -- Tabou Combo, Skah Shah, Magnum Band and System Band -- have dominated the Haitian music scene. Long associated with the Haitian diaspora, and especially its middle class, compas usually steers clear of politics or radical musical changes. But the Haitian new wave's burst of energy has infected compas, too. Once a genre of supergroups, it now has a superstar, and a politically minded one at that: Dieudonne Larose.
Larose, a 32-year-old emigre based in Montreal, recently hand-delivered his third album, "Democratie," to the L'an 2000 record store in Flatbush; as he stepped out of his chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz, a hush fell over the customers, who parted to let the slender, handsomely attired singer pass. But this is just surface style; underneath the trappings, Larose is transforming Haitian music as deeply as Boukman Eksperyans, but in a quieter way.
Larose's gentle bubbling songs are little jewels of melody that have the singsong staying power of children's schoolyard chants. In the 1930's and 40's, Haiti's European-trained urban composers scoured the countryside for traditional and voodoo songs, which they used as the basis for new tunes that became pop classics. Larose, who grew up in the countryside north of Port-au-Prince (most compas musicians come from the city), writes in the style of these old favorites, evoking a yearning for the pastoral life they represent. His rough-hewn tenor rings with pure feeling, reminding many Haitians of the legendary singer Ti-Manno, who died in 1985.
Larose's lyrics lack the Boukman bite; they are commentaries, not anthems. From the point of view of the Haitian immigrant, he tackling topics like democracy, the plight of Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic, the gulf war and his own sudden stardom. He can be as eloquent as a calypso singer or a black preacher, but he usually backs away from hard issues. In "Democratie," for example, he criticizes whites for their racist attitudes toward black governments but then admonishes fellow Haitians as if they were troublesome children: "Work hard . . . respect the law."
Speaking his mind while avoiding trouble, Larose reflects the confusing world of values the Haitian immigrant must negotiate. No wonder he strikes such a nerve with diaspora Haitians; he taps his community's dialogue and spins it into song.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 2d Phase in Milford;
Reefing Sails in a Recession

 BODY:
When the developers of Caswell Cove, a waterfront community in Milford, Conn. put up the first phase of their project four years ago, the recession was still off shore. The 48 two-bedroom condominiums on the marina there sold out at prices of $240,000 to $325,000, along with 48 slips at $1,000 a foot.
But when Milford Partners tried to build the next phase, few buyers came forward and construction stopped for 18 months. "We had a choice of throwing up our hands and going bankrupt or restructuring the project." said Kevin Bartlett, the only remaining member of Milford Partners, the developers. 
 In December, work started on another 48 condominiums. To bring back buyers, prices were slashed sharply -- $145,900 to $149,900 -- although slip prices are the same. A drop in construction costs helped make the price cuts possible. The layouts of the new units are nearly identical to those in the first phase, but features like electronic security systems are optional extras instead of standard. To sweeten the deal, the developer is offering financing that requires a 10 percent down payment on a 30-year loan at 7 3/4 percent interest.
The firm of Valus and Carpenters Associates of Westport designed both phases. The first units are to be finished in May.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Assisted Housing;
Managing the Newly Built Apartments

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
BEAUTY didn't abandon the Grand Concourse in the Bronx during the 70's, when property owners did. Linda Field spotted it on the corner of Tremont Avenue, in a city-owned property known as the Flatiron Building, which a doctors group had owned and operated for years as a medical center. Ms. Field won city designation to do a Federally subsidized gut conversion to create 43 apartments in the building.
That was not the last of the gut rehabilitations in the West Bronx done by Ms. Field, who set out on a housing career after a stint as a graduate student in art history at Columbia University in 1967. But in recent years development opportunities have contracted. 
 So she and her partner, Robert Garcia, an electrical contractor, have concentrated on management. Their company, Ashton Management Corporation, was formed in 1979, principally to manage the buildings they developed together. In the last two years management has come on strong, especially on behalf of nonprofit housing organizations in the Bronx that are recycling many vacant city-owned buildings.
Ashton is the manager of two major projects. One is New Settlement apartments -- 893 units in 14 newly completed buildings that were gut-rehabilitated under Department of Housing Preservation and Development auspices and are owned by the Settlement Housing Fund through an affiliated company. They are in the Morris Heights neighborhood, south of the Cross Bronx Expressway between Jerome Avenue and the Concourse.
The other project, still in construction, consists of 722 apartments in 23 scattered buildings in Highbridge and Morris Heights. The owner will be a housing affiliate of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, which sponsored the development through its housing arm, the Housing Development Institute. Again, the housing agency is handling the construction through private contractors.
These two assignments have made Ashton a major housing management company in the Bronx and given Ms. Field firsthand experience with issues that are current subjects of debate.
Ms. Field's most immediate concern for the future of the housing stock in lower-income neighborhoods -- whether publicly assisted or privately owned -- is the cost of water. As has been widely noted, the city is moving inexorably toward water metering in multifamily housing without any clear notion of what it will cost the buildings and whether they can afford it.
"This is the greatest potential enemy of the private housing stock," Ms. Field said. "It can be the death of the stock. The city will have to decide whether to go back to the frontage system or accept many buildings in abandonment."
Under the frontage system historically used by New York City, water usage was estimated on the basis of plot and building size. Under the metering system, buildings are to be billed by actual water use. The level of use is largely out of the control of the managements paying the bills. In lower-income areas, large family sizes and doubled up occupancy lead to extraordinary usage.
"We see apartments with 10, 15, 19 people living together," Ms. Field said. "It's extremely common. Often there is a family with a father, a mother and three or four kids in one room."
That overoccupancy is a precipitating cause of family homelessness -- usually a young mother with children presenting herself for city shelter, which the city in a consent decree 1981 agreed to provide to all who seek it when they have no apparent housing alternative. Having supplied it, the city is effectively, if not legally, obliged to seek out permanent housing as well, at least when the family fails to do it on its own.
No other city in the country has accepted a legal obligation to supply temporary shelter to the homeless. The New York City approach has set up a competition over which families should have first preference for that scarce but desirable commodity, the newly rehabilitated, city-subsidized apartment. Should it go to a family in the shelter, defined as homeless, or to a family still living doubled up that is not technically homeless.
INITIALLY, the city's standard tenancy mix was 30 percent homeless and 70 percent working low- to moderate-income people in the new gut-rehabilitated rentals. In December 1990 the housing companies were allowed to take half the "homeless" from the doubled-up category.
Ms. Field worked under these standards for two years to tenant New Settlement apartments for the Settlement Housing Fund. She sees them as promoting fairness, and also as an acknowledgment by city government that not all families in transitional housing can cope with independent living even after a 6- to 12-month stay. For perhaps 5 percent of the families with violent or criminal tendencies, permanent custodial care is necessary unless a change in behavior is clearly established, she said.
"There are people in the shelter system because of a temporary disruption in their lives," she said. "They do well in permanent housing. There are others who go there to get priority for permanent housing. They tend to do very well too. Then there is a group of people, and it's a fairly large group, with severe and long-term problems that don't function well in a private setting."
Under a plan offered last month by the Mayor's Commission on the Homeless, headed by Andrew M. Cuomo, applicants for emergency or transitional housing would be screened through a number of "reception centers." The commission recommended no changes in existing standards of eligibility, but said these should be more strictly enforced.
Once housed temporarily -- usually in a facility run by a nonprofit at a cost to government of about $100 per family a night -- the Cuomo commission recommends that the family get whatever welfare assistance is needed to attain "economic and social independence."
It views a permanent apartment as one family need among many. Other needs may include job training and assistance, instruction in independent living, substance abuse treatment and mental health care.
New York City does not consider people in transitional facilities to have an entitlement to permanent housing. But in practice, formal "homelessness" can become a good ticket both to independent living capability and a decent apartment.
"There is no fair way of allocating housing once you say that everyone who presents himself at a shelter establishes a path to permanent housing as an entitlement," Ms. Field said. "People need to have access to permanent housing without having to go through the system."
The tenanting process at New Settlement apartments provided a mix of 70 percent working families, many of them working families moving up to better housing from older buildings in Upper Manhattan. Only 30 percent of the tenants are in the homeless or doubled-up category. The Ashton Management staff dealt with 19,000 applications for the 893 apartments, and interviewed 5,000 candidates.
MS. FIELD and Mr. Garcia have spent years plowing money into their management company, which now operates from an office in a property they rehabiliated under the Government's Section 8 program. This is the 172-unit three-building complex known as Macombs Village, at 1674 Macombs Road. They have a main office staff of 12 and 150 additional employees as office, maintenance and security personnel at developments they manage in the West Bronx.
As developer-owners, Ms. Field and Mr. Garcia also completed the 78-unit Alexander Corprew apartments at 1200 Union Avenue in Morrisania. Mr. Garcia also works independently of Ashton as a general contractor. The partners hope to return to development some day, but meanwhile the focus is on management.
"Management is labor intensive and it requires absolute attention every day," she said. "We deliver services and collect the rent. It's that simple -- and an all-consuming task."

HEADLINE: The Shattered Vision of the Booming 90's

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
HAD the world turned according to plan -- or, at least, according to environmental-impact statements -- a desolate patch west of Ninth Avenue behind the General Post Office would now be shaping up as a center for some 10,500 workers in two new office towers.
Instead, it remains mostly an open cut, 60 feet below street level, through which a network of tracks runs to Pennsylvania Station. North of this cut is an Edison parking lot ("Garden Events -- Fast In -- Fast Out") and to the south there is a Kinney parking lot. Between them, about 12 people work on the site, or 10,488 fewer than envisioned in the late 1980's. 
 As New York City's real-estate market enters its fourth year of distress, the absence of the Ninth Avenue projects, as well as dozens of others proposed in the last decade, is keenly felt. The virtual freeze in construction has cost millions of dollars in tax revenues and thousands of jobs, underscoring the city's dependence on development not only as a prime stimulator of its economy but also as a prop for its civic identity, as a place that ceaselessly, impatiently renews itself.
One way to measure what has not happened to the economy as a consequence of the construction slump is to go back to the late 1980's and recall where New York was supposed to have been in the 90's, as predicted both in broad socio-economic forecasts and specific scenarios outlined in environmental-impact statements.
The tone may be gleaned in these words, almost poignant in their exuberance, which seem to have the distance of decades, although written only five years ago:
"New York City is once again crowded, energetic and exciting. Its economy is booming. Every day brings new businesses and new customers to a wide variety of neighborhoods. Retail stores are opening everywhere. Wall Street is again the world's capital in finance and auxiliary services of all kinds have sprung up to oil the machinery of finance, real estate and insurance."
This vision was offered by a panel whose ribbons could not have been much bluer: the Mayor's Commission on the Year 2000, composed of two dozen civic and academic leaders. Their report, "New York Ascendant," was released in June 1987, four months before the stock market plummeted.
"By the year 2000," members of the commission concluded, "the city's economy will have produced some 300,000 more jobs. This slow but continued growth in employment will probably see increases in construction, finance and services."
Economists at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, writing in 1986, forecast a gain of 231,000 jobs in New York City by 1995, with 23,000 of those new jobs in construction, an increase of 24 percent.
Although years remain before either of these forecasts can be fairly judged, recent history has not encouraged the view that job growth is imminent.
From December 1987 to December 1991, about 135,900 jobs were lost in securities and commodities, banking, business services and law, a decline of 19 percent. "If you think of this complex as the engine, then construction is the caboose," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional director of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "When the engine stops -- after a little bit of a lag -- then the whole train begins to reverse."
If every one of those jobs in finance, banking, law and related services carried a need for 200 to 300 square feet of space, the reduction in demand among those sectors alone -- never mind insurance or advertising or airlines -- would have totaled 27 million to 41 million square feet, the equivalent of 10 to 15 Empire State Buildings.
True to Mr. Ehrenhalt's scenario, construction jobs held fairly stable from December 1987 to December 1989, during the first major contractions in white-collar employment. But since then, following the completion of many big developments, construction jobs have plunged by 32,300, a drop of 26 percent. Similarly, architectural employment grew slightly in the years immediately following the stock market plunge. But since 1989, 1,600 jobs have been lost in that field, a 19 percent decline.
"CONSTRUCTION works both as a push and a pull factor," said Steven G. Cochrane, senior economist at the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., which uses housing starts and nonresidential real estate investment in its economic models.
"Development itself does a lot to fuel the economy both directly and in terms of wages," he said, "but the impact is usually more important indirectly. There are a lot of indirect benefits because construction needs materials, financing and services, down to the guy who drives the coffee truck up to sell coffee to the workers."
And on a subjective basis, Mr. Cochrane noted that "certainly, when one sees construction cranes all around, one says, 'This place is on the move.' "
Such cannot be said of New York today.
Among the projects that have stalled are the two on Ninth Avenue. The Reichmann family's Olympia & York real estate concern planned a 51-story tower at 31st Street, with 1.67 million square feet of space. It was to have been completed last year but was delayed by a lawsuit. The Reichmanns would not build now on a speculative basis on that site, said their spokesman, Peter Rosenthal.
Harvey Schulweis planned a 31-story, 1.08-million square-foot tower at 33d Street. It was to have been finished this year but it, too, was delayed by a suit. Last week, he said the project was approved and "ready to go, waiting for a tenant or a market."
Construction of the Reichmanns' project would have created enough work to keep 1,950 people directly employed for a year and an additional 2,000 people indirectly employed, furnishing goods and services to the contractors, according to the impact statement prepared by Allee King Rosen & Fleming and Vollmer Associates.
(Environmental-impact statements use a "person-year" measurement, which equals one year's labor by one person. For example, 90 "person-years" might be expressed as 90 people working one year, 45 people working two years or 30 people working three years.)
Building the Schulweis project was to have created enough work to provide a year's worth of direct employment for 1,300 to 1,510 people. In total, there would have been a year's worth of direct and indirect employment for 1,960 to 2,280 people in New York City, according to an impact statement by the Parsons Brinckerhoff engineering and planning concern.
From construction alone, the Reichmanns' building would have generated $4.7 million in tax revenues for New York City -- enough to pay the annual, entry-level salary and benefits package of 109 police officers or 132 teachers -- and $9.9 million for the state. The largest portion of revenues would have come from personal income taxes, with other money from sales taxes and corporate taxes both on direct and indirect activities. The Schulweis project would have generated $2.8 million to $3.3 million in city tax revenues during construction -- 65 to 77 police officers or 79 to 93 teachers -- with an additional $6.3 million to $7.3 million for the state.
EVENTUALLY, 6,400 people were to have been in the Reichmanns' tower, as office tenants, store workers or building employees. Although many of these jobs would have been shifted from other buildings in the city, the analysis noted that "there would likely be some net gain in jobs for the city as well, since office tenants often move to accommodate future expansion."
Real-estate tax revenues would not have been affected in the first four years, the statement noted, because the developers intended to apply for a deferral under the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, but "property taxes would increase substantially" over existing conditions in the fourth year. No estimate was given.
The building was also to "generate substantial tax revenues for New York City and New York State to the extent that new uses would be on the site" -- including personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, sales taxes and commercial occupancy taxes.
Along with other projects, the Reichmanns' tower was seen as drawing new enterprises to the surrounding neighborhood. "The business support services, dining, entertainment and general-supply stores which would be attracted to the area would provide additional employment and tax benefits to the city," the impact statement said.
Meanwhile, the Schulweis project would have had some 4,070 office employees and 30 retail employees. And after the deferral under the incentive program, "the full assessed-value taxation of the property would be expected to range upwards to $8 million or $9 million annually," the statement said.
A half mile north, some 23,500 people -- nearly the population of Glen Cove, L.I. -- were to be working in the 42d Street Development Project, which was to have been completed by 1991, according to the environmental-impact statement by the New York State Urban Development Corporation. The project was also seen as displacing 3,300 jobs, for a net gain in the area of 20,200.
Of the new jobs, 13,300 were to have been in four office towers on Broadway and Seventh Avenue, 8,000 in a wholesale mart on Eighth Avenue, 1,200 in a hotel on Eighth Avenue, 500 in renovated theaters on 42d Street and 500 in the new stores throughout the project.
Through 2005, the office towers were expected to generate between $480 million and $507 million in payments in lieu of property taxes. The mart would have generated $200 million in a 22-year period, the hotel $86 million and the theaters $10 million.
Today, the state is still relocating tenants from two of the office tower sites, at the northeast and southwest corners of Broadway. On Feb. 20, six of the theaters were leased by the Urban Development Corporation to New 42d Street, which has been considering proposals for the theaters. And the mart and hotel, though they remain part of the plan, are in a state of suspension, as the state has not yet taken title to the sites.
Economic effects need not be measured in nine digits. The environmental-impact statement by Parsons Brinckerhoff for a residential project at Vernon Boulevard and 44th Avenue in Hunters Point, Queens, went so far as to examine annual household spending on prescription drugs and medicine ($167), reading material ($259) and alcohol ($545).
STARTING with such figures and then adjusting them for inflation, the impact statement concluded that the 1,962 new residents brought in by the project would be spending $14.11 million locally in 1992, $10.24 million of which would exceed the capacity of stores that were part of the development.
"It would appear that a substantial portion of this excess could be captured locally by existing retail establishments," the statement said, "particularly those located along the 21st Street neighborhood retail strip."
The project was expected to generate enough construction work to employ 1,800 people for a year and, in the end, to employ 50 people on the site, no net gain.
In downtown Brooklyn, construction of the Muss Development Company's Renaissance Plaza -- a combination office tower and Hilton Hotel -- was seen as providing a year's worth of direct employment for 1,170 people and a year's worth of indirect employment for another 1,230 people. The environmental-impact statement prepared in 1986 by Allee King also estimated that construction would generate $2.3 million in tax revenues for the city and $4.9 million for the state.
The building was to house 2,910 workers, 2,500 in the offices and 410 in the hotel. The environmental-impact statement acknowledged that most of the office employment would have been shifted from other locations in the city but also pointed out that "the 410 hotel jobs would represent new employment for the city and downtown Brooklyn which would otherwise not have occurred."
The project was given a considerable boost Feb. 25 with the signing of a 20-year lease by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office for 360,000 square feet.
Today, Joshua Muss, the developer, says that the hotel and garage at Renaissance Plaza may generate as many as 500 to 600 full-time jobs that "never existed before," as well as 400 part-time jobs for caterers or other enterprises that serve business conferences. He said it was not clear yet what the office population would be.
About construction-related jobs, Mr. Muss said direct employment might be close to the estimate and indirect employment was probably understated in the impact statement.
"When I think of the ad agencies, the P.R., the law firms, the accountants and the architects cumulatively," he said, "we've already spent an awful lot of money to bring it to date. Now, it will be productive money. We're looking forward to spending it."

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Retroactive Rent Increase
 
Question: My apartment and many others in the building where I live are under rent control. Because of numerous code violations in the building there has been no rent increase since January 1987. 
 Last year, the landlord filed for bankruptcy and the court appointed a receiver to manage the property. Assuming that the new management corrects the violations, would there be a retroactive rent increase? . . . Gladys Brown, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. According to Joseph D'Agosta, acting deputy commissioner for rent administration at the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, in general there is no mechanism in the rules covering maximum base rent, or M.B.R., increases, for retroactivity.
"Assuming that the code violations are cleared," said Mr. D'Agosta, "and certain maintenance and operating criteria are met, then the M.B.R. increase would be granted according to what is allowed for the current application period."
 
Subletting in a Co-op
 
Question: About five years ago I bought a co-op apartment. Before buying I made certain that subletting was allowed, even though I planned to occupy the apartment myself.
About six months after I bought the apartment, the board decided to disallow subletting. I did not pay much attention to the change at the time because I had no plans to take a tenant.
Recently I have tried without success to sell the apartment. There is a good market for rentals in the area and I would like to rent rather than sell at a loss.
Was it legal for the board to change the rules without a vote by the shareholders? . . . Louise Hendrick, Long Beach, L.I.
 
Answer: Maybe. But it would depend on the language of the corporation's documents and how much authority they give the board on such matters.
According to Richard Barr, a spokesman for the New York State Attorney General's office, the subletting issue is usually addressed in the co-op's bylaws. The language in most co-ops requires a majority vote by the shareholders to make changes in the bylaws.
However, if there is no mention of the subletting issue in the document, the board would be within its rights to establish a ban without a shareholders' vote.
The right to sublet is sometimes granted to original buyers in co-op conversions by the sponsor as an incentive to buy. If this was the case in your purchase, there should be a reference to the subletting privilege in the prospectus.
In any case, you should check your co-op documents to determine whether the board acted properly.
 
Noisy Air-Conditioner
 
Question: My house is very close to my neighbor's. Last summer he installed a central air-conditioning system, which requires the component to be outside the house. It is so loud that we could not sit outside last summer. We could hear the system inside the back bedrooms even with the windows closed.
When I spoke to my neighbor about this problem, he said that the installer had told him that nothing could be done about the noise. Do we have to live with this noise? . . . Peter Bell, Brooklyn
 
Answer: Maybe not. According to Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, the city's noise-pollution code sets decibel levels for air-circulation devices, including air-conditioners. Your neighbor's system may exceed the legal limit.
But assuming that the air-conditioning equipment does not surpass the code's noise levels, there may be ways to muffle the sound. Some owners have had some degree of success with natural or man-made sound barriers like shrubs, wooden containers or masonry covers that reduce the noise by absorbing some of it.
For more information on the city's noise code call the environmental agency's hot line at (718) 699-9811.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Carroll Gardens Renewal;
28 Low-Income Rentals

 BODY:
Six vacant city-owned buildings in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn are being renovated into 28 low-income rental apartments by the Carroll Gardens Association
The project is being financed under a $2.2 million loan agreement with the City of New York and contributions from the Enterprise Foundation and the New York Equity Fund. 
 The renovated buildings, which will be called the South Brooklyn Renewal Project, are on the east side of Columbia Street from Sackett to Kane Street. Construction began last December and is scheduled to be completed by late July.
Depending on the resident's income, studios will rent for about $328 a month; the one-bedrooms, $351 a month; the two-bedrooms, $422 a month.
"This is for the very poor; 30 percent will be set aside for the homeless and doubled-up families," said Manual Ortiz Arroyo, the executive director of the association. The association is a not-for-profit neighborhood preservation company financed by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

HEADLINE: Whalers' Woes: From Blue Line to Ticket Line to Bottom Line

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
ASHLEY GORDON was optimistic when she wrote to 146 corporate leaders in Fairfield County, inviting them to attend a reception, dinner and a Hartford Whalers hockey game last month at the Hartford Civic Center. Her optimism turned to chagrin, however, when only 40 responded to the invitations and just six showed up at the reception, which was to have included Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr., whose son Gray once was a goalie in the Whalers' farm system and even played in a few exhibition games for the Hartford club. But even the Governor did not make it; his mother was ill, the team said.
Many of the invited executives "said they were going to be out of town on business, but in some cases I could tell they just weren't interested," said Ms. Gordon, a member of the team's marketing staff and daughter of its principal owner, Richard Gordon. "It was all part of a concerted effort we're making to reach out to get people in the lower part of the state interested in the Whalers." The Whalers were part of the old World Hockey Association when the team moved to Hartford from Boston in 1974. But ever since the club joined the National Hockey League in 1979, becoming the only major league team in Connecticut, it has never had a statewide appeal. Most hockey fans in Fairfield County are still oriented toward the New York Rangers. Now, primarily because of declining attendance, the Whalers are trying to expand their fan base beyond the Hartford area, where it is largely confined, hoping to reach as far south as Greenwich, home of the tennis star Ivan Lendl, one of the team's biggest fans. 
 "We've got to get more people from downstate interested in the Whalers, who really are a state team," said Mr. Gordon, a real estate developer in Hartford. "It's important that we increase our fan base. Maybe we should change the name of the team to the Connecticut Whalers, which we might do some day."
Given Hartford's location, some people feel that the Whalers name is a misnomer, too. Some, citing Hartford's position as a bastion of the insurance business, have suggested names like the Actuaries or Double Indemnities, rather than Whalers, the team's name in Boston.
By any name, the Whalers have fallen on hard times, both at the box office and on the ice. Through the first 34 home games this season, the Whalers have averaged 10,329 fans, about 2,000 less than at a comparable stage last season, in part because season-ticket sales fell to 7,300 from 8,600 in 1990-91. The current average attendance at N.H.L games is 14,550, down just 100 from last year, said a league spokesman, Gary Meagher.
Mr. Gordon said the Whalers' lower attendance was mainly attributable to the team's poor record and not the recession.
"If we win, people will come," he said.
Going into last night's game against Vancouver, the Whalers had won 3 of their last 4 games after having gone 14 games without a victory, leaving them with one of the worst records among the N.H.L.'s 22 teams.
 
'It's the Lack of Winning'
 But the Whalers and their fans have become accustomed to losing. Since joining the league the team has only had three winning seasons. The team's high point came during the 1986-87 season, when the Whalers finished first in the Adams Division, one of four divisions in the league.
That helped raise regular-season home attendance to a record 582,969 the following year. But attendance, which averaged 14,574 that season, has declined in each succeeding year.
"It's the lack of winning," said the 50-year-old Mr. Gordon, who has been a major figure in the redevelopment of downtown Hartford. "You have to win. It's the American way."
Things have also not been going well for the Whalers off the ice. The N.H.L. charged recently that the Colonial Whalers Limited Partnership, formed by four partners in Colonial Realty, which is now bankrupt, falsified financial information in obtaining approval by the league's board to buy 37.5 percent of the team's ownership. The board is sheduled to discuss the matter at a meeting in Chicago on March 20.
Mr. Gordon, who also owns 37.5 percent of the Whalers, said that he is now in the process of buying that disputed share, which previously had been owned by Donald G. Conrad. Mr. Gordon and Mr. Conrad bought 75 percent of the Whalers in 1988 from the a group of businesses in the Hartford area, including the Aetna Life and Casualty Company. The group has retained 25 percent ownership. Mr. Conrad sold his interest to Colonial, but Mr. Conrad has filed suit against Mr. Gordon and Colonial for nonpayment on their ownership agreement.
Because of the declining attendance in the league's smallest market, rumors have circulated that the club might leave the state.
"We're not going to leave, unless we're forced to" by "a lack of support," Mr. Gordon said. He conceded that the team had received overtures from other cities, but he said: "I don't want to leave. The Whalers are a key element in Hartford's revitalization and the glue that holds the city together."
 
Million-Dollar Man
 The Whalers are expected to lose about $5 million this season. Rising salaries -- the team average is now about $400,000, the same as the rest of the league -- have contributed to the deficit.
But in losing money, the Whalers are not alone in the N.H.L. As many as one-third of the league's teams have been operating at a deficit for the last three seasons. During the same period players' salaries have escalated.
The Whalers now have their first million-dollar player, the center John Cullen, who was obtained last month in a trade with the defending league champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins. Mr. Cullen, whose father and two uncles also played in the N.H.L., is earning $900,000 this season, along with a $300,000 signing bonus. He is to be paid $900,000 over each of the next three seasons and $1 million in the fourth year of his contract.
But neither Mr. Cullen nor any of the other current crop of Whalers have established themselves as stars with whom fans can identify.
"That's one of our biggest problems," Mr. Gordon said. "We have no identity, no players to form around."
The players who captured Whalers fans' fancies are no longer around. The legendary Gordie Howe, who finished his career with the Whalers, playing with his two sons for a while, is now a special assistant to Mr. Gordon, while the team's most popular players in recent years -- Ron Francis, Kevin Dineen and Mike Liut -- have all been traded.
"The fans just have to accept the new players and try to understand our basic philosophies," Mr. Gordon said when asked about those trades, which were unpopular with many Whaler fans. "We knew they weren't going to get any better, and we decided to go with younger players."
 
Top Ticket at $30
 Jim Baldwin, the director of ticket operations, said the vast majority of Whaler fans come from within a 30-mile radius of Hartford, including western Massachusetts. The club's appeal in Massachusetts has been helped considerably since the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League, champions of their league in the past two seasons, became a Whalers farm team following the 1989-90 season.
Mr. Gordon, Mr. Baldwin and other club officials said the Whalers offer fans a good deal. The top ticket price is $30, compared with $65 for a New York Rangers game at Madison Square Garden. Ticket prices in Hartford range from $15 to $30, with about 45 per cent of the 15,500 seats in the Civic Center priced at the top.
One of the luxurious 12-seat boxes atop the arena goes for $75,000 for the season; a 10-seat box costs $60,000. Those prices, which are lower for a three- or five-year lease, include a wide range of other Civic Center events, like University of Connecticut basketball games.
Many of the fans at Whalers games come to cheer for the visting teams, especially the Boston Bruins. When the Montreal Canadiens played in Hartford on Feb. 19, at least 550 tickets were been sold to fans of the Canadiens, many of whom chartered buses to make the 400-mile trip from Montreal.
"Most of them can't get tickets to the Canadiens games at the Montreal Forum, which are always sold out, and so they come all the way to see their team play," Mr. Baldwin said. "And you sure know they're in the building."

HEADLINE: At Last, G.O.P.'s Bills See Light of Day

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
REPUBLICAN state senators who have spent their entire careers in the minority are facing a heady prospect. They are going to see some of their favorite bills voted on.
For the last two decades, Democrats have wielded the gavel of the Senate President, a position that carries the ultimate power to decide which bills are posted for voting. Republicans who came up with inspired pieces of legislation would sometimes have to watch from the sidelines as their bills were stolen -- copied word for word -- and put up for a vote by Democratic sponsors. 
 It has not been uncommon to see 10 Democratic Senate bills voted on for every Republican bill. That number would change when the Democratic leadership wanted Republican votes for a potentially controversial measure, creating an opportunity for some horse-trading.
Now it's the Republicans' turn. A landslide victory in the November elections gave them overwhelming majorities in both houses of the Legislature. That gives the Republicans the power to appoint the committees where much of the mischief is done, where bills submitted by the minority are often held and similar bills are released under the sponsorship of the majority.
The new Senate majority leader, John H. Dorsey of Boonton, said the Senate staff had been assigned to draw up a list of bills that have been denied a vote over the years and to single out some of them for early action in the legislative session just started. And Democratic leaders have begun to complain that their bills are being hijacked by the new Republican majority, though the gripes are not too loud.
The role of the majority carries with it important responsibilities -- passing a balanced budget, dealing with a revenue gap and the problems of controlling health-care costs and financing public education in a way that will meet constitutional requirements for fairness. But the prospect of seeing some of their long-delayed pet bills, important and otherwise, finally come up for a vote is bringing smiles to the faces of the new bosses in the Senate.
Gerald Cardinale of Demarest, an 11-year veteran of the Senate, recalls that he first introduced a bill eight years ago that would require restaurants to notify customers if they use monosodium glutamate in their cooking. "I got it out of committee, but John Russo would never put it up for a vote," he said, referring to the former Senate President.
Dr. Cardinale, a dentist, expressed surprise at the furor his bill had created. "The MSG people came out of the woodwork," he said, "and would convince restaurateurs that it would be costly, when all they would have to do was put a sticker on their menus until they printed new ones. I think the 3 percent of the population that suffers an adverse reaction to MSG are entitled to know if it is their food."
He also plans to get a vote on another bill that attracted 25 co-sponsors but was denied a spot on the voting board. This would require schools to begin each day by reciting that part of the Declaration of Independence that says people are "endowed by their creator" with certain rights, a phrase that is certain to raise anew the debate over school prayer and the separation of church and state.
"I saw John Russo the other day and teased him about not posting it in the past," Dr. Cardinale said.
 
Backer of Initiative Measure
 Mr. Dorsey said, "My bill is I. and R." An 11-year veteran of the upper house, he was an early champion of initiative and referendum legislation, which would give voters the right to propose and vote on changes in state law. The idea, supported by a number of voter groups, passed the Senate twice, only to die in the Assembly.
The only reason it made it through the Senate, Mr. Dorsey said, was that the Republican leadership was confident the measure would fail in the Assembly.
Senator Leanna Brown of Chatham, who is starting her ninth year in the Senate, said some of her bills would need reworking because of changed conditions since she had first sponsored them. "I'm told the last time there was this dramatic a change in legislative leadership, it took two years to get the process working smoothly," she said.
Mrs. Brown said she still wanted to pass her bill that would allow people to conduct businesses from their homes under certain conditions. Given the realities of the computer age, she said, the measure "makes sense."
But it would not permit the creation of businesses in a residential zone if they would attract a lot of traffic -- she cited a dance studio as an example -- or violate local zoning codes.
Because of the complexity of the issue, she said, she will probably first move to create a commission to study the proposal and recommend new legislation.
 
Office of Children's Advocacy
 Another of her initiatives that was bottled up would have created an office of children's advocacy within the government to coordinate all the services geared toward the needs of children. "The pundits say the 60's and 70's were the decades of the ombudsman," she said, "and this decade will be the time for a children's advocate."
Senator Robert E. Littell of Franklin said he had been frustrated by the failure of the Legislature to follow up on an old study that found a number of state dams to be in poor condition. He sponsored a Clean Water Bond Act in 1990 to provide $100 million to start a revolving fund that would support state and local projects in solving flooding and pollution problems.
The fund would also support conservation and recreational use of waterways. The bill was never voted on.
"In the case of private lakes that needed some dam repairs," he said, "money for the project could be applied for jointly by the owners and municipalities and paid back through assessments charged to the owners by the towns over 20 to 30 years."
 
Seed Money for Schools
 Senator William L. Gormley of Margate said he hoped to get action on a bill he had been pushing for some time -- along with two fellow Republicans, John H. Ewing of Bedminster and Joseph A. Palaia of Ocean Township, and a Democrat, Matthew Feldman of Teaneck -- to create a fund to provide seed money for school construction.
"The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would provide about $400 million from tolls and lease payments at the World Trade Center to the state's Economic Development Authority," he said. "The toll revenue would have to be spent in the port district -- within a 25-mile radius -- but the revenue from leases could be spent anywhere, and this would provide the seed money to rehabilitate old schools or build new ones."
Mr. Gormley said the present situation, with the Legislature controlled by one party and the Governor belonging to the opposite party, offered a real opportunity for bipartisan cooperation on important initiatives like upgrading the state's aging stock of school buildings.

HEADLINE: 48,000 Motorists May Face Delay In Injury Awards

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
ON a Friday afternoon in July 1989, 16-year-old Jaclynn Pazur was a passenger in a Ford Thunderbird when the car collided with another vehicle in Sayreville. Ms. Pazur's injuries included a fractured pelvis, fractured vertebrae and knee injuries that required surgery.
She sued both drivers, who were insured by the state-run Joint Underwriting Association, and her case was settled last December for $155,000.
About a week later, on Dec. 18, the State Department of Insurance issued an order deferring for one year such payments for pain and suffering arising from bodily injuries. As a result, Ms. Pazur will not receive her settlement until, at best, December 1992. Under a 1990 law that dissolved the bankrupt Joint Underwriting Association, deferments could last up to four years. 
 The deferment decision is expected to affect as many as 48,000 residents across the state who were involved in accidents while insured by the J.U.A., said Brian Hirst, an Insurance Department spokesman. Included in that number are those whose accidents occurred while their J.U.A. policies were in effect but who have not yet filed claims or resolved their cases. Mr. Hirst said that as much as $480 million in claims could eventually be deferred under the order.
For some people, the payment delay has caused financial hardship. Ms. Pazur, for example, was planning to use part of her settlement money to enroll at Middlesex County College in Edison.
The deferment has also been attacked as unfair and possibly illegal. It was adopted without public hearings or advance notice.
In January, the New Jersey branch of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America sued the Insurance Department, demanding that the deferment order be set aside until public hearings can be held.
"This is unfair and it's chaotic," said Robert Levinson, president of the chapter. "The innocent victims of accidents are being told, 'You can't have your money for a year,' while it's business as usual for everyone else."
The lawyers themselves must also wait, since their fees are not paid until their clients are paid.
For accident victims insured under the J.U.A., the payment delay has also thrown a monkey wrench into the claims process, affecting decisions about whether they should accept settlement offers from the J.U.A. or go to trial. The year's delay in payment puts added pressure on the victims to settle quickly, some lawyers say, since the clock does not start ticking on the deferment until a settlement is reached.
The Joint Underwriting Association was created to provide automobile insurance for drivers whose driving records prevented them from obtaining insurance in the private market. Claims filed against the association were paid out of these drivers' insurance premiums with the help of special surcharges paid by drivers insured in the private market.
The J.U.A. insured about two million New Jersey motorists. Before it was dissolved by Gov. Jim Florio's Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, the association had amassed an anticipated deficit of about $3.3 billion in potential claims and other losses.
Under the reform act, the two million drivers insured through J.U.A. were transferred to a new entity, the Market Transition Facility, which is scheduled to go out of business at the end of September 1993. By that time, 90 percent of the drivers will have been shifted to private insurance, and the rest, those with the worst records for accidents and traffic violations, will be placed in an assigned-risk pool.
 
Trustee Appointed
 The reform act provided for the appointment of a trustee to oversee the dissolution of the J.U.A., and Marshall Selikoff, a retired State Superior Court judge, was named to the post.
His chief task is to pay pending claims and claims that arise from accidents between the passage of the act on Oct. 1, 1990, and the expiration of the last association-insured policies on Oct. 1, 1991. Those claims would be paid out of money raised through automobile registration surcharges and assessments levied against insurance companies, doctors and lawyers in the state.
The whole process will end as of Sept. 30, 1993, when the two-year statute of limitations has expired and no further J.U.A. claims can be filed.
Judge Selikoff's job, however, had its own limitations. He needed money to pay off the claims, and it was lacking. Officials estimated that by January 1992, just three months after the last policy expired, the J.U.A. would face $38.7 million in claims it could not pay.
So, Judge Selikoff said, he asked the Insurance Commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, to issue the order deferring payments for pain and suffering arising from bodily injury claims, for a period of one year.
"The statute provides that we have the authority to defer claims for a period of up to four years," Judge Selikoff said in an interview, "but we don't want to do that."
He said it was too early to estimate the number of people currently affected by the deferment.
 
State Paying Interest
 The payment delay does not apply to medical expenses and economic losses, like lost wages or property damage, and the state is paying 6 percent interest on the deferred claims. Mr. Fortunato calls that "a fairly generous rate of interest in today's market."
It is not an argument that offers much consolation to people like Ms. Pazur, who said she felt that the Insurance Commissioner was insensitive to those in her position.
"He doesn't know what it's like to be in pain and suffering," she said. "If he were in my shoes, I'm sure he'd feel the same way."
The deferral order includes a hardship provision that can lead to immediate payment of at least a portion of a claim. For example, Mr. Fortunato said, a claimant may be entitled to an exemption from the payment delay if he or she can prove medical expenses in excess of $5,000 that are unrelated to the motor vehicle accident and are not covered by insurance.
The size of the exemption payment cannot, however, exceed the amount required to meet the financial emergency.
 
A $250,000 Settlement
 Richard I. Goldstein, a Pleasantville lawyer, has a client who was injured in a 1989 automobile accident and was covered by her parents' automobile insurance policy. Her case against the J.U.A. was settled for $250,000 several days before the day the deferral order was issued.
"Her parents had a good policy of insurance," Mr. Goldstein said. Then, he said, "the state turns around and says: 'We don't care what your contract was; you're not getting any money for a year.' "
"As an attorney," Mr. Goldstein said, "you have to consider whether you want to settle a case today or wait and let it go to trial." Time, he said, is typically used as a bargaining chip by both sides in the give-and-take of insurance settlement talks, and an injured party might accept a lower settlement if the amount is paid immediately.
The yearlong deferment of payment, he said, distorts that strategy in favor of the insurance company because the year begins to run only after a settlement has been reached or a judgment has been entered.
 
'You Better Settle Now'
 "They're basically saying that if you want to get your name on the list, you better settle now," Mr. Goldstein said. "People are basically being coerced to settle for less than they're entitled to."
Moreover, Mr. Goldstein fears that the payment delay may be extended beyond a year. "The big question," he said, "is, If they don't have the money now, and they're operating at a deficit, where do they expect to get the money a year from now?"
Mr. Fortunato thinks one year will be enough. "The J.U.A. has a closed book of business," he said. "No further exposure is being added. But it doesn't have a closed income stream." He was referring to the infusion of surcharges and assessments that will continue until 1997.
The Insurance Commissioner had harsh words for the J.U.A. "The J.U.A. was the most inefficient operation of its type in the United States," he said. "Once the cash dried up and no further premiums were coming in, the claims outstripped the income."
 
Reason for Lack of Notice
 Responding to complaints that the deferral order was issued without public hearing or prior notice, Mr. Fortunato said that "equity and fairness" had guided that decision.
"If we gave advance notice that we were going to put in a deferral," he said, "there was a danger that people would rush and get into settlements for figures lower than they might normally settle for. We have a public responsibility to protect the people who have claims against the J.U.A. I'm not saying that the attorneys don't protect them. They do."
Mr. Fortunato said his decision had caused "the least interruption of the settlement process."
Some lawyers disagree with that reasoning.
Marc Rogoff, the Woodbridge lawyer who represented Ms. Pazur in her accident case, said that had he known his client would have to wait a year for her settlement, he would not have been inclined to lower his settlement target. He said he might have recommended that the case go to trial. "There's not a chance I would have settled for less," he said.
Meanwhile, Ms. Pazur waits for her payment. Before the accident, she had played on the soccer team at Woodbridge High School, but now can no longer engage in sports and still experiences pain as a result of her injuries.
"I don't come from a wealthy background," Ms. Pazur said. "I was going to use the money to make something of myself."

HEADLINE: New Rochelle Protesters Demand Cut In School Tax

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
MORE THAN 400 frustrated taxpayers jammed into the grand ballroom of the Greentree Country Club last Tuesday night to denounce a 14.4 percent increase in this city's school property tax and to demand that the next school budget reflect a "return to fiscal sanity."
The predominantly middle-aged and middle-class audience listened attentively for two hours as leaders of the New Rochelle Citizens for Reduced Taxes, the ad hoc group that sponsored the meeting, criticized the New Rochelle Board of Education for levying the highest school tax in city history. The group also introduced its own school board candidates. 
 "We've never seen such a huge increase," said Anthony F. Sutton, a real estate broker and co-founder of the group. "What really upsets us is that it has happened during the recession." Other levels of government, he said, have been able to limit tax increases during these bleak economic times.
Leaders of the group argue that school administrative expenses can be reduced and that programs can be streamlined. But as its first priority, it is demanding that there be no additional tax increases "unless and until the citizens of New Rochelle have the right to vote on the new budget."
 
Joining a Growing Statewide Movement
 New Rochelle residents, like those in 56 other small cities around the state but unlike those in smaller municipalities, are prevented by state law from voting on school budgets. The ad hoc group here has joined a growing statewide movement that is urging legislators to change the law, in the belief that voting on school budgets gives taxpayers financial control and makes their elected school board members more accountable.
School officials and school board members disagree. Allowing cities to hold school-budget referendums, as outlined in legislation pending in Albany, would do little to control school finances, they say, because the problem must be solved at the state level, where budget items are mandated but where state aid to local districts is steadily reduced.
New Rochelle school officials say that state mandates will continue to determine budget priorities. Winning the right to vote on their school budget "may be a disappointment" for city residents, said Dr. Richard C. Schilling, assistant superintendent for business for the New Rochelle Schools. "All but 4 percent of our budget consists of mandated costs."
Paying those costs despite a loss last year of $5.1 million in state aid has caused the New Rochelle schools to rely more heavily on property taxes, Dr. Schilling said.
This has, in turn, increased the financial pressure on private homeowners because the city has lost $20 million in the value of assessed property in the last three years, Dr. Schilling said, as downtown businesses deteriorated or closed down. "School taxes went up 14.4 percent, but our budget has only increased 1.3 percent," he said.
 
'Other Industries Are Giving Back'
 "That's baloney," said Lee Rearigh, president of the WestchesterTaxpayers' Alliance. The alliance is based in Rye and was formed last year to fight tax increases at all levels of government. "Other industries are giving back like crazy," he said. "They simply have to stop giving teachers increases, and citizens have to have the right to say that at the polls."
It's a no-win situation, said Liz Jaffe, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association. "If you vote down a budget, and the school district goes on austerity, you still must honor all contracts and heat all buildings," she said. "What will get cut is transportation, intramural sports, extracurricular activities and library books."
Something has to give, Mr. Sutton, the group's co-founder, said in an interview last week. Tax increases are hurting home sales, he said, despite the insistence by school officials that "we have to have quality schools to draw people."
"We are not drawing people," Mr. Sutton said, "because of the high taxes."
School taxes in New Rochelle have increased almost 70 percent in seven years, said the new tax group's other founder, Hank Tanner, a self-employed businessman. In the last year, the average homeowner, with a home assessed at $20,000, paid an additional $400 in school taxes, Mr. Tanner said.
 
Five Social Security Checks
 "One woman called me to say she now takes five of her Social Security checks to pay school taxes," Mr. Tanner said. "Another is walking around her home in a bathrobe with a coat over it because she can't turn up the heat."
A way must be found to hold school board officials accountable to the public, he said, and gaining the right to vote on their budgets would make a difference for small-city residents in view of recent changes giving school boards more authority. Seven years ago, voters across the state agreed to eliminate the 2 percent taxing limit that had been imposed on small-city school districts. Many of those districts had complained that the state-imposed limit prevented them from obtaining enough property tax funds to pay for school needs.
Voters approved the constitutional amendment, but now many of those involved in the protests say they feel betrayed because Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had promised to introduce a bill giving residents of small cities the right to vote on school budgets if the proposition was approved.
"We have been submitting bills ever since," said Terry Lynam, a spokesman for the Governor. He said the measure had been opposed in the State Legislature by a coalition representing school boards and teachers unions. The bill has a better chance of passing during this session, Mr. Lynam said, because of growing pressure on legislators by taxpayers.
 
Growing Pressure on Property Taxes
 Although voter approval of the constitutional amendment set no maximum spending limits, the small-city school districts at first used their new powers conservatively. But increased costs and declining revenues have caused growing pressure on property taxes, prompting the growing statewide movement for repeal of the amendment.
Last summer, these school districts experienced the full impact of the state's fiscal crunch when a new deficit-reduction formula took effect. The loss in revenue affected some districts more severely than others; New Rochelle was especially hard hit and lost 46 percent of its state aid.
"Governor Cuomo said only 3 percent would be lost from any one school district, but some of our districts lost as much as 70 percent of their state aid," Ms. Jaffe said. Regional costs were never considered under the formula, Ms. Jaffe added. "It costs more to do business here."
Lorraine Werblow, a former member of the New Rochelle Board of Education, agreed last week that the Citizens for Reduced Taxes "had touched a nerve" in the city. "They are not that aware of the effect on New Rochelle of the loss of state aid or that they must be taxed directly because of it," she said. "It's healthy for people to object. There has to be a meeting of the minds."
Mrs. Werblow is co-chairwoman of the New Rochelle League of Women Voters, which is about to begin a study of ways to finance public education. It hopes other small cities will join in the study, she said. "We don't have any answers," she added. "But there must be a better solution than property taxes."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
The Rare Trades of Alpine Capital

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
There are some ideas that are simply catnip to the public. The Catholic Income Trust was just such a gimmick. This whimsical mutual fund was set up in 1989 by Alpine Capital Management in Denver, which already managed two other mutual funds. The new fund invested in the obscure and rarely traded bonds issued by Catholic institutions like colleges and hospitals. What could be more adorable?
But the predictable spate of stories didn't attract enough investors to keep body and soul together at Catholic Income. Its assets never totaled much more than $4.3 million, and fees ate up about 5.75 percent of each dollar investors chipped in. Last April, the Catholic Income Trust was quietly buried by Alpine and the estate was divided among its shareholders -- at $9 a share, a dollar less than its initial net asset value, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund service in Chicago. 
 Now, Alpine's two other mutual funds, the California Municipal Asset Trust and the National Municipal Asset Trust, are in the process of being liquidated. But this time, the Securities and Exchange Commission is presiding at the funeral -- after lodging a civil complaint against Alpine and the funds, which invested almost exclusively in municipal leases.
A taste for obscure and rarely traded assets, it turns out, is not always just a cute gimmick; sometimes, it is a fatal flaw.
As is customary in S.E.C. civil cases, Alpine Capital Management (which is not related to the finance group run by Oded Aboodi, the Time Warner adviser) did not admit any wrongdoing. But it agreed to the filing in December of a court order permanently barring the firm from violating securities laws in the future.
Both Edwin J. Pittock, Alpine's chief executive, and John I. Dickerson, its chief investment officer, were out of the office last week and staff members said they could not be reached. Questions about the fate of the firm's mutual funds were referred to Tom Waymire, who said he was a consultant hired by Alpine to handle the fund liquidations.
Mr. Waymire described the funds' experience with the S.E.C. as "quite cordial." The regulators' complaint, he said, was merely a technical device that permitted the S.E.C. to seek a court-appointed receiver. He said that Alpine had decided on its own to liquidate the two muni funds "as a purely economic decision," but found that their assets were taking longer than anticipated to sell.
And no wonder. Municipal lease obligations arise when property or equipment is leased to a town or other governmental unit; the future lease payments are supposed to produce the income stream for the lease investors. These instruments have become something of a fad among mutual funds because, like junk bonds in years past, they carry above-average interest rates and thus help boost a fund's advertised yield. That, in turn, can attract new investors.
But muni leases carry a higher coupon for a reason: They're riskier, because there is no ready market for them. "I wouldn't say they were 'illiquid,' because I think of that as something that cannot be sold," Mr. Waymire said. "But it just takes a while for somebody to buy them."
Well, it takes longer than a week, anyway. Especially if the leases are in default, as about 10 percent of these were. Thus, the funds were unable to honor their statutory obligation to redeem investors' shares within seven days, he explained.
"It wasn't that the funds did anything wrong," Mr. Waymire said. "The problem is that the S.E.C. does not have a way that they could have just allowed us to suspend redemptions while we continued with our asset sales. They don't have any middle ground, other than to enforce the seven-day rule. So they had to come up with something to permit them to appoint a receiver," he continued. "These were technical things. We're not mad at anybody," he added. 'And we don't think the S.E.C. is mad at anybody."
The S.E.C. officials in Denver, who handled the case, will say no more than they said on Nov. 20, when they went to their local United States District Court to ask that the funds' assets be frozen and a receiver be appointed to oversee the liquidation. But what the regulators said then seems to go a bit beyond "technical" violations.
They complained, for example, that Alpine and the funds were violating some basic provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including the seven-day rule. The board of trustees overseeing the funds did not have the required number of independent members, the S.E.C. charged, and net asset values were not accurately calculated. The regulators further complained that the funds had taken out improper loans, had sold fund assets to an affiliate, and had kept inadequate financial and shareholder records.
A receiver has been appointed to try to sell the municipal leases, but no one can predict how long that process will take or how much money it will raise. Court documents showed that, as of Nov. 14, National Municipal Asset Trust had just $1.9 million in assets, down from $6.8 million on July 31, while the larger California trust had $17 million, down from $27.7 million just a month earlier.
Until this fire sale is completed, of course, shareholders cannot redeem their shares or estimate how much they will eventually get. But their predicament illustrates a paradox that worries a number of mutual fund regulators: People would never dream of sinking all their money into an exotic or risky investment; but they will not hesitate to put their money into a mutual fund that sinks all of its money into those same exotic instruments.
But Catholic diocesan debt that is difficult for an individual to price accurately may be no easier to evaluate when a fund owns it. And defaulted municipal leases, which a cash-strapped individual would find very difficult to sell in an emergency, are not any easier to unload just because the distressed seller is a mutual fund.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Banking Crisis Moves To Europe

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Just when Wall Street had concluded the worst was over for the banks, the rumblings of crisis have begun to arrive from Europe. If the good news for American banks is that the recession has exposed this continent's bad credits, the bad news may be that the process is just getting under way in Europe, where economies are weakening.
Last week, the European financial press was filled with stories of various bank problems. Christiana Bank, Norway's second largest, announced a huge loss and will need another capital infusion. Swedish banks saw their losses mounting and in Spain the central bank had to step in to salvage Banco Ibercorp. The Scandinavian problems appear to be bad loans exacerbated by falling real estate prices. The Spanish losses seem to have resulted more from freewheeling trading gone wrong, with the possibility of an overlay of political scandal. 
 Then, in Canada, rumors flew about Olympia & York, the big real estate company whose pioneering Canary Wharf development in London has turned into a money pit. Olympia & York is selling assets and says there is no danger it will default on its loans. But banks with exposure to Olympia & York, among them J.P. Morgan and Citicorp, saw their share prices slip.
For better or worse, the growing problems in European banks come at a time when world financial integration is more complete than ever before. The distinctions between various financial institutions has blurred, and they all trade innovative financial products with one another. Banks and industrial companies can place huge bets on such things as interest rates and currencies in all kinds of markets, and the existence of those bets may or may not show up on financial statements.
The result, regulators say nervously, is that they don't know what is going on. In an extraordinaary speech in London last week, Alexandre Lamfalussy, the industrial world's top central banker, talked of "a greater fragility of our payment and financial systems" and said globalization and financial innovations may have created "fertile ground for full-blown crises."
Mr. Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, known as the central banks' central bank, questioned whether anyone can calculate the risks involved in the current system. "The hard fact is that the resilience of our new financial environment has not yet been tested by a genuine worldwide recession," he said.
That test won't come if the American recovery proceeds, but at the moment the stock market's confidence in that is starting to slip. The Dow Jones industrial average fell to a seven-week low as the February employment report was weaker than expected. Cyclical stocks are no longer the stars of the market.
It still seems probable that the American economy has bottomed and is starting to recover. But it would be easier to say that with confidence if the news from Europe were better.

HEADLINE: Stealing Toward Russian Capitalism

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
Olga Romanova, a middle-aged woman in a babushka, painstakingly stamps out small copper parts for garden tools on a giant, inefficient metal press on the main floor of the state-owned Electropribor factory here. But instead of working for the factory, Ms. Romanova is working for one of the factory's senior executives, who has become an entrepreneur on the side. In effect, he rents machinery and floor space from himself and operates a profitable private business within a state factory.
The arrangement is typical of the creeping privatization in the old Soviet Union, a spontaneous process that is steadily shifting public property to private use, mostly as a result of the ingenuity, energy and adroitness of people like Ms. Romanova's boss, Viktor Todoryk. Nowhere else in the former Communist Bloc nations is privatization proceeding more rapidly today, or with less respect for master plans devised by economists and government officials. 
 "You can make the argument that the economic situation is so bad that the fastest way to save the Commonwealth is to give the assets to the managers, or to managers and workers, and let them get busy," said William Hogan, an expert on Ukraine at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "It may be a form of robber baronry and a good idea, both at the same time."
That is one view, widely held. Boris Pinsker, a Russian economist, offers another, also widely held. "It is as if your President Bush set up a dummy company that leased the ground floor of the White House for $50 a month, charged tourists $100 a month and kept the profit," Mr. Pinsker said.
Despite the debate, managers of thousands of state enterprises, often acting in defiance of government rules, are using various strategies, among them Mr. Todoryk's, to gradually convert their companies into independent corporations, with themselves in control, much like chief executives in the United States control corporations owned by shareholders.
They are particularly active in Ukraine, whose capital is Kiev, and in Russia, the two most populous and industrialized republics. But they run the risk of having their enterprises canceled by government ministers increasingly irritated that insiders might be stealing state companies.
"One way to deal with this is to limit the activities of state enterprises so that managers no longer have so much power," said Dimitri V. Vasilyev, deputy chairman of Russia's Privatization Committee.
 
The Buccaneer Spirit
 But right now they do have the power, and examples of their buccaneer spirit are sprinkled through the Commonwealth of Independent States. The managers of a Russian aircraft company formed a private joint venture company with a British partner and gave the new air cargo operation control over four state-owned planes. The partners are flying cargo worldwide. The president of a consumer products company in Kiev with 5,000 workers leases the company from the state and is now angling to buy it for a token price. And the top executives of the Vaz Auto Works, the General Motors of Russia, are organizing a joint stock company that would give them long-term control.
Mr. Todoryk, who is 30, is typical of the new managers. He is not some outsider, but a senior engineer at Electropribor, and he has responsibility for the state factory's regular products -- small motors, electric water pumps, gauges and machinery parts. But clearly Mr. Todoryk's enthusiasm has veered toward his own endeavors, the latest a wooden-handled garden tool that can be used as a hoe, a shovel and a weeding rake. "People who have country dachas have told me that they need a tool like this for their summer vegetable gardens," he said.
The garden tool operation, which he claims is making a profit of 20,000 rubles a month on revenues of more than 75,000 rubles, is not the only venture of Mr. Todoryk, an intense workaholic whose worn gray suit, seedy by American standards, masks the catalytic role that he and other managers like him are playing in this early stage of the Commonwealth's capitalism. Most are men in their 30's and early 40's who were working their way up the old hierarchy of centrally controlled companies when that system began to collapse in the late 1980's.
Under the influence of Perestroika back then, Mr. Todoryk talked his older bosses into transforming Electropribor's trade division into a separate company that now sells the factory's products abroad, collecting fees for the service. Another venture, initiated by one of Mr. Todoryk's fellow managers, leases and runs the company cafeteria for the 2,000 employees. Yet another venture assembles electric heaters for export, using parts supplied by a foreign partner. And there are a dozen more examples -- all of them profitable in Mr. Todoryk's eyes, although his definition of profitability wouldn't pass muster with an American accounting firm.
Now, Mr. Todoryk and a few colleagues say they are preparing the next step -- setting up a shareholder's corporation that would purchase Electropribor itself at a nominal price. As Mr. Todoryk described the plan, a big chunk of the capital for the purchase would come from the ventures that feed off the company.
Initially, the Ukrainian Government, as Electropribor's current owner, would have a 30 percent stake, perhaps to be sold later. The managers would have the right to purchase about 5 percent, and the the workers would also be offered shares.
Managers like Mr. Todoryk are counting on the workers to be passive shareholders, accepting management's strategies. Many, like Ms. Romanova, have benefited from Mr. Todoryk's ventures, moonlighting in them and often adding 500 rubles to their monthly wage of about 1,000 rubles. So they might agree to such leadership.
"Electropribor, as a state company, already belongs to all of us," Mr. Todoryk said, by way of justification. "If the state were to auction the company to the highest bidder, then we, the true owners, won't have the wealth to buy at the auction."
 
An Irreversible Tide?
 But the Russian and Ukrainian Governments, like Mr. Pinsker, the Moscow economist, generally don't recognize such a claim on ownership. Nor do various Eastern European countries deeply involved in converting state enterprises into private ones. Having stifled creeping privatization early, Poland, and to a lesser extent, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are trying to sell control of state companies through government-sponsored programs, with workers and other nationals receiving shares either free or at low cost.
The result is that privatization in Eastern Europe is proceeding at a snail's pace. Acceptable buyers are in short supply, said Simon Johnson, an economist at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and a frequent traveler to Ukraine, where he runs a study of managers of state enterprises. "I don't think that the Ukrainian and Russian governments will be able to stop the spontaneous privatization now in progress," Mr. Johnson said. "Government is weaker here than in Poland and Hungary."
But the governments are trying. Both are in the process of enacting roughly similar privatization programs. Small enterprises, retail stores, restaurants and the like are to be sold at auction or directly to the managers and workers who run them. Large companies -- 5,000 or so in Russia and a smaller number in Ukraine, according to government estimates -- would be turned into corporations with the Government as the majority shareholder.
Top managers would be offered 5 percent of the shares and workers an additional 25 percent, either free or at book value. But book value -- the original cost of a factory and equipment, less depreciation for wear and tear -- might be next to nothing.
This approach gives government, rather than management, control of an enterprise. And eventually, the government's majority stake would be sold at free-market prices to investors. Only certain key industries, among them oil, would remain under government control into the 90's, said Mr. Vasilyev of the Russian Privatization Committee.
And what of the companies that are slipping away through creeping privatization? Would Mr. Todoryk have to give up his garden tool operation, although his type of leasing activity was authorized during Perestroika to encourage economic activity?
"That is a very difficult question," Mr. Vasilyev said. "We would limit such activities in the future, but I am not a supporter of forbidding things."
Bogdan Budzan, chief of the privatization process for the Ukrainian Government, is not so hesitant. "We will bring such people to trial and through the courts reverse this de facto privatization," he said.
 
A Fight for Autonomy

Threats of trials and lawsuits aside, privatization proceeds, even at the Vaz Auto Works in Togliatti, 700 miles east of Moscow, a giant state company that makes 700,000 of the 1.2 million cars produced in the Commonwealth.
Nikolai Glushkov, Vaz's vice general director, does not want to exclude the Government from ownership. Instead, he is fighting for management's right to run the company without being second-guessed, whoever the future owners turn out to be.
"It is very essential that management has the power to run the company, or we will have 24-hour-a-day meetings of workers and bureaucrats trying to tell us what to do," said Mr. Glushkov, a 42-year-old former physicist and English teacher. Like managers throughout the commonwealth, Mr. Glushkov and his colleagues stepped in to fill the vacuum created by the collapse of the central system that controlled companies.
"Management, in a sense, has become the owner of Vaz," Mr. Glushkov said. "We are highly underpaid, but we run the company as if we owned it, although we don't really."
A soon-to-be-organized holding company is to own Vaz's various divisions, with the Government as a major shareholder, a provision no one disputes. Other shareholders will include Vaz's 150 top executives, who will be permitted to purchase 5 percent of the stock. The plant's more than 200,000 workers will get up to 25 percent. Both management and workers will receive their stock either free or at nominal prices.
The trouble spot? A challenge by Government to Vaz management's attempt to be, as Mr. Glushkov puts it, the trustees for all the shareholders. Alexander Kovrigin, an official in Russia's Ministry of Autos, clearly aspires to have a voice in Vaz's operations, as well as in those of other auto companies and suppliers.
 
Foreign Capital
 On the other hand, joint ventures -- partnerships combining Russians and foreigners -- are more buffered from government, partly because they have been the chief means so far of attracting foreign investment. Typically, they have served as another vehicle for transferring state-owned property to private hands.
One Russian-British venture flies cargo all over the world with four Russian An-124 planes, returning dollar revenue to the partners: Heavylift Cargo Airlines of Britain and Volga Dnepr, a new company formed by executives in Russia's state-owned aircraft industry. The shareholders are state-owned airframe and engine manufacturing companies.
The British investment in this joint venture, formed last October, is nothing more than expertise -- Heavylift's marketing skills. It drums up clients, schedules cargo flights and collects tens of thousands of dollars in fees. The Russian investment is millions of dollars worth of aircraft and the crews to fly them.
What complicates the venture -- and illustrates the potential pitfalls for foreign investors -- is the cloudy issue of who owns the airplanes. Two of the An-124's are carried on the joint venture's books as owned by the Russian military and leased to the Russian partners in the joint venture, who in turn lease the planes to the joint venture -- all for fees that are not made public. Two other planes are carried as contributions from the Russian partners, which made them.
That raises two questions. First, are the Russians getting an adequate return for their investment, or should they do the marketing themselves and keep all the revenue? Second, what happens in the unlikely event that the Russian Government insists on withdrawing the planes?
The Russians might, in fact, decide that they can handle their own marketing in the future, in which case the joint venture might dissolve, said Bruce Buck, a partner in Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher and Flom, the New York law firm that helped negotiate the deal and drew up the joint venture contract.
As to the second question, Mr. Buck doubts the Russian Government will renege, although the aircraft makers gave up public property. "It is difficult to apply our Western ideas to Russia's ownership concepts," he said.
Not only are the Russians struggling with shifting concepts of ownership in a post-communist world bent on adopting capitalism, but they also are vying to determine who will be in control. The issues appear to be far from resolved.
"The dangers are that the managers will be denied control, but no one else will get it," said Mr. Johnson, the Duke economist. "Or the workers will get control and mess things up, or the managers will get control and have no outside pressure to make them perform and stay honest."
 
 
 
A DAUNTING PRICE FOR SERVICES
 Many big industrial companies in the former Soviet Union provide their workers with housing, nurseries, schools and clinics. As privatization proceeds, no one is rushing to buy these costly items or even to maintain them.
Until central planning and government subsidies collapsed -- and making a profit became a goal -- managers of state-owned companies spoke with pride of the amenities that went with the job. They still speak this way, but a new, contradictory view is also emerging.
The Varegan Oil and Gas Company, which pumps 160,000 barrels of oil a day in Western Siberia, provides social services to its 60,000 workers, who live mostly in Raduzhny, a company town. "I have to take care of the people of Raduzhny," said Anatoly Sivak, director general of Varegan and Raduzhny's former mayor.
But having recently resigned as mayor, he is negotiating with the city to assume the social functions now financed by Varegan, with the city presumably levying taxes to foot the bills. "We cannot drop people," Mr. Sivak said, "But I want to keep under my authority only what the company needs to be profitable. We are moving toward the U.S. model."
So is the Vaz Auto Works, which provides many services for more than 200,000 workers. Vaz's managers speak of shifting these services to government.
More immediately, Fiat is considering an investment in Vaz, and as part of the proposed deal Vaz would spin off the social services into a separate division. The goal would be to insulate the return on Fiat's investment from the costs of hospitals, schools, nurseries and housing.

Talk About a Slogan for the Back-to-Basics 90's: Electrify!

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
All over the United States, utilities are diving into the technology of conservation, helping consumers install new light bulbs, electric motors and heating and cooling systems designed to use less electricity. The current thinking is that the nation should do the same work with less power, to allow generating stations that burn coal to be closed. These plants emit the ingredients of acid rain and also a high level of carbon dioxide, the single largest cause of the greenhouse effect.
But according to a contrarian school, this approach is backward. If pollution or the greenhouse effect is really the problem, according to the counter-theory, there is a technical fix at hand. It is to use as much electricity as possible. 
 How can burning more coal, oil and gas in power plants help the environment? According to Mark P. Mills, a long-time energy consultant, some technologies can perform work better with electricity than with other fuels. The idea has been around for a few years, but Mr. Mills has refined it and given it a name: ecowatts.
Ecowatts, he said, means using electricity instead of another fuel and gaining benefits for the global environment, often as a side effect of gains in convenience or economy or perhaps in alleviating local pollution. He points to lawn mowers.
In southern California, air pollution officials have instituted strict rules on lawn mower emissions. According to Mr. Mills, to meet the rules mowers will come to resemble cars, with electronic fuel injection and catalytic converters. That, he said, means the debut of the $650 lawn mower, and prices that high will just turn the state into a magnet for all the nation's used mowers, defeating the regulation. The answer, he said, is electric mowers, a technology that is hardly new but, he said, is underappreciated.
By Mr. Mills's calculation, the standard gasoline mower, at three horsepower, burns a quart in two hours. But the same job could be done with 2.2 kilowatt-hours of electricity. (A typical home uses about 20 kilowatt-hours a day.)
Burning the gasoline releases 36,800 B.T.U.'s of heat, by Mr. Mills's calculation, taking into account the energy that was used to refine the gasoline. The electricity created 24,400 B.T.U.'s, for an increase in efficiency of about one-third.
The savings in carbon dioxide emissions depends on the fuel used to make the electricity. If the fuel that was saved by retiring the mower -- in this case gasoline -- was used to make the electricity, then some of the oil used to make that gasoline would be left over, and total savings in carbon dioxide would be 2.1 pounds. If the kilowatts were the national average, made from nuclear power, natural gas, hydroelectricity, coal and oil, the savings would be 2.5 pounds, he said.
The impetus for the homeowner to switch to an electric mower would not, of course, be carbon dioxide, but rules like those in California that aim to limit conventional pollutants, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide. The power plant would also pollute, of course, but less.
Electrification has planet-wide potential. Chauncey Starr, an energy expert and philosopher, is fond of telling audiences that cooking dinner over an open fire, as is often done in the third world, is only 2 percent efficient. If the same wood were burned in a boiler to make electricity, it would cook 10 or 15 dinners. Dr. Starr, who founded the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., uses the example to describe a strategy against deforestation, but it is obviously important as a greenhouse control strategy too.
All of this is music to the electric-utility industry, which, with its prominent smokestacks, has become the whipping boy for greenhouse activists. In addition, while fuel use for transportation, heating, industry and other purposes has been roughly unchanged since 1973, the year of the first oil embargo, fuel use for electric utilities has been galloping ahead. Of all the fuel used in this country, about 36 percent is converted to electricity before it is used, and by the end of the decade this figure will approach 40 percent. Transportation is a distant second, at 27 percent.
Outside experts generally agree Mr. Mills's examples are correct, although they often doubt his bottom line. But trivial as the lawn mower example may sound, the United States has about 84 million mowers.
And many other electric technologies have great potential. Mr. Mills points out that the economy now produces far fewer pounds of carbon dioxide per dollar of gross national product. He credits electrification. For example, he cites gains from the electrification of steel, paint drying, glass production and a dozen other technologies, including document shipping, which these days often means a fax machine instead of Federal Express.
Beyond convenience, he says, there could be another major incentive for switching to electric technologies: money. The lawn mower is a good example; nobody likes dragging a cord around and few people buy electric mowers. But over a seven-year lifetime, Mr. Mills says, using an electric lawn mower will cut carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other pollutants by an amount that has a dollar value. If the user could capture that value, said Mr. Mills, electric mowers would become far more tempting.
Some technologies not in the marketplace yet and unlikely to make their entry primarily to save carbon dioxide would still achieve that goal, he said. These include the following:
* Stabilizing toxic wastes. Instead of digging up contaminated soil and hauling it to a lined dump with a water collection system, put electrodes into the soil and zap it with so much power that the soil turns to glass, immobilizing the chemicals. That would cut energy use 20 percent.
* "Flying" between cities by train. Compared with an airplane, a magnetic-levitation train moving at more than 300 miles per hour would use 76 percent less energy per passenger mile, Mr. Mills calculates.
* Driving electric cars. A nine-mile trip would save 2.4 to 3.3 pounds of carbon dioxide, depending, once again, on whether the power plant used the oil that was saved from the car or the national average fuel mix.
According to Mr. Mills, electrification thus far is the major factor in improving the ratio of G.N.P to carbon dioxide, from 4 pounds per dollar in 1973 to about 2.3 pounds per dollar today. He recognizes two "structural changes" in the economy that helped the trend along: the construction since 1973 of a nuclear industry that provides about 20 percent of the nation's electricity without carbon dioxide production and the increase in auto fuel efficiency, with cars going 50 percent further on a gallon, on average. But those together account for only about 22 percent of the improvement, he said.
Charles Komanoff, a utility expert and consultant in New York, described the ecowatts premise as "credible." But other factors muddy the waters, he said.
One reason the American economy is 30 percent more energy efficient now than it was two decades ago is that lights and refrigerators do the same work with less power, Mr. Komanoff said. This is not electrical technologies substituting for technologies that use natural gas or coal; it is new electric refrigerators substituting for old electric refrigerators.
And there are always innovations using other fuels. The Gas Research Institute, for example, will soon test a new glass melter, powered by natural gas, that is expected to be 20 percent more efficient than conventional gas furnaces and 40 percent cheaper than a conventional electric furnace.
There are other factors. Steel making has largely moved abroad, so the carbon dioxide accrues to some other nation. And a bigger part of the mix in the American economy are goods and services that require less energy to make and did not exist a few years ago, like computer software.

HEADLINE: All About/The 'Little Four' Auto Exporters;
Detroit's Not-So-Obvious Rivals

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Last month, while Detroit's Big Three were trading jabs with Japan's largest auto makers, the Daihatsu Motor Company quietly announced that it would stop selling its Charade subcompact and Rocky sport-utility vehicle in the American market.
That announcement, coming from one of Japan's smaller automobile exporters, caused only the faintest of ripples in the American auto industry. After all, Daihatsu held only the tiniest share of the market -- 0.1 percent. Still, Daihatsu's retreat marked the first time a Japanese car company halted sales in the United States since Toyota temporarily pulled back more than 30 years ago. 
 But if Daihatsu was unable to crack the American market, what then are the prospects for other small-volume nameplates, like Japan's Suzuki, Isuzu and Subaru and South Korea's Hyundai?
So far, they appear to be faring well. All but Hyundai had sales declines last year that were less than the 11.2 percent sales drop for the total American auto market. And Suzuki was one of only six brands to have had sales gains in 1991. But analysts concede the low-end, niche markets are especially tough places to be.
Competitive market or not, the "Little Four" are committed to America. They all have built assembly plants in North America. And their sales record in a down year is impressive given their mission: selling lower-priced vehicles to customers easily turned away by a recession.
These companies are also targeting customers who face a dizzying array of choices. Though Daihatsu will stop distributing its cars in five months, Kia Motors of South Korea said in January it planned to start selling a lineup of utility vehicles next year. "They're a brave organization," said Thomas Dukes, director of competitive assessment for J. D. Power & Associates. "This market just gets tougher and tougher."

 
 
ECONOMY
 In the early 1980's, established Japanese importers handed over a sales opportunity to their smaller rivals. In response to import quotas set by Washington, auto makers such as Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Toyota started building pricier, more profitable cars, vacating the lowest-priced segment. Companies like Hyundai and Suzuki charged in, capitalizing on price-conscious consumers.
When the automobile industry grew briskly in the late 1980's, there was room for everyone. Besides, profits were too small to be of much interest to the biggest auto makers. But as sales have turned down, auto makers in every price category have been scrambling.
The Big Three, for example, have fine-tuned their pricing strategies to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. They have done this, in part, by offering low-cost leases.
For example, Oldsmobile began selling its new import fighter this year, the Achieva, with an unusually inexpensive new-model lease special of $199 a month, no money down, for four years. One leasing consultant estimated the incentive costs Oldsmobile as much as $2,200 per car.
"When big players are that aggressive, they can squeeze the small players out," said Susan Jacobs, an automotive consultant based in Little Falls, N.J. As a result, "the time for easy entry has passed," she said.

 
 
How to Stand Out
Four Doors When Others Offer Two
 Despite the challenge of introducing a new car line in the United States, analysts note that there is always room for vehicles that capture the public's imagination. That was part of Daihatsu's problem, analysts say. Though uniformly praised for quality and reliability, Daihatsu's entrants did not stand out. According to Ms. Jacobs, even the lowest-priced models must do more than simply match the competition in order to sell.
Indeed, the most successful start-ups can be traced to an auto maker's ability to spot a niche and fill it quickly. Isuzu was the first to offer an inexpensive four-door imported sport-utility vehicle with its 1984 Trooper model. They have sold briskly ever since, giving Isuzu 0.2 percent of the market last year. While that's not much market share compared with Detroit's, it's about average for the Little Four.
Suzuki began offering a compact sports utility vehicle in 1985 called the Samurai. Initially, this smartly styled vehicle sold well. But then Consumer Reports magazine, after testing the Samurai, deemed it unsafe in certain circumstances. Though other studies disputed these findings, sales dwindled. In 1991, Suzuki had just 0.1 percent of the market. Last year, it introduced a utility vehicle with four doors.
Subaru and Hyundai's offerings are more conventional. But both companies are trying to brighten their image. Subaru, which had 1.3 percent of the market in 1991, introduced its innovation-laden SVX sports car last year. It hopes to win buyers with gadgets like windshield wipers with a winter "park" position for easier snow removal. While design of the SVX is unorthodox, its technology has won trade-press plaudits. "A lot of people have a vision of us as very basic transportation," said Christopher B. Wackman, Subaru's vice president of marketing. "That's not necessarily true any longer."
Hyundai Motor America, the largest of the Little Four with 1.5 percent of the market, is also trying to energize its generic-design image with a striking two-seat sports car that it displayed at recent auto shows. Hyundai plans to introduce the car in 1995. Company officials say it is designed to compete with Mazda's Miata.
Korea's Kia plans to create a new niche with a rounded, compact, sport-utility vehicle that is distinct from the traditional boxy designs other companies offer.
Analysts say the smaller manufacturers are often nimbler than the larger companies and can often bring out new models more quickly. That gives them a big advantage. "Large companies frequently get muddled into community affairs and politics," said Thomas F. O'Grady, who heads Integrated Automotive Resources, a consulting firm in Wayne, Pa. "Sometimes the heads of companies get turned away completely from the company's goals."

 
 
Dealer Loyalties
Smaller Lines Are The First to Go
 Distinctive products are only part of a successful niche franchise; creative marketing and enthusiastic dealers are also key. The smaller importers generally trumpet their products' value and hope the decline of conspicuous consumption will make their products right for the times.
Some new advertisements by Subaru and Isuzu, for example, poke fun at consumers who search for status in their vehicles. The message must be effective, analysts said, but also must be repeated frequently to be heard.
How tough is building name recognition? After five years in the United States, Daihatsu was regularly confused with Hyundai by consumers because of the common "dai" in their names. "It is hard to break through," said C. R. Brown, executive vice president of Daihatsu America Inc.
The smaller imports are also typically added on to an existing dealer's franchise to complement the core model lines. But when overlap occurs, the add-on is the first to go. One dealer who sold Chevrolets and Geos in Phoenix, Ariz., dropped Daihatsu because its Rocky diluted sales of the Geo Tracker sport-utility vehicle.
"If it ever gets to the point that they're competing with the big boys, they're asking for trouble," said Dick E. Strauss, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. Mr. Strauss sells Fords in Richmond, Va., as well as Isuzus and Suzukis. "Unless they offer the buyer something that is not available to them in any other lines, they can't compete."
 
 
 
STUCK IN THE MINOR LEAGUE
 Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corporation was once among the smallest of the new Asian importers. After its first full year of sales starting in 1982, it sold just 30,000 vehicles with a little-remembered lineup of the Tredia, Starion and Cordia. It is now an auto maker in transition, trying to establish a larger presence in the United States.
Several key strategic decisions enabled it to grow quickly. From the start, it insisted on stand-alone showrooms rather than teaming up with other franchises. Dealers signed on with the promise that competing Mitsubishi franchises would be few and far between. Mitsubishi also bought the Value rental car agency to expose its products to the public and insure a good stock of used cars for dealers. It built a manufacturing plant with Chrysler in Normal, Ill., and set up its own financing company last year.
"Mitsubishi never acted like a little guy," said Thomas F. O'Grady, an automotive consultant based in Wayne, Pa.
Mitsubishi has also solidified its image in recent years with new offerings of technologically advanced, value-oriented cars, like the Diamante luxury sedan and the 3000GT sports coupe. With a $100 million advertising budget, it has gained name recognition.
But will it ever graduate to the first tier? Not with its present strategy, some analysts say. For example, the largest Japanese importers all have separate luxury divisions and economy divisions. These distinct brands give the auto makers more reach and marketing focus. By contrast, Mitsubishi showrooms house models that range from subcompact cars to the Diamante and Montero, luxury models with prices that range above $25,000.
"Just selling cars under its main badge is going to keep them in the second tier," said Susan Jacobs, an automotive consultant in Little Falls, N.J.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: William and Mary;
Raising Money For One's School Before Graduation

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va.

 BODY:
Students at the College of William and Mary are not waiting to become alumni before they start raising money for their college.
The college's Student Advancement Association, a 40-member group, has been working to help raise money for the Campaign for the Fourth Century, which is seeking $150 million in contributions by the time the college marks its 300th anniversary next year. The money would be used to finance scholarships, hire professors, make renovations and acquire museum art. 
 While alumni and development officials are expected to raise the bulk of the money, the student group has already begun to see results from its efforts.
 
$204,000 Endowment
 From a series of campaigns ranging from sponsoring bicycle races to auctioning William and Mary memorabilia at Christie's in New York City, the students have raised a $24,000 endowment for student scholarships, visiting professorships and library materials. A 1989 grant by an alumnus, who promised to match up to $25,000 raised by the students, continues to enrich the group's bank account.
The student association "was initiated by students to serve the needs of students," said John Graham, a senior who is the group's executive director. Although college officials say the Campaign for the Fourth Century addresses all areas of need at the university, "we wanted to make sure that student priorities were addressed," said Mr. Graham, a government major from Marion, Va.
This year, for example, the university fell about $800,000 short of its financial assistance goal, said the director of the university financial aid office, Edward Irish. In the fall, the student association awarded its first need-based scholarship of $450.
The association also serves as a "spirit club," Mr. Graham said. Its members have learned the words to the university's alma mater, a tune written in 1902, and the association initiated a course on the history of William and Mary University. The association sponsors concerts featuring student musicians and holds book sales to benefit the library as well.
 
Not Just Stuffing Envelopes
 At other universities and colleges, student fund-raising is limited to stuffing envelopes and telephoning alumni for contributions, said the president for university advancement, Edward Allenby, but William and Mary students also attend alumni functions and travel with development officers.
The program teaches students about business and communications, as well as "preparing students to be good alumni" themselves, Mr. Allenby said.
The association "really gives me a second education at William and Mary," said William Baxter, a senior from Richmond, who is majoring in government. That shadow curriculum, he said, is made up of public relations, finance and contacts with people in the business community.
"It puts you in touch with the real world," he added. "I'm finally getting a grip on how much money it takes to run the institution."
Although the association has asked local businesses that are patronized by students to become "friends of the college" for $250 donations, the students have raised only $500 this way. The group has also been researching foundations that give donations to universities and asking for pledges, but so far none have made donations.
"A lot of times you're too late," Mr. Graham said, noting that many businesses approached by the group have already allocated their philanthropy money to other organizations. "And sometimes they cannot give because of the economic conditions."
Despite the difficulties, Mr. Graham said, "It's exciting to know that you are helping other students while getting practical experience."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS: Jumping on Language, Prices and Such

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
THE mailbox overflows, so it's time again for a smattering of comment and query. But how to begin? Well. . . . 
 Dear Sir,
You used the term "jump-start" accurately in the recent column about your grandfather's old Chrysler, but I don't know if your usage was intended as a quiet protest or an effort to educate. Certainly, "jump-start" is one of this season's more widely misused terms.
My first letter on the subject was to the Times editor regarding an illustration accompanying an article on jump-starting New York City's economy. The illustration depicted a gaping automobile hood with snakelike booster cables in the foreground. Booster cables indeed!
I told the editor that it had been booster cables and not jump-starting that the writers in their ignorance had been thinking about. I concluded with my own thoughts about how the term may have derived, which was that the car hopped or jumped as one let in the clutch. My runner-up opinion was that when it was a solo operation, jumping on the running board was a key step in the process.
In any event, I never heard back from The Times. Apparently the editors didn't agree. I'd all but given up my quest as futile, but you've given me hope.
 
JOHN KOSTER
Wilton, Conn.
 
You're right that the term, which means use of the car's own momentum to turn the engine and thus start it, is oft applied in mistaken fashion. Part of the problem is that booster cables, used to connect a good battery to a bad one, have come to be known as "jumpers." And then there is the predominance of automatic transmissions and the difficulty, not to say impossibility, of jump-starting such a vehicle.
Your definitions sound likely, though, and they remind me of the time I tried to start my '51 Ford Victoria by rolling it down a hill in New London, Conn. I kept popping the clutch, all to no avail. When I got to the bottom, I discovered that the ignition was off. I think I should have begun by jump-starting my brain.

HEADLINE: We Must Restore Higher Tax on Top Incomes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Fake Fixes for the Economy" (editorial, Feb. 25), while assessing the tax proposals of Congress and the Administration, makes no alternative proposal. Last weekend, while doing calculations preparatory to filing my income tax, I came across some figures that I believe accurately reflect the problem of the middle class. 
 Assume that I had $50,000 of taxable income in 1979 and again in 1991. My income tax and self-employment tax for 1979 were $6,400; for 1991, $10,400. Medical insurance premiums for 1979, $2,100; for 1991, $7,100. Local property taxes (for the same house), in 1979, $2,118; in 1991, $5,623. Cost per year at an Ivy League college in 1979, $13,250; in 1991, $22,600. Cost of a midsize car in 1979, $9,800; in 1991, $19,000. The totals are, for 1979, about $34,000; for 1991, about $65,000.
The two bank stocks in my individual retirement account are worthless, both closed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. One insurance company in which I had tax-sheltered annuities is in receivership, after it invested in junk bonds.
I, like most of my peers, was not a member of the merger-and-acquisition, leveraged-buyout or real-estate-dealing fraternities, the ones who made the big bucks during the Reagan years. As you can readily see, I am no longer able -- despite being in the top 2 percent of wage earners in the country -- to spend to affect the economy. Even with another $1 or $2 a day, I will have to spend judiciously, whether for a car, a suit, theater in New York or an evening meal out.
When I started law school, the top-income bracket was taxed at 91 percent, dropping to 70 percent under President Kennedy. The huge loss of revenues to the Treasury caused by the Reagan tax cuts did not, as hoped, spur the economy. Most of the people who saved tax dollars seem simply to have lent that money to the Treasury, by buying long-term bonds, to cover the ever-increasing deficits.
The people who made the big bucks did so not by creating new businesses but in the way depicted in the play "Other People's Money." When Mobil bought Conoco, fewer jobs resulted. When Briggs & Stratton moved its production to Mexico, thousands of hard-working people with a strong work ethic lost jobs replaceable only at minimum-wage levels and without either pension or medical coverage.
This country's most pressing social need is a national health plan. Its most pressing economic need is to free tax revenues.
I urge a new tax at the rate of 75 percent on all incomes, however derived, in excess of $750,000, and at 91 percent on all incomes over $1 million, with the proceeds used exclusively to reduce the deficit. If the taxation necessary to pay interest on the national debt could be reduced from 25 cents of each dollar in taxes paid down to the 3 cents to 4 cents paid in the 1960's, all of us could have a substantial tax cut, and the heavy hitters could be assured of a steady stream of income.
The consumer, who is the ultimate payer of those incomes -- by paying property taxes to pay for municipal bonds, by higher product prices to pay for advertising to sell the cars and the beer -- could continue to consume.

Is 'Local Content' The Smartest Way To Judge Imports?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Back when Detroit first woke up to the dimensions of the Japanese challenge in automobiles in the early 1980's, its leaders said they needed three concessions to compete fairly. First, the Japanese would have to build many of their cars in America, so that they would face the same costs and restrictions that dog American auto makers. Second, they would have to put numerical limits on their exports from Japan. And third, those import limits would have to stay in effect for a number of years, so that the Big Three would have time to get their act together.
They got all three, and a decade later Detroit is in worse shape than ever. Now the Bush Administration is raising a new set of "local content" hurdles and, to hear the Japanese tell it, systematically harassing Japanese business interests in America with regulations and investigations. 
 These days such complaints are not about to get much sympathy in Congress or a recession-mired America, and perhaps the Japanese are simply getting a small taste of what they have dished out for decades to American companies in Tokyo. But the Administration's recent actions have raised a question that few politicians in America seem likely to debate in any detail in an electoral season: Does cracking down on Japan in America truly help American workers in Detroit and elsewhere, or does it hamper the effort to get Japan and other countries to move their best technologies, their best plants and their best jobs to America?
The issue came to the fore clearly last week when the Customs Service came down on Honda for its import of cars built at its plant in Canada. The Government ruled that these cars do not meet the requirement that they contain 50 percent or more "North American content," and thus do not qualify for tariff-free import under the free trade pact with Canada. Honda and Canada dispute that.
 
Two-Sided Argument
 There are endless arguments on both sides over how to measure "local content," and a reasonable argument can be made as to whether Honda passed the test or failed it. In its calculations, Honda includes manufacturing processes and factory depreciation costs that Customs says do not really add to domestic content; the Government says many components of major car parts, such as Honda's Ohio-made engines, can be quickly traced back to a web of Japanese suppliers, even though they pass through American hands.
Indeed local content can be defined to fit any agenda. "It is easy to set up a sham 'domestic supplier' who is actually the subsidiary of a Japanese company doing minimal assembly on a Japanese-designed component," J. Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs, noted recently. The Japanese Government responded last week with a survey of 931 Japanese-owned manufacturing operations in the United States showing that more than 60 percent get more than two-thirds of their materials in America.
Japan's complaint -- echoing that of American firms that struggled to break into industries here -- is that America is making up the rules on the fly to insure that outsiders stay outside. Last week officials in Tokyo charged that election-year politics influenced the Honda decision and Kozo Watanabe, Japan's Trade Minister, ordered an investigation into whether Japanese companies were suffering discrimination.
In any case, Honda is an odd choice for a first victim. It is widely viewed as a model of "Americanization," and the United States came to its defense recently when the Europeans tried to classify Ohio-made Hondas as Japanese imports, not American. But emotion increasingly rules the day on Japan issues. The Japanese blanched last week when Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, a Democrat, told a group of American factory workers that they "should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it: 'Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan.' " The Japanese view such comments as part of an American temper tantrum. They lump into the same category efforts by Attorney General William P. Barr to change Justice Department guidelines so that he can pursue foreign business groups that collude to restrict American exports. Meanwhile Congress is toying with changing the definition of Japanese minivans to "trucks" so that they can be slapped with 25 percent duties.
All these moves are ultimately defended as tactics to protect American jobs. Local content rules, in theory, assure that Honda is forced to hire American assembly workers and buy American parts. That worked wonderfully when parts were designed, engineered and made in the same place. Unfortunately, the manufacturing world is no longer so simple.
As the Japanese have proven better than anyone, the trick is not simply keeping jobs in the country but keeping the right kind of jobs -- the kind that nurture skills and technologies for more industrial growth. Local content rules, however, are imprecise weapons, treating all car components as essentially the same, whether they are a hunk of engine block or a high-tech cluster of electronic engine controls. Often the least "value added" in a part comes from actually manufacturing it; the real value is in the design and the creation of the tools needed to make it.
But as a matter of policy, the United States seems unsure what kind of work it wants to assure for American suppliers.
The trick is not simply to force Japan to produce more goods in America, but to get it to perform its most complicated technological feats there, with American workers. That might seem like a variety of industrial policy, something the Bush Administation rejects. But local content rules, commitments for parts purchases and guarantees about how many American cars will be sold in Japan are all a form of industrial policy, too. The question is whether it is the right form.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
How the Cholera Scare Is Waking Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: IQUITOS, Peru

 BODY:
Cholera, as it turns out, may have saved more people than it killed in the Americas in 1991.
"Last year in Latin America, 4,000 people died of cholera," said Carlos Moreno Chacon, director of Peru's anti-cholera campaign. "During the same time, 100,000 to 150,000 Latin American children did not die of acute diarrhea. Public awareness over cholera and medical preparation made the difference." 
 Although cholera has hospitalized 440,000 people and killed 1 percent of those, many public health experts say that the most lasting effect of the cholera outbreak that began a year ago may be its scare value. Cholera is being used as a lever to force Latin America's governments to attack the less dramatic -- but statistically more deadly -- problems of dirty drinking water and untreated sewage. These conditions, reminiscent of 19th-century Europe and the United States, have been a major contributor to infant mortality in 20th-century Latin America. In 1990, 914,000 Latin American and Caribbean children died before they reached the age of five.
So the cholera outbreak serves as a reminder that Latin America, like the rest of the third world, remains overwhelmed by physical or social conditions that make easily treatable or preventable diseases into the biggest killers; the principal cause for child mortality in the region is still acute diarrhea caused not by cholera but by gastroenteritis. And the very fact that these diseases are accepted as a part of the social landscape makes it difficult to change the conditions in which they thrive. An agent for such change can be a dramatic scourge that threatens rich as well as poor, and that is now the case with cholera.
It is, in a way, similar to what is happening because of AIDS. The realization that 1 million Latin Americans are infected with the AIDS-causing virus has spurred health authorities to launch safe sex campaigns that are expected to reduce venereal diseases and unwanted pregnancies.
"There is an almost mythical sensitivity about epidemics," said Tomas Jimenez, a Spanish economist in Bogota who is a writing a book for Unicef on the health status of Latin America's children. "Cholera has set off a flashing alarm light over the lack of access to potable water and to sewage treatment for a great part of Latin America's population."
Citing the threat from cholera, a water- and food-borne disease that can kill a healthy person in six hours, health ministers from 10 South American nations met in Buenos Aires two weeks ago to draw up a plan to invest $200 billion over 12 years to upgrade water, sewage and basic health facilities for Latin America's poor. About two-thirds of the money is to come from Latin American governments and the rest will be sought from foreign governments and multilateral agencies.
"If cholera serves as a stimulus for these investments, it will have had a useful impact," said A. David Brandling-Bennett, chairman of the cholera task force of the Pan American Health Organization, a Washington-based group that backs the investment plan. "The program will eliminate cholera. But it will also reduce incidence of diarrhea in children, improve infant mortality and adult life expectancy."
Other factors also influence infant mortality rates in Latin America, of course: how much education the mother has, the prevalence of respiratory diseases, and whether infants can be immunized.
The concrete impact of aid against cholera can already be seen in Iquitos, the largest city of the Peruvian Amazon. At this time last year, the Hospital de Apoyo was receiving 70 cholera cases a day. Today, the rate averages one case a day. A major factor for the drop was the installation of a sewage incinerator, installed with a $15,000 grant from the Pan American Health Organization.
"Before, untreated sewage from the cholera wards was coming up at street level five blocks below the hospital," Segundo Pinillos Reyes, chairman of the region's anti-cholera campaign, said in an interview at the hospital. Despite such local improvements and the attention that the cholera outbreak has focused on the need to improve basic sanitation, epidemiologists believe that cholera will probably be present in the Americas through the 1990's.
Last week, one year's worth of Brazilian public health prevention was put to the test when hundreds of people suffering from cholera symptoms flooded hospitals in Recife, a major city on Brazil's impoverished northeast coast. On Friday, Brazil's Health Minister, Adib Jatene, declared cholera an epidemic in his nation. Over the last year, the bacteria has moved slowly down the Brazilian Amazon to the coast, hospitalizing 3,600 people, 54 of whom have died. With the exceptions of Paraguay and Uruguay, all Latin American nations have reported cholera cases.
 
Advance Warning
 But this is still relatively encouraging. Of the total of 441,000 cases, 81 percent have occurred in Peru. Many of the other countries have kept their case rates comparatively low by taking advantage of the advance warning offered by the initial appearance of the disease in Peru on Jan. 23, 1991. Hundreds of Latin American doctors flew to this country to learn how to prevent cholera and how to treat victims. "It was not as bad as we expected," Barbara Lopes Cardozo, a Dutch doctor for the international aid group, Doctors Without Borders, said in Manaus, capital of Brazil's Amazonas state. "People had been warned to cook food, to boil their water, and to wash their hands."
With the return of the Southern Hemisphere summer in December, Peru has been experiencing a resurgence of the bacteria, which is historically associated with coastal areas and which has thrived in Lima, a Pacific Coast capital of eight million people. On Friday, Los Angeles health examiners said food prepared in Lima gave cholera to 76 passengers on a Feb. 14 flight from Buenos Aires to Lima and Los Angeles. Because of a severe drought, half of Lima's population underwent water rationing in February. With water precious, drinking inevitably takes precedence over washing and sanitation suffers.
"Cholera is a misery thermometer," said Luis Antonio Loyola, an Argentine doctor who represents the Pan American Health Organization here. He and other public health officials hope that the highly visible cholera thermometer will provoke governments to treat the underlying causes.

Why International Statistical Comparisons Don't Work

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Living standards in the United States have fallen behind those in Germany, Japan, even Finland. The pay and productivity of once-proud American workers trail those of a dozen or so other nations. The short-sighted United States invests half as much as far-sighted Japan.
These dispiriting and widely cited statistics have one thing in common: They are wrong. 
 In fact, contrary to today's conventional wisdom, the United States remains the richest and most productive economy in the world. That's true even though other industrial nations have been growing faster -- and narrowing the gap -- practically since the United States became No. 1 in the first place, in about 1910.
Certainly, Americans can't afford to be complacent. If some of the worrisome trends in the United States economy -- from increasingly ill-prepared workers to skimpy savings -- continue long enough, today's dubious statistic could turn into tomorrow's hard fact.
But part of what's unnecessarily stoking Americans' anxiety is a handful of false comparisons based on faulty ways of calculating the economic scorecard. Much of the trouble arises in converting other nations' output, consumption or investment from yen, marks or lire into dollars of comparable buying power.
The widespread practice -- in place everywhere from the lofty World Bank to the nightly news -- of using currency market exchange rates seriously distorts comparisons because it does not take account of different price levels -- higher rents in Tokyo than Toledo, cheaper cherries in Bologna than Bristol, the fact that maids are affordable for most middle-class families in Mexico but for few families in Minneapolis.
Put another way, not taking account of different prices in different countries makes as little sense as comparing your pay today with your salary in 1978 without factoring in the doubling of prices in that interval.
Besides, exchange rates gyrate with wars, business cycles and urges by foreign investors to buy American bonds. None of these reflect real changes in economic fundamentals.
Economists rely on so-called purchasing power parity exchange rates. "If you're making comparisons using PPP's, you come much closer to the truth with a capital T, " said Robert Summers, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania who, together with his colleague Allan Heston, helped introduce the whole notion.
So what do the facts, correctly measured, say? Start with that most basic yardstick of wealth, economic development and well-being, a country's gross domestic product -- the sum of what it produces inside its own borders -- divided by the population. The United States is still on top, 17 percent ahead of Germany and a surprising 22 percent ahead of Japan.
What a nation produces, however, includes a great many things -- from missiles to private security guards to new factories -- that don't add immediately to the material well-being of its citizens. What about consumption, public and private -- which reflects how well people are living? According to Mr. Summers and Mr. Heston, the gap between America's consumer society and Germany's and Japan's, which devote more to investment, is even wider.
At this point someone is apt to point out that there's more to life than material goods -- namely, the time to enjoy them. As it turns out, busy Japanese workers work about 260 hours more a year than Americans -- 2,052 hours in total -- to achieve their lower living standard. Germans, on the other hand, may have living standards 15 percent below those of Americans, but they also work 10 percent fewer hours. In many peoples' eyes, these leisure-loving people -- who get six-week vacations -- may be very close to having it all.
What lets Americans live better while loafing more than their Japanese rivals is higher -- yes, higher -- productivity. Contrary to the widespread view that the Japanese economy is vastly more efficient, every comparison shows that output per employee is 40 percent greater in the United States. America also has the most efficient service industries and agriculture.
In some sectors of manufacturing, Japan and Germany are much closer to Yankee efficiency. Japanese productivity is about 80 percent that of America's, while Germany's hovers at about 75 percent. Canada's is the closest. What's more, factory productivity growth abroad slowed in the 1980's, just as it spurted in the United States.
Hard to believe? Japan is hyperefficient as a maker of cars, VCRs and industrial and office equipment. But not enough to offset being relatively inefficient at turning out pharmaceuticals, aircraft, textiles, construction material, processed food and raw materials.
 
$21.53 an Hour
 American politicians have lately been griping that American factory workers trail their counterparts in Europe badly when it comes to pay. Pay here is $14.77 an hour, they say, lower than in at least 12 other countries and positively paltry compared with Germany's princely $21.53 an hour. But adjusting for Germany's higher cost of living shrinks the German advantage to a few pfennig.
What matters for future living standards, of course, is how much a nation invests in new technology, plants and equipment. A rallying cry of late has been that Japan spends twice as much as the United States. That turns out to be a bit of a tall tale based on ignoring the high cost of building in Japan. Correctly measured, Japan invests about 28 percent of G.D.P., versus 19 percent for the United States -- nowhere near twice as much. Surprisingly, the American rate is not far below that of Germany, France and Italy, which plow just 21 or 22 percent of their G.D.P. into the next generation of machines, factories and office buildings.
The United States, not Japan and certainly not Finland, is still the richest and most competitive economy. But for the last 15 years, the United States has consumed more, invested less and grown more slowly than any other industrial nation. Will it remain in the lead? Simple extrapolation often fails because it ignores peoples' ability to change course. Which road is taken will depend on what happens from here on, not on the past.


GRAPHIC: Subtle differences in measurement can dramatically affect how the United States ranks against other countries.
Chart/Table: "Little adjustments make big differences"
In the first pair of tables, G.N.P. and G.D.P. are essentially identical. Using purchasing power parity when converting to dollars adjusts the result for differences between domestic prices -- like Japan's high housing costs or Italy's low food costs. But some institutions like the World Bank use currency market exchange rates, which gyrate wildly from year to year.
The United Nations' Human Development Index is a controversial standard of living measure that combines gross domestic product -- the goods and services a nation produces within its borders -- with other indicators of well-being. The basic index -- at left, below -- averages a nation's per capita income with its literacy rate and life expectancy. Though Japan's per capita income is less than two-thirds that of the United States, it is ranked highest because its citizens tend to live three years longer. The ranking at center adds a factor that penalizes countries with large gaps between the rich and the poor. The ranking on the right penalizes them for disparities between men and women. On it, Finland ranks as the world's richest nation.
 
Tables rank top ten countries in 1990: per person gross domestic products; per person gross national production; U.N Human Development Index adjsuted for life expectency and literacy; U.N. Human Development Index adjusted for life expectancy, literacy and income distribution; U.N. Human Development Index adjusted for life expectancy, literacy and sexual equality.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Business Incentives: A High-Priced Letdown

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
The stunning decision by the General Motors Corporation to close its 91-year-old assembly plant here, coming after 15 years of huge subsidies aimed at keeping big business in the region, has provoked bitter criticism over the taxpayer support of corporations and which, if any, industries should qualify.
G.M. announced Feb. 24 that it would shutter the North Tarrytown plant in 1995, eliminating 3,400 jobs in a region where manufacturing, once dominant, has been in harrowing decline. 
 The bad news, coming during the most stubbornly persistent recession in decades, was a particular blow because it arrived without warning. The auto maker, whose losses for 1991 were the largest in United States corporate history, had said earlier that it would embark on a series of plant closings, but had identified only two of its large-scale assembly plants, in Michigan and Texas, as possibilities.
Worse still, the North Tarrytown assembly plant, G.M.'s oldest and Westchester County's largest factory, had been a showpiece of public initiative. After surviving for decades as a manufacturing anomaly -- sprawling along 97 acres of scenic riverfront in one of the country's richest suburban enclaves -- the plant received a 10-year package of incentives in 1985 from New York State and Westchester County worth over $100 million.
The incentives, although larger than most, were similar to public subsidies that have been extended to many companies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and many other states since the 1970's.
"We have been left holding the bag, and it is empty," said Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive.
Many experts say G.M.'s decision primarily reflected its shrinking share of the global automobile market and the high costs of doing business in a region where even generous public incentives cannot give manufacturers a competitive edge.
"The question may be, 'Why are we trying to retain dying industries?' " said Vincent Tese, president of New York State's Urban Development Corporation and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's chief economic adviser, in an interview last week.
In G.M.'s case, though, he said the state would keep trying. Even though the auto maker called its decision "irreversible," Mr. Tese and other officials said Monday that they had formed a new task force and were beginning to package new incentives to try to persuade the company to stay.
"We can't replace 3,400 skilled and semiskilled blue-collar jobs," Mr. Tese added, "and we are going to fight tooth and nail to save them."
 
Good Money After Bad
 But to some economists and urban planners, public subsidies to large businesses, particularly manufacturers, have become the government's equivalent of throwing good money after bad.
"We have to refocus on whether we are supporting business activity that has reasonable long-term prospects in this region," said Hugh O'Neill, an urban planner at New York University who was a member of the state's task force that negotiated G.M. incentives. Many light industries, including biotechnology, computer and high-technology electronics, would be more suitable than auto plants or other heavy manufacturing, Mr. O'Neill and other experts said.
G.M. is merely one of dozens of companies that received such incentives. They are varied, involving reduced property taxes, the elimination of sales taxes on supplies, subsidized energy, and bridge and road improvements. And although the value of the incentives is impossible to measure with any accuracy, experts say such arrangements were worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the recipients in the 1980's.
Still, despite fiscal problems, states, counties and municipalities across the tri-state area still offer new subsidies.
 
Still Going
 Less than a week before G.M. announced its closing here, Governor Cuomo visited Auburn, in Cayuga County, to announce that SnyderGeneral Corporation, a maker of air-conditioning equipment that had threatened to move to Tennessee, would remain in the upstate village, expand its plant and increase its work force there from 375 to 600.
"SnyderGeneral is a New York success story," Gov. Cuomo said as he handed the company a check for $6.3 million, derived from a low-interest state loan.
Other state incentives extended to the company include a $500,000 investment in the roads and other infrastructure around its plant.
In New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio announced late last year that the General Electric Company had signed a 10-year lease on a new assembly plant in Camden for its aerospace manufacturing division. As part of the deal, the state is spending $65 million to buy a site for the plant and an adjacent office building and will lease it to a developer, who in turn will have General Electric as his tenant.
Yet some attempts to sway business have misfired from their inception. In Hoboken, where the Maxwell House Coffee Company had operated a plant for over 50 years and threatened last year to move to Florida, the city along with the state offered the company low-interest loans, subsidized water and other inducements worth $7.1 million to stay. Maxwell House declined, moved to Jacksonville, affecting 600 jobs, and the Hoboken plant stands vacant.
But the deepest doubts raised about the corporate subsidies involve those in which companies have accepted public support and closed their doors anyway or, as in the case of G.M., announced they would leave after meeting their minimum obligations.
"We have just about given away the store," said Alfred B. Delbello, a Westchester County attorney who was New York State's Lieutenant Governor in 1985 and chief negotiator when G.M. accepted its 10-year package of incentives for the North Tarrytown plant.
Mr. Delbello's experience with corporations reflects the risks. As Mayor of Yonkers in 1972, he approved a package in which the city spent over $4 million to build a new assembly plant for the Otis Elevator Company, which was one of the city's biggest employers and had threatened to close.
Three years later, Otis was abruptly acquired by the United Technologies Corporation, which abandoned its Yonkers operations, and left its gift from the city vacant.
Now, as an adviser to Mr. O'Rourke, the Westchester County executive, Mr. Delbello said G.M. has cast new doubt on the effectiveness of corporate inducements.
"Experience has left me and others somewhat jaded," Mr. Delbello said. "Maybe heavy industry just doesn't make much sense any more in this area."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
The Philosophical Fight Over What Insurance Should Be

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Critics of the health insurance industry like to collect horror stories. There was the group of 1,600 real estate agents in New Jersey who were dropped by Blue Cross. The company said their health claims were too costly. There was the executive of Aetna Insurance who left to start a small company, only to discover that he could not get insurance for himself and his employees because a woman who worked for him had heart disease. And there is the more recent case of Kathleen Renshaw of Leucadia, Calif., whose family's annual health insurance premiums soared to $16,000 after her daughter was found to have only one kidney with about 60 percent of its normal capacity.
These critics say that such stories indicate that at least some sectors of the insurance industry have lost their sense of what insurance is supposed to do: spread the risk around. The Health Insurance Association of America counters that despite some problems, the system works well for most Americans. 
 Donald White, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America, said the horror stories are almost exclusively confined to small groups and individuals. Most Americans who have health insurance get it through medium to large groups, he said. "No one asks them about their health habits," Mr. White said. "Their premiums are set by the entire group's experience." He said the association is proposing legislation that would limit the ability of insurance companies to charge excessive rates to high-risk individuals in small groups or drop them altogether.
But the real question, critics say, is whether health insurance should be governed by an ethic that says, "I am my brother's keeper," or whether it should be "actuarially fair," meaning that those who are healthy should pay less than those who are sick or likely to become sick. "This is a philosophical question," said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University who studies the health insurance industry. "You have to ask yourself, What is health care? Is it to be viewed like food where basically you say that food is every family's own problem? That is the right wing's perception of health care. It is the view of those who call patients 'consumers' and who call getting care in hospitals 'consuming health care.' " The alternative, he said, is to compare health care with elementary education, a social good whose cost should be collectively borne.
 
Subsidizing the Sick
 Among those favoring the idea of actuarial fairness is Dr. John Goodman, president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a research group in Dallas that is partially financed by the insurance industry. "The absolutely fairest way, for a new buyer entering the market, is to price insurance according to expected costs," he said. "If you don't do that, you are forcing healthy people to subsidize the payments of sick people." He said that if some people cannot afford health insurance, the government may want to subsidize them. Picking up on Dr. Reinhardt's analogy, he said health insurance should indeed be like food. "We recognize that poor people may need help in buying food, so we give them food stamps. If we are going to try to help people out, we ought to do it in relation to financial need."
Dr. Goodman said it is unjust to spread the costs of health insurance because then poor people and rich people are forced to pay the same higher premium to take care of sick members of the group. "If a poor person gets sick, maybe you and I would want to chip in," he said. "But if Ross Perot gets sick, that doesn't mean that you and I should give him money." Dr. Goodman said health insurance should be like life insurance. Companies would charge new applicants according to their perceived risks. But once they were insured, he said, the company should continue to cover them no matter what.
In a paper published in the Harvard Law Review in 1987, two lawyers, Karen Clifford of the Health Insurance Association of America and Russel P. Iuculano of the American Council on Life Insurance, made a similar argument. "An insurance company has the responsibility to treat all its policyholders fairly by establishing premiums at a level consistent with the risk represented by each individual policyholder," they wrote. For group insurance, they said, the insurer must evaluate the risk for the entire group.
Others distinguish between health risks that are no one's fault, like diabetes, and health risks that people bring on themselves. Mark Hall, a law professor at Arizona State University who has studied the health insurance industry, said that people who do not take care of their health should pay more for insurance. "To say a smoker should not have to pay anything more is morally indefensible," he said. Mr. Hall added, however, that it can be difficult to decide whether, and when, to blame the victim. "Maybe we can only do this on a larger, symbolic level," he said. "We can take things such as smoking or illegal drugs -- things people generally agree are bad as opposed to something like not exercising -- and impose a modest tax on them." But these arguments, said Dr. Norman Daniels, an ethicist at Tufts University, distort the very concept of insurance. "The idea of insurance is to share the risk," he said. "The social function of health insurance is to protect everyone."
Dr. Donald Light, a sociologist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said that if those few people at high risk are made to pay more, the sick will have their premiums raised astronomically in order to lower everyone else's premiums just slightly.
Dr. Reinhardt said he favors the philosophy of the Canadian Government. "The Canadians say that in a civilized society, the pain of getting sick is bad enough, but the cost should be borne by society at large," he said.
Dr. Reinhardt said that he has heard many insurance executives cite an argument like Dr. Goodman's, saying, in essence: "I am pricing according to use. If you, society, worry about equity, let the government tax and redistribute the money." He said he calls that argument "von Braunian motion," after a line written by the songwriter Tom Lehrer satirizing the rocket scientist Wernher von Braun: " 'Vonce ze rockets are up, who cares vere zey come down? Zat's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun.' "
But, Dr. Reinhardt said, "the sad part of it is that the executives of most insurance companies vote for politicians who do not make these income redistributions."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries and Caucases;
A Bitter, Frenzied Race to Super Tuesday

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 7

 BODY:
With his sharpest attacks yet, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas is battling to contain Gov. Bill Clinton as the race for the Democratic nomination roars toward the Southern-dominated primary extravaganza known as "Super Tuesday."
On the final weekend before 11 states vote in primaries and caucuses, producing more than a fifth of the pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton engaged in a bitter exchange over who was distorting whose record. 
 Mr. Tsongas, who arrived in Florida this weekend and accused Mr. Clinton of being "cynical and unprincipled," assailed the Arkansas Governor again today, even while acknowledging that it could prove counterproductive in the fall. "We're only helping George Bush," Mr. Tsongas said. "But this is one Greek who fights back." Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, was widely derided in the party for not countering Republican attacks.
 
Clinton Attacks Back
 Mr. Clinton, for his part, knocked the charge of pandering back at Mr. Tsongas, asserting that he had shifted his position on Social Security cost-of-living adjustments to appeal to elderly voters in Florida. [Page 24.] South Carolina held a primary today, and Mr. Clinton won with 67 percent of the vote. President Bush won the Republican primary handily. [Page 26.]
There were also caucuses in Arizona and Wyoming, but the Democratic battle was centered here in Florida, second only to Texas in the number of delegates at stake on Tuesday. It is also the place where the former Senator from Massachusetts hopes to knock a major dent in Mr. Clinton's Southern base.
The exchange demonstrates the intensity of the Democratic race as it becomes a grueling, airport-to-airport, cross-country scramble for delegates. Mr. Tsongas says that he "just wants to be perceived as doing well" on Super Tuesday, and his aides talk of a "silver medal" strategy in the region. But he clearly would like to rattle Mr. Clinton in his home turf, before the race moves north again to the critical states of Michigan and Illinois, which hold primaries on March 17.
Mr. Clinton, for his part, is trying to capitalize to the fullest on a day tailor-made for a son of the South, when 7 of the 11 primaries and caucuses are in Southern or border states. He began with a regional advantage and a network of political friendships, and Democrats in several states said this week that he had built upon them to create formidable biracial coalitions.
Dennis Kanin, campaign manager for Mr. Tsongas, said in an interview: "My sense is that Bill Clinton will come out with a significant lead in delegates, as he should, from his own home region. But that will be the last time his region votes in those kind of numbers."
Mr. Tsongas has regional advantages of his own on this day, notably in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, in addition to more neutral turf like Delaware and Hawaii, both of which hold caucuses. But 633 of the 783 pledged delegates at stake come from Southern or border states.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, coming off his surprise victory in Colorado last week, has also been campaigning around the South, spending much of the past few days in Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee. Democratic officials continue to describe him as a wild card in many states. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, his campaign lagging, has largely bypassed the Super Tuesday contests.
On the Republican side, President Bush was finishing up a two-week campaign swing through the South with the prediction, "We're going to win them all, and then keep on going and winning everyone of them." Many of his allies are now resigned to some protest vote in almost every state, but Robert M. Teeter, his campaign chairman, noted, "The fact is, we're going to win all these states."
Patrick J. Buchanan's aides said they hoped for their strongest showings in Louisiana, Mississippi, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, as well as selected areas of Texas.
 
Florida
 With 148 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention, this is a state too big to write off. And as Mr. Dukakis showed in 1988, it can be the most hospitable Southern terrain for candidates from the Northeast, in part because so many of its voters are from there themselves. As a result, Mr. Tsongas is competing hard in Florida and polls show it to be a close race.
Much of the struggle is over the numerous retirees in southern Florida, with the sharpest campaign dialogue focused on Social Security. The Clinton campaign has been broadcasting commercials that note that Mr. Tsongas, in a campaign manifesto he wrote last year, suggested "reducing the yearly increase in entitlements by one percent below the cost of living."
Mr. Tsongas countered this weekend with commercials that say he "fought to protect Social Security" for 10 years in Congress, and accuse Mr. Clinton of "trying to scare people."
Mr. Clinton has an early organizing advantage and some powerful political support, but Florida voters have in the past supported a hot newcomer coming off a victory in New Hampshire; Gary Hart won the popular vote here in 1984.
On the Republican side, Florida is considered to be one of Mr. Bush's strongholds.
 
Louisiana
 When Mr. Clinton came through Louisiana in late January, Gov. Edwin Edwards archly offered to do just about anything to help him get elected, "including endorsing someone else." No such measures seemed to be called for. Louisiana, with its 60 delegates, looks solid for Mr. Clinton, thanks to strong support from both blacks and whites, analysts say.
Louisiana may trouble Bush strategists more than any other Super Tuesday state because of the added competition from David Duke, the former candidate for Governor who is on the Republican ballot here. Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said, "Louisiana may be trickier than the others because of Duke, with both him and Pat pulling from us."
Another trouble spot: William Nungesser, the state Republican Party chairman who feuded with the White House last year over its intervention in the Governor's race, announced last week that he was endorsing Mr. Buchanan. Still, the force of the Duke vote could be muted on Tuesday. Louisiana does not allow crossover voting in this primary, and much of Mr. Duke's support in the Governor's race came from Democrats.
Recent polling of likely voters show Mr. Bush far out in front, with Mr. Buchanan a very distant second and Mr. Duke behind him.
 
Massachusetts
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Tsongas is expected to win by a large margin, at least the 59 percent that Mr. Dukakis won in 1988, some state party officials predict.
On the Republican side, Alan Safran, executive director of the state Republican Party, predicts that, "The President will do better here than he did in New Hampshire, and Buchanan will get less than his 37 percent." Mr. Buchanan, however, clearly has some hopes for this state, judging from his campaign appearances there.
 
Mississippi
 This is another state where the ability to build biracial coalitions should stand Mr. Clinton in good stead. A poll last week showed him far out in front here, and Ed Cole, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, asserted that Mr. Clinton could end up winning all 39 of the state's delegates.
Mr. Brown is also competing in Mississippi, broadcasting television commercials and appearing with the Rev. Jesse Jackson there this week.
On the Republican side, Mr. Buchanan clearly believes he can make some inroads in Mississippi. "He is going after those people who are disenfranchised Reaganites," said a Buchanan campaign organizer, Ashby Foote. Mr. Bush's allies in Mississippi voiced general confidence.
 
Oklahoma
 This is one of the easier contests to predict: Because of a mixup by the Tsongas campaign, the former Massachusetts Senator is not on the ballot here. "Clinton is clearly going to win; it's just a question of the margin," said Gov. David Walters, a Clinton supporter. Mr. Brown is expected to finish second, local analysts said.
On the Republican side, polls show Mr. Bush well out in front, but Mr. Buchanan has spent time here in the last few days; he spoke to the Oklahoma Legislature on Thursday and was warmly received, although much of the warmth came from Democrats responding to Bush-bashing.
 
Rhode Island
 Mr. Tsongas gets the neighboring-state advantage in Rhode Island, although Mr. Clinton has begun broadcasting television commercials and clearly has hopes of at least picking up some delegates in the state.
On the Republican side, the Bush campaign has scheduled Vice President Dan Quayle to appear this weekend -- testimony that Mr. Buchanan is a factor here.
 
Tennessee
 Mr. Clinton has gathered endorsements from Gov. Ned McWherter, dozens of state legislators and four of the six Democratic Congressmen here. He has been running television commercials both attacking Mr. Tsongas's economics and touting his own record as Governor, and he visited Nashville on Friday. All this, of course, is added to his neighboring-state advantage.
Still, Mr. Tsongas is on television here, competing for a share of the state's 68 delegates, and Mr. Brown visited Memphis on Friday with Mr. Jackson.
On the Republican side, Mr. Bush has campaigned in Tennessee and sent quite a few surrogates in as well. Mr. Buchanan is scheduled for a pre-election visit on Monday.
 
Texas
 With 196 Democratic delegates at stake, this is the biggest prize on Super Tuesday, and Mr. Clinton is well-positioned for a strong showing here, Texas Democrats say. "It looks to me like the results will be similar to Georgia," said Ed Martin, executive director of the state party. "Most of the political apparatus is in that posture with Clinton."
Mr. Tsongas says his strategy here is aimed at gathering some delegates, and he could fare well in the upscale suburbs of Austin, among other places.
On the Republican side, Fred Meyer, the state chairman, predicts, "This is Bush country." Still, Mr. Buchanan has been campaigning and advertising here, trying to stoke the protest vote.
And here is a look at the caucuses:
Delaware: Unfortunately for Delaware, this state's 14 Democratic delegates have not made it a battleground state.
Hawaii: Governor Clinton could have an advantage in this state's Democratic caucuses because of his friendship with Gov. John Waihee 3d. Hawaii has yet to see any campaign advertising.
Missouri: Here, as in many other places, Mr. Clinton is given the edge on organization, but Mr. Tsongas may be gaining ground, according to Gary Edwards, executive director of the Democratic State Committee.

HEADLINE: U.S. STRATEGY PLAN CALLS FOR INSURING NO RIVALS DEVELOP

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
In a broad new policy statement that is in its final drafting stage, the Defense Department asserts that America's political and military mission in the post-cold-war era will be to insure that no rival superpower is allowed to emerge in Western Europe, Asia or the territory of the former Soviet Union.
A 46-page document that has been circulating at the highest levels of the Pentagon for weeks, and which Defense Secretary Dick Cheney expects to release later this month, states that part of the American mission will be "convincing potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests." 
 The classified document makes the case for a world dominated by one superpower whose position can be perpetuated by constructive behavior and sufficient military might to deter any nation or group of nations from challenging American primacy.
 
Rejecting Collective Approach
 To perpetuate this role, the United States "must sufficiently account for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order," the document states.
With its focus on this concept of benevolent domination by one power, the Pentagon document articulates the clearest rejection to date of collective internationalism, the strategy that emerged from World War II when the five victorious powers sought to form a United Nations that could mediate disputes and police outbreaks of violence.
Though the document is internal to the Pentagon and is not provided to Congress, its policy statements are developed in conjunction with the National Security Council and in consultation with the President or his senior national security advisers. Its drafting has been supervised by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Policy. Mr. Wolfowitz often represents the Pentagon on the Deputies Committee, which formulates policy in an interagency process dominated by the State and Defense departments.
The document was provided to The New York Times by an official who believes this post-cold-war strategy debate should be carried out in the public domain. It seems likely to provoke further debate in Congress and among America's allies about Washington's willingness to tolerate greater aspirations for regional leadership from a united Europe or from a more assertive Japan.
Together with its attachments on force levels required to insure America's predominant role, the policy draft is a detailed justification for the Bush Administration's "base force" proposal to support a 1.6-million-member military over the next five years, at a cost of about $1.2 trillion. Many Democrats in Congress have criticized the proposal as unnecessarily expensive.
Implicitly, the document foresees building a world security arrangement that pre-empts Germany and Japan from pursuing a course of substantial rearmament, especially nuclear armament, in the future.
In its opening paragraph, the policy document heralds the "less visible" victory at the end of the cold war, which it defines as "the integration of Germany and Japan into a U.S.-led system of collective security and the creation of a democratic 'zone of peace.' "
The continuation of this strategic goal explains the strong emphasis elsewhere in the document and in other Pentagon planning on using military force, if necessary, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in such countries as North Korea, Iraq, some of the successor republics to the Soviet Union and in Europe.
Nuclear proliferation, if unchecked by superpower action, could tempt Germany, Japan and other industrial powers to acquire nuclear weapons to deter attack from regional foes. This could start them down the road to global competition with the United States and, in a crisis over national interests, military rivalry.
The policy draft appears to be adjusting the role of the American nuclear arsenal in the new era, saying, "Our nuclear forces also provide an important deterrent hedge against the possibility of a revitalized or unforeseen global threat, while at the same time helping to deter third party use of weapons of mass destruction through the threat of retaliation."
 
U.N. Action Ignored
 The document is conspicuously devoid of references to collective action through the United Nations, which provided the mandate for the allied assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait and which may soon be asked to provide a new mandate to force President Saddam Hussein to comply with his cease-fire obligations.
The draft notes that coalitions "hold considerable promise for promoting collective action" as in the Persian Gulf war, but that "we should expect future coalitions to be ad hoc assemblies, often not lasting beyond the crisis being confronted, and in many cases carrying only general agreement over the objectives to be accomplished."
What is most important, it says, is "the sense that the world order is ultimately backed by the U.S." and "the United States should be postured to act independently when collective action cannot be orchestrated" or in a crisis that demands quick response.
Bush Administration officials have been saying publicly for some time that they were willing to work within the framework of the United Nations, but that they reserve the option to act unilaterally or through selective coalitions, if necessary, to protect vital American interests.
But this publicly stated strategy did not rule out an eventual leveling of American power as world security stabilizes and as other nations place greater emphasis on collective international action through the United Nations.
In contrast, the new draft sketches a world in which there is one dominant military power whose leaders "must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role."
 
Sent to Administrators
 The document is known in Pentagon parlance as the Defense Planning Guidance, an internal Administration policy statement that is distributed to the military leaders and civilian Defense Department heads to instruct them on how to prepare their forces, budgets and strategy for the remainder of the decade. The policy guidance is typically prepared every two years, and the current draft will yield the first such document produced after the end of the cold war.
Senior Defense Department officials have said the document will be issued by Defense Secretary Cheney this month. According to a Feb. 18 memorandum from Mr. Wolfowitz's deputy, Dale A. Vesser, the policy guidance will be issued with a set of "illustrative" scenarios for possible future foreign conflicts that might draw United States military forces into combat.
These scenarios, issued separately to the military services on Feb. 4, were detailed in a New York Times article last month. They postulated regional wars against Iraq and North Korea, as well as a Russian assault on Lithuania and smaller military contingencies that United States forces might confront in the future.
These hypothetical conflicts, coupled with the policy guidance document, are meant to give military leaders specific information about the kinds of military threats they should be prepared to meet as they train and equip their forces. It is also intended to give them a coherent strategy framework in which to evaluate various force and training options.
 
Fears of Proliferation
 In assessing future threats, the document places great emphasis on how "the actual use of weapons of mass destruction, even in conflicts that otherwise do not directly engage U.S. interests, could spur further proliferation which in turn would threaten world order."
"The U.S. may be faced with the question of whether to take military steps to prevent the development or use of weapons of mass destruction," it states, noting that those steps could include pre-empting an impending attack with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons "or punishing the attackers or threatening punishment of aggressors through a variety of means," including attacks on the plants that manufacture such weapons.
Noting that the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is up for renewal in 1995, the document says, "should it fail, there could ensue a potentially radical destabilizing process" that would produce unspecified "critical challenges which the U.S. and concerned partners must be prepared to address."
The draft guidance warns that "both Cuba and North Korea seem to be entering periods of intense crisis -- primarily economic, but also political -- which may lead the governments involved to take actions that would otherwise seem irrational." It adds, "the same potential exists in China."
For the first time since the Defense Planning Guidance process was initiated to shape national security policy, the new draft states that the fragmentation of the former Soviet military establishment has eliminated the capacity for any successor power to wage global conventional war.
But the document qualifies its assessment, saying, "we do not dismiss the risks to stability in Europe from a nationalist backlash in Russia or effort to re-incorporate into Russia the newly independent republics of Ukraine, Belarus and possibly others."
It says that though U.S. nuclear targeting plans have changed "to account for welcome developments in states of the former Soviet Union," American strategic nuclear weapons will continue to target vital aspects of the former Soviet military establishment. The rationale for the continuation of this targeting policy is that the United States "must continue to hold at risk those assets and capabilities that current -- and future -- Russian leaders or other nuclear adversaries value most" because Russia will remain "the only power in the world with the capability of destroying the United States."
Until such time as the Russian nuclear arsenal has been rendered harmless, "we continue to face the possibility of robust strategic nuclear forces in the hands of those who might revert to closed, authoritarian, and hostile regimes," the document says. It calls for the "early introduction" of a global anti-missile system.
 
Plan for Europe
 In Europe, the Pentagon paper asserts that "a substantial American presence in Europe and continued cohesion within the Western alliance remain vital," but to avoid a competitive relationship from developing, "we must seek to prevent the emergence of European-only security arrangements which would undermine NATO."
The draft states that with the elimination of United States short-range nuclear weapons in Europe and similar weapons at sea, the United States should not contemplate any withdrawal of its nuclear-strike aircraft based in Europe and, in the event of a resurgent threat from Russia, "we should plan to defend against such a threat" farther forward on the territories of Eastern Europe "should there be an Alliance decision to do so."
This statement offers an explicit commitment to defend the former Warsaw Pact nations from Russia. It suggests that the United States could also consider extending to Eastern and Central European nations security commitments similar to those extended to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab states along the Persian Gulf. And to help stabilize the economies and democratic development in Eastern Europe, the draft calls on the European Community to offer memberships to Eastern European countries as soon as possible.
In East Asia, the report says, the United States can draw down its forces further, but "we must maintain our status as a military power of the first magnitude in the area.
"This well enable the United States to continue to contribute to regional security and stability by acting as a balancing force and prevent the emergence of a vacuum or a regional hegemon." In addition, the draft warns that any precipitous withdrawal of United States military forces could provoke an unwanted response from Japan, and the document states, "we must also remain sensitive to the potentially destabilizing effects that enhanced roles on the part of our allies, particularly Japan but also possibly Korea, might produce."
In the event that peace negotiations between the two Koreas succeed, the draft recommends that the United States "should seek to maintain an alliance relationship with a unified democratic Korea."

The U.S must continue to aim nuclear arms at "those assets and capabilities that current -- and future -- Russian leaders or other nuclear adversaries value most."
 
4. Europe
 
The U.S must preserve a strong presence to maintain NATO alliance and Extend Western defense commitment into Eastern Europe "should there be an Alliance decision to do so."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Personal Finances;
Clintons Joined S.& L. Operator In an Ozark Real-Estate Venture

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Bill Clinton and his wife were business partners with the owner of a failing savings and loan association that was subject to state regulation early in his tenure as Governor of Arkansas, records show.
The partnership, a real estate joint venture that was developing land in the Ozarks, involved the Clintons and James B. McDougal, a former Clinton aide turned developer. It started in 1978, and at times money from Mr. McDougal's savings and loan was used to subsidize it. The corporation continues to this day, but does not appear to be active. 
 Mr. McDougal gave a detailed account of his relationship in several interviews in the last two weeks. This account, along with an examination of related local, state and Federal records and interviews with dozens of others in Arkansas, found the following:
*Available records covering the most active period of the real estate corporation, called Whitewater Development, appear to show that Mr. McDougal heavily subsidized it, insuring that the Clintons were under little financial risk in what turned out to be an unsuccessful enterprise. The corporation bought 200 acres of Ozark Mountain vacation property and planned to sell it in lots. During this period, the Clintons appear to have invested little money, so stood to lose little if the venture failed, but might have cashed in on their 50 percent interest if it had done well.
*The Clintons and Mr. McDougal disagree about what happened to Whitewater's records. Mr. McDougal says that at Mr. Clinton's request they were delivered to the Governor's mansion. The Clintons say many of them have disappeared. Many questions about the enterprise cannot be fully answered without the records.
*After Federal regulators found that Mr. McDougal's savings institution, Madison Guaranty, was insolvent, meaning it faced possible closure by the state, Mr. Clinton appointed a new state securities commissioner, who had been a lawyer in a firm that represented the savings and loan. Mr. Clinton and the commissioner deny giving any preferential treatment. The new commissioner approved two novel proposals to help the savings and loan that were offered by Hillary Clinton, Governor Clinton's wife and a lawyer. She and her firm had been retained to represent the association.
*The Clintons improperly deducted at least $5,000 on their personal tax returns in 1984 and 1985 for interest paid on a portion of at least $30,000 in bank loan payments that Whitewater made for them. The deductions saved them about $1,000 in taxes, but since the error was more than three years ago, Internal Revenue Service regulations do not require the Clintons to pay.
The complicated relationship between Mr. McDougal and the Clintons came to light in an investigation by The New York Times of the Clintons' tax records and business relationships. It raises questions of whether a governor should be involved in a business deal with the owner of a business regulated by the state and whether, having done so, the governor's wife through her law firm should be receiving legal fees for work done for the business.
 
Confusion Is Cited
 Asked about these matters, the Clintons retained two lawyers to answer questions. The lawyers said the improper tax deductions were honest errors, made because there was confusion over who really owned a certain piece of Whitewater property and who was responsible for the loan taken out to buy it, Whitewater or the Clintons.
The deed for the land and the loan papers are all in the Clintons' names.
The lawyers said they were not in a position to answer questions about where the money that went into Whitewater came from. But generally, they said they thought neither the Clintons nor Mr. McDougal had profited from the venture. They also said the Clintons were once liable for about $100,000 in bank loans that financed Whitewater's original purchase of land. But the lawyers have only been able to find original documents showing $5,000 that the Clintons paid.
Some questions about the relationship and the Clintons' role in it may be difficult to resolve because of differing accounts and the missing records.
The two lawyers representing the Clintons are Susan P. Thomases, a longtime friend, and Loretta Lynch, a campaign aide, who participated in several hours of interviews at Ms. Thomases' Manhattan offices Thursday and Friday.
 
Payments on Debt
 The records that are available, and Mrs. Thomases' account, show that Whitewater made payments between 1982 and 1985 on Mrs. Clinton's $30,000 real estate debt, reducing the debt by about $16,000 while also paying at least $14,000 in interest. At least one of those checks was signed by Mr. McDougal.
Mrs. Clinton originally borrowed the $30,000 from a bank also controlled by Mr. McDougal, Bank of Kingston, but "Hillary took the loan on behalf of the corporation," Ms. Thomases said. That, she explained, is why Whitewater made the payments.
The Clintons' 1984 and 1985 tax returns show that they took deductions for interest payments of $2,811 and $2,322 that Whitewater had made.
"It clearly is an error," Ms. Thomases said. She noted that the tax returns for those years were prepared by accountants in Arkansas.
The Clintons' gross income in 1984, as reported on their tax returns, was about $111,000 and they paid $22,280 in Federal taxes. In 1985, their reported income was about $102,000, and they paid $18,791 in Federal taxes.
 
Longtime Friendship
 Mr. Clinton and Mr. McDougal had been friends since the 1960's. When Mr. Clinton became the nation's youngest Governor at 32 years old, he took Mr. McDougal into his administration as an aide for economic development. It was at about this time that the men formed Whitewater.
A few years later Mr. McDougal, having left government in 1979, bought control of a small savings and loan association, Madison Guaranty, and built it into one of the largest state-chartered associations in Arkansas.
But over time, the savings and loan got in trouble, like many others around the country. Finally Federal regulators took the savings and loan away from Mr. McDougal, and a Federal grand jury charged him with fraud, though he was acquitted. The Clintons were not involved in those proceedings.
Mr. McDougal began having personal problems, too. He was found to be suffering from manic-depressive illness, though he was judged competent to stand trial. In the interviews, Mr. McDougal appeared stable, careful and calm.
A year after the Clintons and McDougals bought the Ozark Mountain property and founded Whitewater Development in 1979, the corporation bought a modular house for about $22,000 and placed it on one of its lots. That lot was then conveyed to Mrs. Clinton, and the deed indicates that she paid nothing for it. Ms. Thomases says this was an error by Whitewater. The deed, she said, should have shown the price and said that Mrs. Clinton paid.
But the house was carried on the books as a Whitewater corporate asset and used as a model house to attract other buyers, according to Whitewater records produced by Ms. Thomases. Because the records are incomplete, it is unclear exactly what happened. But about the same time, Mrs. Clinton personally borrowed $30,000 from Mr. McDougal's bank to pay for the house and the lot.
Ms. Thomases said Mrs. Clinton and the corporation regarded this as a corporate debt, though it was in Mrs. Clinton's name. The corporation included no one but the Clintons and the McDougals. It was this debt that Whitewater made payments on until the end of 1985.
One year after acquiring the property, Mrs. Clinton sold it for $27,500, with payments to be made over time, records show. It is not clear who received the buyer's down payment of $3,000. But Ms. Thomases said it was the corporation that took the loss on its books. A few years later, the buyer went bankrupt and stopped making payments, and then he died.
In 1988 Mrs. Clinton bought back the house from the estate of the buyer. Records show that she paid $8,000 and then resold the property a short time later for about $23,000, after closing costs. The Clintons reported a capital gain that year of $1,640.
Ms. Thomases explained that the capital gain was small because, as part of that transaction, Mrs. Clinton had to pay off Whitewater's remaining $13,000 debt on the property, originally incurred by Mrs. Clinton. The payments the previous owner had been making to Whitewater before he went bankrupt had been used to help pay off that debt.
 
Account Overdrawn
 It was during the period when Whitewater was making the Clintons' loan payments that Madison Guaranty was putting money into Whitewater.
For example, Whitewater's check ledger shows that Whitewater's account at Madison was overdrawn in 1984, when the corporation was making payments on the Clintons' loan. Money was deposited to make up the shortage from Madison Marketing, an affiliate of the savings and loan that derived its revenues from the institution, records also show.
It was also in 1984 that Madison started getting into trouble. Federal examiners studied its books that year, found that it was violating Arkansas regulations and determined that correcting the books to adjust improperly inflated profits would "result in an insolvent position," records of the 1984 examination show.
Arkansas regulators received the Federal report later that year, and under state law the securities commissioner was supposed to close any insolvent institution.
As the Governor is free to do at any time, Mr. Clinton appointed a new securities commissioner in January 1985. He chose Beverly Bassett Schaffer, a lawyer in one of the firms that had been representing Madison.
 
Fund-Raising Ideas
 Ms. Thomases, after talking to Mr. Clinton this week, said the Governor chose her because they were friends, and because he wanted to appoint a well qualified woman to an important post.
In interviews, Mrs. Schaffer, now a Fayetteville lawyer, said she did not remember the Federal examination of Madison but added that in her view, the findings were not "definitive proof of insolvency."
In 1985, Mrs. Clinton and her Little Rock law firm, the Rose firm, twice applied to the Securities Commission on behalf of Madison, asking that the savings and loan be allowed to try two novel plans to raise money.
Mrs. Schaffer wrote to Mrs. Clinton and another lawyer at the firm approving the ideas. "I never gave anybody special treatment," she said.
Madison was not able to raise additional capital. And by 1986 Federal regulators, who insured Madison's deposits, took control of the institution and ousted Mr. McDougal. Mrs. Schaffer supported the action.

HEADLINE: Ailing Gun Industry Confronts Outrage Over Glut of Violence

SERIES: 200 Millions Guns/First article of a series.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Improbable as it may seem at a time of escalating drug wars and senseless schoolyard shootouts, the American gun industry is staggering after a decade of sluggish sales.
This is not to say that guns are about to become scarce. In each of the last several years, four million to five million firearms -- including two million handguns -- were added to a vast civilian gun supply believed to total close to 200 million. And through the industry's recession a few companies have thrived by selling hundreds of thousands of $70, pocket-sized pistols each year to frightened people for self-protection, and sometimes to criminals. 
 But total sales of rifles, shotguns, pistols and revolvers peaked back in 1975, at more than six million. And so the gun companies, in the best corporate manner, now seek to entice more people to buy guns, and those who already own them to buy more.
 
Just a Business?
 An ordinary corporate goal -- and one that irreconcilably collides with the growing sense among many Americans of a nation bleeding from an oversupply of firepower.
That clash of perspectives is perhaps the most startling contrast in the world of America's 200 million guns. The gun story includes beer-can plinkers in the Arizona desert, deer hunters in Maine and Walter Mitty commandos in Miami who unwind by shooting paramilitary assault weapons. It includes Connecticut craftsmen who tool fine shotguns, crooked Indiana dealers who funnel weapons to Chicago's drug-selling gangs, the Bronx storekeeper who keeps a pistol under the counter and the Brooklyn teen-ager who last month shot two classmates dead in a high school hallway with a .38 revolver.
However America's guns are ultimately used, their story begins with the companies that make them. Revered as a bulwark of American freedom, reviled as accomplices in murder, gun makers just want to sell their products, like any other business.
 
A Too Durable Good
 While recession, public hostility, a decline in hunting and stiff competition from imports have all hurt sales, the industry is now beginning to worry about another, more unusual threat: its products last too long. Producers wonder whether the American market is finally getting saturated.
"We've woken up to the fact that these guns are not wearing out, and used guns are competing with our new production," said William B. Ruger Sr., chairman of Sturm, Ruger & Company of Southport, Conn., a leading manufacturer of handguns and rifles. "People are buying guns for half the money. I think that hurt sales of a lot of companies in the 1980's."
Gun critics might say to leave well enough alone. But for Mr. Ruger, a legendary gun designer who is proud of his products, part of the solution to market overload is "planned obsolescence." By that he does not mean making guns designed to fall apart, like plastic razors, but rather adopting innovative designs that would appeal to the technological lust inside every gun fancier.
"We need to get new products and new models out," said Mr. Ruger, who spoke from his new plant in Prescott, Ariz. There he is experimenting with titanium parts that might yield lighter, noncorrosive firearms and, he hopes without apology, a major new cycle of gun sales.
 
Linking Guns and Violence
 A business-as-usual approach outrages those who think more guns can mean only more murders, robberies, accidental shootings and suicides.
"Adding to the gun supply is the worst thing we could do right now," said Jeffrey Y. Muchnik, legislative director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, an advocacy group in Washington. "It's spiraling out of control. The more guns we have, the more people get shot and killed."
But the industry, and many gun owners, have ready responses.
"To blame the gun for its misuse is to avoid dealing with the real issue," said Ronald E. Stilwell, president of Colt's Manufacturing Company in West Hartford, Conn., the latest incarnation of a faltering company whose revolvers were credited with taming the West. "The issue is poverty, drugs, jobs," he said.
In words perhaps more typical of the gun world, Andrew Molchan, president of the National Association of Federally Licensed Firearms Dealers, said, "We're the excuse for the failure of the liberal courts, for the lawyers who screwed up the system, for the people who don't want to make hard decisions."
 
Change in Use
Tool of Hunter To Tool of Street
 The United States has long been a nation of gun owners. Self-consciously born of the frontier, its democratic tradition insured that its hunting lands, unlike in the Old World, were open to all. Today, about half of all households own at least one gun, with the proportion higher in rural areas, reflecting a continuing link with hunting.
But the kinds of guns Americans buy, and the reasons why they buy them, have shifted markedly.
As late as the 1950's, handguns accounted for only about one in five new gun sales, according to Federal data. Shotguns, for hunting birds, squirrels, rabbits and rodents, were first, followed by rifles. Annual sales of all types hovered below two million.
In the 1960's the market was transformed. In that decade of assassinations, riots and soaring crime rates, the sale of new guns surged, past three million in 1966, then past five million in 1968, the year Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were shot and cities burned.
Indicating social breakdown, much of the increase involved handguns, sales of which jumped from a half-million a year in the late 50's to two million a year by the early 70's. Now, nearly one of every two guns sold is a handgun.
Between domestic production and imports, which account for about one-fifth of new gun sales, the cumulative number of civilian guns in the country doubled between 1950 and 1970, then doubled again between 1970 and 1990, according to the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. An unknown but small fraction of them filtered into the criminal underground.
While most proposed controls focus on new guns, several million used guns also change hands each year. No one is sure of the exact number because most private transfers are exempt from Federal record-keeping rules.
 
Change in Industry
U.S. Makers Let Glory Days Fade
 Long centered in New England, the gun industry played an honored role in the early industrial development of the country, pioneering the use of precision machine tools. Today, while close to 1,000 companies and individuals are licensed to make civilian weapons, a handful of established companies dominate the field.
The industry is not a giant one. According to Commerce Department estimates, total wholesale shipments by domestic manufacturers of "small arms" in 1989 were valued at $1.2 billion. That was less than one-fourth the wholesale value of "bolts, nuts, rivets and washers."
Sturm, Ruger, the only publicly held company, is believed to be one of the more secure and profitable of the major gun makers. Its firearms sales in 1990, including exports, totaled $122 million, and its domestic sales of around a half-million weapons gave the company some 15 percent of the American market, Mr. Ruger said. While in the late 1980's Sturm, Ruger was the second-largest producer, it was first in 1990 as rifle and shotgun sales of Remington Arms Company, the former leader, fell sharply.
Still, today nearly all the largest producers have headquarters in New England. But the glory days are over. Like many American industries, gun makers entered the 1980's with too much production capacity, outdated equipment, high labor costs and complacent management. The slumping sales were partly due to recessions and partly, acknowledged Mr. Stilwell of Colt, because "our manufacturers weren't terribly responsive to the end users, to what kinds of firearms and features they were looking for."
Colt, after a long strike, was purchased in 1990 by a consortium of investors, the union and the Connecticut state pension fund. Now it is struggling to get back on its feet. Foreign conglomerates have bought up some American companies, including Smith & Wesson, the largest handgun producer. Some companies went bankrupt; others have moved their production lines to Mexico or elsewhere. Sturm, Ruger, for example, does its manufacturing in New Hampshire and Arizona, where wages and taxes are lower.
 
Rise of Semiautomatics
 In the 1980's, amid declining sales for most kinds of firearms, one giant shift in gun fashion yielded a flood of new sales. But in a tale reminiscent of the automobile industry, the major American gun companies were caught flat-footed.
The shift was in the handgun of choice, from revolvers, the traditional pride of American producers, to semiautomatic pistols. It was led by many police departments and other law enforcement agencies, responding especially to the rising firepower of drug rings. It also involved target shooters and other private buyers who find the pistols more convenient or appealing.
Compared to standard revolvers, which hold six cartridges in a revolving cylinder, semiautomatic pistols hold cartridges in the handle that are spring-loaded into the firing chamber with each shot. The magazines often hold 10 to 15 cartridges at a time, and reloading is lightning fast.
"The semiautomatic pistol is the only part of the gun business that has grown in recent years," said David M. Guthrie, an industry analyst with Morgan, Keegan & Company, a brokerage house in Memphis. Certainly, sales of domestic as well as foreign pistols have soared as those of revolvers have plummeted. But unable to match the quality and desired technical features offered by European companies, especially in the popular 9-millimeter semiautomatic, American producers largely missed out on the lucrative upper end of the pistol boom.
Today, many police officers and most Federal agents, including those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the firearms bureau, and even the military, carry brands like the Austrian Glock or the German Sig Sauer or the Italian Beretta. Serious target shooters have tended to follow suit, choosing foreign-made pistols that cost $550 to $800 each, twice the price of the revolvers they used to buy.
In a symbolic blow, the United States military in 1985 selected the Beretta as its sidearm of choice; the pistols are produced at an American subsidiary of the Italian company.
 
Change in Society
Urban Ills Bring $70 Pistol to Life
 But on the low end of the pistol market -- small, cheaply made low-caliber weapons -- a few upstart California companies have more than held their own. Semiautomatic versions of the "Saturday night special," pistols like the Raven .25 and the Davis .380, selling for $60 to $100, were some of the fastest sellers of the 1980's.
Guns like these are defended as offering an inexpensive means of self-protection. They are also favorites of gun runners and urban thugs, and are some of the most common guns seen on the streets of New York City.
Also prospering through the slump were some small companies making low-cost paramilitary-style assault pistols, good for spraying up to 30 bullets at a time without great accuracy. These became popular toys for shooting-range commandos, and tools of swagger and intimidation for drug lords.
The old-line companies turn up their noses at the low-end producers. "It's interesting to notice," Mr. Ruger said, "that some guns are naturally more convenient or cheap for some sort of sick head to get into trouble with."
 
Violence on the Cheap
 Sturm, Ruger and Colt, too, make guns that critics say should be called assault weapons. Both sell powerful semiautomatic rifles that can hold clips of 30 cartridges, often bought by Army veterans who enjoy shooting guns modeled after those they carried in combat. The civilian versions differ mainly in their inability to fire on full automatic, bursts of bullets with a single trigger pull.
Mr. Stilwell of Colt strenuously objected to the characterization of his company's "Sporter" rifle as an assault weapon. "It's not more or less lethal than any other semiautomatic firearm," he said.
In truth, a vast majority of crimes are committed with prosaic handguns of all kinds and makes. It takes nothing fancy to rob or murder, and price or availability is usually the determining factor.
"No drug dealer or criminal is going to lay down $900 for a gun," said Michael Zirmo, a New York City gun shop owner who appraises weapons seized by Federal agents.
Guns like the Raven and Davis may be used in crime out of proportion to their numbers. Still, traditional handguns, like Smith & Wesson revolvers, are most commonly involved in violence simply because tens of millions are in circulation.
 
Change in Marketing
Makers See Sport As Path to Growth
 Gun producers know they must work to foster a new generation of gun enthusiasts. The push for gun controls is only one of the obstacles. As more of the country becomes suburban, hunting becomes more difficult, and riflery is no longer so popular as a summer camp or school activity. The traditional passage of gun and hunting lore from father to son may be on the wane.
With crime so pervasive, the demand for guns for self-protection is presumably not yet saturated. Yet most producers prefer to link their prospects to shooting sports.
"Some try to portray shooting as an archaic activity," Mr. Stilwell said. "I don't think that's true." Hunting, he argued, while dwindling, is not about to disappear and may resurge as forests become overstocked with animals. Target ranges, he said, are filled with families and young people. Many in the gun business see women as a huge potential market -- potential buyers both for target sports and self-protection.
Gun companies and the National Rifle Association are sponsoring new kinds of target sports that they hope will draw more people into the world of guns, and create an endless market for new designs. "Target shooting today is more than just popping holes in paper," Mr. Stilwell said. At so-called action events, shooters may fire in quick succession at varied targets, simulating hunting or combat situations. Competing in such events often requires semiautomatic pistols or rifles that can hold large numbers of cartridges.
As for the next generation of potential buyers, Mr. Ruger said, "I take a lot for granted. I think the interest in firearms, in shooting and developing these skills is intrinsically interesting to a lot of people."
"We're perfectly content to remain a small company," he said.
NEXT: The culture of gun owners.

HEADLINE: Off-Target Business Proposal for New York City

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
New York City has paid little attention to economic development in recent years, spending far less than other cities and focusing its efforts poorly, government and business leaders say. In recent years it has aimed, with little success, at propping up sagging businesses, and all but ignored growth industries that might generate more jobs.
This state of affairs, the leaders say, leaves the city particularly vulnerable, not just in this recession, but in future years. The lack of support for promising local companies, public amenities and commercial projects that might stimulate economic growth leaves New York City sorely disadvantaged just when competition with other cities is intensifying. 
 The numbers tell much of the story. Over the last five years, the Federal, state and city funds devoted to economic development in the city, as distinct from tax breaks to private developers, have totaled about $70 million a year. That is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the city's expense budget and about 1 percent of its capital budget.
 
Falling Behind Other Cities
 The city does not just spend tiny sums relative to its own resources; it spends little in comparison to other large cities. According to a report being put together by a mayoral task force committee, New York has spent less than a third of the average of four other large cities on capital investments in economic development over the last five years, on a per-capita basis.
The city does not have any of the large-scale economic development projects that fostered jobs and growth in previous years -- Lincoln Center, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the World Trade Center or Battery Park City. Other cities, meanwhile, have built convention centers, sports stadiums, and airports that shame New York's and make it harder for the city to compete.
In the last few years, New York has been spending large sums to improve its aging roadways, bridges and airports. But that simply maintains already-existing operations, rather than creating new enterprises that could generate more growth.
 
Promotion by Default
 "We do economic development with a small 'e' and a small 'd'," conceded Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the former Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development and a member of the mayoral panel. Indeed, since the early 1980's, the city has generally promoted economic development by default, by granting across-the-board tax exemptions, mainly to support private real estate developers.
At one time, such a policy had considerable public support. Construction creates jobs and income, and the availability of more commercial space may have helped take the pressure off escalating rents, which were driving businesses from the city.
But what started in a small way has become the city's primary economic development tool. In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1991, the last year for which figures are available, the Finance Department calculated that the city granted $507 million in tax exemptions for nonresidential commercial properties in what it classified as "economic development incentives."
Of course, some of the tax exemptions are deferrals, which means the city will eventually recapture those revenues. Still, such heavy reliance on exemptions carries certain costs. It increases the burden on those who do not enjoy similar tax-exempt status, and reduces the potential contribution those taxpayers could otherwise make to the local economy.
Exemptions that are across the board also deprive public officials of much say in determining what kind of economic development actually takes place. In one property-tax exemption program, for instance, movie theaters, fast-food restaurant chains and sports-fitness clubs were among those that benefited, even though there seemed to be little danger of them moving to New Jersey or elsewhere, taking their jobs with them, given the local nature of their business.
"Tax exemptions are a very inexact way to address economic development needs," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said. "It shouldn't be the cornerstone of our philosophy, which it is."
Only the most ardent of real estate developers are still arguing that what New York needs now is more subsidies for new construction, particularly of Manhattan office buildings. But when one looks at the programs the city has at its disposal for making direct investments, they, too, seem to reflect outdated notions about the local economy.
 
Shoring Up Brooklyn
 At a time when the city's central business district in Manhattan is reeling, for instance, the mayoral task force committee found that New York City has devoted nearly three-quarters of its capital spending on economic development over the last five years to shoring up downtown Brooklyn.
The idea was to create office space at rents that would be more competitive with those in New Jersey, and a number of companies, like the Chase Manhattan Bank and Bear, Stearns & Company, did indeed move some of their employees there rather than place them in locations outside the city. But in the absence of expenditures elsewhere, Brooklyn has become the primary focal point of the city's policies.
In addition, many of the city's programs have been geared to helping traditional manufacturers, even though that sector has been losing jobs for 30 years -- including during the 1980's, one of the greatest economic booms in the city's history. It was not until last year, for instance, that the city created a loan program for retail and service companies. But the city has spent almost nothing to support its high-growth industries, like finance, communications or international trade.
"It's classic New York arrogance," said John H. Alschuler Jr., a principal in Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, an economic consulting firm that provided research to the mayoral task force committee. "Government here is using its economic development programs in a shortsighted strategy of social redistribution, and that has resulted in a dangerous underinvestment in industries which could be powerful engines of growth."
 
Little Small Business Aid
 The city has committed tiny amounts of its own resources, for instance, to small businesses. It has set aside just $1 million for microloans of $5,000 to $50,000, and last year it committed $1.6 million from its revolving loan fund for small companies.
Yet about half of all new jobs come from new companies, said David Birch, the president of Cognetics Inc., an economic research firm based in Cambridge, Mass., which maintains a database on more than 11 million companies. Of course, many of those small concerns quickly fail. But Mr. Birch's research shows that 6 percent or 7 percent of those small and medium-sized companies succeed. And they are the ones expected to generate 77 percent of future employment growth.
"To the extent that we can help small businesses, that's the best job-creating vehicle that I know of," said Arthur C. Levitt Jr., the former head of the American Stock Exchange who is the chairman of the panel, the Mayoral Task Force Commiteee on Incentives and Tax Policy.
Instead of promoting small businesses that seem poised for growth, the city has expended time helping to put together large financial incentive packages for large companies that threatened to move employees or leave entirely: $230 million for Chase Manhattan, $100 million for NBC, and, in one of the latest efforts, $145 million for the city's five commodities exchanges.
"In each of those cases, we were confident that they would have left and that the benefits of them staying far exceeded the cost of what we gave them," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
The same could be said for many companies. But the question is, which ones should the city be subsidizing, and for how much?
Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, says the city has no rigorous way of evaluating the support it gives to various industries and companies. "We can't say, so how do we know if this is a reasonable allocation of our resources?" she asks. As some critics have pointed out, a number of companies the city has supported have done nothing but shrink their work forces since those deals were struck.
 
Why So Few Changes?
 If there is widespread agreement that the city's approach to economic development is ill-suited to present problems, why have there not been more changes? For a long time, few people paid much, if any, attention to it. The economy was growing handsomely, and worrying about what the city was doing to invest in its future may have seemed unnecessary. That is obviously no longer the case.
"These are tough economic times, and the tougher the times, the more people start to question if we're on the right track," said City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who has sponsored legislation to bring the city's economic development arms under more direct City Council control.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero acknowledges that many of the city's policies reflect past realities instead of future challenges. But she says it is difficult to chart a new course when financial resources are so constrained, or to buck the political pressure for a continuation of the city's subsidy policies.
Certainly one factor influencing the direction that the city's economic development approach has taken is the powerful role of the real estate community in New York, and the absence of any organized opposition from the rest of the business community to the public subsidies they have enjoyed.
 
Hostility vs. Boosterism
 Critics of the city's policies also blame a general hostility that seems to exist in New York to development that contrasts with the boosterism and enthusiastic backing given to large projects in many other cities. Almost all of the developments that the city or state agencies have tried to sponsor in recent years have run up against hearings, litigation and delay, by which time a project can seem far less sensible than it once did.
What is becoming more widely accepted is that the city can no longer afford to take its economic development for granted. Even when the recession ends, many of the city's underlying problems will remain. It is competing not just with Jersey City or Stamford, Conn., but with Tampa, Fla., Dallas and Atlanta, where the costs of doing business are significantly lower.
"There's a greater need now than ever before for a strategic plan for the city," Mr. Levitt, the committee chairman, said. "When the recession ends, unless there is a clearer vision of where we are going, there will be thousands of fewer jobs and hundreds of fewer companies."

DATE: Concept approved 1982; opened 1985.
 
OCCUPANCY: 65 percent leased.
 
RESULTS: Originally intended to be occupoed entirely by private businesses, but slack demand led to the leasing of 16 percent of the project to the School Construction Authority.
 
COST TO PUBLIC: $23 million Federal grant.
 
JOBS CREATED OR SAVED: 1,200 jobs out a planned 1,7000
 
2. Metrotech
 
SCOPE AND GOAL: New office complex in downtown Brooklyn intended to retain office tenants like back-office operations of financial services companies planning to leave the city for cheaper suburan rents, and to draw more office development nearby.
 
DATE: Concept approved 1980; first building opened 1990.
 
OCCUPANCY: Buildings opened so far are more than 95 percent leased.
 
RESULTS: Attracted some provate companies like Bear, Stearns and Chase Manhattan with major financial incentives from the city, but recent tenants leasing in the area are mainly public agencies like the Internal Revenue Sercie and the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office.
 
COST TO PUBLIC: At least $300 million.
 
JOBS CREATED OR SAVED: 7,700 jobs retained.
 
3. Brooklyn Army Terminal
 
SCOPE AND GOAL: Converting the closed 97-acre military terminal into an industrial park to house manufacturers being driven out of town or out of business by rising rents.
 
DATE: First phase approved 1983; opened 1987.
 
OCCUPANCY: First phase is 100 percent leased; second phase, 30 to 40 percent.
 
RESULTS: 41 companies have moved in so far, but the city is spending $6.2 million to renovate another 240,000 square feet when it still has about 400,000 square feet vacant since October 1990.
 
COST TO PUBLIC: $78 million in renovations so far.
 
JOBS CREATED OR SAVED: 2,000 jobs out of a projected 4,000 when completed.
 
4. Land Sales Program
 
SCOPE AND GOAL: Selling city-owned vacant lots and derelict buildings to commercial and industrial companies that promise to redevelop them for productive use and to create jobs, especially in poor and rundown neighborhoods.
 
DATE: Ongoing; began in 1977.
 
OCCUPANCY: 485 sites around the city were sold through June 1991.
 
RESULTS: State Comptroller's 1991 audit found that many of the sold properties had not been developed, job claims were frequently overstated and the city did not follow up to make sure buyers kept their promises.
 
COST TO PUBLIC: City gained $69 million from sales.
 
JOBS CREATED OR SAVED: No figures available.

HEADLINE: AIDS Is Following Mexican Migrant Workers Back Home From the U.S.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZINAPECUARO, Mexico

 BODY:
As far back as people here can remember, the sons of this quiet market town have gone north to work in fields and factories on what they call "the other side." And for every story of loneliness and sacrifice, it seems, there is a television set, a pickup truck or a house with fresh paint.
In recent years, though, men from Zinapecuaro have come home from the United States with a terrible secret. They have brought AIDS. 
 At the small public hospital in this town northwest of Mexico City, where a cardboard sign offers hangnail removals for $4 and births for $40, the doctors count six deaths from the disease. In a box hidden under the hospital director's couch, anonymous charts show that seven more townspeople carry the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
 
Different Taboos
 Yet doctors and epidemiologists say that even such official statistics describe only the beginnings of a phenomenon that remains submerged in denial and social taboos.
The nurse in charge of AIDS treatment at the Zinapecuaro hospital, having carefully traced the sexual partnerships of her patients, concludes that scores of local people are probably infected. Few of them want to be tested for the virus.
National health officials in Mexico City emphasize that even when the suspicious cases are added to those in which AIDS infection can be clearly traced to the victim's migration to the United States, the connection still accounts for only a small fraction of the 9,000 cases of the disease reported in Mexico -- third highest in the Western Hemisphere after the United States and Brazil.
Given the millions of Mexicans who cross legally and illegally into the United States each year, the number of migrants who return with AIDS appears minuscule. But as the epidemic in Mexico has begun to level off among homosexual men and victims of a blood supply that was still poorly screened and badly contaminated less than five years ago, the spread of AIDS among migrants has become a growing concern.
"It is not something that I would describe as a major problem," said the director of the National Council for the Prevention and Control of AIDS, Dr. Carlos del Rio. "But there is clearly a potential problem."
 
Money, and Pain
 Researchers say the danger arises from the difficult lives of undocumented workers, the different sexual mores of two neighboring societies and the failings of AIDS education in both countries. All may combine to haunt poor rural communities like this one that have long bought sustenance with the cheap labor of their citizens in the United States.
"The uproar will come later, in a future not so distant," said the head of the Government AIDS program in Michoacan state, Dr. Yolanda Pineda. "But there are other towns like Zinapecuaro."
In the small number of states where the idyllic farmlands and volcanic hills sometimes obscure a poverty that has almost left whole towns to their women and children, the closer link between migration and AIDS is already visible. Of the 323 cases of AIDS and H.I.V. infection that have been reported in Michoacan, for instance, 110, or 34 percent, have been people who said they had lived in the United States.
While Mexican migration patterns have changed since the 1970's, with more women and families joining the flow of male job-seekers, it is the archetypal lonely young men who most concern officials like Dr. del Rio.
For months at a time, the men are separated from wives or girlfriends and from the comparatively rigid Roman Catholic society of their rural towns, and many of them are earning more money than they might have dreamed.
Almost wherever they land, activities that put them at risk of infection tend to be more available than cheap health care, AIDS-prevention programs, or information in Spanish about the disease.
Even at isolated migrant labor camps, drug-using prostitutes might show up on paydays. In Watsonville, Calif., near the heart of an agricultural area, AIDS-prevention advocates there say that prostitutes and transvestite homosexuals gather at a dozen or more bars frequented by the Mexican laborers.
And while intravenous drug use is virtually nonexistent in rural Mexico, some of the poorest transplants to Watsonville find it upon arrival. The Pajaro River levee, a favorite spot for migrants to camp, is also a place where heroin users have congregated to shoot up.
"The young guys are really at that adventurous stage in their lives, and for them this is the big city," said Ruth Lopez, the manager of an ambitious AIDS outreach program run by Salud Para la Gente, a state-financed clinic in Watsonville. "There's easy access to the women. There's easy access to the men. And there's very easy access to the I.V. drugs.
A few researchers who have begun to study the link between AIDS and the migrants' sexual activity say that lacking female company, Mexican workers who consider themselves heterosexual may have sexual relations with other men, so long as they are dominant in the relationship.
 
Virus Passed On to Wives
 Men who may be openly homosexual in the United States are also far more likely to have girlfriends or wives in Mexico, creating a viral bridge that has already contributed to increasing rates of infection among both sexes.
"All of the evidence suggests that the migration produces changes in sexual behavior," said Mario Bronfman, a sociologist at the Colegio de Mexico who has studied the link between migration and AIDS in Michoacan and California.
If the meeting of the two worlds sounds dissolute in Watsonville, it is tragic in towns like Purepero, Michoacan. There, a young factory worker named Lourdes Duarte tells quietly how the two worlds came apart for her and the local boy she married, Rogelio Ruiz.
She knew Mr. Ruiz from childhood. He went away to Southern California but came back for her. After they married and moved to Long Beach, though, she found herself struggling for his affections with a Philippine man who had been his lover before her.
Miss Duarte said she had asked her husband a thousand times why he had married her, but never received much of an answer. "This is a very quiet little town, and there are a lot of things that men and women have hidden," she said. "I think he wanted people to think he was a man."
In the first hours of 1989, seven years after she left Mr. Ruiz, he came home to die. He lasted only a day in Purepero, she said, most of it in a storeroom where his parents hid him away. His coffin was sealed, the town gravedigger said. But only Mr. Ruiz's father and brother would help the old man lower it into the ground.
 
Incomprehension and Cruelty
 Such attitudes still cast shadows across the life and feelings of Miss Duarte, who has tested negative for the virus.
Still, they barely find a place among the incidents of incomprehension and cruelty that doctors and AIDS workers recall in Michoacan: the widow and her children who were run out of their small town and had their belongings burned after her husband died of AIDS; the young physician forced to flee a village near Patzcuaro when he tried to trace the partners of a person with AIDS who was known to have been promiscuous; the grotesque scene in the city of La Piedad, in which a family sequestered its son in a back room as he died, refusing to touch him and covering themselves with sheets when they had to enter.
In Zinapecuaro, a dark-haired woman of 22 seems to struggle with the town's harshness each time she leaves her parents' tiny concrete-block home.
The woman, who asked that her name not be used, was infected with H.I.V. by the baker she married at 17. He died nearly five years ago, and health officials say he was apparently infected through sex with a well-known town dentist who died earlier. Maria Audelia Chavez, the nurse in charge of AIDS program at Zinapecuaro hospital, said the dentist was one of at least three local men thought to have contracted the virus in the United States.
Bouncing her cheery, year-old daughter by another man on her lap, the young woman says that after bouts of illness, she feels fine. She worries about her daughter, who has tested negative for the virus so far, but she has found a way to put aside the whispers and whistles that often trail her down the dirt streets by her home.
"This is a small town and everybody knows everything," she says. "But I don't suppose I am the only one."

HEADLINE: Iraqi Aide Meets Jordanian King on Sanctions

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, March 7

 BODY:
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister met with King Hussein of Jordan today en route to the United Nations headquarters, where he is expected to try to head off pressure for harsh measures over Iraq's failure to cooperate in dismantling its weapons program.
The Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, met with King Hussein and with the Jordanian Prime Minister, Sharif Zaid Bin Shakir, the Jordanian press agency said. A Jordanian official, who insisted on not being identified, said Mr. Aziz had asked for help in persuading the United Nations Security Council to ease sanctions against his country. 
 Mr. Aziz, President Saddam Hussein's top envoy in the negotiations leading up to the Persian Gulf war, set out on his trip after new accusations that Iraq has blocked United Nations inspectors assigned to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in line with the Security Council's cease-fire resolutions ending the gulf war a year ago.
A United Nations team assigned to destroy equipment used to manufacture long-range missiles left Iraq late last month, saying it was unable to perform its task because of obstacles placed by the Iraqis.
Iraq has said the equipment in question could be converted to civilian use or used to make short-range missiles allowed under the United Nations provisions concerning Iraq's weaponry.
That dispute was only the latest in a series of confrontations between the Iraqis and the United Nations inspection teams since the inspections began in May 1991.
The official Iraqi press agency, monitored in Cyprus, said Mr. Aziz led a delegation of "officials and experts." They traveled overland to Jordan because the route is Iraq's only link with the rest of world because of the international sanctions that followed the invasion of Kuwait. The agency said Mr. Aziz would address the Security Council on Wednesday and explain Iraq's position on the resolutions.
In addition to warning of possible military action, the United States raised the prospect of seizing Iraqi assets frozen in foreign countries after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The assets, estimated at $2 billion to $5 billion, are mostly held in the United States and Britain, which led the coalition in the war against Iraq last year.
In meetings with the Jordanian officials, Mr. Aziz was seeking help in easing economic sanctions the United Nations imposed on Iraq during the crisis, a Jordanian said.
The Jordanian did not elaborate on Mr. Aziz's request or how Jordan might respond, but indicated that Iraq wanted King Hussein to intercede with the United States.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Pentagon's Plan: 'Prevent the Re-Emergence of a New Rival'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Pentagon's Feb. 18 draft of the Defense Planning Guidance for the Fiscal Years 1994-1999: 
 This Defense Planning guidance addresses the fundamentally new situation which has been created by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the disintegration of the internal as well as the external empire, and the discrediting of Communism as an ideology with global pretensions and influence. The new international environment has also been shaped by the victory of the United States and its coalition allies over Iraqi aggression -- the first post-cold-war conflict and a defining event in U.S. global leadership. In addition to these two victories, there has been a less visible one, the integration of Germany and Japan into a U.S.-led system of collective security and the creation of a democratic "zone of peace."

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
DEFENSE STRATEGY OBJECTIVES
 Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power. These regions include Western Europe, East Asia, the territory of the former Soviet Union, and Southwest Asia.
There are three additional aspects to this objective: First, the U.S. must show the leadership necessary to establish and protect a new order that holds the promise of convincing potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests. Second, in the non-defense areas, we must account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order. Finally, we must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role. An effective reconstitution capability is important here, since it implies that a potential rival could not hope to quickly or easily gain a predominant military position in the world.
The second objective is to address sources of regional conflict and instability in such a way as to promote increasing respect for international law, limit international violence, and encourage the spread of democratic forms of government and open economic systems. These objectives are especially important in deterring conflicts or threats in regions of security importance to the United States because of their proximity (such as Latin America), or where we have treaty obligations or security commitments to other nations. While the U.S. cannot become the world's "policeman," by assuming responsibility for righting every wrong, we will retain the pre-eminent responsibility for addressing selectively those wrongs which threaten not only our interests, but those of our allies or friends, or which could seriously unsettle international relations. Various types of U.S. interests may be involved in such instances: access to vital raw materials, primarily Persian Gulf oil; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, threats to U.S. citizens from terrorism or regional or local conflict, and threats to U.S. society from narcotics trafficking.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It is improbable that a global conventional challenge to U.S. and Western security will re-emerge from the Eurasian heartland for many years to come. Even in the highly unlikely event that some future leadership in the former Soviet Union adopted strategic aims of recovering the lost empire or otherwise threatened global interests, the loss of Warsaw Pact allies and the subsequent and continuing dissolution of military capability would make any hope of success require several years or more of strategic and doctrinal re-orientation and force regeneration and redeployment, which in turn could only happen after a lengthy political realignment and re-orientation to authoritarian and aggressive political and economic control. Furthermore, any such political upheaval in or among the states of the former U.S.S.R. would be much more likely to issue in internal or localized hostilities, rather than a concerted strategic effort to marshal capabilities for external expansionism -- the ability to project power beyond their borders.
There are other potential nations or coalitions that could, in the further future, develop strategic aims and a defense posture of region-wide or global domination. Our strategy must now refocus on precluding the emergence of any potential future global competitor. But because we no longer face either a global threat or a hostile, non-democratic power dominating a region critical to our interests, we have the opportunity to meet threats at lower levels and lower costs -- as long as we are prepared to reconstitute additional forces should the need to counter a global threat re-emerge. . . .
 
REGIONAL THREATS AND RISK

With the demise of a global military threat to U.S. interests, regional military threats, including possible conflicts arising in and from the territory of the former Soviet Union, will be of primary concern to the U.S. in the future. These threats are likely to arise in regions critical to the security of the U.S. and its allies, including Europe, East Asia, the Middle East and Southwest Asia, and the territory of the former Soviet Union. We also have important interests at stake in Latin America, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In both cases, the U.S. will be concerned with preventing the domination of key regions by a hostile power. . . .
 
Former Soviet Union

The former Soviet state achieved global reach and power by consolidating control over the resources in the territory of the former U.S.S.R. The best means of assuring that no hostile power is able to consolidate control over the resources within the former Soviet Union is to support its successor states (especially Russia and Ukraine) in their efforts to become peaceful democracies with market-based economies. A democratic partnership with Russia and the other republics would be the best possible outcome for the United States. At the same time, we must also hedge against the possibility that democracy will fail, with the potential that an authoritarian regime bent on regenerating aggressive military power could emerge in Russia, or that similiar regimes in other successor republics could lead to spreading conflict within the former U.S.S.R. or Eastern Europe.

 	 	 		. . .	 	For the immediate future, key U.S. concerns will be the ability of Russia and the other republics to demilitarize their societies, convert their military industries to civilian production, eliminate or, in the case of Russia, radically reduce their nuclear weapons inventory, maintain firm command and control over nuclear weapons, and prevent leakage of advanced military technology and expertise to other countries.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Western Europe
 NATO continues to provide the indispensable foundation for a stable security environment in Europe. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to preserve NATO as the primary instrument of Western defense and security, as well as the channel for U.S. influence and participation in European security affairs. While the United States supports the goal of European integration, we must seek to prevent the emergence of European-only security arrangements which would undermine NATO, particularly the alliance's integrated command structure.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
East-Central Europe

The end of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union have gone a long way toward increasing stability and reducing the military threat to Europe. The ascendancy of democratic reformers in the Russian republic, should this process continue, is likely to create a more benign polcy toward Eastern Europe. However, the U.S. must keep in mind the long history of conflict between the states of Eastern Europe, as well as the potential for conflict between the states of Eastern Europe and those of the former Soviet Union. . . .
The most promising avenues for anchoring the east-central Europeans into the West and for stabilizing their democratic institutions is their participation in Western political and economic organizations. East-central European membership in the (European Community) at the earliest opportunity, and expanded NATO liaison. . . .
The U.S. could also consider extending to the east-central European states security commitments analogous to those we have extended to Persian Gulf states.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Should there be a re-emergence of a threat from the Soviet Union's successor state, we should plan to defend against such a threat in Eastern Europe, should there be an alliance decision to do so.
 
East Asia and Pacific
 . . . Defense of Korea will likely remain one of the most demanding major regional contingencies. . . . Asia is home to the world's greatest concentration of traditional Communist states, with fundamental values, governance, and policies decidedly at variance with our own and those of our friends and allies.
To buttress the vital political and economic relationships we have along the Pacific rim, we must maintain our status as a military power of the first magnitude in the area. This will enable the U.S. to continue to contribute to regional security and stability by acting as a balancing force and prevent emergence of a vacuum or a regional hegemon.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Middle East and Southwest Asia
 In the Middle East and Southwest Asia, our overall objective is to remain the predominant outside power in the region and preserve U.S. and Western access to the region's oil. We also seek to deter further aggression in the region, foster regional stability, protect U.S. nationals and property, and safeguard our access to international air and seaways. As demonstrated by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, it remains fundamentally important to prevent a hegemon or alignment of powers from dominating the region. This pertains especially to the Arabian peninsula. Therefore, we must continue to play a strong role through enhanced deterrence and improved cooperative security.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We will seek to prevent the further development of a nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent. In this regard, we should work to have both countries, India and Pakistan, adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to place their nuclear energy facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. We should discourage Indian hegemonic aspirations over the other states in South Asia and on the Indian Ocean. With regard to Pakistan, a constructive U.S.-Pakistani military relationship will be an important element in our strategy to promote stable security conditions in Southwest Asia and Central Asia. We should therefore endeavor to rebuild our military relationship given acceptable resolution of our nuclear concerns.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Latin America
 Cuba's growing domestic crisis holds out the prospect for positive change, but over the near term, Cuba's tenuous internal situation is likely to generate new challenges to U.S. policy. Consequently, our programs must provide capabilities to meet a variety of Cuban contingencies which could include an attempted repetition of the Mariel boatlift, a military provocation against the U.S. or an American ally, or political instability and internal conflict in Cuba.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Far Right;
Duke's Followers Lean to Buchanan

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 7

 BODY:
Some subscribers to "The Truth at Last," a far-right publication partial to stories like "Negroes Never Had a Civilization -- Are Far Behind White Race in Mental Development," recently got something else mailed from the same address: campaign literature for Patrick J. Buchanan.
The Buchanan campaign says it had nothing to do with the mailing, which it says was unauthorized and apparently resulted from someone who picked up campaign literature and mailed it on his own. 
 But the incident illustrates the way Mr. Buchanan's angry conservative campaign is being embraced by many of the white-power and neo-Nazi groups at the darkest corner of American politics. Many are showing more interest in Presidential politics than at any time since George Wallace's Presidential campaign in 1968.
 
Conservative Thunder
 No one suggests such backers make up more than a tiny fraction of Mr. Buchanan's support. And he is quick to say he has neither sought nor wants such support.
"I don't welcome the support of anyone who is voting out of hatred of any group or out of bigotry," he has said. "We don't want it."
But critics and organizations who follow far-right groups say Mr. Buchanan, who has stolen the conservative thunder from the former Klansman David Duke, has done nothing to repudiate his most extreme admirers or to distance himself from Mr. Duke.
And some say that at a time when far-right groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, are openly pursuing an electoral strategy, Mr. Buchanan, consciously or not, is sending a message that goes far beyond a challenge to President Bush.
"What Buchanan has catalyzed is a racist movement, whether or not he is personally anti-Semitic," said Leonard Zeskind, research director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, a group that monitors the activities of so-called hate groups. "I don't know exactly what it will produce, but one of the things I expect it to produce is an extremist, conservative movement, in which race, ethnicity, nativism, nationalism, play a greater role than the anti-communism of the past."
 
Raw Nerves
 In his columns and in his campaign, Mr. Buchanan has touched some of the rawest nerves on race and ethnicity in American life. His campaign in the South has featured advertisements showing white families that are said to be imperiled by racial quotas. Some commercials warn that a restrictive immigration policy is needed to prevent the United States from becoming a "third world country."
In the past, Mr. Buchanan has asked, "Who speaks for Euro-Americans, who founded the United States?" But he has denied any racist content to his campaign.
"There has got to be someone who speaks for the victims of quotas, and I'm that guy," he said.
He said that "all Americans should be treated equally" and that he did not support group entitlements. "I believe in individual rights," he said.
But Mr. Buchanan has done almost nothing to distance himself from Mr. Duke. Asked how he differed from Mr. Duke, Mr. Buchanan said: "What his views are, I really don't care. I have my own views and I argue from my own vantage point."
But the similarities between the two men's views have not gone unnoticed on the far right. In obscure racist and anti-Semitic journals and in interviews, many of those usually thought to be outside the standard electoral system voice support for Mr. Buchanan.
 
'Two Dukes'
 A recent issue of "Instauration," a far-right publication, says: "In one sense, Pat Buchanan can be viewed as a clean Duke," and adds, "Two Dukes are better than one, provided they don't work at cross purposes."
"The Truth at Last," which is published by Ed Fields of Marietta, Ga., recently wrote that Mr. Buchanan "could well become the leader who eventually leads the struggle to save America from Zionist domination."
Tom Metzger, director of White Aryan Resistance, said: "It's time that we divide the truly sensitive Republicans, sensitive on the race issue, from the phonies. We are more interested in what Buchanan's doing than what Duke's doing. I think if he is truly honest, he could really be laying the foundation for something big."
Many on the racial right, though attracted to Mr. Buchanan, say their primary allegiance is to Mr. Duke.
"I would call Pat Buchanan an economic conservative and David Duke a racial conservative," said Mr. Fields of "The Truth at Last." But his publication is full of laudatory articles on Mr. Buchanan. A recent one was headlined, "Jews Launch Smear Campaign Against Pat Buchanan." Mr. Fields denied sending out Buchanan campaign literature and said he had no explanation for its distribution in his envelopes.
Still, many people on the far right maintain allegiances to both men.
Thus, Sam Dickson, a lawyer who is a longtime supporter of Mr. Duke, contributed money to Mr. Buchanan and attended a gathering for him the evening before the Georgia primary.
"Basically, I think they're appealing to the same fundamental concerns of the Euro-American majority, the concern about reverse discrimination, the concern about runaway tax and government, the concern about the changing demographics of the country."
Of course, there are some on the far right who see Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Duke as far too close to the political mainstream.
"We're not supporting anybody," said Carl Franklin of the Aryan Nations organization. "They're all establishment; they're all basically anti-Christ."
Mr. Buchanan's campaign says it is unfair to link him to extremist groups.
"It's the worst kind of guilt by association to tar Buchanan's campaign with accusations we're getting support from people we don't know, don't want and haven't had any contact with," said Jerry Woodruff, Mr. Buchanan's spokesman.
But critics like Mr. Zeskind, whose group does not take political stands on specific candidates, said Mr. Buchanan's campaign comes at a time when far-right groups from the Populist Party to the Klan are increasing efforts to run for office.
Mr. Zeskind said the campaign wasgoing on as the religious and racial right were finding common ground along many of the racial and cultural issues at the heart of Mr. Buchanan's campaign.
"Buchanan and every other candidate should know that when you play with racism as a drawing card, you're going to attract the worst elements in American civilization," Mr. Zeskind said.
William Moore, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, and an expert on far right extremism, said he believed hate groups are looking for someone more conspicuously one of their own than Mr. Buchanan.
But, if Mr. Buchanan's campaign is touching on explosive issues and volatile constituencies, it's not a new phenomenon in American life, he said.
"We've seen this throughout American history, particularly in times of economic distress," he said.

HEADLINE: Grande Dame Fasts for Haitians and a Suffering City Responds

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill., March 6

 BODY:
In this island of urban desperation, where people know firsthand about poverty and suffering, a deeply personal crusade is under way to help the refugees of another desperate place in the hemisphere, Haiti.
At the center of the movement is Katherine Dunham, an 82-year-old grande dame of modern dance, who has homes both here and in Haiti, is in her second month of fasting to protest the deportation of Haitian boat people to what she and others here fear is certain death in their homeland. 
 For 35 days now, against the advice of doctors, she has consumed only bottled water, cranberry juice and Tibetan tea. She says she will continue her fast as long as the Bush Administration refuses entry to Haitians fleeing the military government that in September overthrew the country's first democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
"It's embarrassing to be an American," Miss Dunham said, bedridden in her home here since the fast began. "The discrimination is becoming blatant. The lives of those people who half drown in those little boats are being equated to animals. It means I have to declare out-and-out war."
 
Expanding Movement
 Miss Dunham's is the most extreme example of a movement that has expanded nationally in recent months to include human rights advocates, civil rights groups, unions and religious groups all lobbying to change United States policy toward the Haitians.
The Bush Administration argues that the Haitians are fleeing poverty not political persecution, and that position was upheld by the Supreme Court last week.
Earlier this week, responding to a letter to President Bush from Miss Dunham, Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, wrote to her, "I want to assure you that the President shares your concerns on this most difficult problem and that we are taking every precaution to insure that no one is returned to Haiti who has a well-founded fear of persecution."
 
Nightly Vigils
 While opponents of the Administration's policy wage a campaign of faxes and news conferences, a front-stoop battle is going on in this city that, like Haiti, is overwhelmingly poor, black and powerless. Residents hold nightly vigils outside Miss Dunham's home, ministers have marched several blocks to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Bridge over the Mississippi River to pray for the Haitians' safety, and protesters have chained themselves to the courthouse doors..
Since the September coup, at least 15,000 Haitians in packed and leaking boats have attempted the 700-mile journey to Florida only to be intercepted by the United States Coast Guard and taken to the United States Navy base at Guantanomo Bay, Cuba, to await forcible return to Haiti.
Groups as diverse as the American Jewish Committee, A.F.L.-C.I.O., the American Bar Association and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are urging Congress and President Bush to end the repatriations. They say the Haitians are trying to escape repression and violence at the hands of a dictatorship, and they accuse the United States Government of acting on a racial double standard in which it admits thousands of refugees from Cuba, the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia but draws the line at Haitians.
"The Haitians don't have money like the Cubans," Miss Dunham said, "and they are blacker than the Cubans."
Congress has given mixed messages on the matter. The House of Representatives voted 217 to 165 last week to suspend the deportation of Haitians who arrived before early February. But the bill is too late for its intended beneficiaries, who have been turned back by the thousands. And an amendment to give the Haitians special status and allow them into this country pending political change in Haiti was defeated, 96 to 304.
If the bill is passed by the Senate, it would likely be vetoed by Mr. Bush. .
Miss Dunham has celebrated the Haitian culture in her work for 50 years. She grew up in Chicago, was trained in anthropology at the University of Chicago and later founded a dance company that gained international acclaim for its marriage of African and Caribbean culture to modern choreography. When she retired from the stage in the mid-1960's, she chose to settle in Haiti and East St. Louis.
"She chose two of the worst places in the Western Hemisphere and decided that was where she was needed most," said her spokesman, Mark Silverman.
She started dance schools for children in both places and has trained generations of disadvantaged children, including the Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
Now her museum and studio here, a neoclassical brick mansion with barred clerestory windows and a nearby coach house, are virtually the only institutions left in East St. Louis. And they are struggling amid the ruin. The museum, open only by appointment, has a stunning collection of third world musical instruments, Haitian paintings and African carvings.
 
Will Remains Strong
 Unemployed men stand on nearby street corners. Directly in front of the museum, the charred skeleton of a once grand house is collapsing on itself as if it had been bombed.
Hospitalized for exhaustion last week, Miss Dunham has remained alert and her will has been undiminished. More than a month without solid food has left her weakened, her voice low and faint. As she lies in her bed in her large brick house, aides announce guests and bring her tea, slipping the salutation "madame" at the end of each sentence, like French schoolchildren.
She has taken calls from President Aristide urging her to stop fasting and has been advised by Dick Gregory and visited by the Rev. Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam.
But whatever the effect of her crusade, it has probably been felt most by black East St. Louisans who have been given something bigger than themselves to fight for. "Some of the slave ships stopped in Haiti before coming to this country," said Wyvetter Younge, a local State Representative. "Those are our cousins being forced back."

For the farmers who come into Howard McCants's milling operation here, The Market Bulletin is a fixture in their lives -- the place to get a line on anything from a cow dog to seven-shank plows to bales of high-protein coastal Bermuda hay.
For Linda Wish, an Atlanta lawyer, The Market Bulletin is the place to locate seeds for touch-me-nots and four-o'clocks and all manner of things she can use to adorn her suburban garden. And it is the place to correspond with other avid gardeners. 
 The Georgia Farmers and Consumers Market Bulletin, to call it by its full name, is a free weekly newspaper with a circulation of 250,000. Published by the State Department of Agriculture, it has been serving Georgia's farmers for 75 years -- and, more recently, bridging farm and garden, city and small town.
Bulletins like these, with their free classified advertisements and homespun columns, are a rich source of social history. In her book "Gardening for Love: The Market Bulletins" (Duke University Press, 1987), Elizabeth Lawrence writes that the history of a people is to be found "in the yellowed pages of the market bulletins where they sold their mules and their cordwood, their bales of sweet-smelling alfalfa, their old-fashioned daffodils and their yard plants with their poetic country names."
Georgia's bulletin, founded in 1917, is one of the oldest. Many other Southern states have also had market bulletins for decades, though they do not have the advertising volume and circulation of Georgia's.
The Georgia publication is often an outlet for information from the United States Department of Agriculture Extension Service on topics like livestock health and new strains of crops, but such articles and photographs of outsized onions clearly take a back seat. The paper's heart and soul is the classified advertising, a print marketplace with buyers and sellers from around the state.
"They sort of call it their lifesaver," said Mr. McCants, referring to how some of the farmers view the publication. "It's real common that a lot of these ol' boys who advertise an old tractor for sale will tell you that he sold it just minutes or hours after the paper came out. There's no question about it but that these farmers would get mad if they stopped putting it out."
Dan Gunnels, the Extension Service agent in Clark County, said that many of the Market Bulletin's readers are people who have roots on the farm but now live in cities or suburban areas and see it as a way to "keep in touch with their roots."
Ms. Wish, the Atlanta lawyer and gardener, agreed, but also recalled the person who responded to one of her ads for a shrub she was trying to sell.
"It was a droopy plant and I was real apologetic, but he said that was all right because he didn't want it for display, but for some genetic material," she said. "He was a Ph.D. in botany working on a research project."
The paper does not accept advertisements from out of state or from retailers, wholesalers, brokers, dealers and agents. The idea is strictly person to person.
Carlton Moore, editor of the paper for the last three years, said that over the years the paper's advertising columns have evolved, reflecting the changes in farming and the changes in farm living.
"In lean years, for example, we started columns to create a marketplace for people wanting to lease hunting rights on their land and things like that," he said. "People look for all sorts of alternatives to traditional farming when conditions are not good, whether it is because of the weather or the economy."
Along with the advertisements, regular features include a recipe, a column titled "Helping Each Other" in which readers seek information on rare plants or a quilt pattern, and a listing of livestock and gardening events.
The paper's annual production budget is about $1.25 million, with the bulk of that for the cost of mailing it to a quarter of million subscribers. About 2,000 classified ads appear each week.
For its 75th anniversary, the Market Bulletin asked some of its readers for letters telling of the role the publication had played in their lives.
"I doubt that I would still be in farming without it," wrote 70-year-old B. F. Bohannon of Chickamauga. Raymond Hughes of Carrollton, who said he used it as he was learning to read, described it as a "continued source of intellectual growth, entertainment and pleasure."
And Adelia Matthews, 74, of Douglasville wrote:
"When I have insomnia, I have discovered reading it that it helps me go to sleep. When I have squeezed all the good I can from it, I recycle it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Texas Town Sees the Race as Remote

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEER PARK, Tex., March 6

 BODY:
Living in the shadows of oil refineries, the people of this Houston suburb are accustomed to economic booms and busts. Now, even though many express nagging worries about the future, they seem almost disconnected from the Presidential candidates who are trying so hard to address their concerns.
Stuffing her clothes into a washer at the Suds n' Suds coin laundry a few days before the Texas primary election, Alice Lawson, 56 years old, said: "I see that they're on TV a lot now, and I guess I'm interested, yeah. I've seen that a couple of them have had this sex stuff going on about them, but you know what I am really interested in is whether any of them will do anything to help the elderly, especially with our health care." 
 Asked whether she knew of any health care plans being put forward by any of the candidates, Mrs. Lawson seemed unaware of the debate on this issue that has preoccupied the Democratic candidates.
 
Call to Improve Tax Code
 A little farther down Center Street, Ray Sanchez, 36, was eating lunch at the Cattle Drive Bar-B-Que with fellow workers from a nearby grocery store. "There's no question in my mind that fixing the tax code is the No. 1 issue," he said, "and I say there should be a flat tax rate across the board for everybody."
Asked whether he liked the proposal for a 13 percent flat tax rate put forward by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, Mr. Sanchez paused to chew on his sliced brisket sandwich and then said: "Brown? Oh yeah, Brown. He said that?"
With a population of almost 28,000 people, Deer Park is a scattering of subdivisions and shopping centers about 15 miles southeast of downtown Houston. Bordered on the north by the massive refineries and chemical plants that line the Houston Ship Channel, it is home to a mix of laborers, professionals and merchants.
Once solidly Democratic, like the rest of the state, the town has increasingly supported Republicans in Presidential elections over the last 20 years.
For people like Mrs. Lawson and Mr. Sanchez, the Presidential campaign has been remote until now, something conducted mostly in snowy New Hampshire, far from this steamy coastal plain. They seem to have bits of information but no fully formed impressions of any candidates except for President Bush.
The candidates and their television advertisements began appearing in Texas in significant quantities just this week, and even that exposure conveys a feeling that the campaign is just breezing through on the way to or from one of the other 10 states holding elections on Super Tuesday.
As is typical in many places at this stage of the campaign, only part of the electorate seems to be paying much attention.
Some voters like David Williams, 25, say they plan to sit out of the primary. "I don't really get interested until they go one on one in November," he said. "Now there are so many of them up on TV that I really don't have time to sort them out."
 
Concern About Future
 Most of the people in Deer Park weathered the bad years of the mid-1980's, when crashing oil prices devastated the local economy. Now they have seen steady improvement for almost five years. Even so, numerous people encountered on a recent sunny afternoon expressed ill-defined but deeply felt worries about the nation's future. Events overseas were not mentioned, except by those who said they were unimportant.
For example, Malcolm Prevost, a 70-year-old retired heating and air-conditioning contractor, was quick to say that he was voting for Mr. Bush. But then he added: "Some way or another we got to get a lot of help for this country instead of worrying so much about what goes on across the pond. I am disappointed in Bush on that score, but I don't see who else I can support."
An even more generalized unease was expressed by Frances Cobb, 50, who said, "All I know for sure is something drastic has got to change and somebody has got to decide where this country is going to go instead of getting up there and giving us the same old, same old."
Such sentiments seem tailor-made for almost any of the Democratic candidates, or for Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative challenger in the Rupublican race. But their varied messages seem to have only just started to penetrate.
Eating at the Cattle Drive, Jack Heath, 37, said: "I voted for Bush the last time. I'm a Republican, but I haven't decided yet what I'm going to do. The way Bush is running things, the middle-class people like us are just going to disappear, so something has got to change. Clinton says he's for the middle man. Maybe he can do something or one of others. We sure need someone to come up with a plan that really looks down the road, and I'd like to hear it."

HEADLINE: VIETNAM'S EXODUS APPEARS TO HALT

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 7

 BODY:
The number of Vietnamese boat people coming to seek refuge here dropped to zero last month in what officials called an encouraging sign that the exodus that scattered nearly 675,000 Vietnamese throughout this region in a dozen years may finally be ending.
February was the first month in seven years that no Vietnamese arrived in Hong Kong, which had been virtually the last place in Asia where the authorities would not quickly return them to Vietnam. Officials said they believe that people in Vietnam are at last beginning to understand that there is no longer much chance they can improve their lives by fleeing their country. 
 In recent years, a growing number of Asian countries have been closing their doors to Vietnamese refugees. Last year, 92 percent of the 22,000 Vietnamese refugees arrived in Hong Kong.
 
'Word Has Really Spread'
 "No arrivals is pretty remarkable," said a refugee official in Hong Kong. "In a country as primitive as Vietnam, with people living in conditions with poor communications, that everyone got the message is amazing. The word has really spread."
Halting the exodus to Hong Kong, which has a population of 5.5 million people, has been an emotional and controversial issue, and negotiations to resolve the problem took years. The British authorities in Hong Kong have continued to provide food and shelter to the refugees, with some living in special centers for at least 10 years and others who were born in them knowing no life outside the cramped and squalid quarters. There are about 58,000 refugees now in the camps.
Other countries adopted stricter policies earlier on and the results were striking. Malaysia, for example, took no Vietnamese last year, compared with 1,326 in 1990 and 16,718 the previous year. Indonesia received only 1,260 last year, compared with 13,833 in 1990. Thailand took only 164 last year after accepting 9,054 in 1990.
It is possible that more Vietnamese will try to come to Hong Kong during the spring season, when the seas are calmer, but officials will not know until May whether a new exodus will begin.
Most of those who come to Hong Kong now are regarded as economic rather than political refugees. They have little or no hope of finding resettlement in the United States, Australia, Canada or even Hong Kong itself. Instead, they are kept in the camps while the Government tries to encourage them to return home. The British authorities here initially sought to get them to return voluntarily, but recently they have also forced a small number to go back against their will.
 
Britain-Vietnam Agreement
 The refugee flow did not appear to ebb until Britain and Vietnam agreed in October on the mandatory repatriation of certain kinds of Vietnamese refugees. In January, the number of arrivals dwindled to four.
Under the agreement, those who arrived after Oct. 29 were interviewed and then returned immediately if they did not qualify as refugees who were politically persecuted by the Vietnamese Government. Those who arrived for a second time were also sent back.
In contrast, those who arrived before the cutoff date could remain in Hong Kong until their turns came in a line of nearly 35,000 Vietnamese to be interviewed and screened. The process of sending Vietnamese refugees back to their country or resettling them elsewhere is expected to take several years. Thus, it was the immediate returns that seemed to have driven the message home, officials here said.
The number of Vietnamese volunteering to return home seemed to be steadily increasing, with 2,085 returning so far this year, compared to 16,064 who have chosen to return in the three years since March 1989, when the first volunteers returned home, according to Hong Kong Government statistics.
The process was delayed when a riot and a fire in early February, in which nearly two dozen people died, resulted in charges against 173 Vietnamese. About 800 Vietnamese who had volunteered to return home will have their trips delayed pending the Government's investigation into the riot. Still, the Government says it plans to send back five more groups in March.
 
Quayle Causes a Problem
 The program also suffered a significant setback in mid-February after Vice President Dan Quayle referred to the Vietnamese in Hong Kong as "political refugees."
After Mr. Quayle's remarks, Vietnamese refugees here believed that there would be a policy change and that they would be reclassified as political refugees instead of economic ones. Most Governments will accept only those who are fleeing political persecution, not those who are seeking greater prosperity.
The Voice of America broadcast a program in Vietnamese, emphasizing that there would be no change in United States policy toward the refugees. Applications to return voluntarily, however, are still lower than they were before the Vice President's remarks. Moreover, about half of those who had already applied for repatriation changed their minds and decided to remain in the Hong Kong camps.
"A statement like Mr. Quayle's had an immediate impact," said Robert Van Leeuwen, chief of the Hong Kong mission of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "Corrective statements take a longer time to have an impact."

HEADLINE: After Criticism by U.S., Mulroney Jabs Back

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTTAWA, March 4

 BODY:
In remarks bristling with unusual censure of the United States, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has defended Canada's new policy of relying more on United Nations peacekeeping activities than on NATO's strategy of deterrence to maintain a stable and secure world.
He calls the approach "realistic" and says it was brought on not only by the collapse of the Soviet Union but by the remarkable recent experience in which President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia has been seeking billions of dollars of aid from erstwhile enemies. 
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mulroney bridled at criticism by Washington -- and other allies -- of Ottawa's recent decision to pull out all its combat units from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization command before 1995.
That decision was announced last week as 1,300 Canadians were being deployed in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia, the largest national component in that force. The two moves are key elements in Canada's new post-cold-war strategy.
As a special riposte to Washington, which said it was "very disappointed" by Canada's unexpected NATO action, Mr. Mulroney noted that the United States was years behind in its contributions toward the costs of United Nations operations.
"We don't believe you can be a member of a club and not pay your dues," he said. "Otherwise, you're a deadbeat."
He also accused the United States of engaging in "vexatious harassment" and "protectionism of the worst kind" for a series of recent trade actions that have had damaging impact on tens of thousands of Canada's beer, lumber and auto workers.
"If you had told me that some tinpot dictator in some tiny little country somewhere was engaging in this kind of harassment, I'd say, 'So what else is new?' But for the United States, this is most unworthy."
He warned that the continuation of such practices could damage the three-way negotiations under way among Canada, the United States and Mexico for North American free trade.
The use of such unusually sharp language by the 53-year-old leader, long considered the closest friend of the United States, was evidence of the political pressures he is under as Canada struggles out of a recession that is worse than the one in the United States, while edging into an election campaign of its own.
He is politically vulnerable on the trade issue. Many Canadians see freer trade between the United States and Canada, under a three-year-old tariff-cutting pact, as a cause of their economic woes.
The Prime Minister said Washington's aggressiveness was "bad news for any trading partner who sticks his neck out, like I do, in favor of free and fair trade."
Yet he was careful to draw a distinction between President Bush, whom he called "a free and fair trader," and the trade bureaucracy in Washington, which he said was "responding to low-level political pressures."
His comments also suggest a gulf between Ottawa and Washington in perceptions of the post-cold-war world.
Mr. Mulroney's fiscally strapped Government has just promised Mr. Yeltsin, a recent visitor to Ottawa, more than $2 billion of humanitarian assistance, which on a per capita basis is four to five times what the United States has committed.
"It occurred to our people," Mr. Mulroney said, "whom are we defending against exactly, the guy who just left here asking me for money? And we contributed over $2 billion to keep him alive. If he's the enemy, then we're going about this the wrong way. I really shouldn't be committing $2 billion to help a mortal enemy."
In fact, he said, "the enemy is unrest in Central Europe."
Despite the lowest public support for a sitting Prime Minister in opinion polling history -- a 16 percent approval rating in a January poll -- Mr. Mulroney is gearing up to lead his Progressive Conservative Party to what would be an unprecedented third term for the Tories. He has headed the Ottawa Government for eight years.
He reminded a reporter that he did not have to call elections for a year and a half, "and that's forever in politics."

HEADLINE: Brazil Welcomes Drop in Population Growth

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA

 BODY:
For the first time in half a century, Brazil's population growth rate has dipped below 2 percent, according to preliminary results of the country's latest once-a-decade census.
The falling growth rate, part of a trend in developing nations, is being welcomed by officials here because, they say, it gives Brazil, Latin America's most populous nation, more time to catch up with a yawning social deficit of schools, sewers and clinics. 
 The 1991 head count, which ended in February, gives Brazil a population of 146 million. Adjusting for undercounting, the real population figure is about 148 million, according to the census bureau, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics.
Even with 7 million fewer people than predicted a decade ago, Brazil is now the world's fifth most populous nation, slightly larger than Russia. The four most populous nations are China, India, the United States and Indonesia.
Drawing on reports from 189,000 enumerators, Brazil's census paints a picture of hidden population movements across a continent-size nation.
In the 1980's, the fastest population growth was on the Amazon frontier.
In Roraima State, where gold miners invaded lands of the Yanomami Indians, population grew at an annual rate of 9 percent, the highest in Brazil. Rondonia grew at 7.9 percent a year, and Mato Grosso at 5.4 percent.
For the first time, two Amazon cities, Belem and Manaus, broke into the ranks of cities with populations over one million. Brazil's 10 other cities in this category are, in descending order: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Brasilia, Recife, Curitiba, Nova Iguacu and Porto Alegre.
The slowest growth rates were detected in the crowded, older states and cities on the Atlantic coast.
The census started a year late because of a Government hiring freeze. When many numbers released last month proved sharply lower than estimates, many mayors and governors demanded recounts, fearing cuts in federal revenue sharing.
Census officials admit only to a maximum undercount of 2 percent.
Officials attribute Brazil's declining birth rate to major social changes under way in the population.
"There are many factors at work: urbanization, more women in the labor force, and more access to family planning," David Wu Tai, coordinator of the census, said in an interview in Rio.
Indeed, Brazil's move toward smaller families is part of a worldwide trend. Annual growth rates have dropped in China to 1.5 percent, and in India to Brazil's level, 1.9 percent.
Brazil's Government, which supported population growth as late as the 1970's, has celebrated the drop as a step toward improving education and living standards.
The slowing population growth has been defined by special circumstances.
For one, the economy was largely stagnant in the 1980's, a condition that pushed couples to limit family sizes. In addition, falling fertility rates have come about without any Government program for family planning or sex education.
Birth control methods here are often drastic.
Although abortion is illegal in Brazil, the Alan Guttmacher Institute estimates that 1.4 million to 2.4 million abortions are performed annually. Abortions alone could account for the seven million population shortfall between today's reality and forecasts made a decade ago.
In addition, demographers estimate that nearly 30 percent of married Brazilian women of child-bearing age are sterilized. In contrast, the corresponding sterilization rate for United States women is 17 percent, and for Latin American women, 7 percent.
Brazil's high female sterilization rate is due to several factors: the high price and unreliability of local contraceptives, and a new discrimination by Brazilian companies against hiring unsterilized women of child-bearing age. This bias, usually expressed verbally but amply documented by union groups, stems largely from a requirement in the 1988 Constitution that mandates that employers pay for six-month maternity leaves.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Some Royal Insiders Feel Like Outsiders

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAINES CITY, Fla.

 BODY:
In the space of a week last month, George Brett gained a new wife and a new team.
"It felt like I was the one who had been traded," Brett said, referring to his arrival here at the Kansas City Royals training-camp clubhouse, not his marriage. "I walked in and didn't know 10 people. I was early and a lot of position players weren't here yet so I felt when they came in, I'd feel more comfortable. But they came and I still didn't know many of them. Someone said I walked by Gregg Jefferies and didn't know him." 
 The Royals executed one of the biggest face lifts of the winter, bringing in four new significant players in making over a lineup that had taken on the look of a dowdy matron.
"We needed to make some changes," said Mark Gubicza, who joins Brett as the only players left from the 1985 World Series champions. "The last couple years we were stagnant."
In the Royals' new look, Wally Joyner is at first base, Jefferies at third, Keith Miller in left field and Kevin McReynolds in right. Gone from the pitching staff is its leader, Bret Saberhagen, and gone from the starting lineup are a collection of first basemen, third baseman Kevin Seitzer and outfielders Danny Tartabull, Jim Eisenreich and Kirk Gibson.
"Bret and I were together 10 years," Gubicza said. "We were close off the field, and our wives were close. They went to school together. My wife and I are godparents of their little girl. I always thought if we weren't going to be together, it would be me who was traded."
Gubicza, though, said that neither he nor any of the other pitchers resents the trade that sent Saberhagen to the Mets for McReynolds, Jefferies and Miller.
"The pitchers are glad they're here," Gubicza said. "From what I see, they're aggressive players and they hit the ball. They come from a winning situation. I like having them. I look at our team this year, and I feel this is potentially the best offensive team we've had since I've been here. You get the feeling this team could contend for the championship. The past few years everybody would have had to have career years to win. Now they can just have good years."
Brett, at 38 years old and 18 years in the major leagues the elder statesman of the team, has no problem with the changeover. The only question he said has been raised is why competition for jobs was ruled out.
"Everything is written down in pen," he said. "The opening-day lineup is etched in stone."
Hal McRae, who shows signs of becoming an outstanding manager, readily explained his reasoning for establishing the starting nine before spring training. "I believe in these guys," he said. "I've seen them play."
The decision that has been most questioned is the insertion of Miller in left field over Eisenreich, a .301 hitter last year, and Gibson. At first, the Royals had said Miller would play second base, but McRae wanted Terry Shumpert there for defense and he wanted Miller in the lineup.
"We traded for Miller to be a major part of the ball club," McRae said. "We traded Saberhagen for three regulars, not for two regulars and a backup guy. We never would have done that. That would've been out of the question."
 
Shaky Family Affairs
 Family combinations have not fared well working for the Yankees in recent years. The Berras, the Niekros and the Perezes can attest to that.
With Yogi Berra their manager, the Yankees acquired Dale Berra in a trade Dec. 20, 1984. But the father-son setup lasted only 16 games into the 1985 season. That is when, after having said in the spring that he would be the manager the entire season, George Steinbrenner dismissed Yogi.
With Phil Niekro already on the club, the Yankees obtained his brother, Joe, in a trade Sept. 15, 1985. Their in-season time on the same pitching staff, though, lasted only three weeks. The Yankees released Phil the following spring, just before the start of the season.
The latest breakdown in family ties occurred last week. With Pascual Perez an infrequent but well-paid member of their pitching staff, the Yankees acquired his brother Melido in a trade Jan. 10. Pascual and Melido, however, spent only eight days in spring training in uniform together.
Pascual was suspended Friday for one year for cocaine use, and his career is in jeopardy.
Then there are the Steinbrenners. Hank, a son, worked for the Yankees for a few months in 1986, then fled to the family horse farm in Ocala, Fla., and has refused to return. George, the father, left the club in 1990 and keeps trying to return, but unsuccessfully.
 
Cubs Rocking the Boat
 It was not a good week for the Chicago Cubs. First, they catapulted the individual-salary scale another megalevel, from $5.8 million a year to $7.1 million, for Ryne Sandberg, and then they vetoed a realignment of the National League that virtually everyone else desired because it made economic and geographical sense.
Although just about every owner has been guilty at one time or another of contributing to the salary escalation, the owners severely criticized their Tribune Company colleagues for the Sandberg signing.
"No one was rude; they were all polite," said one man who attended the owners' meetings in Chicago. "But the resentment was staggering."
The Cubs might try to say the contract really is $30.5 million for five years, or $6.1 million a year, but that view doesn't fool anyone. They gave Sandberg $28.4 million for an additional four years. His $2.1 million salary for this year was his whether or not he signed an extension so it doesn't figure in the calculation.
Five of the previous 11 salary record-breakers (Bret Saberhagen, Dave Stewart, Don Mattingly, Jose Canseco and Roger Clemens) also signed extensions, and no one suggested including the remaining year of their existing contracts in the new deal.
 
Lasorda Favors Daniels
 Tommy Lasorda is running a sweepstakes for the Los Angeles Dodgers' first-base job, but he has his own favorite in the race: Kal Daniels, who is trying to move there from left field. Daniels was supplanted at his own position by Eric Davis, a former teammate in Cincinnati.
"One of the reasons I'm leaning toward Kal is I need a fifth-place hitter," Lasorda said. "It would be for the good of the lineup. The guy we got from Cincinnati" -- Todd Benzinger, who played for the Reds before the Dodgers obtained him from the Royals -- "is a heck of a first baseman, but Kal would make the ideal fifth-place hitter for us."
Brett Butler, Juan Samuel, Darryl Strawberry and Davis will be the first four hitters in the lineup.
 
Looks Like Bye-Bye Bo
 Bo Jackson's once-promising career appears to be over, unless additional rehabilitation over an extended period can improve his hip and enable him to run decently. Jackson courageously, stubbornly or foolishly insisted on playing football, along with baseball, ignoring the actuarial tables on National Football League running backs.
No one will have to stage any benefits for him, but Jackson has left untold millions on the 50-yard line.
Deion Sanders, the other major league two-sporter, continues to pursue both baseball and football jobs. He has not suffered a devastating injury, but he continues to undermine his chances to be a legitimate major league hitter by cutting his baseball season short each Aug. 1.
"He's doing pretty good," Bobby Cox, the Atlanta Braves' manager, said. "What he's doing now, he could make our club."
Sanders, however, has not performed impressively as a hitter in his abbreviated visits to the majors. In parts of two seasons with the Yankees and one with the Braves, he has hit .234 in 47 times at bat, .158 in 133 at-bats and .191 in 110 times at bat for a career .183 average.
"I'm not so sure he'd hit .180 if he played every day," Cox said. "One-hundred and ten at-bats is nothing. He's better than that. You don't see guys who can fly like that. He never makes a mental mistake. He has power. If he played every day, he's going to improve a lot. Deion is a fast learner."
But four years into his baseball career, the 24-year-old Sanders has squandered valuable learning time.
 
Between the Lines
 Some people think club owners struck a noble blow for higher education last week when they changed the rule covering rights to players selected in the amateur June draft. One lofty interpretation of the change was that by extending a club's rights to high school players throughout his college years and one year beyond, clubs were enabling and encouraging players to go to college.
The owners, however, did not enact the so-called Brien Taylor rule to induce the Brien Taylors of the country to pursue a college education. They did it to prevent successors to Taylor, the Yankee prospect, from getting the money they want from the drafting club by threatening to go to college and go back into the draft the next year. There's no nobility there.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
Scattering the Assets of the Team at Bridgeport

BYLINE: By BROCK MULLINS

 BODY:
Bruce Webster is dead serious when he says basketball at the University of Bridgeport has been his life.
Webster is concluding his 27th season as head coach of the Knights. There won't be a 28th. 
 "One of the reasons I stayed at Bridgeport was for the job security," Webster said. "That doesn't matter now. They're taking my team away from me."
The University of Bridgeport, beset with financial problems, will cease all sports at the end of the school year. The basketball team was to play its final home game last night, against Southern Connecticut in the final of the New England Collegiate Conference tournament. In the semifinals Friday night, the Knights beat Massachusetts-Lowell, 93-79.
 
Lost in 1991 Title Game
 The Knights, who had a record of 23-6 going into last night's game and are ranked No. 6 in Division II, are expecting a bid to the National Collegiate Athletic Association divisionional tournament. They reached last season's title game, losing to North Alabama, and they're hoping to make this year's championship game their triumphant finale.
After the season is over, Webster and his players will go in search of new lives.
"Reality hasn't set in," Webster said last week. "I was driving through campus the other day thinking, how could this university, which was once so prominent and so profitable, all of a sudden go down the tubes? Then you think this team is playing its final home game ever. That's a scary feeling."
Declining enrollment and the grip of the recession have contributed to Bridgeport's demise. The university needed a $2.2 million loan from a consortium of banks to open for the spring semester, and 31 degree programs will be dropped after the academic year if the school remains in operation.
Webster's phone began ringing in late February when it was announced there would be no more basketball at Bridgeport. The callers weren't offering condolences. They were looking for players. Bridgeport's athletes will be allowed to transfer to other schools without losing any eligibility.
"I promised the players I'd take care of them," Webster said. "I asked them not to do anything and we'd get together with their parents at the end of the season. I'm registering all the calls of who is interested in who, and I'm going to call in each kid one at a time and say which schools are interested in him."
The Bridgeport basketball team has 11 underclassmen that Webster will try to place at other schools.
"The problem is that three or four of my players are really wanted, and there are three or four players who are not wanted," Webster said. "The thing is, some of these coaches are under pressure to sign right away, because they're recruiting other people."
Webster will have to find a place for himself as well. First, he'll have to update the resume. The 54-year-old Webster, with a 472-284 record before last night, has accumulated more victories than any other Division I or Division II coach in New England.
"One of the marketable things I think I have, besides my record, is I want to take a couple of these kids with me," Webster said.
The most sought-after Bridgeport player will probably be sophomore Winston Jones, a 6-foot-4-inch, 210-pound forward from Queens. Jones has averaged 16 points and 6 rebounds a game this season as the only underclassman starter for the Knights.
For Jones, the possibility of moving up to Division I basketball is offset by a sadness for the waning of the Knights.
"I'm kind of disappointed because I made this my home," Jones said. "I'm sad to see it go. Now I have to start all over again, and that's tough."
Some of the Division I schools that have inquired about Bridgeport players are Central Connecticut State, Long Island University, Brooklyn College, St. Bonaventure and Baylor. Jones says he wants to go to a school where he'll play right away, be it Division I or II.
 
Bush Has 4 Years Left
 "Since I'm going to be a junior, I don't want to go anywhere where I have to sit," said Jones. "I want to work hard my first year and hopefully my senior year start, or something like that. I'd rather go in and be an immediate impact somewhere."
Freshman Bobby Bush, and his four years of eligibility, should also attract some attention from recruiters. As a Proposition 48 player from the talented team at St. Anthony High School in Jersey City, the 6-5, 210-pound forward never stepped on the court for the Knights.
Freshman Lamont Jones, a 6-2, 165-pound guard from Brooklyn, contributed 8 points and 3 assists per game as a backup point guard. He worried that having only three years of eligibility may hurt him in the recruiting game.
"I think I would've been better off coming out of high school, because I would've had four years to play instead of three," he said. "I guess I just have to be very careful where I go to make sure I get the playing time.
"I'm kind of upset that this is my only season here, but I don't have any regrets. We've been winning and doing really well, and that's kind of made up for all the problems."

HEADLINE: George Bush's Real Enemy

 BODY:
The stench of failure hangs over Ronald Reagan's White House.
New York Times editorial, Jan. 9, 1983 
 Given the rosy glow that supposedly lit up Morning in America, it's easy to forget that the Reagan years included some very tough times indeed. The Teflon President may have at times appeared to be invincible. His popularity occasionally brushed 70 percent. But not even he could avoid the political consequences of recession. In January 1983, with unemployment nearing 11 percent, Mr. Reagan's popularity in the Gallup Poll plummeted to 35 percent.
That recent history teaches how to evaluate Patrick Buchanan's challenge in the 1992 Republican primaries.
President Bush, whose popularity shot up to 90 percent just a year ago, is down to 40 percent in the last New York Times/CBS News Poll. Approval for his handling of the economy has now sunk to half that. That exposes him to harsh challenge from Mr. Buchanan, who denounces the President for supposedly deviating from conservative doctrine. Indeed, he thinks he is "driving the national debate" and winning a third of the Republican vote because his is the truer voice of the true faith.
Whatever one thinks of Mr. Bush's philosophy, a better explanation for his sinking popularity came from the Labor Department Friday when the number "7.3 percent" went up in lights. It's the February unemployment rate and it's the highest since mid-1985.
That may not be as bad as it looks. Total employment went up in February, offering a possible harbinger of recovery. But either way, the new figures demonstrate something most people know and yet, in the drama of a Presidential campaign, are quick to forget. Voters care far more about recovery than ideology.
Presidential popularity virtually defines the word evanescent. In times of international turmoil, Americans rally round the flag, and the President. They surely did last year. Before the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Bush's approval rating was 58 percent. Within days it soared to 90 percent, reflecting what John Mueller of the University of Rochester calls a "rally event." What has happened since shows the fragility of such popularity.
Just as it was shortsighted a year ago to assume that the acclaim would endure, it's probably shortsighted now to assume that the bottom will keep dropping. As Professor Mueller and other scholars find, what's decisive is the state of the economy just before an election.
President Bush's real enemy thus is not Patrick Buchanan, no matter what hyperbolic claims the Republican challenger makes. In no primary has Mr. Buchanan much surpassed the anti-Bush protest vote recorded where he was not on the ballot. The stench of failure emanates from tough times; the test of success is whether, because of or in spite of Mr. Bush, the economy recovers.

A Far Better Thing

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
To: David Dinkins
Re:1993
Mr. Mayor,
I'm sure you're familiar with the final sentence of "A Tale of Two Cities." It's the one that goes: "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done . . ." 
 Perhaps no one could have governed the city of New York in this time of recession, depression and urban disintegration. Last week in East New York, where the speakers were poor and African-American, the week before on the Upper West Side, where they were affluent and white, I heard the same thing: that people feel the city is running you and not the other way around.
Your administration seems to ricochet from one crisis to another, from the Korean grocery boycott to Crown Heights to the Thomas Jefferson High School shooting, as reactive as the silver sphere in a pinball machine. Its best-known official is the Housing Authority chairwoman you just replaced. Her pink leather couch and Marie Antoinette expense accounts have not made those pictures of you in the tuxedo any more palatable, especially as the poor get poorer and the middle class feel more pinched.
Maybe the fact that you were New York's first African-American mayor gave people false expectations. In East New York people talked about the hopes that you would be a savior for their community, a municipal Jesse Jackson. Since liberals tend to have a knee-jerk attitude toward race, some of them instantly saw you as a crusader simply because you are black. Everyone seemed to forget that you have historically been a go-along guy, City Clerk to Borough President and finally to Gracie Mansion.
In that sense you are the George Bush of New York City, and what's going on here is not unlike what's going on in the Presidential races. You have the advantage of incumbency, but it is whittled away by the fact that no one is sure what, if anything, you accomplished during your first term.
Like the President, you may be saved by the shortcomings of your opponents. If someone with all the right moves materialized, you would lose big. Instead you face Andrew Stein and Rudolph Giuliani.
Mr. Stein, who now holds a meaningless job, which is fitting, is nothing but a walking dollar sign. When he gave himself a $5,000-a-plate birthday party at the Waldorf and raised more than $2 million to finance an effort to seize your job, he said, "How you run a campaign reflects how you'd run a city." So now we know: Mr. Stein would have a government by rich people, for rich people, a Reagan Administration for New York.
Mr. Giuliani is hardly a thrilling alternative, with little to offer but his experience in law enforcement, which is beginning to seem warmed over, and a chilly persona that could use some heat. Nevertheless a Marist College poll at the end of January showed him leading you by 11 percentage points. That same poll showed that you would have a seven-point edge over Mr. Stein.
There are a sizable number of anyone-but-Dave voters out there, and despite what The Amsterdam News likes to say, they're animated not by your race but by your performance. Like the anyone-but-Bush crowd, their problem is alternatives. A common parlor game these days is Lesser of Two Evils: "All right, but say you have to choose between Stein and Dinkins." It has the flavor of deciding between ways to be executed.
There are people who will not get into this race because you are in it. If you stepped aside tomorrow, there would be a free-for-all. Ruth Messinger would surely jump in. She could be joined by Joe Hynes, Charles Schumer, even Elizabeth Holtzman if she can't nab that Senate seat. And there's the Harold Stassen of New York, Herman Badillo, and the Paul Tsongas of New York, Richard Ravitch. Rangel, Ferrer, Serrano -- who knows?
Right now some of those people, like some would-be Presidential contenders, are waiting until next time. Like the nation, the city cannot afford to wait. You have the opportunity to thwart a Stein administration or a Giuliani administration, not by offering a second lackluster Dinkins administration, but by clearing the way for alternatives. The way to do that is to announce that you will not seek re-election in 1993. It would be a far, far better thing than you have done in some time.

HEADLINE: Soviet Trade Unions Retool for New Era

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I applaud your coverage of events in the former Soviet Union, I am surprised that hardly a word has appeared about the emerging independent, democratic trade unions. 
 On Oct. 23-27, 1990, a congress of 2,300 trade unionists from across the Soviet Union voted to form a free, independent General Confederation of Trade Unions to replace the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, which had been under the domination of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government.
In a secret-ballot election, the delegates voted for a new set of officers (the top three are no more than 50 years old), and they proclaimed that the key priority of the new labor confederation was to "defend the rights and interests of workers in the context of the country's transition to a market economy."
The trade union confederation, in little more than a year of its existence before the breakup of the Soviet Union, got the Government to accept an unemployment insurance law that provides 26 weeks at average pay. At the legislative initiative of the union confederation, the Soviet Parliament adopted a trade union law, followed by a law establishing for the first time the right to strike. The confederation also promoted indexation of wages to protect workers against inflation and has fought to raise the minimum wage.
With its affiliated organizations in the republics, it represent about 130 million union members.
I was able to confirm the vitality and democratic character of this new trade union movement during a 24-day visit to Russia at the invitation of the confederation to lecture, engage in seminars and hold private consultations under the broad subject of democratic unions in a market economy. I found that the concerns of unions and their members in Russia and the other republics are similar in many ways to those of their American counterparts.
They want to safeguard the many benefits they enjoyed under the former Soviet Union, including free medical care, free education from elementary school through university, paid sick leave up to four months, paid maternity leave of 70 days before delivery, and 56 days post-delivery. They also want big discounts for vacations at union health resorts.
More attention should be paid to the trade unions in the republics of the new commonwealth. They have a major role to play in increasing the production of goods and revitalizing the economy.

HEADLINE: We Must Restore Higher Tax on Top Incomes;
Harmful Boat Fee

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The "no-new-taxes President" seems to have gone a step beyond rationality with his new recreational vessel fee. It is one thing to have to pay a tax or fee as a small-boat owner, but to do so and have the following statement attached to the sticker we receive to signify payment, verges on insult: 
 "The fee for which this document was provided was established under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Persons paying this fee can expect no increase in the quantity, quality or variety of services the person receives from the Coast Guard as a result of that payment."
Do the revenues do anything at all for our waterways? I doubt that any boater would object to the charge, but should it not at least remotely serve those from whom it is extracted?
Boaters are for the most part not super-rich. We generally have to make sacrifices to enjoy a few days' recreation on our country's waterways. Since my family bought our boat, we have spent our vacations on United States waters and not abroad. I suspect the same is true for most middle-income boaters.
As a further insult to the American boater, the so-called luxury tax on boats over $100,000 produced little, if any, new revenue for the Government. It did, however, cost the United States almost all of its boat manufacturers and eliminated thousands of manufacturing jobs, as well as maritime service-related jobs in sales, maintenance and summer employment for students. Probably the biggest beneficiary of this tax was foreign boat builders.
Tax us if you must, but the taxes should both generate net revenues and help us to be a stronger nation. These fees and taxes have only hurt what was once a healthy industry and have sent their United States customers abroad or out of the market altogether.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Primary Debaters Become Brawlers

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 7

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas began his campaign day today in the most serene fashion, with a prayer and a gospel hymn.
But nothing is serene about this Democratic Presidential race anymore. 
 In the last few days, the candidates have begun slashing away at each other -- most frequently at Mr. Clinton -- with an abandon that was largely concealed during their pre-Super Tuesday televised debate on Thursday night.
It is a political fight that illustrates, much better than any sober discussion of health care or foreign policy ever could, just how high the stakes are in Tuesday's primary and caucus voting in 11 states.
After arriving here on Friday night and calling Mr. Clinton "cynical and unprincipled," former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts offered more criticism at a news conference today while asking in the next breath that negative campaigning stop.
 
Tsongas Assails Clinton
 "We're only helping George Bush," Mr. Tsongas said. "But this is one Greek who fights back.
"It is disruptive to my campaign, but it's more destructive to me as a leader to have the suggestion made that I cannot counterpunch."
Mr. Clinton responded in an interview today by saying: "I never thought he couldn't counterpunch. He punched. He's the guy that ran the ad saying Bob Kerrey and I were trying to increase the deficit by helping the middle class, which is baldly untrue. So I thought that was a pretty good punch, and it helped him a lot, too."
As usual, on one front, it is a television war. In Florida, where Mr. Tsongas is best positioned to score his most critical Super Tuesday victory, the attacks have become particularly nasty.
In Mr. Tsongas's newest advertisement being broadcast in Florida, an announcer says of Mr. Clinton: "Some people will say anything to get elected," and accuses Mr. Clinton of distorting Mr. Tsongas's record on limiting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients.
For Mr. Clinton's part, he is broadcasting an advertisement here that faults Mr. Tsongas for his support of increasing the Federal tax on gasoline. "Much of what Tsongas proposes smacks of trickle-down economics," an announcer says.
 
Harkin Makes a Stand
 But the battles are not limited to Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton. In South Carolina, where Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa is mounting what could be his last stand, his supporters have distributed a flyer that juxtaposes two photographs. One is of Mr. Harkin shaking hands with Jesse Jackson; the other is a photograph of Mr. Clinton with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia at a prison boot camp. In the background are rows of mostly black inmates in uniform.
"While Tom Harkin and Jesse Jackson are fighting for social and economic justice," the handout reads, "Bill Clinton has been fighting for a national police force." Mr. Clinton has never called for a national police force.
But the real dispute, which threatens to grow as the next round of primaries approaches, is chiefly between Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton, both of whom are seeking to put the other on the defensive.
The war of words are especially harsh among the aides to the candidates. George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's Greek-American deputy campaign manager, took special umbrage at Mr. Tsongas's assertion that the Arkansas Governor had made an anti-Greek slur when he said Mr. Tsongas's economic plan was "not America."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr. Tsongas was pulling an old political trick: "Whine about being attacked while you're leveling them against your opponent."
But Mr. Tsongas, while not citing specific instances of what he contended were Mr. Clinton's anti-Greek tendencies, said that he had been a victim of attacks by Mr. Clinton and his aides since he first surpassed him in the New Hampshire polls.
"I won't presume that, in a sea of malignant comment, this was innocent," he said. Any affinity the two men once shared, Mr. Tsongas said, has been "destroyed" by the back-and-forth sniping.
But Mr. Clinton said he does not take Mr. Tsongas's attacks personally.
"Am I bent out of shape about it?" he said. "No. This is, after all, a contest between two people who want to end an election."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the intensifying debate between Bill Clinton and Paul E. Tsongas in the Democratic Presidential primaries misattributed a quotation in some copies. It was Mr. Clinton's deputy campaign manager, George Stephanopoulos, who said of Mr. Tsongas: "The great anti-politician is pulling out the oldest political tricks in the book. Whine about being attacked while you're leveling them against your opponent."

Dance Music Marries The Machine

BYLINE: By Jon Pareles

 BODY:
Electronic sounds are ricocheting all around the Limelight: TICK-a-tick-a POCK-a-tick-a
TICK-a-tick-a POCK-a-tick-a BIP bip bih-bip-bih BIP bip bih-bip-bih -- "Go!"
Moby, a skinny Englishman with close-cropped hair, pokes at a keyboard; down on the club floor, black-clad dancers are leaping, shouting, slamming. The rhythm takes Morse code to the verge of a backbeat. The only sound that wasn't entirely created with a microchip is a verbal soundbite gone electronic: digitally sampled and triggered from the keyboard. 
 Moby's music is called techno, and it is just surfacing from the dance-music underground. In the last few months, techno has moved into New York City clubs like the Limelight after gathering momentum in Europe, Los Angeles and the suburbs. It's a studio-made music in which producer-performers hide behind multiple pseudonymns, often with the alphanumeric terseness of computer abbreviations: Model 500, Altern 8, Program 2, Interactive, SL2.
At least for the moment, techno defines some new extremes for dance music. It has minimal lyrics; an average techno transcript wouldn't fill a fortune cookie. It dispenses with the vestiges of pop song structure, ignoring verses and choruses and bridges in favor of free-form, rhythm-driven expansion. And unlike synthesizer-driven pop of the last decade, techno takes machines strictly for granted; it's neither frightened nor intoxicated by them.
The rise of techno represents a recoil against urban, ethnic styles. Made with rootless synthetic sounds, techno doesn't refer directly to older songs (as hip-hop sampling does), and its rhythms steer away from the disco memories of house music. "It's white music," one record-store owner says, and the audience that turns out for techno events bears him out. On stage and on record, techno performers occasionally rap, but it is rap stripped of its connections to black culture, sanitized for the suburbs.
As with hip-hop and house music, techno has spawned and supported independent labels -- a December survey in Dance Music Report listed 25 in the United States, England, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium -- and conglomerates are poised to move in. BMG has signed N-Joi and issued Quadrophonia's "Cozmik Jam," one of few full-length albums by a single techno entity, and Columbia has latched on to groups like T99, Eon and Midi Rain.
Techno is the latest evolutionary stage of dance music's fascination with the machine and the promise of tireless repetition. Tape loops, synthesizers and ever more proficient drum machines delighted dance-music producers, who were willing to sacrifice the subtleties of human rhythm sections in favor of machines that didn't need space, explanations, good acoustics or coffee breaks. Techno's most obvious roots are in the pumping synthesizer bassline of Parliament's "Flashlight" and in the early synthesized efforts of Kraftwerk, the deadpan German band that celebrated a cybernetic era with droning vocals and robotic rhythm tracks. Kraftwerk was recycled and re-funked for an early rap hit, Afrika Bambaataa's "Planet Rock."
During the 1980's, the arrival of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) allowed producers to synchronize layer upon layer of electronic sound, and synthesizers conquered dance music in styles labeled synth-pop, electropop, hi-N.R.G., industrial. Self-described "modern rock" radio stations, like WDRE in Long Island, embraced the futuristic but ominous sounds of bands like Depeche Mode and New Order, which used machines to depict and decry a dehumanized society.
Techno itself arose in Detroit, where Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May, three high-school classmates (and Kraftwerk fans) who worked as disk jockeys and home-studio producers, began making stripped-down, synthesizer-driven dance records. A friend and early collaborator, Richard Davies, picked up the term "techno" from Alvin Toffler's book "The Third Wave." By the mid-1980's, the Detroit contingent was producing dance records that were distinct from house music and hi-N.R.G., though compatible, and soon they were widely imitated.
Europe embraced techno first, responding to the Kraftwerk connections. As the 1980's ended, techno became the sonic backdrop for huge, sometimes illegal dance parties called raves, where the combination of music and widespread use of the drug Ecstasy turned tens of thousands of people into dancing machines. As news of the good times overseas crossed the Atlantic, techno made its way to the United States. By now, its parameters have narrowed: techno is largely instrumental, entirely electronic and riff-based, clicking along at about 130 beats per minute. (Dance Music Report complains that the United States techno audience is actually hearing not just pure techno, but hardbeat, hardhouse and the slightly faster rave; so it goes.)
Within its parameters, however, techno comes up with sometimes startling creativity. Since words can't carry a song, the music has to; since the beat is repetitive and long-lined melody is unfashionable, composers have to keep devising new riffs and textures. In better techno tunes, the result is an outpouring of variations; a track like Program 2's "More Energy" (on Profile Records's "Best of Techno Volume 1," one of the few domestically available techno compilations) offers something different every four bars, or about every 15 seconds, and it rarely looks back.
Techno's musical ingenuity may not be as important as its atmosphere. Industrial rock also uses synthesizers and thumps away at the beat, with lyrics that are only slightly less laconic than those of techno songs. But the tone of industrial rock is dire and brutal; as the name suggests, industrial rock hears itself as a manufactured product, though one that rails against mechanization. Industrial's sounds are huge and resonant, as if taking place in colossal factories, and its singers howl and bark as if caught in pitiless assembly-line machinery.
Techno, by contrast, is crisp and almost perky. While it's not exactly playful, and often uses the same dark minor or modal harmonies as industrial rock, techno has a lighter touch; instead of cavernous resonances, its productions have the ambiance of an acoustic-ceilinged, carpeted office or a shopping mall. Where industrial rock suggests a manufacturing-based economy that's fast disappearing, techno evokes an age of bank machines and databases, with nearly all human effort invisible behind a benignly innocuous display.
To some listeners, techno may feel cold and inhuman, disconnected from living voices; earlier synthesizer-driven pop often pitted an empathetic human voice against seemingly impersonal electronics. But for its fans, techno's all-electronic soundscape doesn't feel so futuristic or threatening; the fans already have video games and pocket calculators, CD players and remote-control VCR's and they hang out at shopping malls that are disconnected from community or history but are as clean as a synthesizer blip. Techno doesn't point to an outside world; it creates an enclave where machines are mobilized for comfort.
Like house music in its early years, techno at the moment is largely functional stuff, made for club disk jockeys who can string together its instrumentals for as long as the dance floor stays busy. Techno's real impact will show up when pop and rock songs are produced or remixed in techno style (as has already begun), and when someone figures out a way to bring lyrics, extended melody and marketable personality to music that thrives on its anonymity. When techno's impersonality is breached, we'll find out whether its machines are really so user-friendly.

TWO NATIONS
Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal.
By Andrew Hacker.
257 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons. $24.95. 
 WAS Tocqueville right, as he was in so many of his other perceptions, when he wrote a century and a half ago: "The danger of a conflict between the white and the black inhabitants perpetually haunts the imagination of the Americans, like a painful dream"?
Not many contemporary whites know who Nat Turner was, and perhaps few could say with accuracy what John Brown's raid was all about. But to one who watched buildings burning and blacks looting in downtown Washington on the day after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in 1968, Tocqueville's insight seems perceptive indeed.
Most of the depredations in Washington and in other cities during the long, hot summers of the late 1960's were suffered, as well as committed, by blacks. But that day in Washington, the endless lines of cars choking the streets, evacuating the city, heading lemminglike for the suburbs, were driven by whites. The rage was black; the fear was white.
On far more detailed and conclusive evidence of the racial situation in America today, Andrew Hacker writes in "Two Nations" that the fear sensed by Tocqueville still haunts not just Americans' imaginations, but "all phases of current life, from party politics to violent crime."
Thus, "to many white voters, the Democrats now look sufficiently 'black' to make them think twice about supporting its candidates," and "the Republicans have been happy to build on these beliefs." As for "further sacrifices on behalf of the nation's black minority," "about the only funding the public approves is for more police and prisons."
Mr. Hacker teaches political science at Queens College and has written prolifically on race and other American social problems. He devoted five years of study and writing to the compilation of statistical and other evidence to support the thesis of this challenging book -- that "from slavery through the present, the nation has never opened its doors sufficiently to give black Americans a chance to become full citizens."
But the real value of his book, despite its wealth of data, is in Mr. Hacker's calm, analytical eye, his unblinking view of American history and his unwillingness to accept cant and "common sense" as facts. Equally important is his compassion for the plight and sensibilities of those from whom white Americans ask "an extra patience and perseverance" that the same whites "have never required of themselves."
MR. HACKER is well aware that most whites see their country "beset with racial problems they feel are not of their making" and believe that they "bear neither responsibility nor blame for the conditions blacks face. Neither they nor their forebears ever owned slaves, nor can they see themselves as having held anyone back or down." In fact, Mr. Hacker concludes, "Most white Americans believe that for at least the last generation blacks have been given more than a fair chance and at least equal opportunity, if not outright advantages."
Therefore, in Mr. Hacker's view, few whites "feel obliged to ponder how membership in the major race gives them powers and privileges." But, he asserts, being white is the greatest privilege any American can have, for "no matter how degraded their lives . . . they can never become 'black.' " And the black presence "as a subordinate caste . . . despite all its pain and problems, still provides whites with some solace in a stressful world."
On the other hand, to be black -- not to be white -- is to be perceived by whites, in some cases unconsciously, more often deliberately, as "a degraded species of humanity." Mr. Hacker pulls no punches as to why he believes this is so:
"Being 'black' in America bears the mark of slavery. Even after emancipation . . . blacks continued to be seen as an inferior species, not only unsuited for equality but not even meriting a chance to show their worth. . . . There remains an unarticulated suspicion: might there be something about the black race that suited them for slavery?"
Why else, he asks, do other Americans still find it fitting that blacks serve so often as maids and janitors, but seldom as chief executives, senators, newspaper editors, brain surgeons or baseball managers?
So, despite Tocqueville's observation that black and white Americans "are fastened to each other without intermingling," Mr. Hacker argues that white Americans "show little inclination toward giving full nationality to the descendants of African slaves." Rather, he maintains, "It is white America that has made being black [in America] so disconsolate an estate. Legal slavery may be in the past, but segregation and subordination have been allowed to persist. Even today, America imposes a stigma on every black child at birth."
"Two Nations" offers ample evidence of where that stigma leads. For only a few examples:
* Black Americans are 12.1 percent of the tabulated population, but they got only 7.8 percent of the $3.6 trillion total personal income received by everyone in 1990.
* Among men with four years of college, blacks earn $798 for each $1,000 of income earned by whites at the same level of education; black college men earn only a few dollars more than white men who went no farther than high school.
* Nearly half -- 44.8 percent -- of black children live below the poverty line, compared to only 15.9 percent of white children.
* "For as long as records have been kept, in good times and bad, white America has insured that the unemployment imposed on blacks will be approximately double [that] experienced by whites."
* One of every five black American males will spend some part of his life behind bars -- perhaps not least because blacks in the most crime-prone age group (25 to 30) have a median income of $14,333, while whites in the same age group earn a median $20,153.
"Two Nations" also demolishes some of the familiar stereotypes whites cherish about black Americans. Some examples:
* Black women do have more children than white women, but from 1940 to 1988 the ratio of black births to white remained about the same. Black women had children about 1.33 times more often than white women in 1940, and only 1.38 times more often in 1988.
* Approximately half of all black single mothers, moreover, are fully self-supporting, not welfare recipients. And Aid for Dependent Children families are not dens of fertility; almost three-quarters of such families number only one or two children, and only a tenth of them have as many as four children. Fewer than a tenth of the parents have received Aid for Dependent Children for more than a decade, and no wonder -- the national average annual cash allowance for families receiving such aid is only $4,644, or about a seventh of the American average annual family income.
* Between 1969 and 1989, opponents of affirmative action say, blacks were being given jobs, opportunities and promotions that white workers deserved. If so, why did the average earnings of black men, relative to white men, increase by only $22 per $1,000, with only $1 of that increase coming in the decade 1979-89? And why did black college men's earnings decline by 11 percent from 1979 to 1989, while those of white college men increased by 11 percent?
Young black men now engage in violence on such a scale, particularly among themselves, that homicide has become for them the leading cause of death. Few white Americans would accept any responsibility for this "self-inflicted genocide," as Mr. Hacker aptly calls it. Yet, he argues, these violent young blacks suffer "a despair that suffuses much of their race. These are young men who do not know whether they will live another year, and many have given up caring."
It may seem contradictory that such a "subordinate caste," occupying such clearly inferior status, can inspire in the national life the fear of racial conflict that Mr. Hacker finds so prevalent. Besides, as he points out, "The United States is not South Africa, where whites are heavily outnumbered by indigenous blacks, who might mobilize their strength to dominate society."
BUT as Tocqueville noted in the 19th century, Americans of that period could rationalize the evils of slavery only by convincing themselves that Africans were inherently inferior and suited for bondage. If, as Mr. Hacker believes, that conviction has persisted long past emancipation, so has white fear of the world turned upside down -- of blacks taking power and exercising it, "the dread that blacks will treat whites as whites have treated blacks."
"Two Nations" runs strongly against what appears to be the temper of the times. Affirmative action programs are under heavy attack (suggesting, Mr. Hacker believes, the fear that they "will diminish the benefits of being white for those who have always believed that they could take that advantage for granted"), no Democratic Presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson has won a majority of white voters, and the great object of concern for this year's aspirants, in both parties, seems to be the middle class rather than the underclass.
Andrew Hacker offers no antidote, no palliative, no 10-point program, not even rhetorical relief. He only looks at the nation's racial situation with a cold eye and finds it unworthy of American boasts about justice and equality. "The reader," he warns in a preface, "should be advised not to expect this book to end on an optimistic note."
The reasons for this bleak picture of two nations "separate, hostile, unequal," he concludes, "rest with a past that has shaped our present; and a present that makes use of that past. Race has made America its prisoner since the first chattels were landed on these shores. . . . A nation that has done so much to stress racial divisions should not be surprised if the result is not compassion and fellow feeling, but withdrawal and recrimination."
 
 
 
'UNCOMFORTABLE WITH TRADITION'
 Over a lunch of mussels and beer near Queens College, where he has taught since 1971, Andrew Hacker reflected on the genesis of "Two Nations." "It's been almost 50 years since Gunnar Myrdal wrote his study of the races in America, and hardly anybody reads him anymore. It seemed time to take another look at the subject. A very beguiling editor at Scribners was convinced that I should be the one to take that look. But Myrdal was given $350,000 and had a research staff of over 70. I was on my own. It took him four years to complete his work; it took me five."
A respected social scientist, Mr. Hacker considers himself a historian in the classical sense, "where you see humanity as history, just as Balzac and Dickens did -- as something to be observed and understood."
"People don't often ask themselves what it means to be white," he noted. "It's taken for granted. They don't often ask themselves what it's like to see if they have their sight -- only if it's taken away. What, then, would it mean to have our whiteness taken away?
"Of course, there's a black culture, a whole black literature, that must be left to others. This book is written by a white person, but at least I am prepared to tell you, just as I do with my black students, this is what America really thinks about you."
"Few of us are really Democrats or Republicans anymore," Mr. Hacker said. "We're all spectators. We're a nation uncomfortable with tradition, and that's a strength as well as a weakness. We're constantly looking around to see what's new. New immigrants in my class will quickly become Americans. But even with this influx, African-Americans are still being left behind. No one is coming in under them. The legacy of slavery persists." -- LYNN KARPEN

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
The Struggle to Provide Affordable Homes

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, CALIF.

 BODY:
The struggle to introduce low-income housing into a working-class neighborhood in this coastal city just west of Los Angeles illustrates the difficulties of providing such housing throughout the state.
The Community Corporation of Santa Monica, a nonprofit home builder, bought four separate parcels in a working-class neighborhood and planned a total of 30 apartments for renters of very low, low and moderate incomes. A group of nearby residents sued to block the project. When the home builder won in lower court, the homeowners appealed. 
 After three years of litigation, Community Corporation settled out of court with the homeowners' group for an undisclosed amount of cash and an agreement to build no more low-income units in the neighborhood for the next five years. Joan Ling, executive director of Community Corporation, said the developer was forced to negotiate "since we were on the verge of losing our building permits and our financing." The housing is currently under construction.
Political difficulties are among the many obstacles to the creation of very-low- and low-income housing, both for sale and for rent, in the nation's most populous state. (Very-low income is defined as households earning up to 50 percent of the median income of a particular community, while low income represents earnings of 50 to 80 percent of median income. Moderate income is 80 to 120 percent of the median.)
As a result of difficulties both practical and political, 79 percent of California cities have failed to comply fully with a state law requiring cities to adopt plans for affordable housing. About 31 percent of all cities in the state have either obsolete plans or no plans at all.
Those plans are inadequate, according to critics, because the state's housing laws do not rerquire cities to build housing, but merely to plan for it. That inconsistent policy is one reason California cities have not met their housing goals, according to one Marc Brown, a lobbyist for affordable housing.
"There is no mechanism to turn that paper analysis into housing -- the law has no teeth," said Mr. Brown, a director of the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, based in Sacramento.
Because of this, affordable housing of all kinds is an urgent issue in California, which has some of the nation's highest home prices. The National Association of Home Builders ranked 17 cities in California among the 20 least affordable housing markets in the nation. The least affordable of all, the association said, was San Francisco, where just 10.6 percent of the homes sold in the third quarter of 1991 were affordable to households earning the median household income of $49,900.
Financing is another, and possibly deeper, problem. Because very-low and low-income housing generate only a modest rental income, individual lenders are rarely willing to assume all the risk for such projects. Often, lenders prefer to take only a small percentage of any project, obliging the home builder to cobble together financing from many sources. Among these are subsidies and grants from public agencies, equity from tax-credit investors and multiple "gap" loans, to make projects work.
After attracting the lenders, home builders must get the different lenders and investors to agree on terms. The presence of more lenders causes more delay and increases legal fees, necessitating more subsidies and loans.
"Things have gotten way out of hand in terms of the complexity of financing these projects," said Ann Sewill, executive director of Los Angeles Community Design Center, another nonprofit home builder.
She recounted a recent conversation with a commercial developer. "He told me, 'We put up $1 million to make $1 million; you put up $1 million to make $100,000,' " Ms. Sewill recalled.
Beyond financing, politics may be the most stubborn barrier to affordable housing in the state. Many homeowners believe that low- and moderate-income units in their neighborhoods will hurt property values, and they oppose such projects bitterly with the help of their local political leaders.
"When it comes time to put the 'fair share' of lower-cost housing into cities, neighhbors are increasingly hostile," Mr. Brown, the housing lobbyist, said. He blames the rise of "nimbyism," or the philosophy of "not in my back yard," for the opposition to affordable housing in middle-class neighborhoods.
Sunne Wright McPeak, a Contra Costa County supervisor and housing activist, concurs. "Any one at the local level who has had to vote for affordable housing realizes there is no constituency for it," she said.
Sometimes opposition to affordable projects comes from home-buying newcomers who want to maintain and enhance property values in older neighborhoods. In the case of the troubled project in Santa Monica, people had "moved into a neighborhood recognizing that it was a low-income area but wanted to prevent the creation of new low-income housing," according to Ms. Ling of Community Corporation, the home builder.
She said that two neighborhood groups were involved in the controversy over the proposed low-income housing: longtime blue-collar residents who generally favored it, and white-collar newcomers who fought it.
In other cases, the protest comes from people sensitive to environmental issues, who perceive some projects as engines of urban sprawl and traffic congestion.
Ms. McPeak described the political resistance to affordable housing as a Catch-22 situation. "If you build on the suburban edge, you get less opposition from neighbors but more from opposition environmental groups," she said. On the other hand, projects in existing residential areas "bother environmentalists less but irritate the neighbors more."
Although it may be impossible to quiet all neighborhood protest, Ms. McPeak said certain strategies can reconcile some neighbors to affordable housing developments. Often, infill projects that occupy only one or two residential lots, and bring about little increase in the existing density, may seem less objectionable than a high-density apartment building.
Architectural compatability with the existing neighborhood is another element often insisted upon by residents, according to Ms. McPeak.
In Santa Monica, one Community Corporation project mimics the two-story stucco apartment buildings that surround it, while another displays the clapboard siding that echoes that of surrounding 1940's-era homes.
And projects that provide some community amenities may also help win acceptance for low-income projects, according to Ms. McPeak.
She cited a 200-unit project in unincorporated Contra Costa County that drew fire from both residents and environmentalists when first proposed; half the units were to be market rate, with the remainder to be below-market.
The developer, Bridge Housing Corporation of San Francisco, appeased environmentalists by preserving a riparian habitat on the site, and won over some neighbors by creating a child-care center.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: HAMPTON;
Landowners Endorse an Effort To Preserve a Scenic Riverside

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE Little River in Hampton is well known among anglers as one of the state's premier trout streams, a wild and scenic stretch of water through one of Connecticut's most rural areas. And an effort by Earth Care, a local environmental group, could keep it that way.
The organization recently persuaded the owners of six tracts along the Little River to grant conservation easements to Joshua's Tract Conservation and Historic Trust Inc., preserving more than a half-mile of the river for the future. 
 "We got the easy people first, the people who have always supported what we're trying to do," said an organizer of the effort, Thomas A. Gaines. "Now we have nine and a half miles to go."
 
'I Love the Land'
 Mr. Gaines said Joshua's Trust already had a start on the process, because it owns the 100-acre Preston Sanctuary, on the river in the northern end of Hampton. Most of the new easements are in the town's south.
Kevin Kavanagh, who owns about 10 acres in Hampton, signed an easement to an acre along the river, with 200 feet of frontage. "I love the land and appreciate that it was kept the way it was before I got it," Mr. Kavanagh said. "As long as I'm alive, I'm going to keep the river as it is. And this gives me a chance to make sure it stays that way after I'm gone."
The people who donate the easements -- no one has been paid for them -- incur no expense. But if they ever decide to sell the property, the conservation easement could affect the price, since use of the property would be limited.
Mr. Kavanagh's agreement says that he cannot develop the property commercially, log it or otherwise damage the watershed. "As far as I'm concerned, those were never options for me anyway," he said. "So what am I losing?"
For others, the easements offered a way of preserving a precious past. Margaret Fox is a widow, and her husband owned the seven-acre tract along the Little River before they were married 35 years ago. He often walked by the river, she said, and she still walks there, particularly in the spring, on the road that leads by the hemlock grove he planted when they were newlyweds.
The Little River begins at the Hampton Reservoir in the extreme northern part of town, and half of the river's 20-mile length meanders through Hampton, where about 70 properties go down to its banks. After leaving town, it goes through Scotland, Canterbury and Sprague, before dumping into the Shetucket River in Norwich. In Hampton the river is classified by the state Department of Environmental Protection as having the quality of drinking water. This is the town where the naturalist Edwin Way Teale chose to live, and many people there share his zeal for the environment.
Hampton's First Selectman, Walter A. Stone, attended the signing ceremonies for the easements. In some towns the chief elected officials would rail against something that might inhibit economic development, but Mr. Stone said he supported the project.
Five farmers have sold development rights to more than 1,000 acres of agricultural land in town under a state protection program, Mr. Stone said, and about 2,000 acres in the Goodwin State Forest are within Hampton's borders.
 
Named for 17th-Century Indian
 "I was on a bus from Atlantic City to Tolland recently, and the first spot of real green I saw was when we got to eastern Connecticut," Mr. Stone said. "Hampton is fortunate to have a lot of this type of land, and we should do what we can to keep it."
David L. Wagner, president of Joshua's Trust -- the organization was named for the Indian who bequeathed to settlers in the 17th century the land that is now the 10-town Windham region covered by the organization -- said the effort in Hampton will be a model for others. He said he knew of no other effort to keep an entire river pristine.
"It's acting out the idea that we should think globally but act locally," Mr. Wagner said. "This is a great example of that theory in action."
Mr. Wagner said an easement is better for Joshua's Trust than outright ownership of the land, because the trust does not have to maintain the property or be liable if it turns out that a former owner dumped toxic materials there.
"It's a way of circumventing development without having ultimate legal liability," Mr. Wagner said. "This is the quickest, easiest way to preserve corridors along a river. In fact, rather than buy property, we encourage just the opposite. We encourage people to give us an easement and put up an endowment for the future maintenance of the property."
Daniel K. Lamont, a lawyer in nearby Mansfield and the legal adviser to Joshua's Trust, said people do not give up many rights when they grant the easement.
"It really is, from the standpoint of the use of the property, a fairly innocuous thing," Mr. Lamont said. "Most of what they agree not to do they could not do anyway, without going through planning and zoning, and inland-wetlands and other approvals processes. Because of that, it really has very little impact on the value of the land."
In some situations these types of conservation easements, granted in large blocks, can be attractive to people who want to live in an area that is guaranteed to remain unspoiled, Mr. Lamont said, thereby increasing the value of the land.
Joshua's Trust has an impassioned preservation partner in Earth Care, a group that is an outgrowth of Ecology Action, formed during the first Earth Day more than 20 years ago, said one of its founders, Alison B. Davis.
"Initially what we did was waste management at the dump," Mrs. Davis said. "We were recycling things in Hampton long before most other towns."
The group acquired a trailer for newsprint recycling, then expanded into bottles, cans, tires and other materials.
"After a while the enthusiasm from that first Earth Day waned, and the group sort of disbanded," Mrs. Davis said. But resurrected as Earth Care, it has tried to focus attention on the environment through projects like a booklet that lists places where furniture, appliances and other items can be repaired, sold or donated, as an alternative to sending such items to a dump.
"We have to learn how to live the old Yankee adage, 'Use it up, wear it out, make do or do without,' " Mrs. Davis said. "We also know you have to talk and talk for years and years before you change people's way of thinking." Mrs. Davis and her husband, Wendell, own nine acres along the river, she said, and were eager to participate in the easement program.
"It's part of my whole way of looking at life," said Mrs. Davis, who is also the town historian. "We have to save some green space, some beauty. We have a responsibility to our children and grandchildren to save this space."
The permanent easement specifically prohibits sewage disposal, burning, dumping, woodcutting except for landscaping purposes, billboards, most agricultural activities, road building, obstruction of the water, and excavation of topsoil, sand or gravel.
"The people who are donating these easements are not going to do any of these nasty things along the river bank, you can be sure," Mr. Gaines said. "What they're doing is making sure no one does these things for generations to come."
If the owner of the property violates the agreement, the covenant allows Joshua's Trust to take him to court -- at his expense.
Mr. Gaines said he likes to compare Hampton to the farmland where George Washington fought with the British when he landed in New York during the Revolutionary War. Washington was traversing a dirt road flanked by fields. The road is still there, but now it is known as Broadway in Manhattan.
"A couple of hundred years from now, this is going to be prime property, a million bucks an inch," Mr. Gaines said. "You can be sure in 200 years we're going to have the same thing as Broadway -- except for our little greenbelt."

HEADLINE: Green Teens

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better; Nancy Marx Better, a New York-based freelance writer, specializes in business issues.

 BODY:
It's 11 on a cool Fall morning, and Sol Solomon, an 18-year-old native of Santa Monica, Calif., is pacing back and forth before some 900 students in an auditorium at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. Dressed in faded jeans and a T-shirt, his long black hair flowing from a baseball cap worn backward, Solomon is complaining about the environment's destruction. "The ocean I'm surfin' in is like a toilet that hasn't been flushed," he laments. "The sky has got colors in it Picasso couldn't even paint. What's going on here? Who's in control? Some corporate dude who wants to get rich? Some corporate dude who doesn't care about me?"
Amid cheers from his audience, Solomon reels off a dizzying list of ecological disasters: global warming, ozone holes, acid rain, toxic waste, vanishing wildlife. He tells how young consumers forced Star-Kist to stop buying tuna from fishermen who ensnared dolphins, how they stopped McDonald's from using foam containers and how they stopped Burger King from importing beef harvested from tropical rain forests. 
 "I know a lot of companies that are good, and I know a lot of companies that are bad," Solomon says. "So I'm going to speak out and boycott companies I don't like, because I can make a difference." Intoxicated by the potent juice of ecological righteousness, the Martin Luther King Jr. students clap wildly.
Solomon is a member of YES -- Youth for Environmental Sanity, a troupe of eco-crusaders that travels around the country preaching an evangelical mission with a funky mix of skits, slides and songs. Founded two years ago in Santa Cruz, Calif., YES, which is financed by Earth-Save and other environmental groups, has already reached more than 100,000 junior- and senior-high-school students, inspiring many to establish their own eco-clubs. The YES performers deliver an impassioned plea to their peers. "Who says we can't save the earth?" asks Solomon. "If we don't save it for ourselves, nobody's going to save it for us."
Earth Day is more than two decades old, and many adults have felt their ardor for the environment cool off. Not teen-agers. In a recent survey of 10,000 young people, the Bedford Kent Group, a New York consulting firm, found that more than 75 percent championed the environment as their favorite cause -- over homelessness, AIDS, illiteracy and drug abuse. Hundreds of groups are cropping up around the country, with punchy acronyms like HOW (Help Our World), STOP (Students Tackle Ocean Plastics) and LIFE (Let's Improve Future Environment). Just as the civil rights struggle and Vietnam shaped the baby-boom generation, global catastrophes like the Valdez oil spill or local crises like overflowing garbage dumps make their children brood darkly. They've adopted the movement their parents abandoned, convinced it's their job to turn back the tide.
To fight the good fight, so-called green teens have turned to tactics their parents should recall from college days. According to a survey by Alexander W. Astin, a U.C.L.A. education professor, the percentage of college freshmen who have taken part in protests is higher than ever -- surpassing even the late 1960's. Across America, teen-agers are nagging their parents to cast aside disposable diapers, disposable razors, disposable lighters. Chanting their movement's anthem -- "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!" -- they conduct environmental audits of their households, examining how much trash is produced, how much energy is consumed, how much water is used. At school, they lobby teachers to substitute ceramic mugs for foam cups. Even their little brothers and sisters are getting in on the act, shunning felt-tip markers with ingredients like toluene (bad) and ethanol (very bad) in favor of beeswax crayons.
It's a reversal of the age-old generational war: now children are bullying their parents into changing their behavior. At the Bel Air Elementary School in New Brighton, Minn., 17 sixth graders were suspended in 1990 for boycotting disposable trays. Barred from class, the malcontents cleaned up a local park. At the next board meeting, the administration capitulated and agreed to buy reusable trays districtwide.
Even an innocent picnic can become a test case for the green police. Barbara A. Lewis, a Salt Lake City schoolteacher and mother of four, remembers the look on her 13-year-old son's face when she brought home plastic cups. "It was as if I'd committed a crime," she says.
Before too long, it may be. In Closter, N.J., a handful of elementary-school students founded Kids Against Pollution (KAP) four years ago to protest foam containers. After speaking before the local Board of Education, the Mayor and the Town Council, the students succeeded in getting the substance banned from the entire community. Today KAP numbers more than 1,000 chapters across the country and abroad, in junior and senior high schools as well as elementary schools.
KAP is now lobbying Congress for an "environmental bill of rights." Their proposed statute, sponsored by Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, proclaims: "We believe we are entitled, by law, to clean air, land and water. It does not appear that our right to a clean environment is being upheld."
VERY POLITICAL movement has its heroes, its martyrs, its myths. Looming large in the green-teen pantheon is 17-year-old Joel A. Rubin, now a junior at Phillips Exeter Academy. In January 1990, as a freshman at Cape Elizabeth High School in Maine, he saw a TV film shot by Sam LaBudde, a San Francisco biologist who worked aboard a Panamanian tuna boat to document dolphins being slaughtered in tuna nets. "I didn't see how humans could murder them so brutally," says Rubin. "Maybe it's because I was taking biology at the time, and I knew dolphins were intelligent."
Rubin blames the blunder, in part, on the generation gap. "If my parents had seen the program on TV, they would have said, 'That's too bad about the dolphins, but that's life,' " he says. "They weren't taught how to save the environment when they were growing up."
With the help of his biology teacher, Rubin got the home addresses of three senior executives at H. J. Heinz, the parent company of Star-Kist, the largest producer of canned tuna in the world. He sent letters and received no reply. Frustrated, he enlisted 75 other biology students and deluged the Star-Kist executives' mailboxes with postcards. Says Rubin: "We wanted to affect these people on a personal level. We wanted them to come home every day to those postcards."
In April 1990 -- 10 days before Earth Day's 20th anniversary -- Star-Kist announced that it would no longer buy, process or sell tuna caught at the expense of dolphins. At the press conference, Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, president of Heinz, read a handful of postcards from the Cape Elizabeth students, including one that carried a single line: "How can you sleep at night knowing your company is doing this?"
The Star-Kist saga galvanized teen-agers everywhere. It also helped set the movement's confrontational tone. In the fall of 1990, KAP members mailed 3,000 letters to McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., begging the company to banish its foam containers. Last winter, McDonald's announced a switch to paper-based wrappings. The company also agreed to work with the Environmental Defense Fund on a waste-reduction program.
McDonald's was lucky; it succeeded in shoring up its image among young consumers. Other businesses haven't been so fortunate. In March 1990, a group of junior-high-school students in Walnut, Calif., persuaded the State Legislature to pass a bill banning the mass release of balloons at the beginning of football games and the like. Testifying before the state's Natural Resources Committee, the students argued that after balloons pop, tiny pieces float to earth, choking small animals and birds. The students won their vote -- dealing a severe blow to the balloon business in California.
If teen-agers have been remarkably successful at forcing concessions, it's probably because they have intransigence on their side. In April, 100 high-school students were invited to Pepsico's headquarters in Purchase, N.Y., for an environmental conference sponsored by the Volunteer Center of United Way. They refused to attend if box lunches were served, objecting to the excess packaging. It would have to be a buffet. "These kids were extremely strong-minded," says Louise Leeds, coordinator of the conference. "They weren't going to give an inch."
 GREEN TEENS AREN'T the first group of young people to threaten corporate America. But they may be the most effective. Opposition to Vietnam couldn't easily be expressed as a point-of-purchase decision, but opposition to environmental degradation can. "I think boycotting is something that allows you to make a real statement," says Ryan Eliason, who helped create the YES tour as a high-school senior in Santa Cruz, Calif. "It feels powerful. If you're saying to a company, 'No, I don't like what you're doing and I'm not going to support it,' you feel strong."
Thus far, only a handful of adults have capitalized on youth's enthusiasm for the environment. The most prominent is John Javna, author of a best seller, "50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth." Last fall his Berkeley, Calif.-based publishing firm, the Earthworks Group, brought out a sequel, entitled "Kid Heroes of the Environment," a collection of stories celebrating eco-victors. Prompted by the success of adult eco-magazines like Garbage and E, Marvel Comics introduced Captain Planet, a comic book based on an international band of teen eco-heroes who battle earth polluters. There's more to come: in 1993, New Line Cinema will release "Toxic Crusaders," a feature film based on a band of characters who are "faster than a nuclear meltdown, stronger than the Environmental Protection Agency and able to blow away radioactive fallout in a single breath."
"50 Simple Things" has spawned a flurry of junior self-help books, most of them advising teen-agers to help the earth by acting nice, not by acting up. In early 1993 the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities will publish, with Ballantine Books, a youth version of its best seller, "Shopping for a Better World," which rates the makers of 2,000 grocery products, based on companies' social, political and economic policies. "Our aim is to have consumers of every age turn their shopping carts into vehicles for social change," says Alice Tepper Marlin, president of the council.
That's no idle threat. According to the Rand Youth Poll, the 28 million teen-agers in the United States from ages 12 to 19 have almost $60 billion to burn. While the number of teen-agers has declined over the last decade, their purchasing clout has doubled. What's more, busy parents dole out $28.3 billion to kids for family grocery shopping. All told, the Rand group estimates the impact of teen-agers on the United States economy at about $230 billion per year.
Not surprisingly, green marketing is booming -- for adults and children alike. Some 600 new "green" products were unveiled in 1990, which means such introductions are increasing at a rate 20 times faster than the overall rate for new packaged goods. Many of these introductions are targeted at children. Animal Grahams, a line of crackers made by the Small World Products Group, depicts 11 endangered species, including pandas, elephants and rhinoceroses. Made from organically grown flour, they're packaged in biodegradable cardboard boxes with soybean ink. The Small World Products Group plans to donate 2 percent of the wholesale price of the crackers to environmental causes.
Some companies, like Chevron, Exxon, Scott Paper, Weyerhaeuser, and Procter & Gamble -- are setting up environmental-education programs to improve their image among young consumers. Sebastian International, a hair-care manufacturer based in Woodland Hills, Calif., recently began a project called Little Green, which includes "eco-literacy" contests in elementary schools.
But corporations should be wary about sprucing up their reputations with a coat of green paint. "When a company spends money trying to convince people it's a good citizen instead of trying to actually alleviate pollution, kids nose it out," says Peter Bahouth, former executive director of Greenpeace.
THE MOLDING OF THE green mind generally begins at school, where, since the giant eco-disasters of the early 80's, teachers have been struggling to explain environmental issues. Ari Raisa, who teaches science at Brooklyn Friends School, is an example. "I told them to come up with a product they feel is strongly connected with environmental problems, and then research how it's made and how it's disposed of," he says.
The strategy seems to work. Tara Satahoo, a sophomore, says her family no longer buys juice in plastic jugs or coated-paper containers; they make it from concentrate, in glass jars. When she goes grocery shopping, she carries a reusable plastic bag. "We talk about products at school, so I know what's okay to buy," Satahoo says.
When these teen-agers hit college, their activism tends to intensify -- and occasionally goes right off the rails. When a Shell Oil recruiter visited the University of Minnesota, Eric Odell, a senior, donned a gas mask and poured blood-colored paint from a gasoline can over a pile of fake money stacked on a table in front of a Shell Oil recruiter. "I'm one of those people who needs reining in at times," he says.
Today, Odell is affiliated with the Student Environmental Action Coalition, the nation's biggest and bold est youth-run ecological organization. Founded in 1988 by students at the University of North Carolina, the coalition now has 1,500 chapters on college and high-school campuses. In October 1990 it sponsored the largest gathering of young environmentalists in history, attracting 8,000 students.
The conference kicked off the coalition's Corporate Accountability Campaign, in which members conduct environmental audits to change the behavior of the business world. Students at Ohio University plan to boycott British Petroleum, requesting reforms in its waste-management process. The coalition's members at the University of Colorado boycotted Coors beer, demanding less pollution in the Rocky Mountains. Students at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque boycotted acid- and stone-washed jeans, which are made with pumice, a lightweight volcanic rock produced by strip mining. The main target: Levi Strauss & Company, which holds 49 percent of the jeans market. "We want to use public pressure to make corporate America clean up its act," says Randolph L. Viscio, the coalition's national outreach coordinator.
The group recently called for a boycott of Mitsubishi, the giant Japanese conglomerate, which finances logging in South American rain forests.
Today Mitsubishi, tomorrow the world. "I think S.E.A.C. represents the future of environmentalism," says Viscio. "We're trying to broaden the definition to include everything that surrounds us."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries and Caucuses;
HARKIN ENDS QUEST AS CAMPAIGN RISES TO NEW INTENSITY

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 8

 BODY:
The Democratic field will narrow to three on Monday with the withdrawal of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, signaling a new intensity of the Presidential race as it moves through the battlegrounds of the South and on to the industrial Midwest.
Mr. Harkin, who campaigned as a "real Democrat" and a tough voice for traditional liberalism, told supporters today that he intended to withdraw, said senior Democrats who spoke on condition that they not be identified. The decision will trigger a scramble for Mr. Harkin's backing among the ranks of organized labor. And it is emblematic of the grim winnowing now under way in the Democratic field, coming only three days after the withdrawal of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. 
 Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California all hustled across the South today, seeking votes in the Super Tuesday contests in 11 states.
 
Tempering Expectations
 Mr. Clinton campaigned in Texas, one of seven Southern or border states voting on Tuesday. Mr. Clinton hopes to replicate his showing in the South Carolina primary, in which he captured 63 percent of the vote Saturday.
Mr. Tsongas returned to Florida today, where he hoped to make his best stand in the South. But he is trying to temper expectations for his showing across the South on Tuesday, after placing a distant second in South Carolina with 19 percent of the vote.
"I think Tuesday will be his day, I acknowledge that," Mr. Tsongas said of Mr. Clinton at a news conference earlier today in Nashville. "I think he'll do well in his territory." Mr. Tsongas, who has fought bitterly with Mr. Clinton in recent days, added, "After Tuesday, we go into neutral territory."
Mr. Brown today showed once again his ability to compete in this unpredictable political terrain, collecting 35 percent of the support to win the Democratic caucuses in Nevada. With more than 95 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Clinton had 26 percent of the vote and Mr. Tsongas 20 percent
Senior Democrats, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said Mr. Harkin began informing top supporters about his decision to withdraw this afternoon. The political math had been grim for Mr. Harkin for several weeks now, with his resources dwindling and his rankings in the primaries and caucuses never giving him the lift he desperately sought.
His campaign spokeswomen declined to comment on his plans, saying only that Mr. Harkin had scheduled news conferences Monday at Gallaudet University in Washington and later in the day in Des Moines. John Roehrick, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said in an interview today that Mr. Harkin's candidacy had succeeded in that "he got folks to look at domestic issues and the lack of attention focused on them by the President."
Mr. Harkin had, in fact, been one of the most aggressive voices in the party in the summer of 1991. At a time when President Bush was still towering in public opinion polls, the Iowan was insisting that his party had nothing to fear in a battle against Mr. Bush in 1992.
 
'Where Does Labor Go?'
 Mr. Harkin had attracted considerable labor support, and many Democrats had expected him to stay in the race until Michigan's primary on March 17, the same day as Illinois's. "Right now, the big question is where does labor go, as we head into Michigan," said a Democratic official.
George Stephanopoulos, deputy campaign manager for Mr. Clinton, said, "Governor Clinton is going to do everything he can to gain support among Tom Harkin's constituencies, and we think they'll be attracted to Mr. Clinton's message of people-first economics."
Mr. Brown is also building some appeal among labor, some Democrats said. And Mr. Tsongas said at a news conference here tonight, "I'm the candidate of economic growth," an argument meant to be appealing to labor. Still, Mr. Tsongas has disagreed with unions on legislation to outlaw the hiring of permanent replacements for striking employees.
This stage of the Democratic primary campaign features struggles on a variety of fronts, but the underlying dynamic is simple: the accumulation of the 2,145 delegates needed to win the nomination.
In general, delegates pledged to a candidate who withdraws are free to commit to someone else, although the wish of the departing candidate can play a role.
After Saturday's primary in South Carolina, and the caucuses in Wyoming and Arizona, a delegate tally by The New York Times showed Mr. Brown with 51 delegates, Mr. Clinton with 293, Mr. Tsongas with 141, Mr. Harkin with 86 and Mr. Kerrey, who dropped out of the race on Thursday, with 27. The tally includes the preferences of superdelegates, who are national committee members, governors and distinguished former leaders.
In addition to his strong showing Saturday in South Carolina, Mr. Clinton won Wyoming with 28 percent of the vote, followed by Mr. Brown with 23 percent, Mr. Harkin with 14 percent and Mr. Tsongas with 12 percent. Mr. Tsongas won Arizona.
A poll conducted by Voter Research and Surveys of people leaving voting booths in South Carolina showed Mr. Clinton forging a powerful coalition for a Democratic primary in the South, capturing 77 percent of the black voters and 55 percent of the white. Mr. Tsongas received just 5 percent of the black vote in South Carolina, and he acknowledged today, "We are way behind the curve on this."
As in Georgia and New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas's strongest showing in South Carolina was among the voters with the highest incomes. Ten percent of the voters in the Democratic primary there had incomes over $75,000 a year, and Mr. Tsongas captured more than half of their votes. He split the voters with the highest level of education with Mr. Clinton.
Stan Greenberg, the poll taker for Mr. Clinton, asserted that Mr. Clinton had succeeded in putting together "the closest thing to a Robert Kennedy coalition we've seen in a long time," combining black voters with "white Democrats with moderate means and moderate views to form a very large coalition in the South." Clinton allies seem increasingly optimistic about the strength of their candidate's showing on Super Tuesday.
On the Republican side, Mr. Bush received 67 percent of the vote in South Carolina, considered one of his strongholds, while Patrick J. Buchanan won 26 percent and David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and Louisiana State Representative, won 7 percent.
Mr. Buchanan, the conservative political columnist who has not won a primary, campaigned in New England today and tried to slough off Mr. Bush's showing. "In South Carolina, his very best state where we could only campaign two days, he lost a third of the vote and 40 percent of the men," Mr. Buchanan said.
 
Hoping to Undercut Duke
 Still, Mr. Buchanan acknowledged that he would soon have to win a state. He clearly hopes that the results in South Carolina will undermine any credibility Mr. Duke has as a candidate.
The exit poll in South Carolina showed a continued protest vote against Mr. Bush: 22 percent of Republican primary voters said they were sending a message, and among that group 66 percent voted for Mr. Buchanan and 22 percent voted for Mr. Duke.
Again, Mr. Bush prospered from the votes of women: 59 percent of the men voted for Mr. Bush, 32 percent for Mr. Buchanan and 8 percent for Mr. Duke. But 76 percent of the women voted for Mr. Bush, 18 percent for Mr. Buchanan and 6 percent for Mr. Duke.
Moreover, the exit poll showed that economic concerns ranked high among those voting in the Republican primary: Nearly three-quarters said they considered the nation's economy either not so good or poor.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The Election Day poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout South Carolina on Saturday.
The poll was conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, an organization created in 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and NBC News.
The results are based on replies by 970 voters in the Democratic primary, and 1,368 voters in the Republican primary from 30 randomly selected precincts around the state.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results from such polls should differ by four percentage points in either direction for both Democrats and Republicans from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters in the South Carolina primary.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting a survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to complete questionnaires, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: The Gun Culture: Fun as Well as Life and Death

SERIES: 200 Million Guns -- Second article of a series

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
It is sunny and in the low 60's on a winter's Friday afternoon. Bruce W. Nelson, a leathersmith who specializes in gun belts and holsters, and his wife, Sandra S. Froman, a lawyer, have invited friends to their home in the cactus-studded foothills of the Catalina Mountains for some pistol shooting.
Starting with .22 revolvers, moving on to .45-caliber and 9-millimeter semiautomatics, they shoot soda and beer cans, hitting them low so they pop into the branches of a paloverde tree. 
 Over at the Tucson Rod and Gun Club, Les Blevins, a water well operator, helps his 10-year-old son, David, align the sights of their rifle and fire at paper targets 100 yards down range. They are preparing to hunt javelinas, spindly legged wild boars that weigh about 40 pounds. "He's going on his first hunt," Mr. Blevins says. "I get to see how good a coach I am."
At Jensen's Guns and Ammo, which does about $11 milllion a year in sales, James Jennings, a sheet-metal worker at the Lockheed Corporation, is looking for replacement parts for an old rifle. "I collect World War II stuff," he says. On weekends, he says, he fires 200 bullets into the desert, about $60 worth. "I enjoy it, just going out and shooting a nice quality weapon."
In the national debate over crime control, a gun, depending on one's view, is either an agent of evil that ought to be banned or restricted, or a constitutionally enshrined defense against evil. But in Arizona as in much of the country, there is a large American culture of gun owners for whom firearms are primarily agents of fun.
Some members of the gun culture here can recite the Second Amendment, which in their interpretation confers upon a citizen the right to bear arms against anyone from burglars and alien armies to a government gone berserk. But the right they pursue the most is the right to indulge in a pasttime that they find as benign and exhilarating as other people find shooting birdies on golf courses.
They see their ownership of firearms as something apart from the escalating violence of city streets around the country, or even from the drug wars that leave bodies in Tucson's desert outskirts.
What becomes clear in conversations here is a yawning gap in beliefs between the many Americans who see little use for guns and those who see them as an enjoyable part of their lives -- a gap that explains why it has been so hard for the country to agree on measures that might curb criminals' access to firearms.
For all their other uses, guns here are venerated levelers. A proverb of the frontier had it that "God made man, and Sam Colt made him equal," people here say.
"Man or woman, old or young, fat or thin, everyone on your right and everyone on your left has the potential to be as good as you are," said Phillip Murphy, a celebrity in the National Rifle Association for having twice used guns to trap burglars at his home, both times without firing.
Tucson, a city of sand, asphalt, the stately saguaro and the spaghetti-like cholla cactus that is said to fire its needles into the hides of the curious, seems no more a community of gunslingers than the Holy See. Federal law requires licensing of automatic weapons, like machine guns, but Arizonans can buy anything else on the spot, just by showing a driver's license. Outdoors, they can legally saunter about town packing pistols on their hips. But few do, and retiree golfers, much more than gun owners, set the tone of life.
The Tucson Police Department says the rate of property crimes here is one of the nation's highest, in part because many retirees vacate their homes in the hot summer. But the rate of violent crime is one of the nation's lowest for cities with more than 250,000 people. (The population of Tucson and its spreading suburbs is about 680,000, almost double the 1970 total of 352,000.)
Still, the police worry about people's caches of guns and how easy guns are to get.
 
The Targets
Bottles and Cans, Deer and Burglars
 In the gun culture here, some people merely collect guns. A few have hundreds, valued for their age and artistry, which they exhibit on walls of specially built walk-in vaults as big as a dining room. Thousands of other people have an interest no deeper than the gun in the table drawer, kept for self-protecton. Among active gun users, those who have scruples about hunting javelinas, deer, quail and other game are target shooters.
They go to the rod and gun club, the Tucson Trap and Skeet Club, the Pima Pistol Club or the two indoor ranges in town, where they compete in a sport that can be as rigorous and precise as any. Seth Nadel, a guest at Ms. Froman's and Mr. Nelson's and a serious competitor, explains a typical match:
"You shoot at a man-like silhouette with Olympic scoring rings on it. The center ring is the size of a pack of cigarettes." Standing 7 yards back, a contestant has 20 seconds to pepper the silhouette with 12 bullets. From 15 yards, he fires 12 more rounds within 20 seconds. From 25 yards, he has 90 seconds to fire 18 rounds, but from four positions. From 50 yards, he fires 24 rounds in 2 minutes 45 seconds, also from four positions.
One could hardly compete in a contest like this, shooters say, without a semiautomatic pistol, which holds 10 to 15 cartridges and fires a bullet with each squeeze of the trigger -- the very kind of gun some want to ban as being lethal in the hands of criminals.
More often, shooters in Tucson go "plinking" at cans and other objects in the desert. "Plinking's got to constitute 60 percent of all the ammunition that's fired out there," said Robert E. Jensen, president of Jensen's.
Whatever the uses of guns, shooters here recognize an etiquette they all seem to respect. Ms. Froman said, "You assume all guns are loaded, and you never point at a person, and you keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to fire." And you hand someone a gun with the chamber open and empty.
 
The Merchants
A Business Built On Gun Culture
 If any one institution defines the gun culture of Tucson, it is Jensen's. With 70 employees, it is the biggest gun retailer in Arizona and one of the nation's 10 biggest.
Mr. Jensen, approaching retirement at 62, got started here 34 years ago, after leaving Indiana in quest of work and a better place to shoot.
Mr. Jensen said he did not know how many people in town have guns. Anyone who has a gun for purposes other than protection, he said, tends to have at least four or five.
He has 9,000 customers on his mailing list, and he sells 15,000 guns a year. The No. 1 seller is a Colt .45 semiautomatic pistol for $500.
"The typical customer is upper blue-collar, married, with two incomes," Mr. Jensen said. But customers include doctors, lawyers, business owners and two local television celebrities.
Besides guns, the shop sells truckloads of ammunition, including five million reloaded shells, which are much cheaper than new ones, a year. It used to sell home-storage cases with glass doors to display guns. But home burglaries have driven the cases out of the market, and now Jensen's sells heavy steel safes -- about one a day -- for an average price of $500.
Jensen's nurtures the gun culture by catering to the young. "We have BB-gun contests for 6-to-10 year-olds," Mr. Jensen said. "If a parent buys a .22 for his child, we give the child a free box of ammunition a month for six months."
Once a year, the store sponsors a javelina hunt for parents and children. It conducts gun-safety classes.
Crime and gun abuse are problems, Mr. Jensen granted. "We know if we sell 15,000 guns a year, a few are going to be misused. Automobile dealers know a few of the cars they sell will be involved in a certain number of fatal accidents. It doesn't mean the gun culture condones it."
Mr. Jensen said the average customer bristles at proposals to regulate guns. "He says: 'I'm not the problem. Why are you unloading on me?' "
 
The Shooters
Lessons Learned From Grown-Ups
 Jensen's customers' involvement with guns covers quite a range. Mr. Jennings said his World War II collection includes survival gear, like camouflage uniforms and a gasoline cooking stove, as well as guns. "You never know, the economy could collapse," he said. "I like the idea of going to the wilderness and roughing it."
"I feel every household should have a gun," he went on. "If somebody breaks in, you're more likely to deter them. But I do kind of feel that if you have a gun in the house you should have a soft-point bullet so it won't go through your house into your neighbor's."
Another customer, Guyla Boswell, there with her sons Byrdeen, 6, and Bernie, 5, bought a rifle with a bayonet for her husband. Mrs. Boswell said she doesn't shoot, "but I can load one up if I need it. Protecting your family, I believe in that."
Byrdeen and Bernie have BB guns at home. At 10, when the law allows, they expect to trade up to .22's. "Go hunting, that's what me and my dad's going to do," Byrdeen said.
"Me, too," Bernie said.
Like the Boswell boys, many shooters here trace their attachment to guns to their fathers and their fathers' fathers. "We always had guns in the house," said Donald Burtchin, a Pima County environmental official.
Mr. Burtchin still has his first gun, a lever-action .22-caliber Winchester, and he has the first gun he bought himself, a pump-action .22 Winchester, called a gallery gun because it was used in amusement parks. He has a lever-action Winchester .30-30 that his paternal grandfather owned and a gallery gun that belonged to his maternal grandfather. He will pass them on to his child, Eva.
Ian Truex, who is 12, was at the Rod and Gun Club practicing shooting with his 4-H club. "My dad and I and my grandfather go hunting deer and bird," he said. "Never hit anything yet. I started last year. I would be real happy if I just got a shot at one." But even missing is more fun than anything else.
Sandra Froman got into shooting for quite different reasons. She was single, alone and living in Los Angeles when a man tried to break into her house. Her screams frightened him off, she said. "But I realized I was responsible for my own safety."
"I decided I was going to buy a gun and learn how to use it," she said, thus becoming one of a tiny minority of women who are active shooters.
Ms. Froman went to the American Pistol School at Gunsite Ranch in Paulden, north of Phoenix. "Shooting was a lot of fun because I was good at it," she said. At her Tucson home, she keeps a gun by the bedside, loaded. "If you don't keep it loaded and ready to shoot," she said, "it's not a self-defense weapon."
Ms. Froman and another shooter, Mr. Murphy, are leading members of the rifle association. They argue against gun control. They consider gun registration, giving the Government access to personal information about shooters, an invasion of privacy. And they argue that requiring a waiting period before buying a gun could jeopardize as many victims as it helps by denying a gun to a person who faces imminent danger. "You might protect a nut from getting a gun," Ms. Froman said, "but what about the victim?"
But like the uses of guns in Tucson, views about guns and gun regulation are diverse. "They think registering a gun is the first step in taking away their freedom," said Ian Truex's father, Dick. Mr. Truex has two rifles and two shotguns at home, and they are strictly for hunting. "I'm not political about it," Mr. Truex said. "The waiting period, that wouldn't bother me. I'm not going out to buy a gun the day I go hunting."

HEADLINE: Menachem Begin, Guerrilla Leader Who Became Peacemaker

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister who made peace with Egypt, lived much of his life in the opposition. A Jewish underground leader before Israel gained independence in 1948, he openly fought the established Zionist leadership of the struggle against British rule.
Then for nearly three decades, he headed Israel's major opposition party. 
 Ultimately and to many Israelis, surprisingly, his minority bloc ousted the Labor Party, which had governed continuously in the three decades since statehood, and Mr. Begin, as party leader, became Prime Minister. He was to govern an ever more divided and troubled nation.
Mr. Begin, who led Israel from May 1977 until he resigned as Prime Minister in 1983, stretched the national mood from great pride to deep dismay. He guided the nation to a peace treaty with Egypt, the first such pact with an Arab country. But he also presided over a bitterly divisive war against Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon.
If the treaty with Egypt, which brought Mr. Begin a shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize with President Anwar el-Sadat, represented a high point in his political leadership, the war in Lebanon in 1982 and the stalemate that followed, with its steady toll of dead and wounded, were its low point.
Started with the announced aim of evicting Palestinian guerrillas from operating too close to Israel's border with Lebanon, it brought Israeli troops to the outskirts of Beirut. It enmeshed Israel in the lethal sectarian politics of Lebanon, and led to a costly and indecisive occupation.
The invasion in June 1982 was seen by Israelis at first as a justified response to years of border harassment. But when the Israelis advanced to the outskirts of Beirut and bombed and shelled the Lebanese capital for 10 weeks, criticism and anguish arose at home and abroad.
 
Massacres at Camps Deeply Affect Israel
 Dissent reached a peak in the fall of 1982, when Lebanese Christian militia units entered Palestinian refugee districts at Sabra and Shatila that were supposedly under Israeli guard and killed hundreds of people.
The massacre led to an independent investigation ordered by the Israeli Government, which concluded that Israeli troops watched the killing from a distance and did nothing to stop it. Mr. Begin survived in office, but was shaken politically.
His medical problems -- he had suffered three heart attacks -- became an increasing burden. And in November 1982, his wife of 43 years, Aliza, died while he was on a trip to the United States. Thereafter, Mr. Begin became increasingly listless, participating little in debate in Parliament, taking less and less interest in politics and limiting his public appearances. On Aug. 28, 1983, he announced that he planned to quit and on Sept. 15 he formally resigned as Prime Minister.
Mr. Begin became something of a recluse. He lived with his daughter Leah in an apartment near the Jerusalem residence of his son, Benjamin, now a member of the Israeli Parliament and a leader in the Likud Party.
He was rarely seen in public and left his house only for rare visits to a hospital and memorial services for his wife. Yehiel Kadishai, a close friend and longtime adviser, visited daily and enabled Mr. Begin to keep up with correspondence. Mr. Begin also received visits from a small circle of friends.
 
A Sharp Contrast To Labor Predecessors
 When he became Prime Minister, Mr. Begin represented both political and stylistic change. He brought a new demeanor to the Prime Minister's office with his remote manner, a sharp contrast to the earthy and informal style of his Labor Party predecessors. Unlike the bulk of Israeli politicians, he was seldom seen other than in suit and tie.
And he moved the country in a distinctly different ideological direction.
Hours after his election victory, he visited an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, which had been overrun in the 1967 war, to declare it part of "liberated Israel." Labor Governments had avoided such declarations, but to Mr. Begin the West Bank was Judea and Samaria, Jewish land from biblical times.
His Government did not formally annex the West Bank, as it did the Golan Heights, a Syrian promontory captured in 1967 after its long use as a base for shelling northern Israel. But under Mr. Begin, the West Bank began to be heavily settled by Israelis.
Mr. Begin was also to return some Arab land taken in battle, a strip of Syrian territory won in 1973 and a town on the Golan Heights taken in 1967.
But the most significant territorial withdrawal, and for Mr. Begin the most personally wrenching, was in the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel returned to Egypt in three stages from 1979 through 1982. Jewish settlements in Sinai were abandoned under intense protest by their residents.
The Sinai withdrawal was the last stage of a process that began with Mr. Sadat's landmark visit to Jerusalem in November 1977, six months after Mr. Begin took office.
The Egyptian President, frustrated by the intransigence of Arab neighbors in the dealing with Israel, had hinted that he was prepared to go it alone in seeking peace and had said he would even travel to even Jerusalem, in pursuit of that goal. Mr. Begin responded with an invitation.
On a warm November evening, the wheels of the presidential aircraft, Egypt 01, touched down at Ben-Gurion Airport. Mr. Begin stepped forward and said: "I am waiting for you, Mr. President, and all the ministers are waiting for you."
Sixteen months of arduous negotiations followed, including the marathon talks at Camp David, Md, with the intercession of President Jimmy Carter. The process culminated in the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty signed in Washington on March 26, 1979.
But Mr. Begin's wariness toward the Arabs, on behalf of what he considered Israel's vital security interests, remained undiminished. In June 1981, he ordered the bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad. This was followed in July by two weeks of bombing in Lebanon.
In December, he pushed through Parliament a measure to annex the Golan Heights. This drew sharp criticism from Washington and other capitals, but Mr. Begin held his ground. His relations with the United States included many other difficult moments. When the Reagan Administration suspended an agreement on strategic cooperation with Israel and imposed financial sanctions because of the Golan annexation, Mr. Begin said his country was being treated like a "vassal state."
His relations with Egypt also changed. After Mr. Sadat was shot to death in Cairo, by Muslim extremists on Oct. 6, 1981, his successor, President Hosni Mubarak, seemed determined to calm the hostility toward Egypt in the rest of the Arab world because of its peace treaty with Israel. Relations between Egypt and Israel cooled, especially after the invasion of Lebanon the folowing year.
The 1977 visit to Jerusalem by Mr. Sadat and the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt gave Mr. Begin one of the great satisfactions of his career. He explained those feelings in a forceful and eloquent speech in Parliament that also addressed deeper concerns.
"Why is this peace treaty so important?" he asked. "This is the first peace treaty Israel ever signed, the first peace treaty after five wars in which we have lost 12,000 of our people. Our aim, our yearning and our dream is to smash this helix of hatred. We must sign this treaty because it is a human act of the highest degree."
At the treaty's White House signing, Mr. Begin called it "the third greatest day of my life" -- after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the unification of Jerusalem in the 1967 war.
The Israeli leader was seeking to place the signing into the historical context of his life, a life that until 1977 had been spent almost entirely in opposition -- to the mainstream of Jews in his native Poland, to both the German and Russian invaders of his homeland in World War II, to the established leaders of the Jewish military struggle against British rule in Palestine and to the decades of Labor Party government in Israel.
 
A Zionism Forged By Bible and Holocaust
 He believed fiercely, and contentiously, that the Jews had a right to a national homeland and that it should range over the land of their biblical forebears. This was Zion and he was a dedicated Zionist, if a follower of the Zionist Revisionist organization founded by Vladimir Jabotinsky.
He was marked forever by the Holocaust, which had wiped out all vestiges of his former life in Poland.
The pursuit of those goals was an easily identifiable thread running through his life. He was to he spend much time explaining and trying to justify what some considered extreme actions and statements.
The best-known of those occurred in 1946, when Irgun Zvai Leumi, the underground terrorist faction he headed during the final years of the British mandate in Palestine, blew up a wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which served as headquarters of the British administrators of Palestine. The attack killed 90 people, among them Jewish and Arab employees as well as British officials.
The most infamous incident was the Irgun's attack on an Arab village, Deir Yassin, in April 1948, in which more than 200 men, women and children were killed.
Two months after that assault, the freighter Altalena, loaded with arms and ammunition and 900 men recruited by the Irgun, came under fire from regular Jewish forces loyal to David Ben-Gurion, by then Prime Minister, who feared that the new Government of Israel might be overthrown or that civil war might break out after the fight against the Arabs was over.
Another, and sometimes rival underground faction, the Stern Gang, was headed by Yitzhak Shamir, who would in time become Mr. Begin's Foreign Minister, and Prime Minister on his resignation.
Mr. Begin struggled fiercely against Mr. Ben-Gurion, the mainstream Zionist leader and head of the regular Jewish force in the fight for nationhood. After independence was achieved in 1948 and Mr. Ben-Gurion became Israel's leader, their conflict exploded frequently.
 
From Coalition To Opposition
 From 1967 to 1970, Mr. Begin served in a war coalition, then withdrew when Israel began to consider an American proposal that would have linked withdrawal from the occupied territories with peace. In August 1970 he returned to the political opposition.
Mr. Begin, a brilliant speaker and writer, was also an enigma: often soft-spoken, mild- mannered and personable. Yet this slight but firmly built man, who dressed in gray and never lost the hand-kissing tradition of his early years in Poland, was described as having the flinty looks of a movie terrorist.
There was no doubt about his dramatic flair. Once during a speech in the immigrant quarter of Jerusalem, he began to describe the "guarantees" for Israel that were being offered by American diplomats seeking to encourage Arab negotiations. His voice rose and his manner grew intense. He pointed higher and higher, as if searching for something, until he had everyone looking skyward.
"Guarantees, guarantees -- maybe there you will find guarantees," he said, adding, as he pointed to the ground, "Not here!"
Early in 1977, with the Labor Government riddled by dissension and tainted, in the view of some, by corruption, Mr. Begin finally achieved the political recognition that had so long eluded him. Though weary from a heart attack two months before the election, he emerged with an upset victory and was asked to form a Government.
Several things brought about his victory: The Labor Party had become increasingly identified with worsening inflation, frequent strikes and a stagnant economy. Its scandals led to the creation of the Democratic Movement for Change, which drew a valuable 15 seats of 120 from Labor in the election, and briefly joined the new Likud coalition.
In addition, a "second Israel" of Jews from North Africa and the Middle East, the poor of the cities and new towns, had grown to become the nation's majority, and these people were attracted to Mr. Begin. Despite his European origin, they felt that he, too, had been outside the establishment, and he promised greater militancy toward the Arabs.
Mr. Begin retained power in 1981 after his right-wing Likud bloc emerged with a one-seat lead over the Labor alignment of Shimon Peres. His margin of success came from the religious parties, which enabled him to form a fragile governing coalition.
 
The Old Country Proved a Cruel Home
 Menachem Wolfovitch Begin was born on Aug. 30, 1913, in Brest, when it was still part of the czarist Russian empire. The area was returned to Poland in 1921, occupied by the Soviet Union in 1939 soon after Hitler's attack on Poland, overrun by the Nazis after Hitler turned on Stalin and attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, and ceded to Moscow in 1945.
Zionism was central to Mr. Begin's childhood. His father, Dov Zeev Begin, had been educated in Berlin and traveled widely for his father, a timber merchant. The elder Begin's travels brought him into contact with Jewish nationalists, the Zionist "heretics," as they were called by the traditionally minded.
Menachem, the youngest of three children, developed an early interest in oratory and made his first speech at the age of 10, in a mixture of Hebrew and Yiddish.
At 15 he joined Betar, the Zionist Revisionists' youth movement, and was trained in the use of weapons. Ten years later, with a law degree from Warsaw University, he headed Betar, which by then had 70,000 members in 600 Polish communities.
"My friends and I labored to educate a generation to be prepared not only to toil for the rebuilding of a Jewish state but also to fight for it, suffer for it and, if needs be, die for it," he said, paraphrasing Jabotinsky.
Mr. Begin fled from Warsaw ahead of the advancing Germans in 1939 and was in Polish-controlled Vilna in 1940 when the Russians occupied the city, now Vilnius, the capital of independent Lithuania. He obtained a visa to go to Palestine but gave it to a friend he thought would have more trouble.
The Russians arrested him, accusing him of being a Zionist and a British agent, and sent him to Siberia. His wife, whom he had married a year earlier, went on to Palestine, convinced that she could do nothing to help her husband. Later, she became quietly influential in her husband's political life while remaining out of the limelight. Besides their son Benjamin, they had two other children -- Hasia and Leah -- and eight grandchildren.
In later years Mr. Begin recalled the interrogations of his Siberian incarceration. They turned on the Russian Revolution, on Britain and Zionism, on Herzl and Jabotinsky.
"From my early youth," Mr. Begin said later, "I had been taught by my father, who went to his death at Nazi hands voicing his faith in God and singing 'Hatikvah,' that we Jews were to return to the land of Israel -- not go, travel or come, but return."
It was a tenet that was to sustain him throughout his life. Nearly four decades later, visiting a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, he would chide reporters for calling the area occupied ("These are liberated territories"), for asking if they would be annexed ("You annex foreign land, not your own country"), and for references to the West Bank ("Say Judea and Samaria," the territories' biblical names).
Though sentenced to eight years in a labor camp, he was released by the Soviet Union in 1941 in an agreement with the Polish government-in-exile that freed 1.5 million Poles. Mr. Begin found his sister, the family's only other survivor, then joined the Free Polish Army. That took him first to Iran and then to Palestine.
Having learned English by listening to the BBC, he served in the British Army in Palestine as a conscripted interpreter until the end of 1943. Then he took over the leadership of the Irgun underground in the battle for a Zionist homeland.
 
Wanted by British With $50,000 Bounty
 By 1946 the British authorities were conducting an intensive hunt for the man they described as the "grim-faced, bespectacled Menachem Begin," placing a price of $8,000 on his head. Later, it was raised to $50,000.
The Irgun, often working with weapons and explosives purchased from the Arabs, set about breaking the grip of colonial rule. Mr. Begin, in his book "The Revolt," explained the group's actions this way:
"The arrest of British officers in order to secure the annulment of a death 'sentence,' the arrest of more officers which did not prevent the murder of our captive comrades, the whipping of officers in retaliation for the whipping of our young soldiers, hangings in retaliation for hangings."
In the first elections for Parliament, in January 1949, Mapai, the Labor Party, emerged with 44 seats; the left-wing Mapam won 15, the religious bloc, 16, and Mr. Begin's Herut Party, 14.
Leading the opposition, Mr. Begin called for retaliatory raids against Arab irregulars. He fought bitterly against ties with West Germany and was suspended from Parliament for organizing demonstrations.
He was forever demanding apologies in Parliament and being asked to apologize in turn, sometimes for personal remarks and sometimes for policy statements. He would demand preventive war, for example, only to hear an opponent say that "anyone who does so is a criminal against the Jewish nation." A policy dispute would become personal.
By the time of the 1956 war with Egypt, Mr. Begin's party was the second strongest. With the Israeli move into Sinai, the party lost much of the stigma of extremism, for the war was viewed by many Israelis as the expression of a policy long advocated by Herut.
In 1973, Mr. Begin broke an embargo on domestic criticism of the Government's action in failing to accurately gauge Arab intentions leading to the war. The Arab attack on Yom Kippur, he said, only underscored the need to retain occupied territories.
He resisted every pullback agreement, and in 1975 derided Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger for "telling us to trade territory for legitimacy."
"We don't need legitimacy," Mr. Begin said. "We exist. Therefore we are legitimate."
 
With Power, Some Compromises
 Although Mr. Begin did in time exchange territory for a form of legitimacy by giving up the Sinai and withdrawing Jewish settlements in return for peace with Egypt, he began as Prime Minister in a familiarly militant fashion. He visited a West Bank settlement, Elon Moreh, the day after the 1977 election and declared: "We stand on the land of liberated Israel. There will be many Elon Morehs. There will be many, many settlements in the coming weeks."
In supporting the establishment of West Bank settlements, Mr. Begin made a distinction between those in territory within biblical Israel and those outside, like in Sinai.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Begin became somewhat less outspoken and dramatic, learning to accept the necessary compromises of governing. He drew former opponents into the Cabinet: Moshe Dayan, Defense Minister in Labor Cabinets, became his Foreign Minister, only to resign in October 1979 over relations with the Arabs.
In the 1950's, Mr. Begin had called "every German a Nazi, every German a murderer," but as Prime Minister he congratulated the West Germans for freeing a hijacked Lufthansa airliner in Mogadishu, Somalia, and he met with the West German Ambassador.
Politically, he survived a challenge from the Labor Party a year after he took office. He suffered from diabetes as well as a heart ailment, and there were rumors as early as mid-1979, vigorously denied, that he was working on a reduced schedule. There were calls in Parliament for his resignation, but none was successful and he survived many votes of confidence.
While Israel under Mr. Begin returned the Sinai to Egypt, it seemed to strengthen its hold on the other occupied territories -- principally, the West Bank and the Golan Heights -- through the establishment of the settlements.
Israel, under Mr. Begin, changed the unit of currency from the pound, a vestige of British rule, to the shekel, a coin used by the ancient Hebrews.
And Parliament, under Mr. Begin, formally declared all of Jerusalem, a city divided into Jewish and Arab sectors before the 1967 war, to be the nation's undivided and eternal capital -- an act that was not recognized by most other countries.
Mr. Begin's party was narrowly returned to power in 1981 in an election campaign marked by violence, the first such for Israel. The confrontations often pitted Sephardim, the Jews from the Arab lands who identified with Mr. Begin, against the formerly governing Ashkenazim, those from Europe.
These clashes bespoke a rift in Israel that was to become deeper, especially during the Lebanon war. Those backing Israeli military action often came from Sephardic ranks, those opposing it from the Ashkenazim.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Profile;
No Longer Target of Jokes, Brown Becomes a Force

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 8

 BODY:
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, the butt of so many Republican jokes, is no longer a joke.
The introspective, ascetic Mr. Brown has developed a loyal, even passionate, following with his message of disaffection and calls for a national health care system and a program for nonpolluting energy sources. Yet he has a campaign staff of only seven paid workers, only two of them with political experience, no paid political consultants or speech writers, little advertising and almost no money because he has imposed a limit of $100 per contributor, a 10th the legal limit for individuals. 
 Mr. Brown has now emerged as a potent force after winning the Nevada caucuses today, the Colorado primary last Tuesday and making strong showings in Maine, Utah, Washington and other states.
Many political experts are beginning to say that he could well go to the Democratic National Convention in New York with enough delegates to play a pivotal role should neither of the front-runners, Gov. Bill Clinton and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, have enough votes to win the nomination. Just what Mr. Brown might want in exchange for his support remains uncertain.
All this has been achieved by one of the most unlikely major political campaigns in many a year. His new prominence comes less than half a year after he dropped out of the race for a United States Senate seat from California, a race, experts said, in which he stood to win the nomination but lose the race to a Republican candidate. Mr. Brown, who will turn 54 years old on April 7 and has been in politics for more than 20 years, has portrayed himself as an "insurgent" outsider against the established system. As of March 3, he had raised only $1,070,108, most of it through a toll-free telephone number, from 19,406 small contributors. This is less than a fifth of what Mr. Clinton has raised.
 
'A Natural Constituency'
 "Because Jerry is so irritating to many people, offensive to many in the press, there is a proclivity to say he's a jerk," said Richard Maullin, a Los Angeles political strategist who Mr. Brown appointed chairman of the California Energy Commission when he was Governor. "But there is a segment of the electorate that is a natural constituency for him."
That constituency, according to recent exit polls conducted at state primaries, tends to be those voters who have grown up in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate era of political cynicism. "It tends to be a person who has not voted before," said Mr. Brown's campaign manager, Jodie Evans, his long-time aide and fund-raiser.
An exit poll conducted by Voter Research and Surveys of voters leaving polling places in Colorado last Tuesday found significant differences between Brown voters and those who preferred Mr. Clinton or Mr. Tsongas. The Brown voters tended to be younger, better educated, more liberal and far more concerned about the environment.
Joseph Scott, a Los Angeles political commentator, calls it the "MTV vote." For example, of the Colorado voters who cited the environment as a top issue influencing their votes, 55 percent supported Mr. Brown, 19 percent Mr. Tsongas and 12 percent Mr. Clinton. On the other hand, the much larger number who cited the economy and jobs as the top issue were much less likely to vote for Mr. Brown. Polls of voters in Georgia and Maryland showed he did not have strong appeal among black and minority voters.
Mr. Brown has commissioned only two polls, one in Iowa and the other in New Hampshire. Donald D. McDonough of Evans/McDonough Inc., which did the surveys, said the results showed Mr. Brown benefits from cynicism and pessimism over government.
 
Slightly Disorganized
 The national Brown campaign operates out of a high-ceilinged ground-floor suite of offices in a modernistic office park in this seaside Los Angeles suburb. About 50 volunteers, most of them too young to remember the Vietnam War, do the drudge work. The mood reflects the candidate's personality: slightly disorganized and easily distracted.
The operation is hand-to-mouth, orders for television time and other decisions being made day to day depending on how much money comes in daily through the toll-free number. "Operators standing by and so is media consultant," joked the media consultant, Sidney Galanty, whose Santa Monica firm, Galanty & Company, produced a 30-minute documentary-style commercial on Mr. Brown that is being shown on television and cable channels in crucial states.
But what the campaign lacks in money and professional support is offset by Mr. Brown's intellect and energy. "People who write off Jerry Brown do not realize he's the brightest guy running for President," said Tom Quinn, who managed some of his earlier campaigns. "He's willing to work day and night."
Unlike the other campaigns, the small Brown entourage usually travels by commercial flight, though in recent days that has become more difficult with the addition of newly interested news crews. To save money, Mr. Brown usually sleeps at the homes of supporters rather than in hotels.
For political advice, Mr. Brown relies mainly on Ms. Evans, his campaign manager, and Michael Ford, a political strategist from Maryland. Aides say he also regularly consults with the political strategist who engineered Jimmy Carter's 1976 race for President, Patrick H. Caddell, who is not paid.
During the recent Colorado race, Mr. Brown talked about his race with the mixture of religion and introspection that have long marked the political career of this former Jesuit seminarian. He said he meditated in a Trappist monastery for a few weeks before beginning his bid and that he searched his soul to make sure of "purity of intention." Asked if he succeeded in being pure, he responded, "That's the goal -- the ego is always intruding."
Friends say Mr. Brown, the son of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California, has eyed the Presidency since 1971, soon after he was elected California Secretary of State when he was 33. Four years later, he was elected Governor and while in office ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1976, winning six late primaries but losing to Jimmy Carter. After re-election in 1978, he again tried for President in 1980, but won no primaries. In 1982, his political career went into eclipse after he lost a race for the United States Senate to Pete Wilson, who is now the Republican Governor of California.
Having a cushion from a substantial financial base provided by his wealthy father, Mr. Brown, who is not married, took seven years after that defeat to work with Mother Teresa in ministering to the poor in Calcutta and study Zen Buddhism in Japan. His return to politics came in 1989 when he sought and won the chairmanship of the California Democratic Party, then quit that post in March 1991 to run for the Senate, only to drop out of that race in September to run for President.
As Governor, Mr. Brown was seen a visionary thinker by some, a flake by others. His insistence on living in a $250-a-month apartment with a mattress on the floor rather than the Governor's mansion and driving an old Plymouth rather than riding in a limousine struck some as virtuous, others as immature and self-indulgent. (Campaigning in New Hampshire, he said he would live in the White House.)
As Governor, he pushed for passage of a landmark bill giving farm workers the right to collective bargaining, created the California Conservation Corps and pressed for using less-polluting energy sources. His airy spiritualism and focus on blue-sky technology earned him the derisive nickname "Gov. Moonbeam."
To this day, Mr. Brown elicits strong reactions among Californians, both positive and negative. According to the most recent California Poll, which is conducted by an independent private organization, 45 percent of California Democrats were inclined to vote for him for President and 47 percent were not, with only 8 percent having no opinion.
He has long elicited strong opinions. In 1981, before his Senate loss, the California Poll found 53 percent of all Californians rated Mr. Brown's performance favorably and 42 unfavorably. By August 1986, with Mr. Brown out of office and away, the rating turned negative, 50-44. By February 1991, just after he announced his intention to run for Senate, the rating was 40-40, and it had hardly changed by the time he dropped out of the Senate race to run for President, standing at 42 percent favorable to 41 unfavorable. (The margin of sampling error ranged from 3 to 5 percentage points either way, depending on size of sample.)
 
Message of Change
 His campaign for President rests on several pillars. The main one is a vague attack on the system in which he promises to "deliver a message to those who run the United States of America like a private club that we are going to work change." His platform includes a flat 13 percent Federal tax on income and goods and services, with deductions only for charitable giving, home mortgage interest and rent; a national health care system, and a vigorous program to develop energy sources that are nonpolluting.
For now, the goal is to stay alive in the primaries. Without money to buy much television advertising, Mr. Brown relies mainly on free broadcast tiem, like radio talk shows. In addition, Mr. Galanty has bought television time for the 30-minute commercial in primary states and some unconventional national outlets, like the Discovery science channel on cable. He spent only $65,000 on media in New Hampshire and $38,000 in Colorado, compared with hundreds of thousands by the Clinton and Tsongas campaigns.
The progam confronts directly the "Gov. Moonbeam" problem, saying that conventional politicians and big companies began to call him names because he would not go along with their game.
Mr. Brown's main vulnerability is the charge that he is a hypocrite because, in previous campaigns and as Democratic chairman, he raised millions from the special interests he now denounces. As recently as Sept. 24, 1990, when he was chairman, he applauded a Federal judge's ruling that struck down a initiative voters passed to put limits on campaign contributions, calling it a "pernicious" measure that aids incumbents. Now he says such limits are needed to oust incumbents.
His explanation for the apparent discrepancy is that he learned the corrupting influence of major contributors when he was chairman.
While many leading Democrats here are dubious about this change of heart, few dismiss the Brown candidacy. "All of us laughed at Paul Tsongas 10 months ago," said Phil Angelides, who succeeded Mr. Brown as chairman of the California Democratic Party.
The experts are divided over whether Mr. Brown, given his high negatives in his home state, can win the June 2 primary here. But almost all agree he has a rock-solid support of one-third to one-half of Democrats, assuring him a good portion of the delegates from the largest state.
And given the low cost of his campaign, there is every reason to believe he will stay for the duration. As Mr. Quinn put it: "If Clinton or Tsongas think Jerry will be out soon, they've got a big surprise coming."

HEADLINE: Investors Say Connecticut Empire Is Fraud

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., March 6

 BODY:
In a burst of real-estate speculation in the heady 1980's, Jonathan Googel, Benjamin Sisti and Frank Shuch dazzled Connecticut with their wealth, their flamboyance and their deals. As many as 6,000 people invested $350 million in partnerships of their Colonial Realty Company that bought shopping centers, apartment complexes and office buildings.
The dealing stopped in September 1990, when banks forced Colonial into bankruptcy. The company's demise proved to be not the end of an economic era, but the end of an illusion. Rather than a legitimate business, creditors and lawyers representing investors say, Colonial had been an enormous open checkbook for the three partners. They say it was not merely one of the decade's largest investment debacles, but one of its largest frauds. 
 Lawyers and accountants who have examined Colonial's records say the company's three partners designed real-estate deals to generate commissions and bank loans for themselves, rather than profits for their investors. To satisfy banks and keep the loans flowing, they said, Colonial falsified its own financial statements and those of thousands of investors.
Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti have attributed the fraud to Mr. Shuch, who was facing trial on fraud and embezzlement charges when he killed himself on Feb. 11. Before his death, Mr. Shuch tried to persuade Federal investigators that his partners were responsible for the fraud. Citing investigations by the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti have declined to be interviewed.
In this small, tight-knit state, home to most of Colonial's deals and most of its investors, the collapse has ruined retirements, friendships, businesses and banks. Thousands of people have their plans suspended while banks sue for as much as $100 million still owed on shares in now-worthless investments.
In the close circles of well-off lawyers and other professionals around Hartford, the original targets of Colonial's tax-shelter deals, there is embarrassment as much as anger.
"I think an awful lot of Colonial investors, and I being one, had stars in our eyes," said Arthur T. Anderson, a Hartford housing developer and property manager. "We were being greedy. We were promised extraordinary returns, and we believed it."
But Colonial also sold its $50,000 shares to teachers, police officers, masons and thousands of other middle-class and working-class people, many of whom tapped retirement accounts or home-equity loans to make down payments. Their investments are nightmares, and a basic trust in the system has been shattered.
"All my life I worked to learn how to be an electrician," said Joseph Cherubini of Wolcott, who bought a $50,000 share in one partnership. "These guys went to the school of how to take it away from you."
Across the country, larger, national real-estate syndicators have also fallen, including VMS Realty in Chicago and Southmark Corporation in Dallas. Herbert Biegel, a Chicago lawyer who worked on VMS's reorganization and now represents a group of Colonial investors, says that while Colonial was marked by unusual fraud, they were all flawed speculations.
"Colonial Realty," he said, "was nothing more than your ordinary, garden-variety Ponzi scheme."
But Colonial was Connecticut's Ponzi scheme. Its collapse was not an abstract financial disaster in which millions and billions lose their meaning. Across this state, everyone knows where Colonial's millions came from.
Frank Shuch, the former chief financial officer of Colonial Realty, killed himself on Feb. 11 by tying a plastic bag over his head in his house atop Avon Mountain in West Hartford.
He was 40 years old and facing trial on Federal charges that he embezzled at least $6 million from Colonial. By then, the glamour and mystique of Colonial Realty had been stripped away; its still-nouveau legends were already tattered and fading.
Colonial Gfounded in 1966 by Jonathan Googel and Benjamin Sisti, boyhood friends from New Britain working out of a hotel phone booth. Their business was managing properties; when it snowed, they shoveled.
They syndicated their first real-estate deal in 1975, using mortgages and $400,000 raised from investors to buy a 360-unit apartment complex in West Hartford.
Colonial hired Mr. Shuch (pronounced shook), an accountant, in 1980. By 1985, when he became chief financial officer and a partner in a related Colonial venture, the partners had syndicated more than 30 real-estate deals. In the next five years, as real-estate values in the Northeast soared, peaked and began to fall, they syndicated nearly 30 more.
Colonial's appeal to investors was basic: limited partners were guaranteed annual dividends and were promised a 300 percent profit over 10 years. The general partners personally guaranteed to buy back the shares of unhappy investors.
A typical prospectus put the net worth of Mr. Googel, Mr. Sisti and Mr. Shuch at $75 million or more. And certainly they lived extravagantly.
Colonial Realty parties were legendary. In 1988 a downtown Hartford street was closed at rush hour so limousines could carry guests to the company's Christmas party at the Hartford Hilton. For his twin daughters' bat mitzvah, Mr. Shuch had horse-drawn sleighs take guests from temple to country club.
 
Banks Want More Proof
 Investors were courted on Mr. Sisti's 93-foot yacht, Family Ties, while he built a house in Farmington that eventually grew to 52,000 square feet, slightly smaller than a football field.
Colonial, however, was trying to sell more and larger deals in a falling real-estate market. In 1990 it failed to sell all $60 million in shares in its last and largest deal, the Constitution Plaza office complex in Hartford. Banks, in crisis themselves, wanted more proof of assets.
That summer Colonial delayed a dividend payment. On Sept. 14, after reports that Mr. Sisti had changed his legal residence to Florida, where three houses had been bought in his wife's name, banks that were owed $40 million by Colonial forced it into bankruptcy court.
Within weeks Mr. Shuch was accused of stealing $6 million from Colonial. Colonial's own complaint said $2.7 million in checks had been written to "SRCA" and "KAMB" -- acronyms, it suggested, for "Shuch Residential Construction Account" and "Kim and Mindy's Bat Mitzvah." But far more was missing.
It was soon clear where much of Colonial's money had gone: records filed in the bankruptcy case showed the company's accounts were an open checkbook for its two general partners, Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti.
In August 1990, as Colonial was teetering, Mr. Sisti drew $164,550 directly, while $86,815 more was paid on his behalf, including a $14.38 check to Yale-New Haven Hospital.
Mr. Googel drew $183,131, plus $84,376 in payments on his behalf, for a total draw of $518,872 for both partners. Records show that in the three years preceding the bankruptcy, Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti drew $4 million in pay but $22 million for payments on their behalf for things like stock accounts, real-estate taxes and Mr. Sisti's $37,000-a-month mortgage payment on his house in Farmington.
In May 1991 creditors asked Judge Robert L. Krechevsky of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Hartford to place Colonial in the hands of a trustee, an extreme step taken in cases of fraud or gross mismanagement.
 
Draining While Borrowing
 They charged that Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti, Colonial's two general partners, had drained $25 million out of Colonial while concealing losses from old real-estate deals, keeping them afloat with fees and commissions from new deals. Meanwhile, they had borrowed millions more from banks, using fraudulent tax returns and financial statements, creditors said.
That summer the trustee, Hal M. Hirsch, drew an even grimmer picture. Colonial and its general partners, he said, might have been insolvent since 1983. The personal guarantees that many investors had trusted were worthless: Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti were personally liable for $1.4 billion in shares, loans and mortgages.
Mr. Hirsch also said that Colonial Realty had virtually no assets, even though under its roof a maze of real-estate partnerships had been built into a money furnace consuming hundreds of millions of dollars. In the end, it appeared, Colonial Realty had little more to its name than the phone booth in which Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti started it.
Last October, at a bankruptcy auction at Colonial's headquarters, the phone booth, which they had bought as a souvenir, was sold for $300.
 
The Investors
Millionaires Only on Paper
 If numbers didn't lie, the gathering of Colonial investors in Robert H. Ficeto's office in Waterbury on March 3 was a meeting of a millionaires' club.
There was Mr. Ficeto, who has a one-man accounting and tax preparation business, and three brothers, Joseph Riggi Jr., 32 years old, who runs an oil delivery company; Vincent, 29, still in his coveralls from the Tire Shak, his tire shop, and Robert, 27, who also has a tire shop.
Each was worth a million dollars, Colonial's records said. That had been news to them, but in that they were typical of Colonial's last years.
They were typical in other ways. Mr. Ficeto had recommended a Colonial deal to several friends and clients; Joseph Riggi had been directed to Colonial by his best friend, and then had recommended it to his brothers.
None saw a prospectus; none knew that Federal regulations require investors in private partnerships like Colonial's to be worth $1 million or have incomes over $200,000.
They all went to sales presentations where Mr. Googel spoke and drinks flowed freely in a room filled with local business executives, lawyers and doctors.
Surrounded by familiar faces, assured by salesmen who came to their children's birthday parties and bought tires at their stores, hearing names of people who had doubled or tripled their money, they all bought shares on credit, making down payments and signing promissory notes for the balance.
"All we signed was one sheet of paper," Joseph Riggi said. " 'Here, sign this,' they said. 'We'll take care of the rest.' "
His brother, Robert, said, "You're supposed to read everything you sign. But I trusted them."
Now they all have banks trying to make them pay those notes.
 
Unqualified Partners
 In its last years, Colonial drew in thousands of investors whose assets and income were insufficient to legally qualify them for its partnerships, and who tapped retirement funds, home equity loans and college accounts for their payments.
Investors have filed class-action lawsuits against Colonial partnerships and their banks, lawyers and accountants, charging that the prospectuses were fraudulent, that fees were understated, that Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti lied about their wealth.
They charge that Colonial falsified the financial statements of hundreds of investors, making them millionaires on paper so that banks would accept their notes as collateral for loans, or even forged promissory notes for people who had paid in full.
Most investors hope Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti, the subjects of investigations by the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service, will be prosecuted for fraud. Some insist it was only fraud -- embezzlement and rigged fees -- that undermined otherwise solid investments.
"We had a three-year buyback, a guaranteed return," Mr. Ficeto said. "It was a good investment. The only way we could lose was if someone was stealing from us."
Others recognize the tissue of trust and credulity that led them into investments that, on some level, did seem too good to be true.
"We got caught on the end of their pyramid deal," Joseph Riggi said matter of factly.
Some had their eyes wide open. One lawyer said he had turned down a share in one partnership after his accountant said the commission and fees were too high. A few years later he signed up for another, while being entertained by a Colonial salesman on a yacht trip to Montauk, L.I.
He signed, he said, even though he knew that Mr. Shuch had been accused of stealing from his previous employers.
"It's like you know a race is fixed, but you don't know which horse it's fixed for," the lawyer said. "You can still hope it's yours."
 
The Accessories
How Could Banks Not Have Known?
 If the Colonial Realty Company was a real-estate supernova, blazing brilliantly in the 1980's, its collapse has left a financial black hole in which hundreds of millions of dollars is disappearing.
Court documents say the web of entities created by Mr. Googel, Mr. Sisti and Mr. Shuch paid too much for properties, drained too much in investors' fees, borrowed too much from banks, and then repeated the process to cover earlier losses.
"The real myth is that these deals fell apart because real-estate prices went down," said Herbert Biegel, the syndication expert. "These deals were dead to begin with."
Now it is time to pay, and Mr. Biegel and other lawyers representing investors in their class-action suits are aiming at the banks that financed Colonial and the accounting firms and law firms that provided favorable forecasts and opinions supporting the syndications.
Colonial's general partners stayed afloat and prospered, the lawyers say, by signing over investors' promissory notes to banks in return for loans. Forged promissory notes signed over to banks and the falsified financial statements of their signers should have been apparent, and an examination of the investment prospectuses should have raised serious questions, they say.
"Without those institutions lending millions and millions of dollars, this would never have happened," said James E. Hartley Jr., a Waterbury lawyer representing about 2,000 limited partners in class-action suits. "Those were the funds that Colonial was putting in its pocket."
The suits also charge that the involvement of the banks, accounting firms and law firms was essential to Colonial's assurances that the investments were sound.
"The overwhelming condition was the element of trust," said John R. Gorman, a New Haven lawyer who, with Mr. Biegel, represents another 2,000 investors. "Reliance on professionals. Reliance on people. Reliance on the system."
 
$4 Million Home Mortgage
 Colonial's bankruptcy case is slowly moving toward a resolution. In April the general partners' interests in 29 partnerships will be auctioned, allowing those deals to be restructured, so that some might avoid foreclosure, and paying off a few large creditors with the proceeds, estimated at less than $30 million.
Another auction, in April, will put Mr. Sisti's house in Farmington on the block. People's Bank is foreclosing on a $4 million mortgage.
Colonial's trustee and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are wrangling over $10 million they want to recover from Mr. Sisti, who they say fraudulently transferred it to his wife and others in Florida. Of that, $4 million came from a home-equity loan on the Farmington house.
But economists and real-estate experts say the Colonial experience is certain to hamper the recovery of Connecticut's economy by making both banks and wealthy individuals reluctant to invest in real estate. The $100 million in disputed promissory notes will help see to that.
"If you're still being sued, where you have to pay 50 grand or 100 grand for nothing, your memory isn't short," said Arthur Anderson, the housing developer. "It will be something that is talked about and remembered by those people for a long time."

Charts/Graphs: "Funny Numbers: How Colonial Concocted a Boom Investment In a Bland Market"
 In 1989, Colonial Constitution Limited Partnership bought Constitution Plaza and five smaller properties from Travelers Insurance for $163 million. Constitution Plaza, consisting of five office buildings and two garages in downtown Hartford, represented $94.5 million of the deal; Colonial said it was appriased at $130 million.
 Colonial tried to sell shares to help finance the properties. Investors were guaranteed 10 percent annual returns.
 There were 1,200 shares available at $50,000 apiece, for a total of $60 million. As few as half the shares were actually sold.
 Colonial intended to take $17 million in fees from the share money.

HEADLINE: JAPAN'S STATISTICS POINT TO A SLUMP, ENDING LONG BOOM

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 8

 BODY:
A series of unexpectedly bleak indicators in recent weeks is signaling the end of Japan's longest postwar economic boom, causing business leaders and politicians to plead for action to avoid a severe recession.
A survey by the Bank of Japan released on Friday showed that business confidence was at its lowest in nearly four and a half years. Based on the Government's early estimates, economists are projecting that industrial production will decline 4 percent in the first three months of this year, the steepest drop since the recession of 1975. Capital investment by manufacturers in the fiscal year beginning April 1 is projected to tumble nearly 11 percent, the worst decline since 1977. 
 Corporate profits are plummeting, consumer demand is slack and the flood of money Japanese investors sent overseas in recent years, particularly to the United States, is drying up.
 
Variations in Slumps
 Bad as the statistics may sound, this is expected to be a very different kind of slump than the one the United States has been grappling with. Corporate Japan used much of the profits it earned during the boom to build more efficient plants, move some production overseas and improve its goods. The result was a big increase in the strength of Japanese industry, creating an advantage that is unlikely to be eroded much now, economists say.
In addition, few expect the amazingly low unemployment rate of 2.1 percent to rise significantly. Japan's labor market has been excessively tight for several years. The shortage of unskilled workers has, in fact, been filled by several hundred thousand illegal aliens. An economic slowdown is thus not expected to result in large numbers of layoffs or dislocations for the average Japanese.
"This could be severe for corporations, but not for individuals," said Yoshihisa Kitai, the chief economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank. "That's what makes this a little difficult to define."
Politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are still alarmed about the economy because they face a tough set of elections in July. They have called for lower interest rates and accelerated Government spending to spur expansion.
But even more worrisome are signs that the slowdown, coming just as the United States is recovering from a recession, could cause Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus to surge, as manufacturers look to overseas markets to make up for slow sales at home.
In February, for instance, exports were estimated to have risen 6.5 percent from the year earlier and imports slid 10.1 percent, producing a surplus estimated at nearly $9 billion, 70 percent higher than in February 1991. Economists are ratcheting up their forecasts for Japan's trade surplus for the year to well over $100 billion.
That is precisely what President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa were seeking to avoid when Mr. Miyazawa agreed during the President's visit here in January to take measures to insure that Japan's economy would grow by 3.5 percent in the coming fiscal year.
Most economists expect Japan to fall far short of that goal -- a harsh turnaround for a country that generally counts expansion of less than 3 percent as a recession.
 
Sharp Drop in Spending
 Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist here with Salomon Brothers Asia, said the indicators were already pointing to one of the deepest recessions in 20 years, in large part because corporations have drastically cut their planned spending on expansion, new plants and new technology. Salomon is expecting growth of only slightly more than 1 percent this year.
"The consensus is changing," said Yoshio Suzuki, the chairman of the Nomura Research Institute, who expects 2.2 percent growth. "The figures are worse than what most people expected."
"Let's Face It -- There's a Recession," read the headline on an editorial in the Nikkei Weekly, which urged quick Government action. "The situation is unlikely to improve soon," the editorial said.
The downturn could also constrict even further the flow of investment from Japan to the United States. The Japanese invested tens of billions of dollars in America in the 1980's, buying everything from Treasury bonds to real estate. That flow was reduced last year, when the Japanese bought just $5 billion in real estate, for instance, compared with $13 billion in 1990. The figures are expected to decline further in a recession.
 
Lower Interest Rates Seen
 To counter the drift of the economy, most analysts believe the Bank of Japan will heed the calls for lower interest rates, perhaps by the end of the month.
Shin Kanemaru, the vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party and perhaps its most influential leader, insisted that the Prime Minister should sack the Bank of Japan's governor, Yasushi Mieno, if he does not cut the official discount rate. It was last lowered in December, to 4.5 percent, and Mr. Mieno has said the bank is watching to see what effects that move has had before it acts again.
Industrialists, too, have begun issuing sour complaints.
"The pace of the deceleration is greater than we expected," said Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "The slowdown will last until the end of this year."
Norio Ohga, the president of the Sony Corporation, whose profits have been battered, added: "You can call the present slowdown a recession. Without pump-priming measures, the economy might plunge into a negative spiral."
And Gaishi Hiraiwa, the chairman of Japan's most powerful business trade group, the Federation of Economic Organizations, ended weeks of judicious remarks by openly calling for a rate cut by the Bank of Japan and quick passage of the next fiscal year's budget so that accelerated Government spending could begin.
 
Political Considerations
 The Government of Mr. Miyazawa has put forward a budget that includes heavy public spending, but it has been bogged down in the Parliament. Opposition parties are demanding answers to questions raised by two recent bribery scandals before they permit the budget process to move forward. That is contributing to the pessimism.
The boom began officially in November 1986, when Japan started its recovery from the shock of the doubling of the yen's value against the dollar. The currency move was engineered in 1985 by the United States and Japan in what was known as the Plaza Accord, an effort to reduce Japan's growing trade surplus.
Japanese manufacturers responded to the difficulties of a stronger yen with a surge in capital investment, as they began a crash program to lower their production costs. Japanese companies outspent their American rivals on such improvements during the latter half of the 1980's by billions of dollars.
But now a depression in the stock market has made it far more expensive for corporations to raise capital and has begun to affect business confidence. A slowdown in spending has caused unsold inventories of goods to back up in warehouses, leading to cutbacks in production.
The Bank of Japan's survey showed companies cutting capital spending 3.2 percent in the fiscal year that begins April 1; an Industrial Bank of Japan survey put the overall cutback at 4 percent, and 10.7 percent for manufacturers.
The Daiwa Institute of Research said it was projecting a 15.4 percent drop in the profits of Japan's major corporations in the year that will end March 31. Bankruptcies are soaring as big declines in stock and property prices hurt speculators. Banks are reluctant to lend because of a mounting toll of bad loans.
It is not clear when the boom ended, since figures from the last part of 1991 are still trickling in. The fourth quarter's economic growth rate has not been disclosed, but some think it might have been close to zero.
It now seems that at least by last November, the end of the fifth year of the boom, the slowdown was taking its bite.

HEADLINE: Saudi Rulers Are Confronting Challenge by Islamic Radicals

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 5

 BODY:
In specialized Islamic cassette shops across this country, a two-hour tape that rails against the Saudi Government has become the latest hit of the subversive Islamic materials making the rounds in Saudi Arabia.
"Royal family princes are not owed allegiance except if they follow the rules of Islam," the unidentified speaker declares, opening the tape's assault on the Saudi rulers. The tape goes on to attack the senior religious leaders allied with the monarchy; the United States, which is described as an atheist enemy of Islam, and most of all the growing number of middle- and upper-class Saudis who have turned away from religion and toward a secular, Western-oriented way of life.
 
'The Supergun' Is the Title
 The recorded message, called "The Supergun," is perhaps the sharpest illustration of a yearlong confrontation with an increasingly outspoken group of Muslim clergymen who have challenged the ruling establishment of Saudi Arabia. 
 This confrontation is of great importance to the future of a kingdom that sits on the world's largest pool of oil, a kingdom that ranks as the West's most prized ally and friend in the Middle East today. But even though the verbal battle is sharp, the consensus here is that the fundamentalists will not win.
After Saudi Arabia emerged relatively unscathed from the Persian Gulf war, its Government decided that it could best insure continued prosperity by looking outward, modernizing the nation's laws and expanding personal and institutional freedoms. This change from a tradition of conservativism in foreign and domestic policies has brought a backlash from radical clergymen and their young followers.
The fundamentalists' campaign is actively opposed by many of the secular Saudis, who are continuing to demand more liberalization. In the middle stands the one power that has for 60 years been the arbiter of consensus here -- the House of Saud, which is headed by King Fahd.
Until a year ago, the Saudi Government largely ignored the religious radicalism, considering it a minor problem. Today it appears to be moving swiftly to contain it by calling on traditional religious leaders to rein in the radicals, and by calling fundamentalist leaders in for questioning and depriving them of their pulpits in mosques.
But it appears that the House of Saud has decided that its security and the welfare of the nation lie in forging ahead with modernization despite the protests.
Officials here say the new Consultative Council announced by King Fahd last Sunday will expand public participation in government. The council's 60 members, who will be chosen by the King over the next six months, are expected to be figures from academia, business and the friendly religious elite, not the fundamentalists who are challenging the Government's modernizing trend.
Ignoring fundamentalist objections, the council is expected to reinforce policies favoring banks and business ventures with Western industries, vastly expanding the margin of operations for a booming private sector.
"There is no self-doubt here," a senior diplomat said of the Government's policy.
To oppose it, the fundamentalists have only their invective, but it is not an insignificant weapon when circulated on mass-produced recordings that are distributed free of charge on streetcorners or at nominal cost at the Islamic shops. These are small storefront operations, invariably full of bearded men, that sell inspirational recordings and literature and such trinkets as jigsaw puzzles of the shrines at Mecca.
 
Corruption Is Attacked
 "The Supergun," named after the Iraqi project to build an artillery piece with a range of hundreds of miles, zeroes in on corruption, mismanagement and theft of the public treasury as the main problems of the country.
"The personal behavior of some of our rulers is so scandalous that it is the subject of books and articles abroad which are damaging our reputation," it says.
"Look at how senior officials and ministers have stayed in their jobs for decades, as if this nation is devoid of qualified men," the speaker says. "Look at their friendship with atheist nations which they consult in all affairs as their Information Ministry bans any newspaper or magazine that attacks America."
Another tape, popular for more than two years, is "America As I Saw It," by a well-known preacher named Ayid al-Qorni. The hourlong tape describes the United States as a thoroughly atheistic nation in which men marry other men, where sons and daughters abandon their parents to hunger and old age, where women have fatherless children, where movies "show animals fornicating with humans."
 
'A Nation of Beasts'

He complains that exercisers jog in the streets "practically naked like animals" and that women look at men straight in the eye "without shame and without veil to cover them." He says America is in decline because it is a "nation of beasts who fornicate and eat rotten food," adding that he prays to God to destroy the United States "the same way he destroyed Russia."
Tapes like these are avidly consumed by tens of thousands of militant Muslims. But in the judgment of many Saudis and foreign diplomats, the radical fringe is outnumbered.
A major reason is that in Saudi Arabia the working class, where anti-establishment sentiment might be expected to take root, is mostly imported from Asia and poor countries of the Middle East. An estimated four million to five million expatriates sweep the streets, pump the oil, drive the cars and build the cities, and they would lose their treasured jobs and visas if they dared to speak out against the authorities.
Most Saudis -- 8 million to 11 million -- belong to the middle and upper classes, enjoying a level of comfort that does not tend to breed revolutionary fervor. Even Saudi women, who have reason to be angry with a system that severely restricts their access to jobs, education and property ownership and their freedom to travel, are quiescent.
"Over here conservatives means people who do not want to rock the boat, and that's the great majority of the Saudis," said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The House of Saud may have termites, but it is not too late to call in exterminators."
 
A Saudi Sea Change
 Saudis and foreign diplomats here say that what underlies this judgment is a sea change that has taken place here over the last 18 months, a product of Saudi Arabia's unprecedented opening to the West after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and of an oil boom, now in its 19th year, that has finally tipped the balance of Saudi society to people with money, education and a Western orientation.
Liberal, educated Saudis constitute virtually the entire middle class, but also a substantial number of the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 in the Saudi royal family, and it is these people who have been accommodated by the Government's initiatives since the gulf crisis.
"What was before the war cannot be after it," said a prince who spoke on condition of anonymity. "These reforms are viewed as a safety valve."
In foreign policy, the Saudi leaders proudly proclaim their alliance with the West, ignoring the fundamentalists' condemnations of Westerners as the "new Crusaders fighting Islam." The Government has strongly supported the Middle East peace talks, which began in October. Prominent American Jews have publicly visited the country, visits that not long ago would have been unthinkable.
 
Council to Review Laws
 On the domestic front, the new Consultative Council is to serve at the King's pleasure, and bears no resemblance to a Western-style democratic body. But it is supposed to review laws and Government policies and is empowered to recommend that the King reject those that are found lacking. The council will give a powerful new forum to the Westernized, pro-business establishment, which is expected to provide most of its membership.
The middle-class endorsement of these bold steps can be measured by the boom in the Saudi stock market, the return here of an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion in capital that had fled to the West during the gulf crisis, a record-breaking expansion of investment in the Saudi private sector and brisk business at banks. That has occurred despite constant warnings from fundamentalists against loan interest, which some Islamic authorities say is forbidden by the Koran.
The new Consultative Council is in part a recognition that many Saudi business executives and administrators have surpassed the pool of royal family princes in prominence in the public and private sectors. It also symbolically makes room for the hundreds of thousands of educated Saudis who, benefiting from the oil bonanza of the last two decades, have emerged from schools to claim a place in society.
With the end of the princes' monopoly over decision-making, it is clear that the ancient structure of Saudi society, which is based on tribal and paternalistic systems of government and has sustained the country since its founding 60 years ago, is changing.
"There are so many royal family princes now, something like 7,000 or so, that even within the royal family itself there is a hierarchy and a meritocracy system," a senior Arab diplomat said. "You really have to do something particularly brilliant to be noticed."
The new Government policies were also influenced by a falling-out with foreign-based fundamentalist movements like the Islamic Salvation Front of Algeria, the Nahda movement in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Syria. These movements, once thought to be friends of Saudi Arabia, proved during the gulf crisis to be determined enemies, siding with Iraq and calling for the downfall of the Saudi royal family.
 
New Crop of Preachers
 Across the country over the last year and before that, a crop of Muslim preachers in religious universities who are in their 30's and 40's emerged to oppose the recent modernizing trends. These militants, who number in the tens of thousands, are the product of a previous policy by the Government on the idea that more religious education is better. The Government used to seek the support of its own religious establishment to resist Iran's radical clergy and Iraq's secularist revolutionary ideology.
The result was a vast crop of people whose religious training is unsuited to a dynamic economy that requires knowledge of foreign languages, business administration and technical skills to move forward.
But the end of the gulf crisis in 1991 and the end of the war between Iraq and Iran in 1988 have diminished the Saudi Government's fear of these two regional powers, making the support of the fundamentalists expendable.
"The importance of these new laws," commented Turki al-Hamad, a professor of political science in King Saud University in Riyadh, who has often been attacked in speeches by religious militants as a secularist, "lies in the fact that they block the way to any auctioneering and betting over the Islamization of politics and the society." Interviewed in the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat, Mr. Hamad said they set "clear Islamic parameters in constitutional terms."
 
Joint Ventures With West
 Given its immense oil reserves and major strides in consumer industries and finance, Government officials say it is now clear that Saudi Arabia's future lies in joint ventures with Western economies, which are multiplying.
Moreover, the security of Saudi Arabia, as has been amply demonstrated in the gulf crisis, is intimately tied to a commitment by the West to defend it, leaving little choice but to further reinforce ties with the West.
To reach these goals, the ruling establishment has clearly decided that if it has to take sides in the internal debate, it must side with the liberals whose political agenda is focused on rewriting the social convenent to emphasize greater freedoms and more democratization.
"The religious establishment is sure that any changes toward the orbit of modernity will be at their expense, which means the lines of battle are drawn," said a top Arab diplomat from the gulf who lives here.

MAYOR DINKINS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL
Looking under the weather, Mayor Dinkins checked into the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center early with an apparent touch of the flu, and his personal physician later said he was resting comfortably and would be kept overnight as a precaution. The 64-year-old Mayor had been feeling ill for several days, his aides said. His doctor said that Mr. Dinkins had had a flu shot several months ago but may not have been protected against this particular strain. B3.
 
A WEEKEND OF PRAYERS FOR THE REBBE
Lubavitch Hasidim sang Hebrew prayers of supplication without pause over the weekend as their leader, known as the Rebbe, stayed in his private quarters in Brooklyn recuperating from a stroke he suffered one week ago. Lubavitch leaders confirmed that the stroke was more serious than earlier reported. B2.
 
A DAY FOR A PERFECT SOUND BITE
Three candidates for the United States Senate competed to find the perfect backdrop for news conferences. Senator D'Amato stood in front of a midtown Manhattan unemployment office that was closed for the day. One of his Democratic challengers, Elizabeth Holtzman, held her news conference outside a Federal office building in lower Manhattan that was also closed for the weekend. Another opponent, the Rev. Al Sharpton, met with Cardinal O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral. B3.
 
WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE WALKWAY OPENS
The walkway on the Williamsburg Bridge reopened for the first time since it was closed for repairs last summer, and a 1954 Schwinn Black Phantom was the first across its new wooden planks. The opening is also a small triumph for three groups -- frequently at odds -- in Williamsburg. The groups -- Hispanic residents, a Hasidic community and a newer population of young artists -- often find themselves in disputes over housing, police protection and race.

THE EMPIRE
BUILT ON ILLUSION
In a burst of real-estate speculation in the heady 1980's, Jonathan Googel, Benjamin Sisti and Frank Shuch dazzled Connecticut with their wealth, their flamboyance and their deals. The dealing stopped in September 1990, when banks forced their Colonial Realty Company into bankruptcy. The company's demise proved to be not the end of an economic era, but the end of an illusion. Creditors and lawyers representing investors say Colonial was not merely one of the decade's largest investment debacles, but one of its largest frauds. A1.
 
RICH SCHOOLS, POOR SCHOOLS
Many communities in Connecticut lack the tax that their richer neighbors have to support public schools. State education leaders wrung their hands over the disparities for years, but little changed. Now, prompted by fiscal necessity rather than educational philosophy, Governor Weicker Jr. has proposed a budget that would begin leveling that system, provoking an intense debate over education financing. B5.
 
LOOKING FOR A MAYOR -- OR NOT
The search by the eight members of the City Council of Jersey City for someone to serve as mayor until a special election in November appears to have run out of time, but appearances can be deceiving where politics is concerned. After the mayor's office became vacant Feb. 7 following Mayor McCann's conviction on Federal fraud charges, the Council had 30 days to name an interim mayor. Today is the deadline, and while the Council has a meeting tonight, the agenda makes no mention of filling the mayor's seat. B5.
 
A CROP OF OUTRAGE IN NEW JERSEY
Farmers in New Jersey are objecting to the state's efforts to manage growth. New Jersey's pioneering state land-use plan, which is intended to direct growth to already-developed areas, has won over nearly all of the state's fractious business groups except the farm community. As now written, the plan frowns on any development in farm-designated areas that is not directly related to agriculture. Farmers insist the future of farming in the Garden State is at stake. B5.

HEADLINE: Otto Klineberg, Who Helped Win '54 Desegregation Case, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Otto Klineberg, whose pioneering studies on the intelligence scores of black students helped win the Supreme Court's landmark school desegregation case in 1954, died on Friday at the Carriage Hill nursing home in Bethesda, Md. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of Parkinson's disease, his family said. 
 Dr. Klineberg, a renowned social psychologist, was a lifelong critic and debunker of racial superiority theories, whether propounded by Nazis, white Southerners or black extremists.
He played a significant role in the desegregation victory on three levels. Jack Greenberg, a lawyer on the case, said Dr. Klineberg "was the father of the studies we used" to prove that segregated schools provided an unequal education.
And he testified as an expert in a Delaware suit that was one of four cases consolidated for the Supreme Court, and the only one that the integrationists had won in the lower courts.
 
Controversial Views
 In studies that he started more than 60 years ago, he found that students in underfinanced Southern black schools averaged lower intelligence scores than Southern whites and Northern blacks and whites. But when blacks moved north to schools that were integrated and of better quality, their scores eventually equalled those of Northern-born blacks.
In the North, he concluded, the scores of blacks nearly matched those of whites, with the discrepancy attributable to social and economic differences.
His views were controversial. When he was quoted in 1931 saying there was no scientific basis for racial superiority or barring interracial marriage, the New York Herald-Tribune, in an editorial against him, said his assertions ran counter to most ethnologists, "any intelligent farmer's knowledge of barnyard biology" and "American experience."
But he also won praise. In 1935 the columnist Lewis Gannett praised Dr. Klineberg's latest work, saying, "The Negroes are not inferior; they just have not had a chance. It is too much to hope that one academic monograph will blow away the mists of superstition in which the average white American mind is wrapped; but this little book may make a beginning."
Dr. Klineberg once said "there is no more important problem for our democracy" than achieving harmony among the many groups "that make up the American people."
 
Psychology Associations
 He was a former president or chairman of the International Union of Scientific Psychology, the World Federation for Mental Health, the Inter-American Society of Psychology, the Eastern Psychological Association and the Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues.
Born in Quebec, he grew up in Montreal. He earned a bachelor's degree at McGill University in Montreal in 1919, a master's in philosophy from Harvard in 1920, a medical degree from McGill in 1925 and a doctorate in psychology at Columbia in 1927. There he began studying American Indians, taught psychology and became the first chairman of the social psychology department.
In 1961 he went to the University of Paris, where he directed the International Center for Intergroup Relations. He retired there in 1982, returned to New York and taught part time at City University until 1990.
Surviving are his wife of 59 years, the former Selma Gintzler; a daughter, Rosemary K. Coffey of Pittsburgh; two sons, John M. of Chevy Chase, Md., and Stephen L. of Houston; eight grandchildren; a brother, Jack, of Montreal, and five sisters, Florence Pascal, Nettye Greenberg, Beatrice Shapera, Dolly Ginsberg and Queenie Meyerovitch, all of Montreal.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Declining Incomes

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Americans' after-tax income is lower than it was three years ago, when George Bush became President, the Government has reported.
Many economists say the decline in this income gauge during the Bush Presidency could be an ominous portent for his re-election chances, and they cite the so-called pocketbook index to prove it. 
 For more than four decades, the correlation between personal income after taxes and Presidential re-election rates has been tracked. Derived from the work of Edward Tufte, a Yale University professor, the index found that incumbent administrations had won 50 percent of the popular vote only when incomes had risen by annual rates of 3.4 percent.
The increase, after taxes and adjusted for inflation, is measured by comparing the personal income rates of the third quarter of 1988 with those of the July-to-September quarter of the previous year.
 
'It's Not Possible'
 But with incomes over the latest four quarters contracting at an annual rate of six-tenths of 1 percent, and the economy still struggling to mount a sustainable recovery, many economists think there is practically no chance this standard can be met.
"I would think it's not possible" even if a solid recovery took hold this spring, said Lynn O. Michaelis, the chief economist for the Weyerhaeuser Company, the wood-products concern based in Tacoma, Wash. "Zero" possibility, added Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
Jay N. Woodworth of the Bankers Trust Company is one of the analysts who asserts that Mr. Bush is in danger of suffering the fate of the incumbent parties "in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1976 and 1980 who lost the election chiefly because of the poor performance of the U.S. economy."
Consumer sentiment and Gallup Poll popularity ratings are both "reasonably correlated" with incomes, Mr. Woodworth said, noting that in all five elections, incomes had risen by less than 2.8 percent a year. The losers, in some cases a President's would-be successor of the same party, rather than the President himself, were Adlai E. Stevenson, Richard M. Nixon, Hubert H. Humphrey, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.
To be sure, several analysts are more sanguine in their economic outlook for election time, thinking the recovery is already under way. They point to the nation's total output, or gross domestic product, having risen, albeit at an average rate of less than 2 percent, for the latest three quarters. And other politico-economic barometers suggest brighter prospects for Mr. Bush.
Take the formula for predicting election outcomes created by Ray C. Fair, also a Yale professor, that stresses output and inflation. The more important of the two, he said, is the growth rate of the country's gross domestic product, adjusted for population growth, in the six to nine months before Election Day. The other is the inflation rate in the two years before Election Day.
Assuming recovery takes hold and pushes the gross domestic product up this year at a 2 percent to 3 percent clip -- somewhat higher than the 1.6 percent consensus of the economics fraternity -- Professor Fair figures the President to get 53 percent to 59 percent of the vote.
Inflation is quite favorable, with consumer prices rising by 3.1 percent in 1991 and producer prices actually falling slightly, and Professor Fair's formula also includes a factor for the advantages of incumbency.
"It's hard to defeat an incumbent Republican running again," he said. On the other hand, "if there's a double-dip, negative growth starting now, then there's a considerable chance Bush could be defeated."
Another method of tying political fortunes to economic conditions rests mainly on the unemployment rate. Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa, has observed that an incumbent or his party won on all five postwar occasions when the unemployment rate was falling in the second quarter of the election year. These involved Harry S. Truman in 1948, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Mr. Nixon in 1972, Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Mr. Bush in 1988.
The simplest gauge is probably the so-called misery index, devised by the late Arthur Okun, which merely adds the unemployment and inflation rates. This is barely in double digits now, compared with a reading of almost 20 in 1980.
 
Different Circumstances
 Even the many economists who seem partial to consumers' disposable income as the most crucial factor in election results acknowledge that the traditional guides may not work this year because of different economic conditions.
"A 3 percent standard is a lot harder to make today than it was before," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist for Prudential Securities Inc. Perhaps, he implied, people have gradually become accustomed to skimpy growth in spendable incomes, partly the result of rising state and local taxes, and thus would not blame Mr. Bush for a jolt.
And Joseph W. Duncan of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, the information-services company, said that while consumer wallets would not fatten much this year -- mainly because of low returns from interest, rents and proprietorships -- this may not be particularly important.
"I don't think the equation will work this year," said Mr. Duncan, a former Federal policy maker on statistics. He said he was inclined to look at what happens to jobs.
And what happens with jobs, can, of course, be seen in more than one light. "If you look at the 93 percent of the population still employed, you see their incomes are doing very poorly," said Lee Price, a senior economist for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. The decline in income, many analysts say, is an important factor in the low state of consumer confidence, which in turn is holding back recovery.
However they view the numbers, economists generally agree that the figures will not get dramatically better for the President and that each month the recovery is delayed will make re-election less likely.
Already, said Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, "It's a contestable election."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Clinton-Tsongas Ads Provide a Little Drama in Florida Contest

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., March 8

 BODY:
For all their griping about the clogged airwaves, Floridians ought to be grateful for the commercials that Paul E. Tsongas and Bill Clinton have put on television here. What little drama there is to this state's fly-by Presidential campaign, they are providing.
It is true that the commercials are not particularly sensational when compared with, say, ones about furloughed murderers. But for Floridians watching the campaign on television, they are pretty much all there is to see. 
 On the newscasts here in Florida's second-largest metropolitan area, the state's upcoming Presidential primary has trailed far behind items with more local interest, like the rape trial of a young Tampa man -- a sort of William K. Smith trial redux -- and the recent firing of the St. Petersburg police chief.
 
Uncluttered Setting for Ads
 What primary coverage there has been has tended to be dominated by reports of how the voters have been uninspired by the candidates and how few are expected to vote on Tuesday. Candidates who appear in Tampa, as former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California did Saturday, can expect to get about 45 seconds on the evening news. Those who do not have to content themselves with less.
This paucity of television news coverage has reduced a lot of the clutter that often surrounds advertising campaigns. With the other Democratic candidates too poor to advertise and the Republicans forgoing commercials, the television battle between the once-friendly Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton has taken on an intriguingly intimate quality, like a private spat being carried out in public.
After listening to the two men harp at each other for a few days running, one cannot help feeling somehow implicated in their dispute. Perhaps, one wonders, it is time to find them professional counseling.
The techniques that Mr. Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, and Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, are using against each other should be familiar to most married couples. Each man has found the other's vulnerabilities and has tried to make caricatures of them.
 
Frog in His Chair
 Mr. Clinton went first with a commercial that attempts to discredit Mr. Tsongas's economic policies while at the same time taking advantage of his sometimes schoolmarmish expression.
"Time Magazine says, 'Much of what Tsongas says smacks of trickle-down economics,' " the narrator intones, while in the corner of the screen there appears a picture of Mr. Tsongas looking as if he has just discovered a frog on his chair.
The screen then flips around, and a friendly looking Mr. Clinton takes Mr. Tsongas's place. "Bill Clinton wants change," the narrator says. "More education and job training and making the rich pay their fair share."
The commercial closes with a full-screen shot of Mr. Clinton bathed in a warm orange light.
Mr. Tsongas responded to this advertisement with one that plays off Mr. Clinton's ill-concealed ambitions. The first shot is a black and white picture of Mr. Clinton looking like a circus barker. "Some people will say anything to be elected President," the announcer says.
Then a black and white shot of Mr. Tsongas appears. He is poring over his work in a pose reminiscent of the young Abraham Lincoln. "Isn't it time we sent a message that we've had enough negative campaigning?" the announcer asks as a full-color Mr. Tsongas emerges onto the screen shaking hands with supporters.
 
Insuring Viewership
 Both of the candidates have been trying to amplify their commercials by using the same themes on the stump. Thus, the other day Mr. Tsongas held up a stuffed bear and said, "This is my opponent: pander bear." Mr. Clinton meanwhile has been traveling around with a clipping of a New York Times article reporting that the richest 1 percent of Americans took in about 60 percent of the increase in after-tax income in the 1980's. At the same time he accuses his opponent of espousing "growth first, fairness later."
Aides to Mr. Clinton say he has spent roughly $500,000 to broadcast his commercials in Florida; Mr. Tsongas's aides say he has spent about $300,000. By Presidential campaign standards, this is not a heavy budget for a state with half a dozen media markets. But it is enough to insure that most television viewers have seen the exchange at least a few times.
Several potential voters interviewed in the indoor cool of University Square Mall in Tampa recalled having seen Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton cut each other down on television. But it was unclear whether either candidate had achieved anything, since few of those interviewed could recall what it was the two men were fighting about.
"I tell you how it is," said one Tampa resident, who would give her name only as Ann. "I hear them, but I'm not listening."

HEADLINE: Trump Casinos May File Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, March 8

 BODY:
Two of Donald J. Trump's casinos, Trump's Castle and Trump Plaza, could file plans on Monday in Federal Bankruptcy Court to restructure $538 million in debt.
Bondholders completed voting Friday to approve the plans for filing a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission had been told in the past two weeks that sufficient support was in place. 
 The advance creditor approval helps avoid a long and costly stint in bankruptcy court. Mr. Trump's other Atlantic City casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, emerged from bankruptcy court last year with a prepackaged plan similar to that proposed for Trump's Castle.
Under the Castle plan, Mr. Trump would give bondholders half the casino's equity in exchange for lower interest rates on $288 million in bonds, some of which now pay 13 3/4 percent.
The Trump Plaza plan would swap $225 million of bonds at 12 7/8 percent and $25 million in long-term debt for $200 million in debt at 12 percent and 4 million shares of preferred stock.
The Plaza plan does not relinquish any equity because the casino hotel is not in default.

HEADLINE: Isolated Washington Neighborhood Keeps Wary Eye on Its New Subway

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
For Anacostia, a neighborhood separated from the rest of the nation's capital by the river that bears its name, the recent opening of its first subway stop could mean the end of decades of isolation.
But many residents worry that the long-awaited arrival of the Metro's Green Line could engender a rush of gentrification in a neighborhood that has seen its turn-of-the-century grace diminish over the years, supplanted by drugs and crime. 
 The Anacostia station, which nearly 11,000 people use on weekdays, is the final stop of a $286 million, three-station extension of the Metro subway line that opened in December. Stations on an extension of that line are planned to open in 2001, a spokeswoman for Metro said.
The subway whisks Anacostia residents to downtown Washington in a matter of minutes, in contrast to the slow buses that were a mainstay in the neighborhood before the subway.
But the subway's advent did not come easily. There was a great deal of wrangling over the placement of the station on the edge of the neighborhood and the accompanying cutback in bus service.
 
Not on the Map
 Though few residents believe the subway's coming heralds an overnight renaissance, many view it as a lifeline, another link to pull Anacostia closer to the rest of Washington and draw Washingtonians across the river to a neighborhood so isolated it sometimes does not even appear on city maps.
In the bleak area near the station, where most merchants work behind the safety of bullet-proof glass, business owners are counting on the subway to bring in more business and speed up revitalization.
"It will help tremendously," said Roy Distad, who owns a garage near the station. "This has always been such an out-of-the-way place to get to."
The further one goes from the station, however, the less enthusiastic the responses often become.
Many residents say that the geography, poverty and dearth of political clout that have always separated them from the rest of the city will not be solved by a new subway station.
"It's not going to help black people at all," said a merchant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in Anacostia's main business district, more than a mile from the new station. She says she worries, as do others, that the subway may bring a rash of land speculation and gentrification that will displace longtime residents and shopkeepers, most of whom are black.
"In my neighborhood, it won't change anything," said Robert Adams, a neighborhood representative. "You're only talking about one subway station."
 
Changing Neighborhood
 Built in the late 1800's by craftsmen who commuted across the river to work in the Washington Navy Yard, Anacostia is still distinguished by its historic district of hundreds of Victorian, Empire, Queen Anne and Italianate houses, many with large yards surrounded by low, wrought-iron fences.
But in the decades since the demise of the pontoon bridge that linked Anacostia and the Navy yard, the area has changed significantly, with some streets little more than boarded-up shops and run-down housing. An occasional battlefield for drug wars, it is a place where cab drivers sometimes refuse to go.
Dorn McGrath Jr., a professor of urban and regional planning at George Washington University, acknowledges that the new stop could encourage speculation and gentrification. But Mr. McGrath, who directs a team of graduate students that has tried to minimize the impact of subway construction on the historic district and protect the area from overdevelopment, is counting on the recession to help curb a renewal process that has drastically changed other black areas in the city.
Mr. McGrath said that Anacostia had been home mostly to black and white working-class people until 1968, when whites fled many parts of the city after racial disturbances.
He remains optimistic about the prospects that will come with the subway. "We will see more new buildings," he said. "With that will come amenities, little parks, a more attractive building environment."
And some businessmen say that if the subway does draw people from other neighborhoods here, it's all for the better.
"It's the most beautiful neighborhood of the city, believe it or not," said Andrew Washington, who runs a drapery shop and several other small businesses in Anacostia. "If you just look around on this side, you've got the park, you've got the river. If you get into a fifth-floor office, it's like a little Miami, the way the river curves."
Now that the station is in place, many residents say they are resigned to it, though still unsure of what it will mean.
"I don't know," said Irwin Ruben, who has run a drugstore in Anacostia for more than 30 years and is known as "Doc," when asked if he thought it would be a boon to the neighborhood. "I can't give you a yes or a no. I hope so."

Peace Advocates Turn Tax Resistance Into a Ritual

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLRAIN, Mass., March 5

 BODY:
Every Thursday morning for 14 weeks, a small group of out-of-towners has trudged down a dirt road in this quiet Berkshire community carrying colorful hand-sewn banners to the doorstep of a small white farmhouse.
Stopping in the front yard, they are greeted by others, who form a circle and join hands to sing songs of defiance and world peace in a ceremony evocative of the 60's. They have come to protest the size of the nation's military budget in a house that has become a symbol of tax resistance. 
 The participants have two things in common: they do not believe in paying Federal taxes to finance the United States military, and, pointing to the end of the cold war and evidence of social unrest in the nation, they believe the time is ripe for a revival of their cause.
"Everybody's become more restless and disgusted with the major parties in government," said David Dellinger, who was a defendant in the Chicago Seven trial and who came to Colrain with a group from Vermont. The Chicago Seven were anti-war protesters charged with various offenses related to disruptions at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
"Everywhere people go now, there's crime in the cities, homelessness, drugs, poverty, unemployment," said Mr. Dellinger, now 76 years old. "I think people are going to decide we didn't win the cold war. The Soviet people lost and we lost."
Mr. Dellinger and others have come from as far away as California to the Colrain house, which was seized by the Internal Revenue Service in 1989 because its owners had not paid $27,000 in Federal taxes and interest. The tax-resister owners, Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner, did pay their local and state taxes.
Mr. Kehler and Ms. Corner continued to live in the house until they were arrested by Federal marshals last December. Since then, friends and supporters of the couple have arrived to occupy the almost empty house in weeklong shifts marked by the Thursday "changing of the guard" ceremony.
Because the house was sold in a Government auction in February, all who go inside risk arrest for trespassing. Seven protesters were arrested on the day the house was auctioned but were released after the auction.
For Bonney Simons of St. Johnsbury, Vt., sleeping on a bedroll in the house is her first official act of civil disobedience. At 72 years of age, she said, it is time to "put your body where your mouth is."
Others, like Purusha Obluda, come to resurrect values of their past. Mr. Obluda met Mr. Kehler in California in 1967 after being jailed for blocking the Oakland induction center.
During his week's stay at Colrain house, Mr. Obluda, 64, typed a letter to the Government saying he would not pay his income tax this April. "I don't expect to file for the rest of my life," he told others before he left to go home to Palo Alto, Calif.
The I.R.S. says it stopped counting tax refusers in the mid-80's because the numbers were so small.
The sale of the house to Danny Franklin, a 22-year-old part-time police officer from the nearby town of Greenfield, has added a twist to the protest, which seeks among other things more attention for housing needs.
The house sits on land owned by the Valley Community Land Trust, a private trust formed to preserve open space and affordable housing in the area, said John J. Stobierski, Mr. Franklin's lawyer. Mr. Franklin is waiting for the trust to confirm that he can assume the 99-year lease before moving into the house with his fiancee and 5-month-old child.
From his office in the Traprock Peace Center in nearby Deerfield, Mr. Kehler said that he felt sorry for the young couple who bid on his house but believed that they had made a "mistake."
"In our view, they have wittingly or unwittingly assisted the Government in collecting taxes from us," he said.
Mr. Kehler, 47, a self-employed public policy researcher, spent 10 weeks in jail after his arrest in December and was released on the day the house was sold. He and his wife, Ms. Corner, and their 12-year-old daughter are staying at a friend's home near their former house.
Ms. Corner, a self-employed landscape architect, still returns to tidy up the house she lived in for 13 years. She bristles at those who have written letters in the local paper saying she is setting a bad example for her daughter, Lillian.
"We aren't paying for bombs and she understands that," Ms. Corner said. "People can't get away from the fact that we're breaking the law. But this country was founded by breaking the law."

Companies Find Rewards In Hiring G.E. Executives

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
So many companies have been rejuvenated by the arrival of a new chief executive drawn from the management of the General Electric Company that many investors feel as if they have hit a jackpot when their companies announce such recruiting coups.
Companies that hire G.E. executives usually get managers who have experience running businesses that would be among the nation's largest companies if they were independent. Most have also been through G.E.'s widely admired management training courses and have absorbed G.E.'s global perspective. 
 "It takes a special leader to rise to the top of G.E., or near it," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst who follows the company for C. J. Lawrence Inc. "Anyone who gets there has faced a host of demanding circumstances and has seen more than one industry."
Analysts call the good fortune that often follows G.E. executives to other companies the halo effect, and it has been particularly strong in the last year.
In June, when Allied-Signal Inc. announced that Lawrence A. Bossidy, G.E.'s co-vice chairman, would replace Edward Hennessy as chief executive, the company's share price immediately jumped 13 percent, to $29.375. And that was just the start.
As Mr. Bossidy embarked on a cost-cutting overhaul of Allied-Signal's operations, the stock climbed. It closed Friday at $49, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Bossidy joined Allied-Signal less than a month after one of G.E.'s best-known alumni, Stanley C. Gault, took over at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Mr. Gault, who had risen to be head all of G.E.'s industrial products businesses, left in 1980 to manage Rubbermaid Inc., the rubber-products company in Wooster, Ohio, that his father co-founded. By the time he left Rubbermaid for Goodyear, sales had jumped to more than $1.5 billion from about $300 million, and earnings had grown even faster.
Goodyear's stock was already up to $28, from a low of $17, when Mr. Gault arrived, and the share price jumped $3 when his appointment was announced. Since then, it has bolted upward, closing Friday at $60.50, down $2, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Gault has brought a new marketing focus, as opposed to production focus, to Goodyear," said Saul H. Ludwig, who follows the company in Cleveland for Roulston & Company. "And he's convinced employees at all levels that they are on a winning team."
Just as impressive is what Glen H. Hiner has delivered to shareholders of the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation since moving there at the end of December from his position as head of G.E. Plastics.
Shares of Owens-Corning Fiberglas, based in Toledo, Ohio, rose $2.25, to $23.25, on the day Mr. Hiner's appointment was announced. A month later, the shares leaped 27 percent in a single day, to $36.325, as Mr. Hiner announced plans to take an $800 million charge against earnings in 1991's fourth quarter to cover all of Owens-Corning's uninsured asbestos liabilities for the rest of the decade.
Wall Street liked Mr. Hiner's effort to put the asbestos problem aside so much that it ignored lower-than-expected quarterly earnings announced the same day. The jump also signaled confidence that Mr. Hiner would deliver on his goal of producing quarterly gains throughout 1992 and 1993. The stock closed Friday at $36.875, down $1.625 on the Big Board.
Old-line industrial companies are not the only ones that seem to respond to the G.E. touch. Roger Schipke, the top G.E. appliance executive when he left in 1990 after 29 years, became chief executive of the Ryland Group Inc., a home-building company in Columbia, Md., after a short transition period as president.
Despite the recession in the housing industry, Ryland's shares have risen to $26.50, down 25 cents, on Friday from $15.25 on Dec. 18, 1990, the day before Mr. Schipke's appointment was announced.
Analysts said that Ryland was a well-managed company before Mr. Schipke arrived, but that it has benefitted from the global perspective he brought from G.E. by winning its first international contracts.
What other companies would currently make up a mutual fund of companies led by former G.E. executives? General Dynamics (William Anders); Wang Laboratories (Richard Miller); Sundstrand (Harry C. Stonecipher); Rubbermaid (Walter Williams); M/A-Com (Thomas A. Vanderslice), USF&G (Norman P. Blake Jr.); Zurn Industries (George Schofield); Clean Harbors (Clyde Keaton), and Systems and Computer Technology (Michael J. Emmi).
Many of these companies enjoyed healthy stock gains in the early months after former G.E. executives took control. The Sundstrand Corporation, an aircraft and components maker based in Rockford, Ill., rose 60 percent in the first seven months after promoting Mr. Stonecipher from president to chief executive in 1989. He had joined Sundstrand two years earlier after 26 years with G.E.
Zurn Industries Inc., a manufacturer of pollution control equipment, rose more than 34 percent in Mr. Schofield's first six months as chief executive in the latter half of 1985. The USF&G Corporation, a deeply troubled insurance company, climbed from $7.875 when Mr. Blake took over on Nov. 26, 1990, to $12.50 the following April.
But the record is not perfect. M/A-Com Inc., a military electronics concern in Burlington, Mass., saw its stock fall during the early months of Mr. Vanderslice's control. So did Clean Harbors Inc., an environmental cleanup company in Quincy, Mass., when Mr. Keaton began serving as co-chief executive with the founder, Alan S. McKim.
And the stocks of companies led by former G.E. executives have not always sustained their gains. Sundstrand gave up most of the original advance under Mr. Stonecipher before recovering, closing Friday at $43.375, down 37.5 cents. And USF&G fell Friday to $9.125, down 25 cents.
"You don't turn insurance companies around overnight," said Myron Picoult, who follows insurance stocks for Oppenheimer & Son. "It could take 10 years. I'm urging investors to steer clear of USF&G."
The Systems and Computer Technology Corporation, which develops computer systems for universities and other institutions, has been on a roller coaster since Mr. Emmi was recruited in 1985. Mr. Emmi's arrival at the company followed a scandal that led to the conviction of Frederick Gross, the previous chief executive, on charges of insider trading and securities violations. One decline took the stock down as low as $1.75 in late 1988; it was at $10.75, down 62.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading Friday.
In addition, as prospectuses always warn, past performance is no guarantee of future profits. Owens-Corning, for example, could easily stumble if it turns out that Mr. Hiner was overly optimistic about the company's ability to take asbestos off its financial agenda for the rest of the decade with the $800 million write-off.
Stephen J. Dobi, who follows the company for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, urges investors to avoid the stock because he thinks it is too risky relative to others in the construction group.
And Owens-Corning will still be burdened by litigation costs. The company told analysts that it had a plan to cut legal costs by two-thirds, from $150 million to $50 million annually, but it has been vague about how such huge savings could be achieved.
What about G.E. itself? The stock of the conglomerate, based in Fairfield, Conn., was at $77.50, down 25 cents on the Big Board on Friday, a far cry from about $14, adjusted for splits, when John F. Welch Jr. became chief executive on April 1, 1981. The annual rate of return including dividends averages out to more than 15 percent.
Still, G.E. shares have underperformed the market since the beginning of this year and trade at about a 30 percent discount to the Standard & Poor's index of 500 major stocks, based on the ratio of price to projected earnings. Many analysts now rate the company as an undervalued buy, especially for long-term investors.
But others, like Howard A. Rubel at C. J. Lawrence, say G.E. is fully valued. Among the stocks Mr. Rubel prefers is Allied-Signal under Mr. Bossidy, Mr. Welch's former top lieutenant. "There's more potential for upside surprises at Allied," Mr. Rubel said.

HEADLINE: Senate Candidates Smile for the Cameras

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
For three candidates for the United States Senate who scheduled news conferences yesterday, it was a picture-perfect day for photo opportunitiies and sound bites.
Two of the three went to locked government office buildings where they sought to dramatize Federal policies they want changed. A third had coffee with John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, and later chatted with reporters outside an instantly recognizable Manhattan landmark, St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
 Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican seeking a third term in Washington, spent a half-hour standing in front of a midtown Manhattan unemployment office that was closed for the day, talking about the need to create jobs, stop "the economic hemorrhaging" and reduce the tax burden on businesses.
 
Posing With Jewish Leaders
 One of his would-be Democratic challengers, Elizabeth Holtzman, held her news conference in the windy courtyard outside a Federal office building in lower Manhattan that was also closed for the weekend. She posed with a group of Jewish leaders and said the Government should open its files on Nazi war criminals.
Another Democrat, the Rev. Al Sharpton, the self-styled civil rights crusader, gave Cardinal O'Connor a letter asking for help with his application to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Two other Democrats, Geraldine A. Ferraro and Representative Bob Mrazek, had no events scheduled in New York City yesterday.
Outside the unemployment office on West 54th Street, Mr. D'Amato reviewed figures released last week that showed that joblessness in New York State climbed to 10.9 percent in February. He noted that New York State had had one-fifth of America's job losses in the last year, even though it has only about 7 percent of the country's population.
He said that a cap on state and Federal spending could lead to a tax reduction within 18 months. And, citing figures he said came from a State Senate Advisory Commission, he said that $5.7 billion could be saved if some Government services were turned over to private investors. He wants the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to sell the region's three major airports and the World Trade Center, because, he said, they would generate tax revenues in private hands.
Mr. D'Amato also blasted one of his favorite targets, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and the state's "bloated bureaucracy," saying state costs are "choking" suburban communities. "We've got a population little more than half of California, but we spend twice as much on Medicaid," he said.
As for the Republicans' presidential prospects, he said the conservative challenge presented by Patrick J. Buchanan was not hurting President Bush or, indirectly, his own campaign.
"The Buchanan campaign has been a blessing in disguise, sending a message to the President that many people who supported him were disappointed with his tax agreement with the Democrats," Mr. D'Amato said.
Miss Holtzman, who wrote the law authorizing the deportation of Nazi war criminals, said that it was time to open files on the Government's involvement with them.
"We know that Nazi war criminals who committed some of the most brutal crimes against humanity were brought to this country by Government officials, were employed by U.S. Government agencies and were sheltered abroad," she said. She said that Argentina had opened its files, and Washington should follow suit.
Inside Cardinal O'Connor's residence behind St. Patrick's, Mr. Sharpton drank two cups of coffee while the Cardinal had tea. Mr. Sharpton said his letter sought a place in the St. Patrick's Day Parade for himself and "a contingent of African-Americans who protest the Bush Administration's exclusion of Joe Doherty and Haitian refugees from the United States."
Mr. Sharpton said he did not believe that the Cardinal controlled the parade, but has influence over those who do.
In the past, Cardinal O'Connor has spoken out for both the Haitians, who were denied asylum after they fled their country for an American military base in Cuba, and Mr. Doherty, a former Irish Republican Army soldier whom the Federal Government deported last month.
"It smacks of a blatant double standard, and smells of racism," Mr. Sharpton said in his letter, "that all Senatorial candidates have been given dignitary status, but myself and the African-Americans who support Doherty, Haitians and gays have not been included."

HEADLINE: Exports Rise For U.S. Tools

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Exports of American machine tools posted a record year in 1991 despite the global recession, increasing 1.3 percent, to $1.08 billion from the previous high of $1.06 billion in 1990, the Association for Manufacturing Technology has reported. It was the eighth consecutive annual increase.
Machine tool imports, reflecting the depth of the recession in the United States, declined 7.3 percent in 1991, to $2.14 billion, from $2.31 billion in 1990. It was the second consecutive annual decline after a record high in 1989. 
 The leading export market for machine tools from the United States last year was Canada, at $134.6 million, down 26 percent from 1990, followed by Mexico, which increased 14 percent to $124.9 million, and Germany, which advanced 10 percent to $100.2 million.
Japan was No. 4 at $94.4 million, an increase of 13 percent, followed by South Korea, up 14 percent, to $93.2 million; China, up 90 percent, to $70.7 million, and Britain, down 30 percent, to $58.4 million.

HEADLINE: Israelis Say They May Drop Bid for U.S. Loan Support

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 8

 BODY:
Israeli Government leaders have strongly suggested in a series of recent statements that they are ready to abandon their request for United States loan guarantees in the face of American demands that they stop building Jewish settlements in occupied territories.
A growing number of senior officials have actively urged the Government to withdraw its aid request, which involves $10 billion in loan guarantees to help resettle hundreds of thousands of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. 
 The most recent such advice came from Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, the driving force behind a boom in settlement construction that has taken place over the last two years.
"I would give up on the matter," said Mr. Sharon, who strengthened his political position last week as the governing Likud Party picked its candidates for June parliamentary elections.
"I would announce, 'Thank you very much,' " he told a group of high-school students on Friday, "and make a very big effort to raise these funds from other sources."
 
No Dictating by U.S.
 Other Likud Cabinet ministers have said that if the Bush Administration insists on telling Israel to choose between loan guarantees and settlements, they would tell the Americans to keep their aid. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir sounded a similar note this weekend with a warning that Israel would not allow Washington to tell it what to do, either in this case or in the Middle East peace talks, which ended another inconclusive round in Washington last week.
"I think almost all the political factions in Israel would not accept a situation in which the American Administration would dictate our policy, whether about settlements today or about other territorial issues tomorrow," he told the army radio.
Mr. Shamir's advisers say he still wants the loan guarantees, and believes that a compromise can somehow be worked out despite the unbending insistence of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that settlement-building must first come to an end. But on a not-for-attribution basis, senior officials acknowledge that they have essentially given up hope for the aid, certainly until after the June 23 elections here.
In a further sign that the Israeli Government was ready to pass up the assistance, its Ambassador to the United States, Zalman Shoval, said in Washington that if there were "tough conditions" in a compromise bill being worked on in Congress, it was possible that "Israel will have to reassess its request."
 
Mistrust of Baker Deepens
 The Israeli Government's mistrust of Mr. Baker seems to have deepened in the last few days. It follows press reports -- denied by Mr. Baker's office -- that he discussed with senators the possibility of cutting Israel's regular economic aid of $1.2 billion a year if it does not freeze settlements, and that he used a vulgar Anglo-Saxon verb in talking about American Jews with Bush campaign advisers.
The obscenity was reported on Friday in a column written for The New York Post by former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York City. Although the report was dismissed as "garbage" by Mr. Baker's spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, it was carried today in all Israeli newspapers. One of the more sober dailies, Haaretz, splashed the supposed remarks, in English and startlingly uncensored, across the top of page one.
Another newspaper, Maariv, said in an editorial that whether or not the Koch report was accurate, "those who claim that the man cannot serve as an honest broker in the Israeli-Arab conflict will use this as proof."
Israel has sought the guarantees so it can borrow money from private banks at more favorable interest rates than it would normally get. The United States is not being asked to lend the money itself but rather to stand by as a guarantor. In that position, it would probably be required under the law to set aside several hundred million dollars to be used in the event -- an improbable event, officials here say -- of an Israeli default.
Senior officials here accuse Mr. Baker of interfering in their domestic politics, seeking, they charge, to create a climate that would enhance the opposition Labor Party's chances for electoral victory in June. Labor is calling for the settlement freeze that Washington wants.

HEADLINE: From Tiananmen Square to New York Sweatshops;
One Woman's Fight to Better the Lot of Workers Under Communism and Capitalism

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Lu Jinghua moved excitedly among the garment workers sitting awkwardly in undersized chairs at Public School 105 in Brooklyn, passing out leaflets and preaching worker solidarity.
"The union is for the benefit of the workers," Ms. Lu told them in Chinese, as she circled the classroom decorated with alphabet letters and paper snowflakes. "It will fight for benefits for you. Unionize!" 
 The workers, mostly women and recent arrivals from China, listened intently. They had come to the school in Sunset Park, as they do each Sunday morning, to study English -- and along the way to learn about workers' rights -- in classes organized by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
 
Family Left Behind
 What Ms. Lu does not tell them is how she came to work for the union, how as a young garment-shop owner she was drawn inexorably into the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, how she became a leader of a labor federation born on the Square, or how she fled after the bloody crackdown, leaving behind her husband and baby daughter.
"I do not tell them my story," Ms. Lu said through a translator later. "It has nothing to do with what they need at this point. If they gain benefits, then their lives will be secure, then there will be hope in their lives."
Ms. Lu believes she is simply carrying on in Brooklyn a struggle that began in Beijing three years ago when she impulsively joined a long march of students that would eventually sweep her into the international labor movement. Instead of fighting the hard-line Communists in China, she fights exploitative owners of sweatshops in New York City. But the cause, she says, remains the same.
"You should know your rights," she told the workers, "and fight for them."
 
A High-Profile Symbol
 In the nearly two years since the garment workers' union hired her, she has not only been a high-profile symbol of the union's efforts to foster international worker solidarity, but has also become an effective rank-and-file organizer.
While reluctant to recount her story to workers, she has been eager to tell it at human rights forums, demonstrations at the United Nations and elsewhere.
"When I first spoke to her, I got chills," said Jay Mazur, the president of the garment workers' union. "She's a real hero. She believes in what she's doing, and she's paid a price for it."
For Ms. Lu, who is 31 years old, that price has been high. Her husband, Li Zhilang, served seven months in prison for harboring her after the crackdown. She has not seen her daughter, who is now 4, since the early morning three years ago when she slipped out of Beijing. She lives in an apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, cut off from her family, except for an occasional telephone call. She fears arrest if she returns home.
Ms. Lu's initiation into the labor movement was as abrupt as it was unlikely. Born and raised in Beijing, she was a garment worker for several years before opening a small garment shop of her own near Tiananmen Square in 1986 -- an enterprise made possible only by the Government's tentative easing of economic rules in the 1980's.
 
Joined a Union
 A month after students began protesting in Tiananmen Square on April 15, 1989, she joined them. Her reasons, she said, were more naive than political. "Everybody felt we should support the students," she said. "I participated hoping the Government would change in terms of the serious social problems."
On May 24, she joined the Workers' Autonomous Federation, an unofficial labor union that issued a constitution in the headiest days on the protests. Ms. Lu became the group's spokeswoman, reading its demands over blaring loudspeakers.
On June 4, it all ended.
In the days after the crackdown, in which many members of the union were killed or arrested, Ms. Lu hid in a friend's apartment. Later, she fled with only a small bag to Hebei Province in the south, where her husband was working, then to Hong Kong and finally to the United States after receiving political asylum.
For a time she worked in a grocery store in Los Angeles. Through her work with human rights organizations, she came to the attention of the garment workers' union, which represents 75,000 workers in New York City, a quarter of them Chinese.
Michelle Briones, director of the union's international relations department, said Ms. Lu has been "a charismatic and symbolic spokeswoman," as well as a committed and energetic organizer.
Ms. Lu, who works in the union's headquarters on Broadway at 54th Street in Manhattan, is compiling a book of interviews and writings from Tiananmen Square. She is also learning English.
 
New Immigrants
 At the school in Sunset Park, she takes the roll and otherwise serves as a union representative to more than 200 workers, union and nonunion. As Chinatown has become overcrowded, thousands of Chinese have moved to Sunset Park, which now has the largest Chinese population in Brooklyn.
Employers have subsequently followed, and a thriving garment industry has sprung up in storefronts, warehouses and, in some cases, sweatshops, where workers must contend with substandard conditions and employers who disregard labor laws, said Dan Yun Feng, who runs the union's school program.
Ms. Lu said the immigrant workers are vulnerable. "Because the Chinese here, especially the immigrants from the villages, have very little education, they do not know how to fight back," she said.
Between their lessons, workers beckon her to their desks and bashfully ask her questions about the union. Some, she said, whispered to her what they would like to see done in their shops. "That's progress," she said, "from just being silent."
Ms. Lu said she was never an ideologue, but in the years since Tiananmen, she has become more committed to the idea of fundamental rights for workers, for all people. She has learned a lot, she said, but considers her work here temporary.
"The only place I can use the skills and knowledge I have learned," she said, "is China."

HEADLINE: A Boom Town's Slumping Fortunes

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILTON KEYNES, England

 BODY:
If any place is a gauge of just how much the recession has knocked the confidence of Britons, it is Milton Keynes. A gleaming city of low-rise, mirror-glass office buildings, warehouses and light-manufacturing factories about 50 miles north of London, it was one of the Thatcher era's boom towns.
As a train pulls into town, visitors are still greeted by a slogan scrawled on a wall declaring, "Tomorrow belongs to us." But with foreign investment slowing, housing prices down by 25 to 35 percent and unemployment at what is here considered to be an astronomical 7.5 percent, uncertainty pervades the city. 
 Large British and foreign companies came here in droves in the 1980's to escape an overcrowded and increasingly expensive London. There are 88 American companies, including Unisys, Motorola, Dana, Cooper Industries and Coca-Cola, and 43 Japanese companies, including Minolta, NEC and Alps Electric.
 
Symbol of Slump
 But what propelled the local economy were the hundreds of so-called Thatcher entrepreneurs who came and started companies. With its abundance of commercial space, cheap rents and eagerness to help new companies get off the ground, many saw Milton Keynes as an ideal base from which to serve large London corporations. Others saw the opportunities created by the local boom.
Since 1980, the borough's population has grown by 56 percent, to 187,400. Everything was so new and successful that the community -- with its huge covered shopping mall, modern houses with thatched-roofs and outdoor sculptures of cows -- became both the butt of humor and the object of envy throughout Britain. Now, the local slump mirrors what has happened throughout the south of England as the boom in real estate, construction, retailing and financial and business services has gone bust.
It used to be that the great majority of people who came to Milton Keynes Business Ventures, an agency that helps entrepreneurs get off the ground, were people with jobs who were looking to strike out on their own. "That has radically changed in the last eight months," said Colin Offor, its chief executive. "Now over 50 percent are unemployed."
Most jobs have been lost because small businesses went under or retrenched. With bad loans piling up, banks became reluctant to lend to small companies, raising fears that many more cash-starved enterprises would join the growing pile of failed businesses.
"Advertising agencies don't have the work, so we don't have the work," said Ian Douse, manager of Harvest Studios, a small company that does commercial photocopying and processing. His sales dropped by about 20 percent in the last 18 months, and he cut his staff to 6 from 15. But he was luckier than most. There were 25 small graphics and computer-services companies in his building; now there are 8. "The Government says the recession is almost over," Mr. Douse said. "I can tell you it's still far from it."
William Burnes's small company, which installs doors, windows and conservatories in houses, still thrives because people are refurbishing their homes instead of trading up. Also, he has a lot fewer competitors. "When we started four years ago, there were 15 or so companies; now there are 3," he said, adding that he was lucky because he had not borrowed heavily.
 
Personal Worries, Office Glut
 Indeed, many residents of this once-confident city are consumed with worries about their jobs and meeting loan payments. "People may have mortgages greater than the value of their houses and that's not just a Milton Keynes phenomenon," said Philippa A. Eccles, chief executive of the Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce.
About 20 percent of office space in central Milton Keynes is vacant. "That's the highest it's ever been," said Robert Hill, commercial director of the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, a Government-financed agency.
An eternal optimist, Mr. Hill says foreign investment will rebound. He says the main reason it slowed was recessions elsewhere, like the United States, Germany and Sweden and the slowdown in Japan. But some here worry that with the creation of the European Community's single market and the opening up of Eastern Europe, investment will be harder to attract.
"It's difficult to see at the moment what is going to make things turn around," Mrs. Eccles said.

HEADLINE: Thatcher's Miracle: Victim of Its Own Excess

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 8

 BODY:
When the Conservatives led by Margaret Thatcher won a landslide victory five years ago, Britain was booming, and Britons believed that their economy, which had long suffered from anemic growth, high inflation and militant unions, had been transformed.
Now, with Britain slogging through what is by some measures its longest recession since World War II, the so-called Thatcher miracle is looking a lot less miraculous. 
 Last year, Britain's economy suffered its sharpest one-year contraction since the 1930's. Unemployment, on the rise for 22 months, totals more than 2.6 million people, or 9.2 percent of the work force. And economists expect it to rise to nearly 3 million, rivaling the postwar record.
 
No Sign of Recovery
 After more than a year of recession, there are no concrete signs of a revival in business or consumer spending. And slowdowns or recessions in America, Japan and Western Europe mean Britain cannot expect much help from exports, which have been one of the few bright spots.
What happened here has a familiar ring in America. Years of expansion in the 1980's accompanied by lavish bank lending, tax cuts and spirited entrepreneurship eventually caused the economy to overheat. To dampen things down a bit, interest rates climbed as high as 15 percent at one point. Consumer spending plunged and business spending followed.
Some examples of the 1980's excesses are well known, like the collapses of Robert Maxwell's publishing empire and Asil Nadir's conglomerate, Polly Peck International P.L.C. There are also real estate boondoggles like the sprawling Canary Wharf development in East London, where 40 percent of the 4.6 million square feet of office space that has been built or nearly so is not rented.
But Britain's biggest problem is the tens of thousands of people who got in over their heads. College students were bombarded with credit cards. Entrepreneurs found it easy to borrow for new businesses. And home buyers found banks all too willing to lend them as much as 100 percent of their mortgages at floating interest rates that wound up soaring.
"Banks were throwing money at people," said Donald Lee, owner of VIP Type Ltd. in Milton Keynes, a city 50 miles north of London, where entrepreneurs flourished in the prosperous 1980's. "But when times are tough, they tighten up."
Mr. Lee's small company, which prepares material to be printed, had been growing at 30 to 35 percent a year until last April. Then sales plunged. His bank cut his overdraft and reneged on a promised mortgage to replace the temporary financing used to buy his building. Mr. Lee saved his business by selling his invoices at a discount. He now has no cushion. "I'm still on a knife edge," he said.
Later this week, when the Government's annual budget is announced, it is widely expected to contain initiatives, including tax cuts, to pump money into the economy and ease the recession. But Prime Minister John Major, Mrs. Thatcher's successor and protege, is resigned to facing a general election, which must be held by July 9, with the economy still in recession. The Prime Minister is expected this week to announce an election for April 9.
"The latest data," said Patrick J. Foley, chief economist at the Lloyds Bank, "indicate that there probably won't be an improvement in the first half. There may even be a slight deterioration."
Leaders of Labor, the main opposition party, are reminding Britons that the country went through two severe recessions in the 13-year rule of the Tories, as the Conservatives are known. So far, the gross domestic product has fallen 3.7 percent since the third quarter of 1990. But the 1979-81 double-dip recession was worse; a 5.5 percent drop.
 
Recovery's Course: An Important Test
 Beyond this year's election, business leaders, economists and other experts say that how Britain lifts itself from this slump could be pivotal to the nation's economic future. Will this country of 57 million people regain its historic presence among the first tier of industrialized nations or will it slip back into decline?
"We're at a turning point," said Sir Denys Henderson, a leading British industrialist and chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries. After the union problems, high taxes, excessive Government intervention and lack-of-enterprise culture of the 1960's and 1970's, the pendulum swung too far the other way in the go-go Thatcher era, he said.
"One has to hope that that when we get through this period of stringency," Sir Denys added, "we will see the pendulum centering -- that taxes will not rise again to the point they become penal, that people will say, 'Yes, we still want the enterprise culture, we have to keep inflation low because we've got to be competitive in world markets and we will not be quite so ready to overextend ourselves in terms of borrowing.' But at this point, it remains to be seen which way the British economy goes."
 
Surplus in 1980's
 In the 1980's, the Tories greatly reduced Government borrowing and even ran a surplus for a while thanks partly to North Sea oil proceeds and the sale of state-owned companies. But personal and business debt soared.
The Tories boast about the record number of new businesses formed in the 1980's, when there was a net increase of 1.2 million. But they do not like to talk about two records last year: 47,777 companies failed and 75,540 homes were repossessed.
While personal income taxes and business taxes fell, other taxes, including the value-added tax on most goods and services, were increased. As a result, the overall tax burden for families with average or below-average incomes rose in the Tory era.
 
Productivity Gap: Behind the Pack
 Several large British companies, however, are much healthier than a decade ago. Most state-owned companies were closed or hammered into shape and then sold. Similarly, private-sector companies that had suffered from years of overstaffing, inefficient work practices and too little investment were put through the wringer. The result is a collection of world-class companies like British Airways, British Steel, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome.
But as a whole, British industry remains encumbered by factories with less sophisticated equipment and workers who are less skilled and much less productive than rivals in Continental Europe, America and Japan.
 
Needs Much More
 Edward J. Roberts, chairman of a small maker of springs and clips in England's West Midlands, Britain's industrial heartland whose biggest city is Birmingham, boasts of the equipment his company bought in the last 10 years. But like most British manufacturers, he knows he must buy much more.
Pointing to a wondrous $220,000 machine that is twisting wire into springs, Mr. Roberts said: "Ten years ago, there was not a machine like that in the U.K." He wanted to buy two more, but the recession forced him to cut planned capital expenditures by 80 percent.
Besides being better equipped, German competitors generally have workers with better skills. To be competitive, Mr. Roberts pays his 130 workers a third less than comparable German workers. "Many of us in the West Midlands might survive the recession but not long term unless things start to pick up," he said. "Another year of this could be very dangerous."
Foreign companies, drawn by Britain's free-market attitudes, low wages, widely spoken language and eagerness to have them, plowed some $170 billion into Britain between 1981 and 1991. That investment is helping to revitalize formerly declining industries like autos and to build new ones like electronics.
But with Communism's fall in Eastern Europe, Britain now seems remote from the center of the European market. It must not only worry about vying with the likes of France, Germany and Italy for investment but also with some Eastern European countries with well-educated, low-wage work forces.
 
The Tory Legacy: Measure of Success
 What does all this say about the Tory era? "It's not easy to give a definitive answer," said David Kern, chief economist of the National Westminster Bank.
"If you take inflation, economic growth and productivity growth over the period compared with the previous 20 years," he said, "you can easily give the answer that things have gotten worse. But if you look at the average performance of the U.K. economy relative to that of other countries, the gap between us and the others has narrowed a lot."
From 1980 through 1991, Britain's economy grew at an average annual rate of about 1.7 percent, trailing the 2.6 percent average for the 24 industrialized countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But in the previous 20 years, the gap was a percentage point greater, with Britain's economy growing at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent versus 4.7 percent for the O.E.C.D. countries. Britain's inflation in the 1969-1979 period averaged 7.9 percent, but eased only slightly in the 1980-91 period to an average of nearly 7.5 percent or 1.7 points higher than the O.E.C.D. average.
British manufacturing productivity grew in the 1980's at an annual average rate of 4.1 percent -- the highest of any leading industrialized country and 1.5 times Britain's average rate in the previous 20 years.
 
A Borrowing Binge
 One reason was that the Government pacified unions by requiring that many key decisions like strikes be made by the rank-and-file instead of merely at the discretion of union leaders. Other steps limited the ability of the unions to disrupt the economy.
Meanwhile, interest rates were low and the Government put more money into people's pockets by cutting the basic tax rate to 25 percent from 33 percent and the top marginal rate to 40 percent from 83 percent. In addition, the Government sold a large portion of public housing to tenants, which not only saddled them with mortgages but also made them feel richer -- and thus willing to borrow more -- when housing prices took off.
Financial institutions then went overboard in lending.
 
Sales, Closings and Layoffs
 "We shared in the optimism about continued growth that characterized that period and there were undoubtedly some departures from sound lending," Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster, said recently when he disclosed that his bank had added a record $3.71 billion to reserves to cover bad debts.
Although interest rates have fallen sharply and debt has declined to a more manageable level, business and consumer confidence remains low.
In London, scores of stores on Oxford Street and in other shopping districts are empty or display signs announcing spectacular sales.
Companies are also contending with forces their counterparts in the United States know only too well: deregulation; foreign competition; worldwide cuts in military spending and economic slowdowns or recessions abroad. And some of the handful of remaining state-owned companies are laying off people as they prepare for life in the private sector.
Companies that have announced big job cuts this year include British Telecommunications, British Aerospace, British Steel, state-owned British Coal and some big banks.
 
Plan of Action: Nothing Too Drastic
For now, Mr. Major is reduced to reminding Britons that his Government cannot be blamed for the global slowdown and that the ingredients for a recovery -- lower interest rates and inflation and more manageable levels of business and consumer debt -- are in place. Nor can the Government deeply cut the base or prime interest rate, which is now 10.5 percent, until the Germans cut theirs: the pound is linked to the mark in the European Monetary System.
 
4.1% Inflation Rate
 Private economists say the Government will be reluctant to go overboard with tax cuts and spending increases in the budget. That would damage its hard-won reputation for being serious in the last few years about bringing down inflation, which is now 4.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. It is also unlikely that such largess would have a noticeable impact on the economy before the election.
"I think we're pretty clear what the state of the economy will be in the election," an aide to Mr. Major said glumly.

HEADLINE: Farmers Wary of Efforts to Manage Growth

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Spring has arrived only in the heated greenhouses on New Jersey's vegetable farms, where seedlings are set out to start the season's crop of melons, cucumbers and cabbages. But farmers like Erwin Sheppard are already raising a political crop of objections over New Jersey's efforts to manage growth in the state.
New Jersey's pioneering state land-use plan, which is intended to direct growth to already-developed areas, has won over nearly all of the state's fractious business groups except the farm community. As now written, the plan frowns on any development in farm-designated areas that is not directly related to agriculture. Farmers like Mr. Sheppard say that if they cannot sell to real-estate developers, the price of their land will be depressed. 
Lower land prices mean less equity for the farmer and a harder time borrowing the money to put in a spring crop, the farmers say, although some planners dispute it. The farmers want to keep the right to sell at least a portion of their land to the highest bidder or have the state pay them for the loss.
"The equity issue is the biggest problem with the plan statewide," said George Horzepa, director of the Division of Rural Resources for the state Agriculture Department.
"Equity is the basis for a farmer's borrowing for next season's crop, and it is potentially his retirement. So the farmer's reaction to the plan is sort of like the reaction of a suburban community when they want to put a halfway house in their neighborhood, and everybody starts talking about housing values."
 
Future of Farming Debated
 Mr. Sheppard, who with his father and two brothers operates a 1,100 acre vegetable farm outside of Cedarville, in southern Cumberland County, insists that the future of farming in the Garden State is at stake.
"If we lose our equity in the land the viability of a lot of farm enterprises is going to be in question," he said. "If agriculture is viable and farmers can make money, none of this land will be sold for development anyway. All the farmer wants to do is make a living and pay his bills."
After nearly six years of work, the State Planning Commission may find the speculative value of farm land the biggest remaining stumbling block before it publishes a final state plan this summer.
Before then, at least six meetings will be held around the state to debate the plan, and the State Board of Agriculture, an official advisory panel, expects to stress the issue of farm equity. The state has 8,300 farms.
"What astounds me is that this group of several thousand people have managed to absolutely befuddle the rest of the whole state," said Sam Hamill, a planning consultant who heads the Policy Committee of New Jersey Future, a group formed to support statewide planning.
The state plan, one of the most advanced of several statewide efforts under way around the country, will be nonbinding. But it could, at the Governor's direction, have the force of state controls over roads, sewers and other improvements, without which large projects cannot be built.
 
Winners and Losers
 In addition, county plans and township zoning rules, which govern land use in New Jersey, will be encouraged to conform to the state master plan and to focus growth into designated areas.
Supporters of the state plan reject the farmers' argument: people gain or lose every time government makes land-use decisions, they say, so why should one group be singled out for compensation? Besides, they add, perhaps half of the state's 870,000 acres of agricultural crop land is already owned or optioned by speculators, whose profits the public has no duty to protect.
Even the amount of money the farmers stand to lose over the next two decades from lost sales of land under the plan, put at $350 million in an economic impact study released Friday, is dwarfed by the billions in tax expenditures saved elsewhere by having the state grow in a plannedway, they say.
 
A Little Bit Developed
 "Equity is not an issue in the plan. Equity is an issue for the authorities to decide," John W. Epling, director of the state Planning Commission, said during Friday's commission meeting. "If the legislature and the people make the decision that they want to purchase all of that land so that nobody gets hurt, there are plenty of savings under the plan to cover the cost."
One solution under discussion would have developers who build in growth centers contribute to a fund that would pay farmers not to develop their land.
Mr. Sheppard, a member of the state agriculture board, insists that more is at stake than speculators' profits.
"They have not allowed any development that isn't pertinent to agriculture," he said. "Does 'non-pertinent' mean that my son who doesn't work on the farm cannot build a house on the farm? That is really restrictive."
Mr. Sheppard wants a compromise that would still allow farmers to develop a corner of their land, using the most current design rules for clustering houses in compact, land-saving patterns.
But while no state plan would object to a child's building on the family farmland, to allow each farmer to put a townhouse development on his land would produce the same kind of scattered development the plan was born to combat.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Geer, DuBois Hires a Chief In Time for Jaguar's Review

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
GEER, DuBOIS INC. has hired a president and chief executive, and not a moment too soon. The agency's second-largest client, Jaguar Cars Inc., has announced a review of its account.
Joining Geer, DuBois is Stephen G. Bowen Jr., who had been president of J. Walter Thompson U.S.A. until April of last year, when the agency said he had resigned "because his career objectives are not in accord with the current opportunities here." Translation: his departure followed a political tussle. 
 For Mr. Bowen, 48 years old, time to settle in will be as much of a luxury as -- well, a Jaguar. He must immediately deal with the review on the British luxury car maker's American account, which has been at Geer, DuBois since June 1986.
"What we will do is give Jaguar the best work they've ever seen in the remainder of the 1992 model year," said Mr. Bowen, echoing the slogan the New York agency has created for Jaguar advertising: "The best Jaguars ever built." Geer, DuBois has accepted an invitation to participate in the review, he added.
Jaguar's announcement on Friday was no shock. The company's American sales slide, in the wake of the recession and the onslaught of Japanese luxury-car competition, made a review likely. So, too, did a skein of imported car companies that had reviews since last year; Jaguar becomes the fourth, after American Isuzu Motors, Mercedes-Benz of North America and Subaru of America -- all of which changed agencies.
"We may be the first incumbent in all these pitches to win," said Rodney Underwood, Geer, DuBois's chairman and creative director.
An even more compelling reason for the review is the 1989 purchase of Jaguar Ltd. in Coventry, England, by the Ford Motor Company. Advertising executives have long expected that Ford would nudge Jaguar's American operation into a review that would include Ford's four global agencies: Ogilvy & Mather, Wells Rich Greene BDDP Inc., Young & Rubicam Inc. and Thompson, where Mr. Bowen worked from 1969 until last year.
"I'll have to give them a call," Mr. Bowen said of his former Thompson colleagues.
Neither John Crawford, a spokesman for Jaguar in Mahwah, N.J., nor Neal Gilliatt, a New York advertising consultant hired by Jaguar to advise on the review, would discuss which shops other than Geer, DuBois might participate.
Nor would they discuss the account's billings. According to the Leading National Advertisers tracking service, Jaguar spent $17.1 million on advertising during the first 11 months of 1991, compared with $22.6 million during the corresponding period of 1990. Geer, DuBois's billings are estimated at $120 million.
The only Geer, DuBois client larger than Jaguar is the Paddington Corporation, which imports brands like Bailey's Original Irish Cream liqueur and Cinzano. The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation was the largest client until it withdrew its $30 million account over a computer error that resulted in overcharges.
That loss, and the departure of the agency's president and chief executive, John Hayes, have cast a pall over Geer, DuBois, overshadowing recent gains of additional billings from current clients, like Paddington, and new accounts like the Northrop Corporation and the New York Zoological Society.
"That's the agency business," Mr. Underwood said philosophically.
He added that choosing Mr. Bowen from a long list of candidates to succeed Mr. Hayes, who left unexpectedly last month to become president of Lowe & Partners, stemmed from a belief that Mr. Bowen "is someone who could bring big-agency marketing thoughts to a boutique agency that's creatively driven."
Mr. Bowen becomes a partner in Geer, DuBois, joining Mr. Underwood and Peter Geer, chairman of the executive committee. Mr. Underwood dismissed a report in a trade newsletter that Mr. Bowen would buy the agency, which has recently received inquiries from shops like Bloom FCA about being acquired.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Analysts Still See Room For Fed to Ease Further

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Some credit market analysts maintain that the Federal Reserve Board needs to lower short-term interest rates further, even though recent economic statistics point to a revival in business activity.
That view is not popular with most market participants, who have pushed up short-term and long-term rates sharply over the last two months. Indeed, at current levels, short-term rates suggest that traders expect that the next move by the Fed will be to tighten monetary policy. 
 In large part, analysts' expectations about additional Fed easing are based on the belief that the rise in interest rates since mid-January is probably sapping strength from the modest recovery that seems to have been building since the start of the year.
"The pickup in activity we experienced over the past two months was triggered by the declines in rates we saw in December and early January," said Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. "But with rates backing up significantly, that will be enough to slow the recovery down considerably, and perhaps get the Fed back into an easing mode."
 
Yields Flirt With 8%
 Despite continued news of low inflation, traders have responded to the modest rebound in consumer demand and signs of a recovery in manufacturing by driving up yields on two-year Treasury notes by more than 80 basis points since December. Bond yields, which fell to as low as 7.40 percent in January, continue to flirt with 8 percent.
As of Friday, the interest rate differential between three-month Treasury bills and 30-year bonds stood at 3.80 percentage points, up from 3.53 percentage points at the end of 1991 and more than double the 1.82-point average differential that prevailed from 1985 through 1991.
"The economy was so depressed at the end of last year that some sort of bounce was inevitable," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc. "But the bond market is so paranoid about a recovery that they are not willing to look at things objectively."
 
No Confidence From Jobs Data
 Debt traders did seem to interpret the February rise in non-farm payroll employment as a further sign of economic weakness.
They pointed out that virtually all the 164,000 new non-farm jobs came in the retailing and automotive industries, two businesses that are severely depressed. Moreover, when combined with the revised 149,000 drop in payroll figures during January, the figures show that a mere 7,500 net new jobs were generated in each of the last two months. And the rise in the unemployment rate, to its highest level since July 1985, was seen as little help in bolstering consumer confidence.
"It's way too much to interpret the employment report as a harbinger of strong employment growth ahead," said William Melton, a vice president and chief economist at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis.
"It does seem that some industries, notably lumber and chemicals, have bottomed out and are beginning to show some increases," he continued. "But there are 20 different industry components in manufacturing, and those are just 2. That doesn't look very broad-based to me."
Nevertheless, the reported gains in employment and hours worked last month almost certainly mean that personal income and industrial production also rose during February. And most Wall Street economists are expecting that February retail sales figures, due out on Thursday, will show another healthy increase after the rise of six-tenths of 1 percent recorded in January.
Analysts said the expected strength in retail sales is likely to be skewed because this year February had five Saturdays, the busiest shopping day of the week.
"Any rebound in retail sales will be slower than what the January and February numbers are showing," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation.
 
Fed May Have Time to Wait
 With the exception of Mr. Yardeni, who says that within a month the Fed will need to cut its discount rate by a full point from the current level of 3.5 percent, analysts agree that the brighter economic numbers have given the Fed more time to ponder its next move.
"It remains far more likely that the Fed will ease again this year than it will tighten," Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, wrote in a weekly letter to clients.
"There is still considerable risk that the February gains will prove short-lived and that the economy will sputter after a month or two," he said. "And even if the economy has entered a firm upward course, it would be difficult for Fed officials to justify moving up short-term rates any time soon, given the virtual lack of growth in the economy over the past three years."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New Reuters Rates Upset British Clients

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CASSIDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 8

 BODY:
The Reuters news agency has angered some of its most important British clients by sharply increasing the rates it charges some publications at a time when they are struggling to get through a severe recession.
Faced with rates that have more than doubled, The Daily Telegraph, the largest of the broadsheet British dailies, has dropped the Reuters World Report, which carries mostly foreign news. Instead, it will rely on Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press. 
 And The Economist magazine, whose rates more than quadrupled, may drop the Reuters World Report. It is subscribing to Agence France-Presse on a trial basis.
 
Telegraph's Complaint
 Nigel Wade, foreign editor for The Daily Telegraph, said his newspaper and The Sunday Telegraph had dropped Reuters solely for economic reasons.
Calling Reuters "a superb news agency," Mr. Wade said: "This is not about quality at all. It's about price. It's about pricing one's self out of the market, basically."
Susannah Amoore, managing editor of The Economist, called the rate increase "unpalatable, especially at a time when we're trying to cut budgets."
The new rates for Reuters are based on a publication's circulation and marketplace. They were instituted to bring Britain in line with Reuters's pricing practices in the United States, where subscribers' rates have always been based on circulation.
 
Old Pricing System
 Barry Simpson, the Reuters news products manager for Britain and Ireland, noted that before Reuters Holdings P.L.C. went public in 1984, one of its principal shareholders, the Newspaper Publishers Association, paid Reuters on behalf of its member papers. It then charged those papers uniform rates, regardless of circulation and the amount of Reuters coverage they actually used.
In 1986, Reuters began dealing directly with the individual newspapers, but the old pricing system remained intact until this year.
Mr. Simpson called the old system illogical. He said it was "ridiculous" for a tabloid that carries little foreign news to pay the same rate as The Telegraph.
Under the new rate structure, implemented earlier this year, "quality" broadsheet dailies like The Telegraph and The Times of London are required to pay a monthly rate of 20, or nearly $35, per 1,000 circulation; mid-market dailies like The Daily Express and The Daily Mail pay 5, and popular tabloids like The Daily Mirror and The Sun pay 2. Weeklies like The Sunday Telegraph and The Economist pay a quarter of the daily rate in whatever category they are in.
As such, Mr. Simpson said, the Telegraph newspapers would have paid 17,500, or about $30,000, a month; previously, they were paying about 8,000. The Economist, which had been paying a monthly rate of less than 500, is now paying more than 2,000.
 
Savings for Some Papers
 Some newspapers like The Evening Standard of London and the tabloid Today, however, are paying less. For example, The Evening Standard's rate dropped to 2,455 a month from 3,720.
Still, several papers that agreed to pay higher rates have their own complaints. At The Sunday Times, for example, Roger Eglin, the managing editor, said he understood the rationale behind the new rates, but was "not terribly enthusiastic" about the higher bill.
"In this sort of recession and with all the pressures to cut costs, any increase causes you some distress," he said.

HEADLINE: Control Data To Sell Unit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn., March 8

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation will sell its money-losing lottery systems business to Video Lottery Technologies Inc. Terms were not dislcosed when the agreement was announced last week.
Control Data's automated wagering division supplies computers to state-authorized lottery games in eight states. 
 Last year, the unit generated $114 million in revenues, down from $126 million the previous year. The drop was attributed to recessionary pressures on the sale of lottery tickets. Last year the division provided about 8 percent of the company's $1.5 billion in revenues.
The buyer, Video Lottery, based in Bozeman, Mont., had 1991 revenues of $31 million. Its primary business is the sale and management of video gaming terminals -- touch screen video games for blackjack, poker and keno that are placed primarily in taverns in the 27 states that permit them.

HEADLINE: Finding Hemingway's 'Lost' Articles

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 8

 BODY:
He covered economic summit conferences, jailbreaks, the sacrifices of a single mother for her three small children, the death of oak trees in High Park, the decline of Jack Dempsey.
In three years at The Toronto Star his byline was Ernest M. Hemingway, although not all the hundreds of articles that he wrote for Canada's biggest-circulation newspaper carried his signature, or even were published. 
 He left The Star's payroll on Dec. 31, 1923, staying just long enough to collect his Christmas bonus. He then sailed from New York to Paris to work on "The Sun Also Rises." He was 24 years old.
To mark its 100th birthday this year, The Star, after dogged research in its archives and elsewhere, published a special section on March 1 of "lost" articles by its most famous employee, dispatches that have not appeared in any Hemingway collections.
James D. Brasch, associate professor of American literature at McMaster University, said the material "makes us all richer" and means that scholars will have to rewrite the biographical material of the writer's Toronto period. It also means, he said, that the Charles Scribner's Sons "Dateline, Toronto: The Complete Hemingway Toronto Star Dispatches 1920-24" will have to be re-edited.
Hemingway turned up at The Toronto Star in 1920 after a brief stint at The Kansas City Star. He had served in the Ambulance Corps in Italy during World War I and had been wounded.
 
'Loose-Jointed Youth'
 Greg Clark, one of the first Star journalists to meet him and who later helped Hemingway land the reporting job, described him as "a large, rather heavy, loose-jointed youth, with a flushed face, dark loose hair and a big red mouth."
"He perspired easily along under his hair on the forehead and under his lower lip. He appeared to be shy, anxious and restless."
The reason Hemingway came to Toronto, his closest friend on The Star, Morley Callaghan, a Canadian novelist, recounted in his memoir "That Summer in Paris," was because Hemingway's wife, the former Hadley Richardson, was having a baby, "and he had heard that Toronto doctors were very good."
Hemingway called his days on The Star a "stern apprenticeship." Although he later became famous for bulls, boxing and booze, he shows up in the newly discovered articles as a sensitive feature writer, an environmental reporter and even a Santa Claus Fund columnist. Star reporters had to take turns composing the Santa Claus appeals. Hemingway's effort was about a woman whose husband had abandoned her with three small children and who earned $6 a week as a domestic.
"She had worked until she had become a shadow," he wrote. "Her big eyes in sunken lids seemed to hold flame as they glowed from the pallid transparency of her thin face. Her lips were colorless. There was not a spare ounce of flesh on her nor a spare gill of blood in her veins. Her bones showed as knobs and hollows in her gaunt cheeks."
 
A Concern for Trees
 Writing on the environment 70 years ago, he focused on the impact that automobiles, even then, were having on the "sullen and rigid" oaks of High Park and Queen's Park: "Stripped of their leaves by the wind, they stand stiff and despairing looking against the sky. For the oaks are dying." He had found an expert, Dr. C. D. Howe, dean of forestry at the University of Toronto, to explain that the dust constantly stirred up by cars settled on the oak leaves and formed a film that stopped the pores' breathing.
"The trees suffocate," Hemingway's professor said. "They must have air to breathe just as an animal must."
He returned to Italy for the paper to cover the Genoa economic summit conference in April 1922 and wrote that he found the city "scrubbed cleaner than it ever was before or ever will be again." The Genoa meeting was crowded with journalists "all speaking different languages, and all pounding ridiculously small typewriters with a look of concentration on their faces, or else writing in illegible longhand."
While in Europe he interviewed the French wartime leader Georges Clemenceau, but the long account, including compelling description of Clemenceau and his home on the French Atlantic coast, was rejected by The Star's managing editor, John Bone. In the interview, Clemenceau had accused Canada of rejecting compulsory military service and refusing to help France during the war. Neither statement was accurate.
The Star reproduced a letter from Bone to Hemingway explaining the rejection: "As his reference to Canada constitutes the most interesting part of the interview, I don't think we should use it at all although I hate to pass up your excellent color to be found throughout the article."
 
'Looking the Tiger'
 Hemingway introduces Clemenceau: "A bulky man, thickened by age, wearing a brown tweed suit, a funny flat cap, his face as brown as an Ojibway, his white mustache drooping, his white eyebrows bushy, looking the tiger his pictures show him, his eyes twinkling as he talked to his plump daughter-in-law, he came plodding through the sand."
Later in the piece he describes Clemenceau's face as "remarkably like a Chinaman's. If the mustache, instead of being large and drooping, was cut in a narrow line, he would look exactly like a Mandarin."
The pugilist in Hemingway comes out in an article that deflates Jack Dempsey, then heavyweight champion of the world, and anticipates some of the attitude and mood of "Death in the Afternoon," about the decline of a great matador.
"Jack Dempsey is not the man today that he was in Toledo," he wrote. "Two years of championship life coupled with whatever effects there might be from his wild years as a bum and tramp fighter have made a change in him. The public are rarely told these things."
The article provided background on an approaching fight with Georges Carpentier of France. Although Hemingway predicted Carpentier would take Dempsey, Dempsey actually knocked Carpentier out in the fourth.
 
Written His Heart Out
 Hemingway's most embarrassing moments on the paper were when he was unceremoniously yanked off the coverage of British Prime Minister Lloyd George's visit to the United States in October 1923. He had written his heart out on the tour, 6,200 words in two days, but ignored an event that editors later thought was newsworthy. That was a welcoming speech by New York City's acting mayor that had been seen by other journalists as insulting to Lloyd George.
"He was in disgrace," wrote William McGeary, a Star editor, who chronicled Hemingway's career at the paper and who found much of the new material. Hemingway resigned a few weeks later.

The Beauty of the Flat Tax

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

 BODY:
Jerry Brown's upset victory in the Colorado primary has forced his opponents to pay attention to his campaign proposals, even those that sound oddball. Take the tax plan he extols in every debate: Scrap all Federal taxes and replace them with a 13 percent "flat tax" on each taxpayer's personal and corporate income. Mr. Brown is able to set such a low rate because he would eliminate nearly every deduction and exemption. Families would be allowed to deduct only mortgage interest, rent and charitable contributions.
Mr. Brown says his plan would cure nearly every national ailment. Because Congress would be taken out of the business of dishing out tax breaks, the political choke hold wielded by most powerful special interests would be broken. And because the marginal tax rates would be low, investment should spurt -- bringing rapid rises in productivity and wages. 
 O.K. Mr. Brown exaggerates. But by less than seems obvious. While Mr. Bush and Congress are mired in petty debate over small-bore tax cuts, Mr. Brown is onto something wonderful.
To see why, first note that the existing tax code is riddled with wasteful contradictions. Everyone agrees, for example, that the U.S. desperately needs higher rates of saving and investment. Yet the existing code singles out investment income for double taxation: first at the corporate level, then again at the individual level when profit is distributed to shareholders as dividends. Congress builds in progressive tax rates so the rich will pay more than the poor. Then it builds layers of complexity and loopholes so that the progressive rates are effectively undone.
Enter Mr. Brown. Actually, enter Robert Hall, an ingenious economist at Stanford University who co-authored a dazzling tax plan that forms the basis of Mr. Brown's flat tax. Mr. Hall's plan shows how to build a code that taxes every dollar of income only once, subsidizes saving, favors the poor and is simple, simple, simple. Mr. Brown had the vision to seize a smart idea.
Under the Hall plan, individuals would pay tax on all labor income -- wages, salaries and pension distributions. Corporations would pay tax on all capital income -- interest and dividends -- paid to creditors and shareholders and all fringe benefits provided to workers. Thus every dollar of income would be taxed once and only once. One more wrinkle: Corporations would be allowed to deduct the full cost of investment in the first year.
What's the beauty of the plan? For starters, Mr. Hall's (and Mr. Brown's) plan would cleverly exempt saving. How so? To economists saving and investment are mirror images of the same activity; investment funds come from savings. By fully deducting investment, Mr. Hall and Mr. Brown thereby exempt savings. Mr. Brown rightfully boasts that investment should spurt, pulling wages up with it.
But tax codes that exempt savings are notoriously unfair to the poor, who typically save only a small percentage of their income. To make sure the poor come out ahead, all Mr. Brown would need to do is build generous tax credits and exemptions into the personal income tax. He'd no longer have a perfectly flat tax, but it would nonetheless work beautifully.
Look further. By exempting investment, corporations would no longer need to calculate allowances for wear and tear -- depreciation. Gone would be a zillion pages of tax complexities. Also gone would be the need for individuals to pay tax on capital gains -- which would be indirectly captured by the corporate levy. Throw out another zillion pages of tax code.
Indeed, under Mr. Hall's plan, tax forms would be no bigger than a postcard. Simply brilliant.
There are problems with the Hall plan, especially in figuring out how to make the transition from the current code to the new code. But the problems are solvable, leaving America with a code that would be simple, fair and -- the President would be wise to listen -- pro-growth.
The Hall plan does, alas, embrace one flaw, almost certainly fatal. If passed, it would create a small but devastating form of unemployment: among the 56 members of the House and Senate tax-writing committees. Hall-Brown is dead even before arrival.

HEADLINE: Space Bargains From Russia

 BODY:
How shortsighted can the United States get? The Soviet space program, once the best in the world and long a feared competitor, has put most of its products and many personnel up for sale. The offer comes when the West is seeking ways to prop up the disintegrating Russian economy and keep Russian scientists from selling their services to renegade nations.
So what's the response of timorous Federal officials? They are hanging back, worried that any purchases of Russian space hardware or expertise might keep alive the Russian defense industry. Their ingrained reluctance persists even though the cold war is over and the chief threat in the former Soviet empire is disintegration, not military revival. 
 The Russian space program, though weak in electronics, leads in some technologies. It has the world's most powerful rocket, with an especially advanced first stage; the world's only operating space station; the world's only compact nuclear reactor for generating power in space; exquisite tiny plasma thrusters that are used to change the orbits of satellites, and other advanced hardware of potential value to spacefaring nations. All that is backed by some of the most experienced and talented space scientists in the world.
Russian officials have been trying to peddle hardware and expertise for months. They have attracted interest from some defense officials and industrial companies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is also studying the feasibility of using the Soyuz spacecraft as a crew-rescue vehicle for its own space station and will examine, though not necessarily use, an automatic rendezvous and docking system that even NASA acknowledges is "elegant engineering."
But so far no significant deals have been consummated. As was disclosed in a recent article by William J. Broad of The New York Times, key officials have blocked any purchases by refusing import licenses. Some officials express concern that many space technologies, like rockets, have potential military uses; they seek to force the Soviet military-industrial complex into a decline so steep that it will pose no future threat.
Others want to protect the U.S. aerospace industry from competition at a time of recession and cutbacks. And some experts say NASA is reluctant to purchase any hardware or services that might reduce the need for its own programs.
The impasse is heightened by the Administration's failure to set forth a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the evolution of the former Soviet Union. As a result, Washington now risks missing a chance to buy technologies that could save the United States billions in development costs while saving the Russian economy and scientific establishment from disintegration.
Surely Russia's Energia rocket could carry America's space station aloft in far fewer flights than the space shuttle, and at far less cost. And perhaps other cheap, reliable Russian rockets could loft American payloads instead of the finicky shuttle. Russian space experts might well conduct assessments of American space projects, as they do already for Europeans.
The opportunities are not unlimited. Some Russian hardware is primitive, and there are always difficulties in blending one nation's technologies with another's. But this is a time for boldness. Just as the American space program profited mightily from the contributions of German scientists after World War II, so might it benefit from Russian contributions at the end of the cold war.

Whine, Women, Tsong

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
Let us now phase out famous myths.
Myth 1. President Bush's popularity will rebound as economic growth resumes this summer. 
 A whining question permeates the Bush campaign: Why are people unfairly blaming him for hard times that statistics show are not really here?
The Federal Reserve "hit the gong," as central bankers say, last Dec. 20, at the culmination of a quarter in which interest rates were lowered dramatically and other stimulants were administered. The economic consensus is that real economic growth will resume six months afterward, and that come Fiscal New Year's Eve -- June 30 -- the economy will be merrily popping its cork again.
But economics ain't beanbag. As we come out of recession or stagnation, the last statistic to show good news is the unemployment rate.
Perking-up sales with lean payrolls mean productivity and profits, which will help the stock market, but the President's performance will be judged on the lagging unemployment figures. A summer turnaround, even if it develops, may be too late to do much for the jobless figures or for Presidential popularity.
Myth 2. Governor Clinton's campaign has overcome the worst of the bimbonic plague.
The word is around that at least one young woman has been stripping for political action to illustrate her magazine memoirs. Punchy Clinton supporters are hoping it is only a past Miss Arkansas, which would at least show gubernatorial state loyalty.
The brighter side: The number of voters lost to Clinton on this characterless issue will probably remain the same. They demand marital fidelity, period, and it matters not to them if a candidate slipped once or a dozen times. However, the unforgiving judges can only walk out on him once.
As night follows day, any new life given the peccadillo brigade will encourage it to go for even more prestigious game. At a full-scale Presidential news conference (and whatever happened to them?) some reporter -- ostensibly in the interests of fairness -- will ask the dread have-you-ever question of the President of the United States.
If he denies it -- thereby condoning the asking -- the great hunt for even a hint of refutation will begin. But if Mr. Bush coldly denounces the fishing inquisition as unworthy of a place in politics, he will be doing what is right but will help level the playing field for Governor Clinton.
Myth 3. The health issue has been laid to rest by the candor of former Senator Tsongas and his doctor.
The most knowledgeable and responsible medical journalist in our business, Dr. Lawrence Altman of The New York Times, was given access to both the candidate and his personal physician. He wrote a straight news story that, despite its upbeat headline, had to be troubling to any serious voter.
I read it closely and reached two conclusions: first, that Mr. Tsongas has greater inner strength than most of us realized, making his political comeback after his cancer went into remission all the more admirable. His emergence from the shadow of death to the spotlight of national prominence is nothing short of inspirational.
Second, several leading cancer specialists expert in the lymphoma that nearly killed Mr. Tsongas do not share the hopefulness of his doctor's prognosis. As I read the story that bears careful study and follow-up, this candidate may be in greater danger of not surviving his term than the younger Mr. Clinton or even the older Mr. Bush.
If Mr. Tsongas becomes the Democratic nominee, his complete medical record should be subject to inspection by doctors who could then make their independent judgments public. We need to learn more about his claustrophobia, too, the existence of which he freely asserted in his interview with Dr. Altman. (Perhaps a fear of confined spaces would be good in a President.)
With unemployment remaining high for Mr. Bush; with Mr. Clinton under continued sexual harassment; and with Mr.Tsongas's health to be more closely examined -- does this mean a fault-free last-minute entrant will scoop the pools?
I think not. Let's pin on our "Nobody's Perfect" buttons, recognize a choice of three pretty good candidates and stop sniveling. This is shaping up into the best campaign in 12 years.

HEADLINE: Did Cancer Battle Shape Tsongas's Character?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Candidate's Cancer" (editorial, Feb. 23) attempts to defuse Paul Tsongas's medical history as a political issue, but it doesn't go far enough. In the view of this undecided Democrat, Mr. Tsongas's battle with cancer does more than simply not disqualify him from the Presidential race; it actually distinguishes him as a candidate worth a closer look.
Paul Tsongas was forced in his 40's to confront his own mortality, to find courage and the will to fight in the face of understandable terror. Surely, if he is a thoughtful man, he has emerged from those experiences with some of the insights and sense of priorities that make a wise leader. 
 Having relied on state-of-the-art health care for his recovery, might he be more sensitive to the unmet needs of millions of Americans for adequate insurance? Because he owes his life to a bone-marrow transplant, a treatment considered highly experimental until quite recently, is he more willing to finance biomedical research and scientific education generously?
Having leaned heavily on his own loved ones in a time of great need, will he be more of an advocate for social and economic policies to help sustain the family? Dare we hope that his hard-won appreciation for the value of human life might even make him less willing to march a generation of young people to war?
While no one would deliberately choose illness as a tool for developing new perspectives, the value of Paul Tsongas's medical experience should not be underestimated. A life-threatening disorder can be an extraordinary teacher.

HEADLINE: The Other Hamptons: Jobs and Food Lag

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAG HARBOR, L.I., March 3

 BODY:
At the First Presbyterian Church, a squat white frame structure built by prosperous whalers in the 1840's, hungry people began lining up along a dark staircase even before a volunteer unlocked the door to a small room where the emergency food was stored. The shelves were almost bare.
Thomas Haskins was one of the first on line. Thirty-five years ago in South Carolina, he boarded a bus of migrant farm workers to pick potatoes on Long Island, and stayed. Now he earns $7.50 an hour at a riding stable, in season, and goes hungry in the winter as he struggles to survive on an unemployment check of $166 every two weeks. 
 "I got to work, a guy like me got to work," he said, as he selected some groceries, a package of spaghetti, some sauce, tuna fish and a bulk wrapped pound of butter. "But there ain't no work in the winter time. If I could get a job I would be working around the clock."
It is the far side of an unusually harsh winter in the Hamptons, a time when the summer people have shuttered their houses, the motels are closed and restaurants have posted signs saying "reopening in April," a time when hundreds of people living on the cusp of poverty struggle to survive until business picks up in the spring and the hiring starts again.
While the Hamptons evoke images of luxury and grandeur, side by side with the fancy summer cottages and estates of the well-to-do are the homes of the less fashionable and the less visible -- the gardeners, fishermen, field hands, construction workers, painters, house cleaners and waiters, who struggle to get by despite the exorbitantly high costs of living in a resort community.
 
A Shorter, Sadder Season
 This winter, volunteers at churches and emergency food pantries from Westhampton Beach to Montauk say that the demand for emergency food is soaring -- doubling in many cases -- and they are struggling to keep up.
"All the places you think of as the glitzy Hamptons are bearing a tremendous load of trying to feed the hungry," said Martyde DiPierro, a former supervisor of the town of East Hampton, who is raising money for the food pantry in the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Quogue.
"The only good news is that people are very generous and are trying very hard," she said, "but no matter how many times they stock the shelves they are empty."
Despite its image of affluence and leisure in the summer, when the population of about 16,000 rises four-fold, East Hampton town, which includes Sag Harbor, has one of the highest poverty rates on Long Island. In the 1980 census, one of 10 residents was living below the poverty level. The 1990 figures are not yet available.
In this winter of recession, many seasonal workers were laid off earlier than usual, social workers say, adding to the distress. Now the workers worry that they will not get their jobs back at all when the warm weather arrives.
On the coldest days of winter this year, social workers say that they found three people living in their battered old cars in Montauk, at the farthest reaches of Long Island, without money, but unwilling to leave town. Others face hunger, social workers say, because of the crushing cost of rental housing, or because of delays in the processing of applications for welfare in a county where the welfare case load has risen by 35 percent in the last two years.
 
The Food-Bank Circuit
 Mr. Haskins, for instance, pays $400 a month rent for a box-like house on the Bridgehampton-Sag Harbor Turnpike, across from luxury homes built on what used to be a potato farm. The walls are as thin as paper, and he has to pay more than $600 each winter to refill the gas cylinders that run the gas heater, Mr. Haskins said.
When he is out of money, he said, he goes back to the riding stable, where he can get some gas for his car, and do some odd jobs for a few dollars to tide him over.
"People think everyone here uses money for toilet paper," he said.
Edna Steck, director of human services for the town of East Hampton, said that three new food banks have opened in the town in the last year.
"We are finding that people are going from one to another; they seem to be running out of food more often," she said.
 
The Work Dried Up
 In Sag Harbor, in the white frame church built to evoke the grandeur of an Egyptian temple, Susan Gonzalez, scrutinized the dates on jars of baby food before putting some of them in a brown paper grocery bag.
Outside, her husband, Frank, waited in a battered sedan, while their 9-month-old daughter, Hannah, slept, strapped into her car seat. Mrs. Gonzalez's two other daughters from her first marriage, Jennifer, 12, and Emily, 6, were at school.
Mrs. Gonzalez grew up in and around Sag Harbor, where her father worked for years at the local supermarket. She cleaned houses three days a week, but was laid off when she was pregnant.
Her husband, an immigrant from Costa Rica, earned $11 an hour working as a landscaper and house painter. The work dried up in November. Later he learned that some of his coworkers had agreed to work for lower wages to keep their jobs.
Now, the Gonzalezes struggle through the winter on welfare, donated food and the money they raise driving up and down the back roads of the Hamptons, collecting cans for the 5-cent deposit. "We had to cash in some cans at the A.&P. to get money to buy some soap so I could take a shower," Mrs. Gonzalez said. "We have no money. Sometimes I don't want to get up in the mornings."
 
Waiting for Spring
 What makes their predicament particularly acute is the starkly modern weathered wood house they rented in a wooded neighborhood outside of Sag Harbor last October, just before Mr. Gonzalez lost his job. They receive $891 a month in welfare benefits -- because of its high housing costs Suffolk County has the highest housing allowance in the state -- but pay $800 a month in rent.
First they lost their cable television connection and then their telephone and now they worry about the $793 bill they owe for electric heat. In a sprawling yard outside, scavenged plywood boards and tree branches are stacked to be burned in a cast iron stove for heat. At first the Gonzalezes used a chain saw to cut the wood. When the chain saw broke, they used an axe. Then the axe handle came off. Now they use a saw.
"My daughter came home with a list of books to buy from the book club, and I couldn't buy her even one book for 95 cents," she said.
The Gonzalezes are not alone. At the old whaler's church in Sag Harbor, 400 Thanksgiving dinners were provided last year compared to 75 two years earlier. The minister, the Rev. Christine B. Rannie Grimbol, said the emergency food pantry, operated by volunteers from churches throughout Sag Harbor, is giving out two to four times as much food as it did last year.
Despite the hardships of living in a place with no industry and a seasonal economy, many of the poor of East Hampton say they are better off staying where they are.
Shelton Thompson, who arrived at the Sag Harbor food pantry wearing a faded tuxedo shirt and a worn bow tie and carrying a cane with a brass duck handle, said it was far easier to be poor with dignity here than in New York City.
An unemployed chef with years of experience at restaurants that have long since closed, Mr. Thompson, his wife and daughter got by last year on welfare, food donations and some free-lance catering jobs in the summer.
"You work all summer for the winter, then you survive all winter for the summer," he said. "Everybody is very beautiful and very nice, thank you, because without God's grace and food pantries we would starve to death."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 10, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about poverty on the East End of Long Island referred incorrectly to a fund raiser for a food bank and misidentified her former position. She is Mardythe DiPirro, the former supervisor of Southampton, not East Hampton.

HEADLINE: Nixon Scoffs at Level of Support For Russian Democracy by Bush

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Former President Richard M. Nixon has sharply criticized President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for what he calls the Administration's pathetic support of the democratic revolution in Russia. He says one of the historic opportunities of this century is being missed.
In a memorandum circulated among friends and foreign affairs experts, Mr. Nixon faults Mr. Bush and other candidates for virtually ignoring the issue in the Presidential campaign. 
 Mr. Nixon argues passionately that if President Boris N. Yeltsin fails in his effort to transform Russia into a free-market democracy, everything that has been gained in the peaceful revolution there in 1991 will be lost. He says that would weaken democratic forces and embolden dictators from China to Eastern Europe and from the Middle East to Korea.
 
'As If a Penny-Ante Game'
 Despite having so much at stake, Mr. Nixon says, the Bush Administration's support for Russia in some areas is comparable to assistance extended to a small country like Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta.
"The stakes are high, and we are playing as if it were a penny-ante game," Mr. Nixon said.
While not mentioning Mr. Bush or Mr. Baker by name in his critical passages, Mr. Nixon leaves no doubt about the way he feels they have inadequately supported President Yeltsin. The Administration's support has been primarily $3.75 billion in commercial credits to buy American grain, and an international aid conference in Washington that produced a onetime airlift made up of medical supplies and enough leftover Persian Gulf war rations to feed Moscow for one day.
 
'Photo-Opportunity' Parley
 "What has the United States and the West done so far to help Russia's first democratic, free-market oriented, non-expansionist government?" Mr. Nixon asks in the memo. "We have provided credits for the purchase of agricultural products. We have held a photo-opportunity international conference of 57 foreign secretaries that was long on rhetoric but short on action."
"We have decided to send two hundred Peace Corps volunteers -- a generous action if the target of our aid were a small country like Upper Volta but mere tokenism if applied to Russia, a nation of almost 200 million people covering one-seventh of the world's landmass," he added. "This is a pathetically inadequate response in light of the opportunities and dangers we face in the crisis in the former Soviet Union."
Mr. Nixon argued that the United States and its Western allies should provide much larger amounts of humanitarian aid, reschedule the debts incurred by the former Soviet Union until the new market economy begins to function, and create a multi-billion dollar fund to help stabilize the Russian ruble as soon as Russia gets control of its money supply.
His critique comes at a time when Mr. Bush has almost forsaken the foreign policy front as he concentrates on re-election. Administration foreign policy experts have been complaining privately that the President has become so concerned about the isolationist trends in the country -- which his main Republican rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, has encouraged -- that he has not only muted his support for foreign aid and increased assistance to the former Soviet lands, but has also virtually stopped talking about foreign policy at all, except to extol the victory in the gulf war.
The only reason that the Administration now has $400 million to spend in helping the former Soviet Union dismantle nuclear weapons is because the money was pushed through by Congressional Democrats last year, without the support of Mr. Baker or Mr. Bush.
 
Taking Issue to Voters
 Congressional leaders have told the Administration that if it wants a 1992 foreign aid bill that will include such things as money for international peacekeeping operations and increased contributions for the International Monetary Fund so it can help Russia, the President is going to have to get out and fight for it in Congress and with the public.
"The American people overwhelmingly oppose all foreign aid because they want to see that money spent on solving our problems at home," said Mr. Nixon, who published a sanitized,less critical version of his memo in Time magazine this week. "But the mark of great political leadership is not simply to support what is popular, but to make what is unpopular popular if that serves America's national interest."
"What seems politically profitable in the short term may prove costly in the long term," he added. "The hot-button issue in the 1950's was 'Who lost China?' If Yeltsin goes down, the question 'Who lost Russia?' will be an infinitely more devastating issue in the 1990's."
The Democratic Presidential candidates, none of whom have much foreign policy experience, have not been much more aggressive than the President on the Russian aid issue. While all have said that the other former Soviet republics should be helped in their move toward democracy, none have made the issue a centerpiece of his election campaign or pushed it as major item in his campaign advertising.
 
Refurbishing the Image
 Mr. Nixon's memorandum is the latest of many public policy pronouncements that have helped to refurbish the image of the former President, who resigned in disgrace in 1974 over the Watergate scandal. It was his Administration that established relations with Communist China and initiated detente and nuclear arms control treaties with the Soviet Union. Mr. Nixon has also just published a book, "Seize the Moment: America's Challenge in a One-Superpower World."
He begins his analysis in the memo by writing, "While the candidates have addressed scores of significant issues in this Presidential campaign, the most important issue since the end of World War II -- the fate of the political and economic reforms in Russia -- has been virtually ignored."
He added, "The Communists have lost the cold war, but the West has not yet won it."
What will determine whether "the final battle of the cold war will be won or lost," he argued, is whether "President Yeltsin's economic reforms succeed in creating a successful free-market economy."
If Mr. Yeltsin fails, Mr. Nixon said, "war could break out in the former Soviet Union as the new despots use force to restore the 'historical borders' of Russia."
"The new East European democracies would be imperiled," he continued. "China's totalitarians would breathe a sigh of relief. The new Russian regime -- whose leaders would cozy up to the Soviet Union's former clients in Iraq, Syria, Libya and North Korea -- would threaten our interests in hot spots around the world."
"The bottom line," Mr. Nixon said, "is that Yeltsin is the most pro-Western leader of Russia in history." He said the West must help the Yeltsin Government in six ways:
*By providing humanitarian food and medical aid to get the Russian Government through the critical months until reforms start working.
*By creating a "free-enterprise corps" that will send thousands of Western managers to Russia to infuse newly independent enterprises with capitalist tools.
*By rescheduling Soviet debt incurred under President Michael S. Gorbachev and deferring interest payments until the new market economy begins to function.
*By allowing greater access to Western markets for Russia's exports.
*By joining with other industrial nations "to provide tens of billions of dollars for currency stabilization through the I.M.F. as soon as Russia gets control of its money supply."
*By creating a single Western-led organization to coordinate government and private aid to Russia and other republics, as the United States did in rebuilding Europe after World War II.
The Nixon Library is holding a two-day foreign policy conference in Washington starting Wednesday, and Mr. Bush will be giving the keynote address. This may explain why his last paragraph contains the only explicit reference to the President:
"President Bush is uniquely qualified to meet this challenge," Mr. Nixon said, because the leadership he exhibited in the gulf war "can insure that the cold war will end not with just the defeat of Communism but also with the victory of freedom."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
President Focuses on 'Family Values'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
With Presidential primaries fast approaching in the Midwest's most urban states, President Bush declared today that the problems of big cities were rooted in the collapse of the family, and that the need for new solutions to the crisis was urgent and clear.
At the same time, Mr. Bush appeared to argue against more Government programs directed at families, saying that many of them have hurt more often than they have helped. His own prescription, delivered in a speech here to a meeting of officials in the National League of Cities, was limited. 
 "We needn't look far for principles to guide us," Mr. Bush said. "There are old home truths: rely on what works, discard what doesn't, never be afraid to innovate, remember the government closest to the people responds best to the needs of the people."
White House and Bush campaign officials said today that the President was considering a series of speeches and campaign events to sharpen his economic debate with the Democratic Congress and lay out more detailed plans for a second term.
The events, under discussion for several weeks, range from an Oval Office address to the nation to a barnstorm-style trip across the country to chide the Congress for refusing to pass the White House's economic growth package, one official said today.
Other options include a televised news conference on prime-time television -- a showcase that the President has rarely used in his three years in office -- and another address to the Congress, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In today's comments, Mr. Bush called for innovations in the welfare system, which he said was sapping family strength, but the President did not suggest any other specific Federal action to deal with the breakdown of the family, a social problem many experts say has been worsening for at least three decades.
 
Embellishing a Theme
 Mr. Bush's speech today was the White House's effort to embellish a campaign theme -- the restoration of "family values" -- that the President first tried out in his State of the Union Message in January and that he has sounded in recent political speeches throughout the South.
In those stops in the weeks before the group of Southern primaries known as Super Tuesday, the President often denounced welfare cheats and child-support dodgers, called for the receipt of welfare to be conditioned on some form of work, and talked about the family's task of teaching children commitment to principals like morality and patriotism.
In part, those speeches have responded to criticism of Mr. Bush from his conservative opponent, Patrick J. Buchanan. But strategists also say that emphasizing the White House commitment to traditional family values will have an appeal beyond the South this fall, especially if Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, already scarred by accusations of sexual misconduct, becomes the Democratic nominee.
Today's address, delivered eight days before Presidential primaries in Illinois and Michigan, centered on the problems of urban families and big cities. Mr. Bush called for a bipartisan approach in curing the ills of the family, a contrast to the far harsher and partisan theme that Vice President Dan Quayle sounded last month in a speech denouncing Democratic-controlled New York City as an example of the failure of the welfare state.
A shift in campaign tactics would come as the most hectic series of primaries draws to an end.
At the same time, the March 20 deadline that Mr. Bush's gave Congress to pass his economic growth legislative package will expire, requiring some new White House action to make it clear that Mr. Bush is waging political war on behalf of his economic agenda.
The forum for Mr. Bush's appearances remains under debate, but he is expected to have a series of speeches in coming weeks "that will lay out the themes he'll pursue over the next several months," that official said.

HEADLINE: Afghan President Says U.S. Should See Him as Ally Against Militant Islam

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, March 9

 BODY:
Abandoned by his former benefactors in Moscow and cast somewhat adrift in the new politics of the region, Afghanistan's President made an impassioned appeal to the United States today to help his country become a bulwark against the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia.
In an interview here, President Najibullah also pleaded for immediate economic and humanitarian assistance from Washington, which long backed the Afghan fundamentalist guerrillas fighting his Government. He also promised that he would release four Afghans who worked in the United States Embassy and were convicted of espionage in 1983. 
 The Afghan President's praise for the United States and his attempt to enlist Washington in common cause against fundamentalism marked the sharpest departure yet from the open hostility that has characterized relations between Kabul and Washington since Afghanistan's leftist coup of 1978.
 
An Uncertain Future
 His appeal reflected not only the loss of support from Moscow and the vastly changed politics of the region but also his sense of uncertainty about his place in a future Afghanistan as well as his acute awareness of his country's desperation.
"We have a common task, Afghanistan, the United States of America, and the civilized world, to launch a joint struggle against fundamentalism," said Mr. Najibullah, who then described what he thought would happen to his country if Islamic extremists took power in Kabul.
"If fundamentalism comes to Afghanistan, war will continue for many more years," he said, the rush of his words repeatedly overwhelming his translator. "Afghanistan will turn into a center of world smuggling for narcotic drugs. Afghanistan will be turned into a center for terrorism."
 
Support for U.N. Plan
 Mr. Najibullah has promised to support a United Nations plan to summon a wide spectrum of Afghans -- including the Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas -- to a gathering that would lead to a political accord to end Afghanistan's years of civil conflict.
But his call for immediate aid left open to question whether he wants Washington to extend assistance while he is still in power or after a United Nations-sponsored transition from his Government is irreversibly under way. Mr. Najibullah has grown increasingly uneasy about the expected outcome of the United Nations process, which almost certainly would mean his removal from office and the dissolution of his Watan, or Homeland Party, the successor to the Soviet-inspired Communist Party he once led.
[In Washington, a senior State Department official said that the United States has long viewed Mr. Najibullah as an obstacle to peace and for that reason has felt that he should leave office, although that is a decision for the Afghans to make. The official, who asked not to be named, said that Mr. Najibullah's plea for funds notwithstanding, Washington already provides large amounts of aid from a humanitarian program administered from Pakistan.
[A department spokesman said there would be no direct public response to the interview.]
After 13 years of war, waged by Islamic rebels against various leftist governments and the Soviet forces, Afghanistan is a country in tatters. The years of conflict have driven six million refugees into Pakistan and Iran, prompted the country's educated classes to migrate to Europe and America and fractured the country along its already fragile ethnic fissures.
With the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in February 1989, virtually all Western nations abandoned their embassies here and ostracized Mr. Najibullah's regime. And then, with the final disintegration of the Soviet Union in December, Afghanistan's last source of economic assistance disappeared. Mr. Najibullah found himself alone in the world, and all but ignored.
In recent months the United Nations peace plan has begun to show signs of life. Pakistan, the principal benefactor of the Afghan guerrillas and the main conduit of Western arms to them, cut off its assistance in late January and said it was supporting the United Nations plan. In doing so, Islamabad abandoned its insistence on installing a fundamentalist government in Kabul, seeking instead a government that could serve as a stable bridge to fruitful economic and political ties with the new Central Asian republics formed from the old Soviet Union. Many leaders in those republics are wary of Islamic fundamentalism.
Some of the fundamentalist guerrillas have condemned the peace efforts, declaring that only the imposition of an Islamic government will bring peace to the country. But others among the splintered guerrilla movement have agreed to participate in the peace efforts.
Mr. Najibullah spoke fervently today of his hopes for a dialogue with the United States, which at one time was shipping hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons to the fundamentalist guerrillas largely in the interest of countering Soviet dominance over the country. Repeatedly during the 40-minute interview, the President echoed a concern underlying the swing through Central Asia last month by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d -- that Islamic fundamentalism poses a significant threat to stability in the region.
"You may think that the Central Asian Republics are significant for the United States of America," he said. "That's right. But I must say that the strategic and political significance of Afghanistan is much more than these republics. If Afghanistan is lost and is turned into a center of fundamentalism, you will lose the Central Asian republics."
Mr. Najibullah, a burly man with a brush mustache, spoke in a wood-paneled conference room dominated by a huge map of the country and lighted by a chandelier made up of five glass globes. Dressed in a subdued blue suit and dark blue tie, the president, normally quite reserved in his discussions with journalists, gesticulated frequently, especially during his discussion of his hopes for a renewal of contacts with the United States.
 
'What Is the Obstacle?'

Most disappointing, the President said, was the refusal of the United States to talk to his Government at any level. The guerrillas, he said, had held talks with the Russian Government in Moscow, and Mr. Baker had visited the newly formed governments in Central Asia, "so what is the obstacle that the United States of America is not opening its embassy in Afghanistan?" he asked.
The last American ambassador to Afghanistan, Adolph Dubs, was killed in 1979 during an attempted kidnapping. Mr. Dubs was never replaced and American representation in Kabul continued at a reduced level until the embassy closed in 1989.
In a gesture intended to demonstrate his sincerity, Mr. Najibullah said that he would offer pardons to four Afghans who worked in the old American embassy. The four were arrested in 1983 and charged with spying for the Central Intelligence Agency. "When we receive a letter from an official source of the Government of the United States of America, we will do this," the President said. "For instance, this letter could be sent through any embassy in the region, or some department in the United States of America, or through Benon Sevon," a reference to the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General to Afghanistan and who is orchestrating the latest peace effort. When asked how long it would be after receiving such a letter that the men would be released, Mr. Najibullah simply said, "Immediately."
American officials have steadfastly denied that the four men -- Ghulam Sakhi Ahmadzai, Jalaludin Talibee, Mohammed Esa and Fazal Ahmad Maulana -- ever engaged in espionage. Several years ago, another embassy employee who also had been imprisoned for spying was traded in a deal for several Afghan officials who were captured in Pakistan.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Bowing Out;
Congratulating the Remaining Candidates, Harkin Ends Campaign

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, as expected, withdrew today from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination, still embracing his unabashed message of liberalism that failed to catch fire during his six-month campaign.
In departing the race, Mr. Harkin became the third Democratic casualty of the season; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska withdrew Thursday and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia withdrew Jan. 8. 
 "My advisers told me not to peak too soon," Mr. Harkin said. "I think I took them too seriously."
Mr. Harkin said he would do all he could for the party's nominee in November. Paraphrasing John F. Kennedy's inaugural address in 1961, Mr. Harkin said, "I will pay any price, bear any burden, learn to speak Greek, develop a Southern accent, or learn to wear a turtleneck to insure that a Democrat is elected President in 1992."
At a final appearance before returning to Iowa, the Senator told an audience made up mainly of students at Gallaudet University, a liberal arts institution for the deaf, that running for President had been the "privilege of a lifetime." Mr. Harkin, whose brother, Frank, is deaf, delivered a brief message in sign language before addressing the crowd.
 
3 Caucuses, No Primaries
 During his campaign, Mr. Harkin failed to win a single primary although he won caucuses in Idaho, Minnesota and Iowa. Congratulating the surviving contenders, he said, "As a result of their success, after today, I will no longer be a candidate for President of the United States."
In a sometimes wistful speech tinged with self-deprecating humor, Mr. Harkin seemed to dismiss the verdict that voters had rejected the liberal politics he represented. "Our campaign was based on the belief that America is not some at the expense of many, but many to the advantage of all," he said. "This is still our cause. Nothing that has happened in this campaign has or could ever change that."
Mr. Harkin, who had referred to himself as the "real Democrat" in the race, had gauged his appeal to traditional constituencies within the Democratic Party, in particular organized labor, in what he said today was a campaign "about keeping the progressive agenda alive for our party."
But that base proved too fragile to sustain him through the early primaries, while candidates like Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massaschusetts, and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, swiftly shouldered him aside. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, though running a shoestring campaign, also remains in the race for the nomination.
Mr. Harkin advocated deep cuts in military spending and a large-scale costruction program to revive the flagging economy. "The poor may be out of political fashion, but they are not without human needs," he said. "The middle class may be angry, but they have not lost the dream that all Americans can advance together."
Mr. Harkin had hoped to last until the primaries in Michigan and Illinois on March 17, but his campaign was in debt and seemed stalled after doing poorly last Saturday in the South Carolina primary and caucuses in Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming. A delegate tally by The New York Times on Sunday showed Mr. Harkin with 86 votes, trailing Mr. Clinton with 293 and Mr. Tsongas with 141. Mr. Harkin won 14 percent of the vote in Wyoming, 8 percent in Arizona, 6 percent in South Carolina and about 1 percent in Nevada.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Unusual Use of the First Amendment Overturns a Killer's Death Sentence

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The Supreme Court overturned a death sentence today on the ground that the prosecution violated a convicted murderer's First Amendment rights by telling the jury that he belonged to a white racist prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood.
The vote was 8 to 1, with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist writing for the majority and Justice Clarence Thomas casting the dissenting vote. 
 The convicted murderer, David Dawson had just escaped from a state prison in Delaware when he killed a woman and stole her car. The prosecution introduced evidence of Mr. Dawson's membership in the Aryan Brotherhood at the sentencing phase of his trial without trying to show that the information was relevant either to the crime or to Mr. Dawson's character. The woman he killed was white.
 
Freedom of Association
 In his majority opinion today, Chief Justice Rehnquist said that because the evidence indicated nothing more than Mr. Dawson's "abstract beliefs" the state violated the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of association by providing the information to the sentencing jury.
"We have held that the First Amendment protects an individual's right to join groups and associate with others holding similar beliefs," Chief Justice Rehnquist said. His opinion emphasized that the First Amendment would not bar the use of "associational evidence" that was relevant either to the crime itself or to an aspect of the defendant's character, like an indication that a defendant was committed to violence and would be dangerous in the future.
But in this case, the Chief Justice said, Delaware failed to show that Mr. Dawson's membership in the Aryan Brotherhood was relevant to his sentencing. "On the present record one is left with the feeling that the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was employed simply because the jury would find these beliefs morally reprehensible," he said, and in that circumstance, the introduction of the evidence was a "constitutional error."
The First Amendment has rarely if ever been a factor in a death penalty decision. As circumscribed as the majority opinion was in this case, the outcome was still somewhat surprising from a Court that has seemed in recent cases to be intent on clearing away obstacles to the death penalty.
Justice Thomas, in his dissenting opinion, objected both to the Court's discussion of relevance and to the majority's analysis of the First Amendment issue.
 
'Forbidden Activities'
 Mr. Dawson's membership in the Aryan Brotherhood "had relevance at sentencing," Justice Thomas said, because a jury could have used it to draw inferences about his character. "In my judgment, a jury reasonably could conclude from Dawson's membership in a prison gang that he had engaged in some sort of forbidden activities while in prison," he said. Also, he said, it was relevant in countering the defense effort to portray Mr. Dawson as a kind person who had earned credit for good behavior while in prison.
Justice Thomas said he had "difficulty seeing what the First Amendment adds to the analysis." He accused the other Justices of adhering to a "double standard" in death penalty cases, in which defendants are given more leeway than prosecutors.
The Supreme Court has recently expanded information that the prosecution can bring before a jury in death penalty cases. Last year, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Payne v. Tennessee, which overturned earlier rulings and permitted evidence about the character of the murder victim that assisted the prosecution. Today, the Chief Justice cited that case, making it clear that the Court was in no way retreating from that ruling.
Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion was notable for the solitary position in which it placed him, without even the company of his apparent mentor, Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia joined Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion without comment. This was the first case that found Justices Thomas and Scalia on opposite sides.
When he was an Associate Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist was often the Court's lone dissenter, a role that more recently seemed to fall to Justice Scalia. Justice Thomas's opinion today may indicate his willingness to assume the role.
The decision, Dawson v. Delaware, No. 90-6704, sends the case back to the Supreme Court of Delaware, which had upheld the death sentence in a 1990 opinion. That court can now order a new sentencing proceeding that excludes the Aryan Brotherhood evidence. Alternatively, the majority said today, the Delaware court can decide whether use of the evidence was a "harmless error" in light of other evidence of Mr. Dawson's eligibility for the death penalty.
By implying, without directly holding, that the "harmless error" analysis might be appropriate, the Court appeared to exclude the First Amendment problem in this case from the category of constitutional errors that require an automatic reversal even if other evidence is overwhelming.
The Bush Administration filed a brief in the case in support of the state. The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers filed a brief for Mr. Dawson.
 
Faulty Instruction of Jury
 The Court set aside a second death sentence today, ruling 6 to 3 that a Mississippi man was entitled to a new sentencing proceeding because his 1982 death sentence was based on an unconstitutional jury instruction.
The instruction permitted the jury to impose a death sentence if it found that a murder was "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel." Though the Supreme Court had found as long ago as 1980 that this language was unconstitutionally vague, it was not until later rulings that the Court made clear that the use of this instruction invalidated a death sentence in cases like the one before the Court today.
The question in the case, Stringer v. Black, No. 90-6616, was whether the inmate, James R. Stringer, was entitled to the benefit of the later decisions in the petition that he filed in Federal court in 1987 challenging his sentence. The Supreme Court has ruled that an inmate may generally not benefit in a habeas corpus petition from a "new rule" contained in a decision issued after his conviction becomes final.
In a majority opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court today said that the later decisions on the jury instruction were not "new rules" but were based directly on the 1980 decision.
Justice David H. Souter dissented in an opinion that Justices Scalia and Thomas joined. They said it was not clear at the time of Mr. Stringer's sentencing that the doctrine the Court announced in 1980 would apply to death sentence statutes such as Mississippi's.
There were also these other developments at the Court today:
 
California Term Limits
 Without comment, the Court refused to hear a challenge by the California Legislature to the limits on legislators' terms that California voters adopted in a 1990 referendum. The California Supreme Court upheld the term limits in a ruling last October.
The limits, which do not apply to members of Congress, will require all current members of the California Legislature to be out of office by the end of the decade. In its appeal, Legislature v. Eu, No. 90-1113, the legislative leadership argued that the limitation violated the First Amendment rights both of those who want to run for office and of voters who want continued representation by the incumbents.
Though the Justices rejected this case, which involved only state offices, the Court may well be more interested in challenges to limits on Congressional terms. Voters in Washington State rejected a Congressional term-limit measure last year, but a similar measure will appear on the Florida ballot in November.
 
Commercial Speech
 In a case with important implications for advertisers and businesses, the Court agreed to decide whether a city that permits newspapers to place their vending machines along public streets must give the same privilege to publications that consist almost entirely of advertising.
The Court has ruled in cases over the last 15 years that though speech offering or advocating a commercial transaction was protected under the First Amendment, the government could regulate it in ways prohibited for "pure" speech. But the dimensions of the "commercial speech" doctrine remain unclear.
In this case, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, No. 91-1200, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that in granting permits for newspaper vending machines Cincinnati could not discriminate against two publications that are distributed for free and that advertise real estate and adult education classes.
 
Workers' Compensation
 The Court ruled unanimously that a 1987 Michigan law imposing retroactive liability on employers for a category of workers' compensation benefits did not violate the employers' rights. The decision, by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, affirmed a 1990 ruling by the Supreme Court of Michigan.
The case, General Motors v. Romein, No. 90-1390, was seen as a possible vehicle to revive the Constitution's "contract clause," which prohibits a state from breaching a contract. The clause has been little used in modern times, and economic and legal conservatives have looked to its revival as a curb on government regulation.
The Court essentially sidestepped the issue today, ruling that the contract clause did not apply in this case because the state workers' compensation law was not part of the contract between the employers and their labor unions.
 
Private-Property Rights
 The Justices dismissed another closely watched case without an opinion. The case, PFZ Properties v. Rodriguez, No. 91-122, was a constitutional challenge growing out of the refusal of planning officials in Puerto Rico to issue a construction permit for a proposed development. The case was a potential test of the Court's new interest in private-property rights. But the Justices apparently decided after hearing arguments last month that the case was flawed and should not have been accepted for review.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Democrats' Diplomacy: They Need Each Other

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 9

 BODY:
Welcome to the N.F.L.
There are 13 Democratic primaries and caucuses over the next eight days, 11 of them on Tuesday. They will produce 31 percent of the pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention. 
 What drives this campaign now, as the primaries tumble one after another, are real, flesh-and-blood, "How does this affect me?" Democratic constituencies: the condo dwellers of South Florida, the black voters of the Deep South, the auto workers of Michigan, the white ethnic voters of Chicago. This is complicated and messy and hard. All the theoretical constructs for this year's election fell away somewhere on the way to Super Tuesday and next week's primaries in Illinois and Michigan.
Gov. Bill Clinton, who spent much of the last year as the darling of the "new thinkers," is now campaigning across the South with what looks like an old-fashioned, lectern-thumping, working-class populist coalition -- one that Walter F. Mondale might have felt at home with. He has been carefully organizing and positioning for months to pull these groups in.
His allies call it smart politics, his critics cynical expedience. (Remember Bill Clinton, chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, that fierce challenger of politics as usual?) Whatever, at this stage of the campaign, these groups matter.
Here in South Florida, the Clinton campaign has blanketed the condos, home to many Jewish retirees, with leaflets accusing former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of being lukewarm in his support of Israel. On Monday night, more Clinton volunteers were in the field with new leaflets attacking Mr. Tsongas's record on Social Security ("Paul Tsongas -- Older Americans -- The Facts").
On television, the Clinton campaign highlights Mr. Tsongas's support for an increase in the gasoline tax (this is a big commuter state, dependent on tourism), and his suggestion that cost-of-living adjustments for 'entitlement' programs might have to be curbed (no explanation needed).
Suddenly, "I'm no Santa Claus" is a message with a downside. ("Why not?" some Democrats might ask.) Mr. Tsongas often seems angry and defensive these days as he battles to hold the line in Florida against a Clinton sweep of the South.
"He's been knocked off his message," says Jeff Eller, Mr. Clinton's Florida coordinator. In person and in his television commercials, the former Senator rails at Mr. Clinton for negative politics.
Still, even if he seems outmatched in conventional politics, part of Mr. Tsongas's appeal is simply that -- the idea that he is something other than another politician who knows how to play the game. He keeps drawing the upscale suburban, Volvo vote; even in South Carolina, which was a Clinton blowout, Mr. Tsongas ran well among voters who make over $75,000 a year. This vote is critical to Democratic chances of retaking the White House. Many smart young Democrats believe their party went awry when Gary Hart, who also drew this kind of voter, self-destructed in 1987.
But Mr. Tsongas, as Mr. Hart did, faces a problem in this phase of the primaries: the Democratic Party has a base, and it includes black voters and organized labor. Mr. Tsongas carried 5 percent of the black vote in South Carolina, 14 percent in Georgia and 25 percent in Maryland, a state where he otherwise ran very strong. Next week, when the race moves to Michigan and Illinois, he faces a heavy labor presence -- and labor has not exactly swept to his side.
And Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton have one more thing to worry about: former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who endured against all predictions when others walked away.
The broader problem for the Democrats is that the party needs both the Clinton and Tsongas vote. "The campaign that has to be run against George Bush is a campaign that combines the appeal to suburban voters who have substantial economic interests, with strong support from traditional Democratic groups such as black voters," said Thomas E. Donilon, a veteran Democratic strategist and a supporter of Mr. Clinton's.
If Mr. Clinton wins in Florida, he can head North with considerable drive and try to demonstrate on neutral turf, that he can unite old and new in the Democratic Party. He would also have new evidence that he has triumphed over questions about his finances, fidelity and draft status.
If Mr. Tsongas prevails in Florida, it would feed the doubts about Mr. Clinton and demonstrate the power of these new Democrats. Too much is at stake here for the debate to be anything but hard, wary and angry.

HEADLINE: Lone Superpower Plan: Ammunition for Critics

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The Pentagon's draft policy statement that foresees a one-superpower world in which no collection of allies or foes is allowed to become a rival reflects intense pressure in the American military establishment to define a robust mission for itself in the post-cold-war era.
Should this draft policy be issued this month to the military chiefs under Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's signature, the Bush Administration will find itself at odds with a number of its international allies and, domestically, with the Democratic majority that controls Congress. 
 And, perhaps more problematical for the President, the Pentagon vision of the new American role sharpens the debate within the Republican Party, where Patrick J. Buchanan lashed out today at the Pentagon prescription for the United States' becoming the ultimate guarantor of world security.
"This is a formula for endless American intervention in quarrels and war when no vital interest of the United States is remotely engaged," Mr. Buchanan told reporters on his way to Memphis, Tenn. "It's virtually a blank check given to all of America's friends and allies that we'll go to war to defend their interests."
Mr. Buchanan called on Mr. Bush to repudiate the draft document. The White House was silent on the matter, and a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said he would not comment on a document that was internal to the Pentagon.
The Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, today characterized the document as a "low level" draft, but defended its contents. He said the statements were very similiar to public statements and Congressional testimony by Mr. Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Democratic reactions to the draft document were as strong as those from Mr. Buchanan on the Republican right, indicating that Mr. Buchanan's opposition converges in this instance with Democratic calls for greater reductions in military spending and for greater collectivism in international security.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he agreed with some of the objectives stated in the policy draft, like combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The problem, he said, was that "the Pentagon vision reverts to an old notion of the United States as the world's policeman -- a notion that, not incidentally, will preserve a large defense budget."
 
A 'Pax Mundi' Is Urged
 He criticized what he termed was an inappropriate Pentagon instinct to erect a "Pax Americana, a global security system where threats to stability are suppressed or destroyed by U.S. military power."
As an alternative strategy, Mr. Biden suggested that the United States pursue "the next big advance in civilization," which he described as "collective power through the United Nations," an option that is effectively rejected by the Defense Department draft.
Among Democratic candidates for President, Paul E. Tsongas has most pointedly addressed the question of whether the United States should take an overarching role in world security.
In his political manifesto, "A Call to Economic Arms," Mr. Tsongas says he would pursue a policy not of Pax Americana, but of Pax Mundi, under which collective security would be a matter of equitable risk sharing and burden sharing so that each nation seeking to protect its vital trade or security interests would make contributions in forces and financial resources to reflect those interests.
"Efforts are going to have to be made to provide a United Nations Security Force with real teeth," Mr. Tsongas writes. "Pax Americana must give way to Heal Thyself. This is not isolationism. It is participation in a new internationalism truly based on the principle of collective security."
 
Draft Called 'Low Level'
 George Stephanopoulos, deputy campaign manager for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, said the first reaction to the Pentagon document was that it seemed to be "one more attempt" by defense officials "to find an excuse for big budgets instead of downsizing."
John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, and an advocate of significant reductions in the President's $1.2 trillion five-year defense plan, said that while many of the goals stated in the policy statement were laudable, its somewhat chauvanistic tone might prompt allies "to challenge us in terms of military procurement."
"People will develop capabilities designed to offset ours," he said, especially if the United States takes a position, as the draft does, that no collection of nations can aspire to regional dominance because that would put them on the path to global rivalry with the American superpower.
"This is very likely to happen if we assertively pursue this kind of superiority," Mr. Steinbruner said.
Caught off guard by the publication of extensive excerpts from the draft defense planning guidance in The New York Times on Sunday, the Pentagon seemed at a loss today whether to embrace the document or reject it. Mr. Cheney was said to have complained to aides that his public testimony on defense strategy gets scant coverage in the news media while classified documents relating to policy formulation underlying those public statements get greater attention.
Mr. Williams called it a "low-level draft" that had not been seen by Mr. Cheney nor been approved by any senior official. "Undoubtedly it will be revised," he said, adding that he had not seen the document, but had instructed his staff to prepare examples of where the document "overlaps" with the public testimony of senior defense officials.
 
Who Got the Document
 On Feb. 18, the draft "Defense Planning Guidance," prepared under the supervision of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Policy, was circulated to General Powell, who serves as the President's principal military adviser, the secretaries of all four military departments, Mr. Cheney's under secretaries and assistant secretaries of defense and the chiefs of all four military services.
A week after the draft document was circulated, Adm. David E. Jeremiah, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the document would be issued by Mr. Cheney in early March, thus indicating it was in an advanced drafting stage. A cover memo from Mr. Wolfowitz's deputy, Dale A. Vesser, also indicates that the policy statement is near final form and asks recipients to "focus your comments on major substantive concerns."
One 15-page section of the guidance states that it has been approved by Mr. Cheney and begins, "This section constitutes definitive guidance from the Secretary of Defense" to be used in conjunction with "fiscal guidance published by the Secretary on 15 February 1992."
Today, Mr. Williams declined to say when the final policy document would be issued. But owing to its classification as a secret document, the public may not discover for some time how Mr. Cheney resolves the questions that have been raised about the draft.

HEADLINE: Christian Science Head Quits Amid Money Fight

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The longtime chairman of the Christian Science Church resigned yesterday amid a bitter internal dispute over the church's direction and finances, and the church simultaneously abandoned his ambitious and expensive dream of building a cable television channel into the church's principal ministry to the world.
The church announced that the money-losing Monitor Channel, a 24-hour public affairs and news channel started last April, was for sale and that it would be closed if no buyer could be found by June 15. 
 In a statement, church leaders said the changes would not affect The Christian Science Monitor, the newspaper started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of The First Church of Christ, Science in Boston from which the church developed. The church's membership is estimated to have dwindled to fewer than 150,000 today from 270,000 in the 1930's, but the church provides no figures on membership.
Mrs. Eddy taught a meditative doctrine of using prayer to heal physical ills and resolve disputes, and the church has traditionally been quiet, conservative and not subject to upheaval.
 
Hope for End of Crisis
 Many Christian Scientists said yesterday that they hoped the moves would help resolve a spiritual and financial crisis that had divided the church into camps supporting and opposing the direction taken by the five-person board of directors under the chairman, Harvey W. Wood.
Since the mid-1980's, under the aggressive guidance of Mr. Wood as is the doctrinal and operational leader of the church and his principal aide, John H. Hoagland Jr., $250 million to $500 million was invested to build a broadcasting and magazine empire whose crown jewel was to be The Monitor Channel.
But in the past two weeks, several respected church officials resigned in a highly unusual public protest of that policy. The church also acknowledged that it had borrowed $41.5 million from its pension plan and shifted other money on an emergency basis, prompting speculation that the church might have to declare bankruptcy if it did not scale down its plans.
"It's too soon to understand entirely what all this means, but it appears to be a beginning of getting the church back to its fundamental spiritual roots," said Katherine W. Fanning, a former editor of The Christian Science Monitor who resigned in 1988 in protest of the plans to make electronic media the centerpiece of church activities.
 
Millions for Broadcasting
 Some signs indicated that the board and its new chairwoman, Virginia S. Harris, were trimming their sails but had no intention of making the fundamental change that had been sought by Ms. Fanning and others. A church spokesman said neither Mrs. Harris nor Mr. Wood was available for comment.
For nearly a century, The Christian Science Monitor newspaper was the church's main media enterprise, and it became highly respected, especially for its international coverage.
Richard J. Cattani, the editor, said that the paper reached a circulation high of about 240,000 in the 1960's, but by the early 1980's it was operating at a $20 million deficit and circulation had declined to 176,000.
The board decided to make broadcasting its principal media focus, and circulation and staffing have declined further in recent years, though Mr. Cattani said that the paper still receives the financial support from the church it needs.
 
Widespread Operations
 The church's mass media operations also include World Monitor, a monthly magazine; Monitor Radio, a daily and weekend public radio service distributed over American Public Radio; World Service of The Christian Science Monitor, a 24-hour shortwave radio broadcasting operation; WQTV, a UHF television station in Boston that carries Monitor Channel programing; World Monitor, a television news program that was carried by the Discovery Channel until early this year and is now part of the Monitor Channel. All of the church's media operations require subsidies, which critics have estimated to be $80 million annually but which church officials have said is much less, although it includes about $4 million a month for the channel.
A church official said the television news program would be offered for sale along with the Monitor Channel, but that neither WQTV nor other operations would be sold. The church set no goal for the amount it seeks from the sale.
Larry Gerbrandt, a senior programing analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a media research company, said yesterday that the crowded marketplace for cable channels would make it difficult to sell the Monitor Channel.
Harry King, a spokesman for Monitor Channel, said it reached 3.5 million households through cable companies in areas like San Diego, Raleigh, and Minneapolis, plus 2 million households over the air through WQTV in Boston.
 
Nonreligious Programming
 Mr. Gerbrant said such a channel would normally sell for from $1 to $5 per cable subscriber. Cable systems do not begin to attract advertising until they reach 15 million households, and become profitable at about 25 million households, he said.
Programing on the channel is virtually all nonreligious, which was one concern of Mr. Wood's critics, who argued that the centerpiece of the church's ministry had become totally secular. The only religious program is a five-minute program broadcast about 5 A.M.
The statement by church leaders issued yesterday said only that the decision to sell the Monitor Channel was "due to a number of challenges" that were not identified. Mr. Wood gave no explanation of why he decided to resign after nearly 15 years on the church's ruling board.
Employees of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, which is called the Mother Church, said yesterday that at meetings to explain the moves, church leaders blamed the decision to sell the Monitor Channel on news reports that had discouraged potential investors.
The crisis began in September when the board arranged to publish "The Destiny of The Mother Church," a book by written Bliss Knapp about 40 years ago that argued that Mary Baker Eddy, who founded the church in 1879, was a second Christ. Mrs. Eddy had forbidden such deification and publication of the book had been repeatedly refused as heresy.
But the church stood to receive a $98 million bequest from the Knapp estate if the book was published as authorized material and offered prominently for sale in Christian Science reading rooms.
Many church members felt that the board had sacrificed principle for money to satisfy the needs of its growing empire, particularly the Monitor Channel.
Stephen Gottschalk, who was once the church formal historian and is a critic of Mr. Woods, said " one clear sign that the new regime could make that indicated real change would be withdrawal of the Knapp book." A church spokesman said yesterday that board had not indicted any such change would be made.
The crisis grew worse on Feb. 25, when the four top editors of the church's religious periodicals resigned and issued a public statement saying, "In good conscience, we are unable to continue serving as editors under present board policies," which was understood to mean the decision to publish the Knapp book.
The periodicals editors are regarded as the religious conscience of the church and the public rebuke of the board, which has a mantle of near-infalability similar to that of the Pope, rocked the church.
Then last week, after reports in The Boston Globe quoting an unnamed church official, the church acknowledged borrowing $41.5 million from the church pension fund.
The church's income comes from three principal sources: the annual giving of church members, various unrestricted funds that have come to the church as gifts and bequests, and various donations that may be used only for designated purposes.
Traditionally, the unrestricted funds have been used when annual giving was not sufficient to cover operating needs, but those funds are apparently exhausted.
In a March 3 memorandum to employees the church's treasurer, Donald C. Bowersock, said the loans were not reported to the church's membership when they were made because the promisory notes issued to the pension fund meant its value did not decline. Mr. Bowersock was replaced as treasurer yesterday and now has the title of managing treasurer.
Critics said there was little or no chance that the notes could be repaid, because all church's operations were losing money and there was evidence that annual giving would probably decline because of shaken confidence in Mr. Wood.
Similarly, the prospects of obtaining the $98 million Knapp bequest, in the near term, had been all but eliminated by a legal challenge to the church's claim by the alternative benefactees, Stanford University and the Los Angeles Art Museum. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for May 27.
Some critics of Mr. Wood feared that the board would borrow more from the pension fund, sell church property, or take some other step to raise money to support the Monitor Channel.
Indeed, a longtime Christian Scientist who opposed Mr. Wood said last week that she was prepared for the church "to go over the falls in a barrel" financially. She said that she and others of like mind would then try to pick up the pieces.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Backs Deal By Milken

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Winning the right to review some financial data in the deal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reversed course yesterday and agreed to support a plan allowing Michael R. Milken, along with hundreds of other former executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Drexel's insurers, to put up $1.3 billion to settle all civil litigation against them.
Although the basic economic terms of the settlement were not changed, the F.D.I.C. will now be allowed to review some information about the net worth of Mr. Milken and some of the other executives. 
 The F.D.I.C. had accused Mr. Milken of having persuaded savings and loan institutions to buy high-risk junk bonds with federally insured deposits. Under the terms of the settlement, the F.D.I.C. will drop all claims against Mr. Milken. In exchange, the F.D.I.C. will share roughly $500 million of the settlement with the Resolution Trust Corporation, a Federal agency that also oversees the savings and loan industry and that has favored the settlement from the outset.
 
Earlier Criticism
 The outcome, which clears the way for the deal to go forward, seemed remote just last Thursday, when the F.D.I.C. rejected it in response to criticism from Congress and other regulators that Mr. Milken was getting too sweet a deal.
The settlement is expected to leave Mr. Milken and his family with a personal fortune of $500 million, after deducting the $500 million he has agreed to pay in the current settlement. The payment would be in addition to $400 million Mr. Milken previously set aside in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Since the terms of the deal that the F.D.I.C. rejected last week would not have forced Mr. Milken or the other defendants to disclose much about their private net worths to the Federal regulators, the agency believed it would have been hard pressed to defend itself against its critics.
 
A Symbolic Debate
 Indeed, the debate over whether to take the $500 million or gamble on extracting more from Mr. Milken sometime in the future by going to trial became a symbol of the struggle between good politics and good business. On one side was the R.T.C., whose chief executive, Albert V. Casey, a former chairman of American Airlines, favored the deal for its pragmatism. On the other side was the F.D.I.C., whose chairman, William Taylor, a man who has spent most of his career in government service, seemed more concerned about the appearance that his agency was being lenient on a white-collar criminal.
What ultimately secured the F.D.I.C.'s cooperation was Mr. Milken's new willingness to allow Mr. Casey, Mr. Taylor and Melvyn Weiss, a lawyer representing investors who claimed they were hurt in Drexel's deals, to see information about Mr. Milken's net worth -- information that has already been shown confidentially to Federal District Court Judge Milton Pollack. Judge Pollack will be able to determine the conditions under which the three men will be allowed to see the information.
As for the roughly 200 other Drexel executives who are part of the settlement, their individual contributions to the deal will also be made known to the regulators. In addition, about 40 of the executives who had been named by the two agencies in lawsuits will have to make some limited disclosure about their wealth, also at Judge Pollack's discretion.
The two agencies can then back out of the agreement if they do not like what they are shown, though lawyers involved in the deal do not expect that to happen. "This is not going to be a long, drawn-out process," said Ira M. Millstein, a lawyer for Drexel.
 
Concerns in Washington
 Given that Judge Pollack has so far seemed reluctant to disseminate widely the information on the executives' net worth, the compromise is already a cause of concern for some Washington lawmakers.
"I'm pleased that the F.D.I.C. will now get more detailed information about the true financial wealth of Michael Milken and his cronies," said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts.
"However, it is difficult to understand why the parties were so quickly pushed into making a settlement without all the facts," Mr. Kennedy said. "It appears that the judge has pressed the parties to put the cart before the horse. I worry that it will be very hard to reopen this deal if the F.D.I.C. finds that Milken and his associates misrepresented their true wealth."
With the deal's last hurdle out of the way, Judge Pollack indicated yesterday in a court hearing in Manhattan that he intended to approve the settlement for a combination of "economic, practical and legal reasons," chief among them that the agreement would greatly increase the amounts that Drexel's many creditors would recover.
They, along with the investors who have sued Drexel and Mr. Milken, stand to share the $800 million of the settlement proceeds that do not go to the Government.
Still, some in the courthouse found the conclusion unsatisfying, since it left open the question of whether Mr. Milken bore any responsibility for the savings and loan crisis. Within hours of the deal's being put back on track, Mr. Milken's spokesman, Kenneth Lerer, had released a statement attempting to clear his client's name in the matter.
"It's obviously very difficult to pay this sum of money when these claims have no merit," Mr. Lerer said. "But Michael wants to get on with his life, and this settlement is a step in that direction. Michael and his lawyers are confident that had these suits gone to trial, no jury would have found him responsible for the losses sustained by the S.& L.'s."
Asked whether the public might have been better served by a trial that could have resolved the question of Mr. Milken's guilt, Thomas D. Barr, one of the attorneys representing the Federal regulators, said the purpose of litigation was not to satisfy curiosity. "This may be a hot issue in Washington," he said. "But the settlement agreement is about a lot of people all over the U.S."
In a further step that should allow Drexel to put the debris of the junk-bond era behind it, Federal Bankruptcy Judge Francis Conrad yesterday ratified the plan that Drexel had submitted last week to pay off its creditors and emerge from bankruptcy as the New Street Capital Corporation. New Street is expected to begin operating by late April.

HEADLINE: Two Trump Bankruptcies

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, March 9

 BODY:
Two of Donald J. Trump's financially troubled casinos filed for bankruptcy today seeking court permission to go forward with a debt restructuring already approved by the bulk of the casinos' bondholders.
By gaining advance approval from at least two-thirds of the bondholders, the casinos were able to file a "pre-packaged" bankruptcy petition that could avert long and costly stints in Federal bankruptcy court. 
 Under the Trump's Castle plan, Mr. Trump would give bondholders half the casino's equity in exchange for lower interest rates on $288 million in bonds.
The Trump Plaza plan restructures $250 million in debt but does not relinquish any equity because the casino is not in default. Mr. Trump has missed two interest payments to Castle bondholders.
Mr. Trump's other Atlantic City casino, Trump Taj Mahal, emerged from bankruptcy court last year with a prepackaged plan similar to that proposed for Trump's Castle.

HEADLINE: Menachem Begin, Guerrilla Leader Who Became Peacemaker

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister who made peace with Egypt, lived much of his life in the opposition. A Jewish underground leader before Israel gained independence in 1948, he openly fought the established Zionist leadership of the struggle against British rule.
Then for nearly three decades, he headed Israel's major opposition party. 
 Ultimately and to many Israelis, surprisingly, his minority bloc ousted the Labor Party, which had governed continuously in the three decades since statehood, and Mr. Begin, as party leader, became Prime Minister. He was to govern an ever more divided and troubled nation.
Mr. Begin, who led Israel from May 1977 until he resigned as Prime Minister in 1983, stretched the national mood from great pride to deep dismay. He guided the nation to a peace treaty with Egypt, the first such pact with an Arab country. But he also presided over a bitterly divisive war against Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon.
If the treaty with Egypt, which brought Mr. Begin a shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize with President Anwar el-Sadat, represented a high point in his political leadership, the war in Lebanon in 1982 and the stalemate that followed, with its steady toll of dead and wounded, were its low point.
Started with the announced aim of evicting Palestinian guerrillas from operating too close to Israel's border with Lebanon, it brought Israeli troops to the outskirts of Beirut. It enmeshed Israel in the lethal sectarian politics of Lebanon, and led to a costly and indecisive occupation.
The invasion in June 1982 was seen by Israelis at first as a justified response to years of border harassment. But when the Israelis advanced to the outskirts of Beirut and bombed and shelled the Lebanese capital for 10 weeks, criticism and anguish arose.
 
Massacres at Camps Deeply Affect Israelis
 Dissent reached a peak in the fall of 1982, when Lebanese Christian militia units entered Palestinian refugee districts at Sabra and Shatila that were supposedly under Israeli guard and killed hundreds of people.
The massacre led to an independent investigation ordered by the Israeli Government, which concluded that Israeli troops watched the killing from a distance and did nothing to stop it. Mr. Begin survived in office, but was shaken politically.
His medical problems -- he had suffered three heart attacks -- became an increasing burden. And in November 1982, his wife of 43 years, Aliza, died while he was on a trip to the United States. Thereafter, Mr. Begin became increasingly listless, participating little in debate in Parliament, taking less and less interest in politics and limiting his public appearances. On Aug. 28, 1983, he announced that he planned to quit and on Sept. 15 he formally resigned as Prime Minister.
Mr. Begin became something of a recluse. He lived with his daughter Leah in an apartment near the Jerusalem residence of his son, Benjamin, now a member of the Israeli Parliament and a leader in the Likud Party.
He was rarely seen in public and left his house only for rare visits to a hospital and memorial services for his wife. Yehiel Kadishai, a close friend and longtime adviser, visited daily and enabled Mr. Begin to keep up with correspondence. Mr. Begin also received visits from a small circle of friends.
When he became Prime Minister, Mr. Begin represented both political and stylistic change. He brought a new demeanor to the Prime Minister's office with his remote manner, a sharp contrast to the earthy and informal style of his Labor Party predecessors. Unlike the bulk of Israeli politicians, he was seldom seen other than in suit and tie.
 
Land and Ideology; Legacy and Withdrawal
 And he moved the country in a distinctly different ideological direction. Hours after his election victory, he visited an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, which had been captured in the 1967 war, declaring it part of "liberated Israel." Labor Governments had avoided such declarations, but to Mr. Begin the West Bank was Judea and Samaria, Jewish land from biblical times.
His Government did not formally annex the West Bank, as it did the Golan Heights, a Syrian promontory captured in 1967 after its long use as a base for shelling northern Israel. But under Mr. Begin, the West Bank began to be heavily settled by Israelis.
He was also to return some Arab land taken in battle, a strip of Syrian territory won in 1973 and a town on the Golan Heights taken in 1967.
But the most significant territorial withdrawal, and for Mr. Begin the most personally wrenching, was in the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel returned to Egypt in three stages from 1979 through 1982. Jewish settlements in Sinai were abandoned despite intense protest by their residents.
The Sinai withdrawal was the last stage of a process that began with Mr. Sadat's landmark visit to Jerusalem in November 1977, six months after Mr. Begin took office.
The Egyptian President, frustrated by the intransigence of Arab neighbors in the dealing with Israel, had hinted that he was prepared to go it alone in seeking peace and had said he would even travel to even Jerusalem, in pursuit of that goal. Mr. Begin responded with an invitation.
On a warm November evening, the wheels of the presidential aircraft, Egypt 01, touched down at Ben-Gurion International Airport. Mr. Begin stepped forward and said: "I am waiting for you, Mr. President, and all the ministers are waiting for you."
Sixteen months of arduous negotiations followed, including the marathon talks at Camp David, Md., with the intercession of President Jimmy Carter. The process culminated in the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty signed in Washington on March 26, 1979.
But Mr. Begin's wariness toward the Arabs, on behalf of what he considered Israel's vital security interests, remained undiminished. In June 1981, he ordered the bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad. This was followed in July by two weeks of bombing in Lebanon.
In December, he pushed through Parliament a measure to annex the Golan Heights. This drew sharp criticism from Washington and other capitals, but Mr. Begin held his ground. His relations with the United States included many other difficult moments. When the Reagan Administration suspended a strategic cooperation pact with Israel and imposed financial sanctions because of the Golan annexation, Mr. Begin said Israel was being treated like a "vassal state."
His relations with Egypt also changed. After Mr. Sadat was shot to death by Muslim extremists in October 1981, his successor, President Hosni Mubarak, seemed determined to calm the hostility toward Egypt in the rest of the Arab world because of its peace treaty with Israel. Relations between Egypt and Israel cooled, especially after the invasion of Lebanon the following year.
The 1977 visit to Jerusalem by Mr. Sadat and the subsequent treaty gave Mr. Begin one of the great satisfactions of his career. He explained his feelings in a forceful and eloquent speech in Parliament that also addressed deeper concerns.
"Why is this peace treaty so important?" he asked. "This is the first peace treaty Israel ever signed, the first peace treaty after five wars in which we have lost 12,000 of our people. Our aim, our yearning and our dream is to smash this helix of hatred. We must sign this treaty because it is a human act of the highest degree."
At the White House signing, Mr. Begin said it was "the third greatest day of my life" -- after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the unification of Jerusalem in the 1967 war.
The Israeli leader was seeking to place the signing into the historical context of his life, a life that until 1977 had been spent almost entirely in opposition -- to the mainstream of Jews in his native Poland, to both the German and Russian invaders of his homeland in World War II, to the established leaders of the Jewish military struggle against British rule in Palestine and to the decades of Labor Party government in Israel.
 
A Zionism Forged By Bible and Holocaust
 He believed fiercely, and contentiously, that the Jews had a right to a national homeland and that it should range over the land of their biblical forebears. This was Zion and he was a dedicated Zionist, if a follower of the Zionist Revisionist organization founded by Vladimir Jabotinsky.
Mr. Begin was marked forever by the Holocaust, which had wiped out all vestiges of his former life in Poland. The pursuit of those goals was a thread that ran through his life. He was to he spend much time explaining and trying to justify what some considered extreme actions and statements.
The best-known of those occurred in 1946, when Irgun Zvai Leumi, the underground terrorist faction he headed during the final years of the British mandate in Palestine, blew up a wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the headquarters of the British administrators of Palestine. The attack killed 90 people, among them Jewish and Arab employees as well as British officials.
The most infamous incident was the Irgun's attack on an Arab village, Deir Yassin, in April 1948, in which more than 200 men, women and children were killed.
Two months after that assault, the freighter Altalena, loaded with arms and ammunition and 900 men recruited by the Irgun, came under fire from regular Jewish forces loyal to David Ben-Gurion, by then Prime Minister, who feared that the new Government of Israel might be overthrown or that civil war might break out after the fight against the Arabs was over.
Another, and sometimes rival underground faction, the Stern Gang, was headed by Yitzhak Shamir, who would in time become Mr. Begin's Foreign Minister, and Prime Minister on his resignation.
Mr. Begin struggled fiercely against Mr. Ben-Gurion, the mainstream Zionist leader and head of the regular Jewish force in the fight for nationhood. After independence in 1948, Mr. Ben-Gurion became Israel's first Prime Minister, and their conflict exploded frequently.
 
From Coalition To Opposition
 From 1967 to 1970, Mr. Begin served in a war coalition, then withdrew when Israel began to consider an American proposal that would have linked withdrawal from the occupied territories with peace. In August 1970 he returned to the political opposition.
Mr. Begin, a brilliant speaker and writer, was also an enigma: often soft-spoken, mild- mannered and personable. Yet this slight but firmly built man, who dressed in gray and never lost the hand-kissing tradition of his early years in Poland, was described as having the flinty looks of a movie terrorist.
There was no doubt about his dramatic flair. Once during a speech in the immigrant quarter of Jerusalem, he began to describe the "guarantees" for Israel that were being offered by American diplomats seeking to encourage Arab negotiations. His voice rose and his manner grew intense. He pointed higher and higher, as if searching for something, until he had everyone looking skyward.
"Guarantees, guarantees -- maybe there you will find guarantees," he said, adding, as he pointed to the ground, "Not here!"
Early in 1977, with the Labor Government riddled by dissension and tainted, in the view of some, by corruption, Mr. Begin finally achieved the political recognition that had so long eluded him. Though weary from a heart attack two months before the election, he emerged with an upset victory and was asked to form a government.
Several things brought about his victory: The Labor Party had become increasingly identified with worsening inflation, frequent strikes and a stagnant economy. Its scandals led to the creation of the Democratic Movement for Change, which drew a valuable 15 seats of 120 from Labor in the election, and briefly joined the new Likud coalition.
In addition, a "second Israel" of Jews from North Africa and the Middle East, the poor of the cities and new towns, had grown to become the nation's majority, and these people were attracted to Mr. Begin. Despite his European origin, they felt that he, too, had been outside the establishment, and he promised greater militancy toward the Arabs.
Mr. Begin retained power in 1981 after his right-wing Likud bloc emerged with a one-seat lead over the Labor alignment of Shimon Peres. His margin of success came from the religious parties, which enabled him to form a fragile governing coalition.
 
The Old Country Proved a Cruel Home
 Menachem Wolfovitch Begin was born on Aug. 30, 1913, in Brest, when it was still part of the czarist Russian Empire. The area was returned to Poland in 1921, occupied by the Soviet Union in 1939 soon after Hitler's attack on Poland, overrun by the Nazis after Hitler turned on Stalin and attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, and ceded to Moscow in 1945.
Zionism was central to Mr. Begin's childhood. His father, Dov Zeev Begin, had been educated in Berlin and traveled widely for his father, a timber merchant. Dov Begin's travels brought him into contact with Jewish nationalists, the Zionist "heretics," as they were called by the traditionally minded.
Menachem, the youngest of three children, developed an early interest in oratory and made his first speech at the age of 10, in a mixture of Hebrew and Yiddish.
At 15 he joined Betar, the Zionist Revisionists' youth movement, and was trained in the use of weapons. Ten years later, with a law degree from Warsaw University, he headed Betar, which by then had 70,000 members in 600 Polish communities.
"My friends and I labored to educate a generation to be prepared not only to toil for the rebuilding of a Jewish state but also to fight for it, suffer for it and, if needs be, die for it," he said, paraphrasing Jabotinsky.
Mr. Begin fled from Warsaw ahead of the advancing Germans in 1939 and was in Polish-controlled Vilna in 1940 when the Russians occupied the city, now Vilnius, Lithuania. He obtained a visa to go to Palestine but gave it to a friend he thought would have more trouble.
The Russians soon arrested him, accusing him of being a Zionist and a British agent, and sent him to Siberia. His wife, whom he had married a year earlier, went on to Palestine, convinced that she could do nothing to help her husband. Later, she became quietly influential in his political life while remaining out of the limelight. Besides their son, Benjamin, they had two other children -- Hasia and Leah -- and eight grandchildren.
In later years Mr. Begin recalled the interrogations of his Siberian incarceration. They turned on the Russian Revolution, on Britain and Zionism, on Herzl and Jabotinsky.
"From my early youth," Mr. Begin said later, "I had been taught by my father, who went to his death at Nazi hands voicing his faith in God and singing 'Hatikvah,' that we Jews were to return to the land of Israel -- not go, travel or come, but return."
It was a tenet that was to sustain him throughout his life. Nearly four decades later, visiting a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, he would chide reporters for calling the area occupied ("These are liberated territories"), for asking if they would be annexed ("You annex foreign land, not your own country"), and for references to the West Bank ("Say Judea and Samaria," the territories' biblical names).
Though sentenced to eight years in a labor camp, he was released by the Soviet Union in 1941 in an agreement with the Polish government-in-exile that freed 1.5 million Poles. Mr. Begin found his sister, the family's only other survivor, then joined the Free Polish Army. That took him to Iran and to Palestine.
Having learned English by listening to the BBC, he served in the British Army in Palestine as a conscripted interpreter until the end of 1943. Then he took over the leadership of the Irgun underground in the battle for a Zionist homeland.
 
Wanted by British With a $50,000 Bounty
 By 1946 the British authorities were conducting an intensive hunt for the man they described as the "grim-faced, bespectacled Menachem Begin," placing a price of $8,000 on his head. Later, it was raised to $50,000.
The Irgun, often working with weapons and explosives purchased from the Arabs, set about breaking the grip of colonial rule. Mr. Begin, in his book "The Revolt," explained the group's actions this way:
"The arrest of British officers in order to secure the annulment of a death 'sentence,' the arrest of more officers which did not prevent the murder of our captive comrades, the whipping of officers in retaliation for the whipping of our young soldiers, hangings in retaliation for hangings."
In the first elections for Parliament, in January 1949, Mapai, the Labor Party, emerged with 44 seats; the left-wing Mapam won 15, the religious bloc, 16, and Mr. Begin's Herut Party, 14.
Leading the opposition, Mr. Begin called for retaliatory raids against Arab irregulars. He fought bitterly against ties with West Germany and was suspended from Parliament for organizing demonstrations.
He was forever demanding apologies in Parliament and being asked to apologize in turn, sometimes for personal remarks and sometimes for policy statements. He would demand preventive war, for example, only to hear an opponent say that "anyone who does so is a criminal against the Jewish nation." A policy dispute would become personal.
By the time of the 1956 war with Egypt, Mr. Begin's party was the second strongest. With the Israeli move into Sinai, the party lost much of the stigma of extremism, for the war was viewed by many Israelis as the expression of a policy long advocated by Herut.
In 1973, Mr. Begin broke an embargo on domestic criticism of the Government's action in failing to accurately gauge Arab intentions leading to the war. The Arab attack on Yom Kippur, he said, only underscored the need to retain occupied territories.
He resisted every pullback agreement, and in 1975 derided Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger for "telling us to trade territory for legitimacy."
"We don't need legitimacy," Mr. Begin said. "We exist. Therefore we are legitimate."
Although Mr. Begin did in time exchange territory, giving up the Sinai and withdrawing Jewish settlements in return for peace with Egypt, he began as Prime Minister with familiar militancy. He visited a West Bank settlement, Elon Moreh, the day after the 1977 election and declared: "We stand on the land of liberated Israel. There will be many Elon Morehs. There will be many, many settlements in the coming weeks."
In supporting the establishment of West Bank settlements, Mr. Begin made a distinction between those in territory within biblical Israel and those outside, like in Sinai.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Begin became somewhat less outspoken and dramatic, learning to accept the necessary compromises of governing. He drew former opponents into the Cabinet: Moshe Dayan, Defense Minister in Labor Cabinets, became his Foreign Minister, only to resign in October 1979 over relations with the Arabs.
 
Bitter and Painful Years: Lebanon, Wife's Death
 In the 1950's, Mr. Begin had called "every German a Nazi, every German a murderer," but as Prime Minister he congratulated the West Germans for freeing a hijacked Lufthansa airliner in Mogadishu, Somalia, and he met with the West German Ambassador.
Politically, he survived a challenge from the Labor Party a year after he took office. He suffered from diabetes as well as a heart ailment, and there were rumors as early as mid-1979, vigorously denied, that he was working on a reduced schedule. There were calls in Parliament for his resignation, but none was successful and he survived many votes of confidence.
While Israel under Mr. Begin returned the Sinai to Egypt, it seemed to strengthen its hold on the other occupied territories -- principally, the West Bank and the Golan Heights -- through the establishment of the settlements. The first settlements, similar to those under Labor Governments, were isolated defense posts, with armed farmers tilling fields. Later settlements were built nearer Arab towns, and then within them, such as in Hebron. By 1982, about 30,000 Israelis lived on more than 100 such settlements. New highways encouraged commuting from prefabricated towns to jobs in Tel Aviv.
Israel, under Mr. Begin, changed the unit of currency from the pound, a vestige of British rule, to the shekel, a coin used by the ancient Hebrews. And Parliament, under his leadership, formally declared all of Jerusalem, a city divided into Jewish and Arab sectors before the 1967 war, to be the nation's undivided and eternal capital -- an act that was not recognized by most other countries.
Mr. Begin's party was narrowly returned to power in 1981 in an election campaign marked by violence, the first such for Israel. The confrontations often pitted Sephardim, the Jews from the Arab lands who identified with Mr. Begin, against the formerly governing Ashkenazim, those from Europe. These clashes, especially disruptive during the Lebanon war, bespoke a rift in Israel that was to deepen, and would come to fundamentally demark Israeli politics and society.
Lebanon was Mr. Begin's last war, perhaps the most bitter one for him, and the election his last as well.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media
One Campaign That Stumbles to Success, Another That Seldom Stumbles;
For Tsongas Camp, Things Go Right 'Now and Then'

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., March 9

 BODY:
For the Tsongas campaign, today was an exception.
The weather was postcard perfect as a Dixieland band played for hundreds of eager supporters who turned out for the candidate at an outdoor rally here. American flags made a colorful backdrop next to the green-and-white Tsongas placards. 
 The candidate was on. People laughed at his quips and cheered his message about leading the nation out of economic hardship.
But as this slapdash campaign pushes toward the Super Tuesday contests, things rarely go this well.
Catapulted out of New Hampshire three weeks ago with a victory there, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts found himself with virtually no organizations in the 11 states that hold primaries or caucuses on Tuesday: no staff to plan events or to sign up volunteers.
 
A Rally That Wasn't
 In the last several days Mr. Tsongas has often been met by lackluster crowds in places that hardly make great pictures on the evening news. The biggest embarrassment was Saturday, when the candidate appeared at a park in the poor Overtown section of Miami for his big event of the day. Only a handful of spectators showed up for what was billed as a rally, and they were outnumbered several times over by reporters and television crews. Mr. Tsongas cut short his speech and quickly moved on.
So today's rally here was good reason for Ed Jesser, the Tsongas communications director, to savor the moment. "I'd like to see one of these every day," he said. But he acknowedged such successes happen only "every now and then."
That his campaign is still in the netherworld between a guerrilla operation and a full-fledged national effort is so obvious that even Mr. Tsongas readily admits the problem.
"I acknowledge that we're not as smooth as we should be, but hopefully it will all work out," he said. "In whole regions of this country we were financially strapped, just trying to stay alive in New Hampshire, and others were traveling around the country and had the advantage."
With little alternative, Mr. Tsongas has sought to turn the deficiencies into a virtue by portraying the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas as a political behemoth. "It's the machine versus the message," Mr. Tsongas said. "I'm the candidate of message. He's the candidate of machine."
But it is with envy and fear that Tsongas aides describe the Clinton organization. "At every level of organization, his campaign is far superior to ours: in money, supporters, time on the ground," Mr. Jesser said. "He's got people everywhere."
Robert Schroth has not lived in Florida since 1982, but came to the state less than two weeks ago from Washington to run the Tsongas campaign here. He is clearly overwhelmed.
"Under siege," is how he puts it. "It puts us at an extraordinary disadvantage among the groups that can be organized in this state -- the black vote, the condominium vote," he said. "What you can do is touch as many people as you can with your message through the airwaves."
The goal is for a memorable tidbit from the candidate's speech, against a picturesque made-for-television setting, to land on the evening news. So Mr. Tsongas and his entourage have been flitting from state to state on his chartered plane, looking for opportunities to get on television.
The Tsongas campaign usually has no more than three big events a day, about half that of the Clinton campaign. Mr. Tsongas's relatively light schedule is a reflection not only of his organization, but also of a candidate who likes to travel at his own pace.
Sometimes the scheduling is curious. On Thursday, Tsongas aides were still debating whether to head to Florida for a day of campaigning or to detour to Phoenix, where he was told his appearance could put him over the top in Arizona's caucuses on Saturday. Mr. Tsongas went to Phoenix, skipping nearly a whole day of campaigning in Florida, where 148 delegates are at stake, compared to 41 in Arizona.
The candidate said his decision was vindicated when he won in Arizona, getting 34 percent of the vote to 29 percent for Mr. Clinton. Mr. Tsongas said his stop in Phoenix "made the difference between winning and losing." But some aides say they are awaiting the outcome in Florida before making an assessment.
He plans to break tradition by spending Tuesday night in his hometown, Lowell, Mass. Typically, a candidate would head straight that night for Michigan or Illinois, to begin campaigning in next week's battleground.
"All I can say," said Peggy Connelly, a Tsongas aide, exasperated from all the questions about why the campaign is going to Lowell, "is that from Day 1 this campaign has been unconventional."

Tsongas's victory in the New Hampshire primary, the former Massachusetts Senator's campaign has received closer scrunity, and he admits, "we're not as smooth as we should be."

HEADLINE: Panel Approves Compromise in Wage Bill

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 9

 BODY:
The Republican-controlled Assembly Labor Committee voted today to send to the full Assembly an amended bill that would reduce by half a planned 80-cent-an-hour increase but would still make New Jersey's minimum wage among the highest in the nation.
The Republican plan would increase the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour on April 1 and add an additional 40 cents an hour a year later. The compromise, which was approved after six hours of debate, displeased both proponents and opponents of the original bill, which would have raised the minimum to $5.05 on April 1. 
 Hours before the committee vote, the Assembly's Democratic minority attacked a Republican effort to eliminate all of the increase as "a callous affront to the working men and women of New Jersey" and vowed to resist any compromise.
In 1990, the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved with bipartisan support the bill to increase the minimum incrementally, to reach $5.05 an hour April 1. But the Republicans who became the majority on Jan. 14 said said they feared the higher minimum wage would drive businesses from New Jersey.
The Federal minimum wage is $4.25 an hour. A $5.05 rate would make New Jersey's minimum wage the second-highest in the nation. Only Washington, where the minimum wage ranges up to $5.25, has a higher rate, said a spokeswoman for the United States Department of Labor.
The Republicans have the votes to pass the legislation and override any veto by Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat. But constitutionally, the Governor has 45 days to decide whether to sign or veto the bill. Waiting the full 45 days would allow the 80-cent increase to take effect April 1, and the Republicans would end up in the unsavory position of trying to take the increase back.
"It seems like the Republicans haven't figured out the 45-day game," said the Assembly Democratic Leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. "They're going to have to ask the people to give back what they already have."
The Republicans ran into a similar problem last month when the Legislature passed a bill to postpone school elections from April 6 to April 27. The Republicans said they wanted the delay to look for cuts in Mr. Florio's budget proposal. But the 45-day window means the elections could take place as originally scheduled; all the governor has to do is delay acting. That could put the Republicans in the unpopular position of having to take back money from the schools.
 
Making Political Hay
 The Democrats tried today to capitalize on the Republicans' stumble, painting their political opponents as enemies of the working class and attacking the Republican plan to roll back the sales tax from 7 to 6 percent.
"The Republicans contend that New Jersey will emerge from the recession if the people get a few extra pennies a day in their pockets," said Wayne R. Bryant, the Deputy Democratic Leader. Mr. Bryant, who joined Mr. Doria at a morning news conference, held a penny in one hand and in the other waved $30, which he said represented the money a worker earning minimum wage would lose each month if the Republican legislation is approved.
"The Republicans are shortsighted by ignoring the benefits of the higher minimum wage," he said. "They are also callous by suggesting that a paltry raise for people earning sub-poverty wages will doom the economy."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Note and Bond Rally Continues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Treasury notes and bonds yesterday continued the rally that began Friday as investors and speculators seemed to have decided that the sharp increase in yields on those securities the last two months has made them much more attractive.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 5 3/8 percent two year notes were offered at 99 3/4, up 7/32 on the day, to yield 5.51 percent. As recently as last week, two-year notes were yielding 5.65 percent, up from 4.62 percent on Jan. 8. 
 The move to higher prices and lower yields on short-term notes also helped raise prices of longer-term issues. The 6 3/4 percent Treasury notes due in five years, for example, rose 14/32, closing at a price of 100 1/32, to yield 6.74 percent.
In the long-term bond market, the bellwether 8 percent issue due in 2021 was offered at 101 1/2, up 22/32, to yield 7.87 percent, down from 7.92 percent late Friday. The yield on long-term bonds was as low as 7.38 percent on Jan. 8.
"I think people decided that enough was enough," said Robert Sbarra, head trader at Carrol McIntee & McGinley, a securities firm. "The market had overreacted the past few months to worries about increases in the budget deficit and the supply of Treasury securities."
The latest reminder of how low short-term interest rates remain came at yesterday's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills. The three-month issue sold with an average rate of 4.02 percent, unchanged from a week ago, while the six-month issue was 4.14 percent, up from 4.10 percent last week.
 
30-Day Commercial Paper
 Elsewhere in the short-term market, 30-day commercial paper of high-quality companies was about 4.25 percent, unchanged from Friday.
For many individual investors, not able to afford the $10,000 minimum for Treasury bills or the million-dollar minimums for commercial paper, yields on short-term investments are well below 4 percent. Money market mutual funds, which lost $12.8 billion in assets last week as investors shifted funds to the stock and bond markets, are yielding about 3.83 percent, according to IBC Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Bank money market deposit accounts are even lower, with a national average of about 3.70 percent, according to the Donoghue report issued last week.
In the municipal market, traders said yields of New York State general obligation bonds did not change much after the Standard & Poor's Corporation issued a negative report about the state's finances. Although the rating agency kept the bond rating unchanged at A-, it said "the rating outlook is negative" because of the failure of legislative and executive leaders to solve the state's financial problems, and because of the state's weak economy.
Standard & Poor's reduced the city's bond rating to A- from A in mid-January. Moody's Investors Service, the other major rating agency for local governments, reduced its rating on New York State bonds to A from A-1 in mid-1990.
In advance of New York State's offering of $220.6 million of new general obligation bonds today, which are backed by the state's full faith and credit, securities dealers said they expect bonds due in five years to be offered with yields of about 5.75 percent, with bonds due in 10 years yielding slightly less than 6.50 percent. For bonds due in 2022, they expect a yeild of about 7 percent.
The yields on the state bonds are far lower than those offered last week by New York City, which offered a 6.90 percent yield on five-year bond and 7.75 percent on bonds due in 2012. The state bonds carry lower yields, analysts said, because the ratings of the state are higher and it issues fewer bonds than the city.
In other financing activity, the New York State Thruway Authority offered $155.3 million of bonds backed by highway revenues and an outside insurance policy with a top yield of 6.15 percent for bonds due in 2002. Yields were far lower than on New York City or New York State issues because the bonds are insured by Financial Security Assurance, a bond rating firm, and were triple A-rated.
 
Investors Wait for New Issues
 In the corporate market, investors are waiting for offerings of several new issues of preferred stock, amid some confusion about what is the appropriate yield for such issues and which issues will come to market first. Shortly before 10 A.M. yesterday, underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company began telling investors that an unusual $100 million financing for the Bankers Trust New York Corporation might be offered with a dividend yield of 8.50 percent. The confusion arose when, two hours later, Morgan Stanley & Company began telling investors it might offer its own $100 million issue of ordinary preferred stock for a significantly higher yield of 8.875 percent
To futher complicate matters, a $100 million issue of preferred for Banco Santander, a Spanish bank, is waiting in the wings with a maximum yield set by the bank of 8.70 percent.
Although Bankers Trust has an A+ rating from Standard & Poor's that is better than the A- rating on the Morgan Stanley issue, analysts said the rating differential was too small to explain the difference in yields suggested by underwriters. Both Bankers Trust and Morgan Stanley were rated A-1 by Moody's.
The Bankers Trust offering would be the first-ever offering of preferred purchase units, where the company issues $100 million of 6 1/2 percent notes, which the holder is obligated to convert into preferred stock after three years. Although Bankers Trust does not have any pressing need for additional capital at the moment, the security is a way to raise the capital at today's attractive rates. For three years, Bankers Trust will be able to deduct its interest payments on the notes as an expense.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
White House 'Funnel' Directs Aid To States With Primaries Nearing

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The favors that President Bush dispensed as he campaigned throughout the South last week were a result of a formal, systematic effort to coordinate the policies and actions of the Federal Government with the political operations of the President's re-election campaign, say Administration officials and campaign workers.
A small group of White House officials, closely supervised by Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, transmits requests from the campaign to Government agencies. This arrangement is known as "the funnel."
 
Criticism From Challengers
 The benefits of incumbency are not new to office holders, from Presidents to mayors. And in most instances, there is nothing illegal about the use of government largess for political purposes. At the national level, chief executives of both parties have long exploited the powers of the Presidency in election years. 
 Still, the political use of Government grants has drawn sharp criticism from Mr. Bush's Republican challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, and from Democrats in Congress.
In this instance, top officials from the campaign and the Administration hold daily meetings to coordinate their efforts. Among those who attend are Mr. Skinner and his deputy, W. Henson Moore; Frederic V. Malek, the manager of Mr. Bush's campaign; Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman; Katherine Super, director of Presidential scheduling; Edith E. Holiday, secretary of Mr. Bush's Cabinet, and William Kristol, chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle.
Each Government agency has a "campaign contact," a Federal employee who can supply information to the campaign and arrange political speeches and travel by agency officials. Likewise, the White House has agencies review campaign literature for accuracy and consistency with official Administration positions.
Mr. Bush boasts about the fruits of such cooperation, which include Federal money and regulatory actions intended to please voters in politically important states.
Last Thursday officials from the Army Corps of Engineers told Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida that they would agree to help finance a project to restore the natural course of the Kissimmee River, which in the 1970's was diverted into a canal with untold damage to fish and wildlife. Governor Chiles, a Democrat, hailed the agreement as "a tremendous breakthrough in the 20-year effort" to protect the Everglades and rivers feeding into it.
Debby Kilmer, director of the Washington office for the State of Florida, said: "I don't think it's coincidence that it happened this week. The Administration wanted to help Florida, and this is a major issue in the state."
Florida holds primary elections on Tuesday.
Likewise, in a campaign trip through Southern California last month, Mr. Bush announced $800 million worth of road improvements, sewage treatment projects and other public works to promote economic development along the Mexican border.
Mr. Malek, the Bush campaign manager, knows the benefits and risks of using Federal money to win support for a President's re-election. As an aide to President Richard M. Nixon 20 years ago, Mr. Malek devised a program to improve the Government's "responsiveness" by directing Federal grants and other benefits to important constituencies. Mr. Malek later said that the program, exposed in investigations of the Watergate scandal, was a mistake because it left an impression of impropriety.
 
Standards of Conduct
 In an effort to prevent embarrassment and abuse this year, the Bush-Quayle campaign requires campaign workers to sign standards of conduct. One provision says campaign workers "shall not initiate communications with the White House or any Federal official or employee on behalf of the campaign for any purpose unless specifically authorized to do so by a member of the senior staff after securing legal clearance."
Such contacts are supposed to go through the White House funnel. At the neck of the funnel are Mr. Skinner and Ms. Holiday, who serves as chief liaison to the campaign.
The "campaign contact" at each department is a senior official, usually an assistant secretary, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Such officials are generally exempt from the Hatch Act, the 1939 law that limits the political activities of Federal employees.
Federal auditors say it is difficult to prove a violation of the law when the money is being used simultaneously for some purpose authorized by Congress.
Administration officials say the dispensing of favors by the White House in the last two months does not reflect an effort to buy votes; rather, they prefer to describe it as an effort to create a politically congenial environment for the President in an election year.
"I've got to brag about something, and you're darn right I'm going to brag about the highway bill and all the jobs that go with it," Mr. Bush said after engineering a windfall of Federal aid for New Hampshire last month.
 
Is It Appropriate?
 Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said recent decisions by the Small Business Administration appeared to be "politically inspired." But Patricia Saiki, head of the agency, insisted the decisions, including new loan guarantees for small businesses, were a response to the recession, not to the political calendar.
David M. Ifshin, general counsel for the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democratic candidate for President, said, "It is hard to define the line between what's appropriate and what's inappropriate in the use and timing of Government grants."
It is difficult to show how politics influenced a particular decision because "the mechanisms of investigation are in the hands of the executive branch itself," said Mr. Ifshin, who also served as general counsel for Walter F. Mondale's Presidential campaign in 1984.
The Federal Election Commission has issued detailed rules requiring campaign committees to pay for campaign-related travel by public officials. But the rules give no indication of how much interaction is allowed between a campaign and the Government.
Roger M. Witten, an expert on election law who advises Common Cause, the citizens' lobby, argued, "The standards require an exercise of judgment and are subject to abuse, given the incentives to conserve campaign dollars by substituting Government money when that can arguably be justified."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Assessment;
Eyeing November, Democrats Shiver

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 9

 BODY:
Despite all the partisan hullabaloo leading up to Super Tuesday, all the proclamations of inevitable victory in November, a gnawing anxiety grips Southern Democrats. They have a wounded bird in their sights, but they fear they lack the ammo to bring him down.
President Bush is in terrible trouble. It shows in the national polls, where his approval rating is down to 40 percent. It shows in his floundering campaign, his search for themes, his aides' short fuses. And it shows here in the South, where like Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush built his majority in the electoral college and where he hopes to do so again this year, to make up for the possible loss of California with its 54 electoral votes. 
 In the South Carolina primary on Saturday, as in so many other early contests, a third of Republican voters said no to the President, voting either for Patrick J. Buchanan or David Duke. Some of the naysayers will "come home" in November, but not all.
In addition, in the primaries that are open to independent voters, the President has been running weakly among this group, an important element in the coalition that has kept the Republicans in the White House.
 
Trouble Even in Texas
 "Without the independents and the Reagan Democrats," said one of Mr. Bush's old friends here, "we lose. At the moment, we don't have them."
The trouble shows even in Texas. This is the President's adopted home state, and he is expected to sweep the primary on Tuesday, perhaps even to hold his rivals to 20 percent of the vote. But in a recent poll, three quarters of the respondents said they were worse off economically under Mr. Bush, which surely suggests potential vulnerability in November.
In another survey, published Sunday by The Houston Chronicle, four of seven people interviewed said they wished that other names were on the ballot for both parties.
"The boom for the Republicans of the 1980's has stalled out," said Richard Murray, a political science professor and poll taker at the University of Houston. "But people aren't switching to the Democrats. They are turned off by both parties."
Texas matters a lot. In November, it will cast the third-largest number of electoral votes, 32, just behind New York, with 33, and fast-growing Florida will cast the fourth-largest number, 25. The two Sun Belt states have overtaken four Great Lakes states -- Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- to take a commanding position in national politics. And without carrying Texas, people here remind visitors, no Democrat has won the Presidency since Texas entered the Union in 1845.
Democratic strategists are keenly aware of that, and they remember, too, that in the last 40 years, they have captured the White House only when they nominated Southerners for President (Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Jimmy Carter in 1976) or for Vice President (Mr. Johnson in 1960). That has been a powerful argument for Gov. Bill Clinton among party leaders this year.
 
Backing and Doubt
 But important figures throughout the South wonder whether the Arkansas Governor, whom many of them back, can get the job done if he is nominated.
Almost no major Democrat in the region sees any alternative to Mr. Clinton. That is why senators and governors who dislike or distrust him have said so little in public.
They dismiss former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California as a no-hoper, and it is impossible to overstate the apprehension that most feel about former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. They see him as another Michael S. Dukakis, and that makes them gag.
"If Tsongas is nominated," said a Democratic Senator from the region who knows him and likes him personally, "you can write off the South. Again. And that means you can write off the White House for us. Again."
 
Fear of Tsongas
 Local officeholders have rushed to endorse Mr. Clinton at least partly out of concern about how a Tsongas candidacy might damage their own re-election chances. An example is State Senator Ted Lyon, a Texan who said the other day, "I have had all the liberal candidates from Massachusetts I want running at the top of the ticket."
Why the animosity? Partly it is the legacy of the lackluster Dukakis campaign, which came as a crushing disappointment in Texas particularly, since Senator Lloyd Bentsen was on the ticket as the Vice-Presidential nominee. Partly it is the foreign surname in a region with no experience of ethnic politics. Partly it is Mr. Tsongas's platform; he is liberal on social issues and conservative on economic questions, to paint with a broad brush, and many Democrats in Texas and elsewhere in the South are the reverse.
Unvarnished liberals win in the South these days only in special circumstances. A recent case is Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, elected in 1990 after one of the most inept Republican campaigns in recent memory.
Mr. Clinton is therefore careful to throw out symbols of moderation, calling for welfare reform and advocating the use of the death penalty in a fairly large number of cases, to mitigate his liberalism on race and economics. The problem for him is the accusations that he avoided the draft in the Vietnam War and had an extramarital affair. Many Southern Democrats think this makes him unelectable. It's as simple as that, although few will say so openly.
Reports last weekend of questionable financial dealings involving Governor Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and a developer subject to state regulation will do nothing to make voters forget the earlier accusations.
 
Issue of Character Remains
 The Clinton campaign believes it has left its difficulties in the dust of victory. George Stephanopolous, the deputy campaign manager, said the other day that "the campaign is again focused on the real issues."
Polls of voters leaving the booths in Georgia's primary last Tuesday did suggest that few Clinton voters took the character issues, as they are called, into account. But Mr. Clinton won only a bit more than half the vote in the Democratic primary, which itself amounted to only about half the overall vote. Among those who backed other Democrats, the character issues loomed larger, and it seems certain that they also mattered to many of the Republicans and independents.
The Democratic primary electorates in the South are no longer very representative of statewide sentiment. In Texas, for instance, blacks and Hispanics, white-collar urban professionals and trade-union members now predominate, and many rural Democrats have switched to the Republican primary or avoided primaries altogether. It may be among those people -- religious, patriotic, conservative -- that the greatest damage has been done to Mr. Clinton, and they will be vital to victory in November.
"You can be sure of one thing," said a Democratic state chairman who described himself as "spooked" by the prospect. "If we nominate Bill, the Republicans will find a way to drive those issues home in the fall."
Earl Black, a prominent political scientist at the University of South Carolina, attributed Mr. Clinton's powerful showing in his state's primary to what he termed the weakness of the Democratic field. With a stronger challenger, he said, the Arkansan would have felt "the impact of all the baggage he's accumulated over the last month."
The baggage probably won't weigh too much on Tuesday. But much of the Democratic establishment in this part of the country fears that it will feel like lead come November, especially if the economy starts to snap back and the voters remember that once upon a time they liked George Bush a lot.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Unveils Bond Plan In an Effort to Create Jobs

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 9

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today unveiled an $800 million economic development bond act proposal that is aimed at creating jobs for New York's failing economy but that represents, aides say, a scaled-back version of what he originally hoped to propose.
The proposal would enable the state to borrow $800 million for infrastructure improvements like roads and sewage hookups that make areas more attractive to businesses. A portion of the money would go to each of the state's 62 counties; the rest would be allotted project by project. 
 "When there's no investment going into the system, the public sector has to pick up the slack," said Vincent A. Tese, commissioner of the state Department of Economic Development, at a news conference this morning.
Governor Cuomo first publicly mentioned the bond act in his State of the State address in January, describing it as a package of loans and grants to local governments and businesses. But after he outlined his plan to lawyers in the state Attorney General's and other offices, his aides said, he had to modify it to satisfy legal restrictions.
As a result, all of the projects paid for by the bond act must have some general public good beyond helping a single corporation. In addition, the projects must be on publicly owned land, and the money cannot be given, in either loans or grants, to individual companies.
 
Act a Harder Sell
 "When the Governor first talked about it, we thought the investment from the state would be for infrastructure, but we could condition it on private firms' being committed to do something," said Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine in a recent interview.
"But now, it's infrastructure whose public purpose will stand on its own without depending on a private company," he said. "It's going to be much tougher to drive a hard bargain or to tell the voters that this will guarantee real jobs."
The Cuomo administration has generally been successful with its bond acts. Of six it has gotten on the ballot, only one, an environmental bond act in 1990, was defeated. The Governor hopes that the current recession will convince voters of the need to create jobs. But critics are likely to argue that in this time of fiscal trouble, passing another bond act will irresponsibly drive the state further into debt.
Aides said that the original concept had to be altered because the state constitution prohibits the state from lending or giving money or credit to private corporations and mandates that bond acts have just one stated purpose.
The bond act, which is subject to approval by the state Legislature before it can be put before the voters in November, would create short-term construction opportunities as well as long-term jobs when companies move in or expand, Mr. Cuomo said.
Of the total amount, $300 million would be spent on county-sponsored projects costing the state less than $1 million each. The money would be divided according to a formula that gives each of the state's 62 counties a flat sum of just under $3 million, and then adds on additional money according to the counties' population and unemployment rates. For example, Bronx County would receive $11.5 million, while Putnam County would receive $3.4 million.
In addition, $400 million would be spent on state-sponsored infrastructure projects that cost the state more than $1 million each or are in special economic-development zones or economically distressed areas. The funds would be given to local governments and other public entities.
Finally, $100 million would be spent on infrastructure projects on idle or underused state properties, such as closed mental hospitals.
Legislators said they were reviewing the proposal. John McArdle, a spokesman for the senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, said the Republicans had already proposed their own job-creation package and were leery of supporting anything that would add to the state's debt burden.
But state officials said that the proposal would cost the state's residents just $4.25 a person a year.

HEADLINE: Unusual Alliances Form on Tax Bill

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Like sports fans speculating on the possible draft picks by pro teams, senators and their aides are now guessing what amendments will be proposed right after the Senate takes up tax legislation on Tuesday and which will be conspicuous by their absence.
Voting cliques are gathering around an assortment of probables. Because the issue is money, the groupings are sometimes based on local interests as well as on party affiliations. 
 The first amendment scheduled comes from Senator David H. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, who wants to restrict the use of tax credits in Puerto Rico by pharmaceutical companies that raise drug prices by more than the inflation rate. Mr. Pryor told the Senate Finance Committee last week that the measure would hold down drug prices and might make drug companies consider opening factories at Arkansas military bases scheduled for closing.
Mr. Pryor did not actually introduce his measure last week, he said, because most of his supporters were not on the committee. "The reason Senator Pryor does not want to offer his amendment now is I would get beat," he said in an unusual burst of senatorial candor.
 
Possible Amendments
 Amendments now being drafted propose eliminating the earnings limit on Social Security payments, deleting a proposed tax on coal companies to pay for medical benefits and a ban on states' withholding taxes from pensions paid to residents of other states.
Among other likely proposals are the elimination of -- or expansion of -- a child tax credit for middle-class parents, a lowering of the capital gains tax and a change in the Senate rules on votes that raise or lower taxes.
Hoping to keep the debate short enough to hold a vote by Thursday, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which sent the tax bill to the floor, urged their Democratic colleagues this afternoon not to introduce any amendments. And Senate Republicans remain divided on whether to bother with amendments at all.
They hope to strike a compromise on the issue at a caucus for Republican senators on Tuesday. The conservatives among them, led by Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr. of Wisconsin, are eager to press Democrats publicly for tax cuts and spending cuts. But the moderates have pushed for a short debate on a Democratic bill that President Bush appears certain to veto anyway.
 
'A Political Charade'
 "In a very real sense, I think we're going through a political charade," said William V. Roth Jr., a moderate Delaware Republican who wants to hasten the legislative process so that a bipartisan bill can be created later this year.
"Every day you delay in getting to the economic legislation is another day you delay in getting the recovery," he said in a telephone interview today.
But Senator John McCain, a conservative Arizona Republican, said that no one was going to stop him from introducing amendments, like one that would lower the number of votes needed to reduce taxes and increase the number of votes needed to raise them. Refraining from amendments, he said, "would be not only foolish, but since this is a political exercise, it would be politically inopportune." Under the 1990 budget agreement, which was intended to reduce the Federal budget deficit, 60 votes are needed to lower taxes and 50 to raise them; Mr. McCain wants to reverse those requirements.
Mr. McCain said that the Republicans were likely to endorse the introduction of an alternative tax bill on Tuesday. But the bill would incorporate only those parts of President Bush's tax plan that all members of the caucus could endorse, like an extension of existing tax credits, Mr. McCain said. He added, "We've got to have some kind of little bill."
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, charged that "highly partisan leadership" in Congress had made a legislative stalemate likely this year, adding that the Democratic bill "looks like it would be headed for a veto" because of its tax increases.
 
Presidential Plan
 One of the issues to be decided at Tuesday's caucus is whether Republicans will introduce part or all of the President's original tax proposals from his State of the Union Message of Jan. 28. Mr. Roth said that while he opposed any such move, conservative Republicans were in favor and the outcome remained unclear.
Mr. Kasten plans to join Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, in proposing to eliminate the $57 billion of tax increases in the Democratic bill and replace them with an equal amount of spending cuts in the military and other areas.
A separate amendment from Mr. Kasten would replace the complicated capital gains tax in the Democratic bill, which limits the benefits to the middle class, with a reduction in the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent for all taxpayers, including the rich.
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, may introduce an amendment deleting a provision of the bill that would tax coal mining companies to pay for the health benefits of coal miners, whose union is running out of money this month to pay for them. Coal companies in Wyoming and other Western states rely mainly on strip mining, which hire operators of large backhoes and other earth-moving equipment rather than employing miners.

HEADLINE: Otto Klineberg, Who Helped Win '54 Desegregation Case, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Otto Klineberg, whose pioneering studies on the intelligence scores of black students helped win the Supreme Court's landmark school desegregation case in 1954, died on Friday at the Carriage Hill nursing home in Bethesda, Md. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of Parkinson's disease, his family said. 
 Dr. Klineberg, a renowned social psychologist, was a lifelong critic and debunker of racial superiority theories, whether propounded by Nazis, white Southerners or black extremists.
He played a significant role in the desegregation victory on three levels. Jack Greenberg, a lawyer on the case, said Dr. Klineberg "was the father of the studies we used" to prove that segregated schools provided an unequal education.
And he testified as an expert in a Delaware suit that was one of four cases consolidated for the Supreme Court, and the only one that the integrationists had won in the lower courts.
In studies that he started more than 60 years ago, he found that students in underfinanced Southern black schools averaged lower intelligence scores than Southern whites and Northern blacks and whites. But when blacks moved north to schools that were integrated and of better quality, their scores eventually equaled those of Northern-born blacks.
In the North, he concluded, the scores of blacks nearly matched those of whites, with the discrepancy attributable to social and economic differences.
His views were controversial. When he was quoted in 1931 saying there was no scientific basis for racial superiority or barring interracial marriage, the New York Herald-Tribune, in an editorial against him, said his assertions ran counter to most ethnologists, "any intelligent farmer's knowledge of barnyard biology" and "American experience."
But he also won praise. In 1935 the columnist Lewis Gannett praised Dr. Klineberg's latest work, saying, "The Negroes are not inferior; they just have not had a chance. It is too much to hope that one academic monograph will blow away the mists of superstition in which the average white American mind is wrapped; but this little book may make a beginning."
Dr. Klineberg once said "there is no more important problem for our democracy" than achieving harmony among the many groups "that make up the American people."
 
Psychology Associations
 He was a former president or chairman of the International Union of Scientific Psychology, the World Federation for Mental Health, the Inter-American Society of Psychology, the Eastern Psychological Association and the Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues.
Born in Quebec, he grew up in Montreal. He earned a bachelor's degree at McGill University in Montreal in 1919, a master's in philosophy from Harvard in 1920, a medical degree from McGill in 1925 and a doctorate in psychology at Columbia in 1927. There he began studying American Indians, taught psychology and became the first chairman of the social psychology department.
In 1961 he went to the University of Paris, where he directed the International Center for Intergroup Relations. He retired there in 1982, returned to New York and taught part time at City University until 1990.
Surviving are his wife of 59 years, the former Selma Gintzler; a daughter, Rosemary K. Coffey of Pittsburgh; two sons, John M. of Chevy Chase, Md., and Stephen L. of Houston; eight grandchildren; a brother, Jack, of Montreal, and five sisters, Florence Pascal, Nettye Greenberg, Beatrice Shapera, Dolly Ginsberg and Queenie Meyerovitch, all of Montreal.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Out $50 Million In Mortgage-Backed Trades

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company said yesterday that it had lost $50 million on mortgage-backed securities so far this year and that the head of the unit that trades in the investments had resigned.
Mohamad Sotoudeh, who quit as a managing director, was responsible for the analytical research and the investment positions that Morgan took in mortgage-backed securities, which are backed by pools of home loans. 
 Such securities, known as collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.'s, can be highly risky, and Wall Street trading groups sometimes suffer enormous losses. In 1988, Merrill Lynch lost $377 million on mortgage-backed securities and reorganized its C.M.O. trading group as a result.
Of all the major commercial banks, Morgan has one of the strongest reputations as a trader of various securities and foreign exchange. The trading arm of the bank adds hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues annually to its income statement. The losses in C.M.O. trading underscore the perils of these securities, especially when interest rates are declining.
Morgan said that lower trading revenues from C.M.O.'s would be offset by higher revenues in other areas in the first quarter. Its stock closed yesterday down 62.5 cents, to $57, on the New York Stock Exchange.
C.M.O.'s are often divided into interest-only and principal-only securities for sale separately to investors. Some investors may get fixed interest rates, others variable rates. In principal-only C.M.O.'s, investors receive income from payments made toward the principal on home mortgages. In interest-only C.M.O.'s, investors' income comes from interest payments on mortgages. Morgan lost money on interest-only C.M.O.'s.
As interest rates fell last year, holders of interest-only securities had big losses because homeowners refinanced their mortgages, reducing the number of mortgages in the pool actually making interest payments and causing the value of the interest-only C.M.O.'s to fall.
Mr. Sotoudeh and his staff, and many people in the C.M.O. trading business, had expected that when mortgage rates rose in January and February, refinancings would subside and the value of Morgan's C.M.O. portfolio would stop declining. That proved wrong, as mortgage refinancings continued strongly in January and February. Mr. Sotoudeh's estimate of the value of Morgan's investment in C.M.O.'s was roughly $50 million more than its market value proved to be.
Mr. Sotoudeh joined Morgan in 1989 and had headed the mortgage-backed trading group for one year. Before joining Morgan, he worked in the mortgage-backed area at Shearson Lehman, a unit of the American Express Company.
Most C.M.O.'s are sold to institutional investors, but recently Wall Street has been pushing more of the securities to the retail investment market. According to IDD Information Services, about $246 billion of the securities were issued last year, almost double the 1990 level. Some market participants said more C.M.O.'s were sold in January than in any other previous month.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital Funds on Upswing

BYLINE: By ALLAN MYERSON

 BODY:
Venture capital funds, bloated in the mid-1980's but famished for the last few years, are again enticing investors.
Soaring prices for small-company stocks and a frenzied market for initial public offerings have nourished the recent returns of older funds, helping venture-fund managers raise capital for new ones. Pension funds and university endowments are pouring more of their money into the portfolios of young companies that venture funds assemble. Fund managers relish the prospect that President Bush's proposed cut in the capital-gains tax would bring wealthy individual investors back. 
 The University of Notre Dame has raised its venture investments from about $5 million in mid-1990 to $9 million now, with commitments to add another $30 million over the next few years. Scott C. Malpass, the chief investment officer for the university's endowment, has been surprised by how readily venture funds have raised capital. "A year ago it would have been hard to raise $40 or $50 million," he said. "Last year, some funds raised $250 million."
 
Not a Stampede
 But the movement back to venture funds is no stampede. Some institutions, disappointed with past returns, are standing pat, and a few are selling their positions for less than their market values. The wildly varying fortunes of biotechnology stocks have caused some venture investors to hesitate, and a stock market retreat could prompt them to pull back.
Investors swear that they have learned from their mistakes during the late 1980's, when they flushed money in so furiously that the many competing venture funds had a string of losing years. But now that many investors have turned upbeat, some, including Mr. Malpass, say that the best time to make new commitments has already passed. "I am less excited that I was a year and a half ago," he said. "We're still making commitments, but we'll be much more selective."
Venture funds invest in new companies -- mostly in technology -- with a view toward selling out several years later. The funds remain crucial to giving companies long on ideas but short on history the financing to develop and market their products.
 
High-Risk Investment
 Many of these enterprises fail, but many have blossomed into some of the nation's most prominent corporations, including Digital Equipment, Compaq Computer, Intel, Genentech, Lotus Development, Apple Computer and Federal Express.
Some fund managers see the rebound of venture capital funds as a boon for the international competitiveness of American products. "We're creating important new technologies, new jobs, new wealth," said David P. Best, a general partner in Oak Investment Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., venture capital firm.
Venture funds are not for the conservative, the cash-short or the impatient. Minimum investments are often $1 million, although some funds allow individuals to put down as little as $50,000. A fund typically has a 10-year life, taking several years to find suitable investments, then years more trying to sell the companies outright or take them public.
Returns can range from many times the original investment to total wipeouts. Backing Broadway shows may be more risky, but Broadway throws better parties, with a chance to meet performers instead of computer nerds.
 
Losses in the Late 80's
 As venture funds multiplied wildly through the mid-1980's, they found too few sound investments. Entrepreneurs often dictated unfavorable terms. As Barton M. Biggs, research director at Morgan Stanley & Company, recently wrote, "It seemed like everybody's worthless brother-in-law was suddenly a venture capital genius in partnership with some long-haired Cal Tech dropout who had invented a magic chip while walking on the beach."
After years of annual returns averaging more than 20 percent, venture capital lost an average of 3.8 percent annually from 1986 through 1990. The best estimates for 1991 are that returns climbed back up to 10 percent. Mr. Biggs guessed that venture capital would produce a compound annual return of 25 percent over the next five years -- "which should look terrific compared with anything else," he said.
Venture capital has rebounded so recently that evidence of a recovery has shown up so far only in analysts' insights and the list of firms that have raised money, not in the available statistics. Venture Economics, a Newark-based unit of the Securities Data Company, says that commitments to venture funds rose from $661 million in 1980 to $4.2 billion in 1987, but fell back to $1.3 billion last year.
 
Surge in Biotech Offerings
 This year, said Robert E. Mast, vice president of Venture Economics, the funds will attract about $2 billion. He attributed the renewed rush to the success of last year's initial public offerings, especially for biotech companies. A total of 116 venture-backed companies went public last year, he added -- more than in the three previous years combined, and the most since 1983. Only two venture-backed biotechnology companies went public in 1990; 25 did last year.
Such figures are invaluable in gathering more money. When Mr. Best was raising $150 million for Oak Investment Partners V late last year, he could point out that since Oak Investment Partners IV was started in 1987, investors had already tripled their money. Last year, 10 of the companies the fund had backed went public.
Many fund managers and investors say that the very lack of money available for venture capital over the last few years leaves many promising companies begging for financing on any terms. When fewer competitors in an industry or niche win support, those that do are more likely to succeed. "Now, for every good idea there are two companies, or three," not a dozen, as in the early 1980's, said Richard A. Shaffer, whose Technologic Partners publishing firm monitors venture capital.
 
Investors Less Venturesome
 This time around, the venture capital investors are not an especially venturesome lot. They are choosing only those funds that have proved themselves, "funds that have a Roman number III or IV after their names," Mr. Mast said. Last year, just six funds accounted for more than half of the $1.3 billion raised.
Pension funds have accounted for 40 percent of the $26 billion that venture funds have raised over the last 10 years, according to Venture Economics. Endowments and foundations contributed 9 percent, but that share rose to 23 percent last year. The rest of the money came from foreign sources, individuals, corporations and insurance companies.
President Bush's proposed cut in the capital-gains tax would bring in more money from individuals, fund managers say. "If Congress really wants to entice additional investment in technology, my advice would be, 'Lower the capital gains tax rate, fellas,' " said John A. Griner, executive vice president of Landmark Ventures of Simsbury, Conn.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Is Found to Spur Growth, at Social Cost

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
A report by an independent panel of economists concludes that developing countries that follow the programs of the International Monetary Fund usually make substantial cuts in social welfare spending as well as large cuts in their top income tax rates.
But that conclusion, which tends to bolster longtime criticisms of the secretive international lending institution, was accompanied by another: Countries that adhere to I.M.F. programs increase their growth more and reduce their trade-deficit problems faster than do countries that fail to follow the fund's prescriptions. 
 The report, by a nonpartisan group called the I.M.F. Assessment Project, concludes that the I.M.F. systematically pushes countries to reduce their budget deficits and that as a result these countries usually agree to cuts in food subsidies, housing spending or other social spending.
The report found that developing countries that adhered to the I.M.F.'s fiscal and monetary targets in the late 1980's saw their economic growth jump from 2 percent a year to 4.1 percent, while countries that failed to meet the targets saw their growth inch up from 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent.
 
Closely Guarded Operations
 The project, which was financed by foundations, companies and individuals, sought to shed more light on the I.M.F.'s closely guarded operations. It was carried out by a group of economists, both conservative and liberal, under the aegis of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a nonprofit research foundation based in Arlington, Va. The project's advisory board includes Cyrus R. Vance, who was Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter, and William E. Simon, who was Treasury Secretary under President Gerald R. Ford.
The group found that the I.M.F. did not dictate programs to developing countries that turn to it for financial aid. It said the I.M.F. strived to tailor its recommendations to the conditions of individual countries, but in doing so, generally encouraged "the development of free markets, the removal of price controls and a reduced reliance on state ownership."
The study, led by Gregory A. Fossedal, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, noted that the I.M.F. pressed countries to adopt policies favorable to wealth creation, and as a result often recommended that they lower their top tax rates. The report showed that in 20 countries with I.M.F. programs, the average top tax rate was cut to 39 percent in 1990 from 59 percent in 1982. I.M.F. officials have long said that cutting the top tax rate helps to reduce tax evasion.
The report showed that in 48 I.M.F. programs from 1986 to 1990, 92 percent of the countries reduced spending in housing, health care or economic aid programs like food subsidies. It also said that 62 percent of the programs made cuts in two of those three areas, and that 29 percent of the programs involved overall social spending cuts of more than 20 percent. In these countries, social spending was reduced from 11.1 percent of gross national product to 10.2 percent. The report said that 78 percent of these programs called for cuts in overall government spending.
 
Maintaining Safety Net
 The report said that in pushing for deficit reduction, the I.M.F. did not stress cutting social spending. It added, "The I.M.F. now routinely insists that countries make a reasonable effort to maintain a social safety net."
I.M.F. officials said they had not yet seen the report, so they could not comment. But officials of the fund have long asserted that they do not tell countries receiving I.M.F. help what to do, saying they set up targets for cutting budget deficits and then leave it to the countries to decide how to cut their deficits. I.M.F. officials have often advised countries that they should weigh social spending more effectively, arguing, for example, that food subsidies are inefficient because in many cases they help those who are not poor.
"There's a tendency to reduce social spending across the board," said Mr. Fossedal, the project's chairman. "At the same time the fund argues that it's possible to have reduced levels of spending, yet constant, or even increased, levels of real benefit for the poor."
The report said that reducing poverty and improving the environment "do not appear to be elements" of I.M.F. programs, while "limited or reduced spending in these areas tends to be" an element of such programs.
On exchange rates, the report states that the fund prefers that countries adopt floating or flexible exchange rates because devaluing their currencies helps reduce their trade and current account deficits. But such devaluations often hurt consumers by raising the price of imported goods.
"The fund seeks to minimize its involvement in specific tax and budget policies," the report said. "It works with countries in an effort to set prudent, sustainable overall limits on budget, trade and monetary policy."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Early Start To Job Study In Colleges

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
BIG or small, universities and colleges are worrying more about the job outlook for their students. Perhaps surprisingly though, their concern is not so much for those graduating this recessionary year, but for those who are now just freshmen and sophomores.
Some college administrators say that juniors and seniors are already painfully aware of how bad the employment situation is. But they say younger students may be unrealistically optimistic about how easy it will be to enter the career they want by the time they graduate. 
 As a result, Texas A & M University in College Station, one of the nation's largest with 40,000 students, plans a seminar called, fittingly enough, "Reality 101." The seminar will start next fall for first- and second-year students, and as many as 7,000 could take part.
Dr. C. Wayne Terrell, the university's acting executive director of career planning, said the seminar's leaders would try to convince students that the job market could be tough even when there was not a recession. He wants the discussion to have "almost a shock effect on students."
They will be told that grade point average is important and that they must gain work experience during summers and possibly during the college year. Students will also be lectured on developing their personal skills, including the ability to be interviewed successfully, speak and write well and other basics like dressing properly.
Other colleges do much the same, but few start before the crucial junior and senior years.
Another college has an innovative program aimed at young women seeking careers as business executives. The college, Susquehanna University, is a private institution in Selinsgrove, Pa., with 1,400 students. Its business school has started a new approach to the job market for women, who often have a harder time finding good jobs than male students. The approach involves a mentorship program in the second part of a woman's freshman year.
The aim, said Dr. Mary Cianni, assistant professor of management in the business school, is to get the women involved with mentoring early enough so that it can be useful in their career planning.
Each student has been assigned a woman to be her mentor -- an alumna of the university successful in the business world. They include a manager of human resources for Citibank, a senior industrial engineer at Quaker Oats and a vice president of Equitable Life.
The program, started two months ago, is not mandatory, but she said that 23 of the 25 women who are freshmen in the business school are participating. The school has a total enrollment of 400 students.
The program began with a day on campus for mentors to meet the freshmen. "One objective," Dr. Cianni explained, "was to provide a sounding board about the mentors' careers and how they handled work and family issues."
The students and mentors make such basic commitments as meeting twice a year from freshman through senior years, and keeping in touch through letters and by telephone. Both are asked to evaluate the program periodically. Also, the students must participate in other career programs offered by the university.
As in most undergraduate schools of business, Susquehanna requires a large number of liberal arts courses in addition to the business courses that are taken mostly in junior and senior years.
"The goal is to help these women freshmen in the business school learn how to function in a mentor relationship so they will be able to create such relationships when they move into the business world," she said.
Susquehanna also has an "executive in residence" program, which brings a business executive to campus to talk to students, but the mentoring program helps provide women students with the skills and contacts that the men students generally already have.
"The guys learn to do it -- to have mentors outside in the business world and to build networks," Dr. Cianni said.
Dr. Cianni said a research project she did at a large corporation showed her that women needed better networking skills.
She found that female managers "were acutely aware of an 'old boy network' and were excluded from some important social events perceived to lead to career opportunities." These include golf, bowling, baseball and other outings, during which men shared experiences and ideas.
"Many of our women mentors wish there had been such a program when they were in school," Dr. Cianni said.
Catalyst Inc., a New York-based organization that does research on women's issues, contends that not only is there a "glass ceiling" that prevents many women from reaching top levels but there is also a "glass wall" that blocks them from gaining the broader line experience they need in addition to the staff jobs many hold as middle managers.
"Women," a recent Catalyst report stated, "encounter 'a glass wall' early in their career that prevents them from getting critical experience they need to compete with men for top management positions."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Settles Mostly Lower And Gold Drops Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower in quiet profit taking on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices slumped worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $348.90 a troy ounce, off 60 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold slid 45 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $348.80. 
 Analysts said the dollar was poised for a technical decline. "It was time for a little pullback," said John Marchese, chief economist at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "We've had an economy that's strengthening, and that's given the dollar a boost of about 8 percent in the last six weeks."
But the trend did not hold against the Japanese yen, which declined. The market is anticipating that Japanese monetary authorities will cut interest rates to prevent their economy from weakening further.
 
Expected Within Week
 The move is expected in the coming week and would help raise the dollar. Declining foreign interest rates make United States yields more appealing and thereby increase investors' need for dollars.
There was talk that monetary authorities intervened last week to subdue the dollar's rise against the yen, but the moves were unconfirmed. Central banks often step into the market to prevent currencies from moving too sharply in either direction.
"If the dollar moves up too fast" against the yen," Mr. Marchese said, "it will hurt the price of our exports." He predicted the dollar would be contained to its current trading range, since no economic data are expected this week that would have an impact on trading.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.73 yen, up 0.10 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 131.90 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 131.96 yen, up from 131.85 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7240, from $1.7200 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.7245 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.7190.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6620 German marks, down from 1.6690; 1.5075 Swiss francs, down from 1.5155; 5.6430 French francs, down from 5.6700; 1,245.00 Italian lire, down from 1,251.00, and 1.1921 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1914.

HEADLINE: Consumers Pared Debt In January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Consumers continued to pay down their overall installment debt in January, but they increased their loans for automobiles for the first time in 13 months, the Government said today.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit decreased at an annual rate of three-tenths of 1 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $183 million. Installment debt fell eight-tenths of 1 percent during 1991, the first annual drop in 33 years. 
 Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home equity loans.
 
Link to Economic Momentum
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other economists have said that the speed with which businesses and consumers pay down the mountains of debt incurred during the 1980's will determine how quickly they resume spending and thus provide the momentum to get the economy moving.
The January decline was the third in a row, although it was slower than the 1.2 percent posted in December. The revised drop in December was also less than half of the 2.8 percent rate originally estimated last month.
Automobile loans rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $332 million, the first increase since December 1990, when car loans advanced 3.6 percent.
Auto makers had reported that 1991 sales were the worst since 1983, when the economy was emerging from the previous recession. Sales of domestically produced cars fell slightly in the first 20 days of January but jumped 16.9 percent in the final 10-day period.
 
December Figure Revised
 Still, the rate of decline in December was not as steep as first reported. The Fed said car loans were down at a revised 1.0 percent rate rather than 3.1 percent as it had reported a month earlier.
Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, also rose at a 1.5 percent rate in January, or a seasonally adjusted $299 million, after falling eight-tenths of 1 percent in December.
The Fed said revolving credit was "typically volatile at the turn of the year." Still, the Commerce Department has said that retail sales rose six-tenths of 1 percent in January, and major retailers reported last week that sales continued to improve in February.
The various changes left total consumer debt at $729.2 billion in January, after adjusting for normal seasonal variations.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Moscow Subway Defies the Odds

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
EVERY Moscow subway station has a digital clock that if it were mounted in a New York subway station would be a source of endless public razzing. The clocks time the intervals between trains. Each has only three digits: two that count seconds and one for minutes. The message is that trains are never more than 10 minutes apart, a boast the New York subway system does not dare to make.
The Moscow subway system -- carrying eight million riders a day, more than any other subway in the world -- works, and works well. In a city where very little does function well, the subways are almost a haven from gray winter days, rundown buildings and rutted, slushy streets. The social forces that made New York subways a world marvel in the early 20th century still appear to be powerfully at work in Moscow. 
 Rapid escalators bring people deep underground to arching granite and marble stations, elegantly lighted, with statues, murals and mosaics set in the walls. Graffiti are unknown, fatal accidents are rare and crime is just beginning to be a problem. However disorderly people might be in the streets, a code of behavior, a respect, keeps them subdued in the subways -- except during rush hours, when trains are as jammed as in New York and people elbow their way aboard.
"Even in 1941, when German forces were only 20 kilometers from the Kremlin, construction of new subway tunnels continued," said Dimitri Gaev, first deputy director of Moscow's subway system. And today, construction goes on, at the rate of three miles of new tunnel a year, compared with zero miles in New York. The expansion continues although Government subsidies are harder to obtain and the revenue from fares covers less than 20 percent of the 10 billion rubles in operating and construction costs that Mr. Gaev expects this year.
Still, the Moscow subway system -- the fourth largest in the world in miles of track, behind New York, London and Tokyo -- stands out as a monument to public support among a citizenry critical of and often indifferent to institutions. Its success reflects two trade-offs that have influenced subway development worldwide for decades: public transportation versus private cars and city living versus living in the suburbs.
Virtually all of Greater Moscow's nine million people live within the city. Relatively few people have cars, so nearly everyone relies on the subway, whether they are going to work, to shop, to school, to visit friends or to the ballet. "Once the ethos of a subway system develops, people prize it," said Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University.
That ethos existed in New York, but with the rise of the auto, a good road system and home mortgages with tax-deductible interest costs, the middle class shifted en masse to the suburbs and the subways declined. Although New York's population is as large as Moscow's, only 3.2 million riders now use its subways daily -- mainly to commute to jobs -- and the interval between trains can exceed 10 minutes, says Robert Previdi, a spokesman for the New York system.
Perhaps more important for Muscovites, from the early 1930's, when Stalin began building the subway, the Government assigned to them their apartments and their jobs, without great regard for distance from friends and office. In the long, snowy winters, a reliable and rapid subway system became essential, not only to keep industry going, but simply to make life tolerable.
"Let everyone go on strike -- doctors, teachers, factory workers -- and that is not a problem," Mr. Gaev said. "But if metro workers strike, the city dies." That helps to explain why the subway's 21,000 employees are well paid; a motorman, for example, earns nearly 4,000 rubles a month, a middle-class wage. And, as more apartments are built farther from downtown, the subway tunnels are pushed out to meet them, with new stations.
Still, hard times might soon take their toll on the Moscow subway, sacred cow that it is. Until 1991, the Soviet Union paid nearly all of the difference between the revenue from fares and the costs. The Russian Republic covered the shortfall in 1991; this year the Russian and Moscow governments are in dispute over how much each should pay.
"I think the politicians will exhibit a wisdom in solving a problem that affects all the people," Mr. Gaev said, hopefully. But just in case they don't, fares are rising -- to 50 kopeks this month from 15 kopeks, and probably to one ruble, or 100 kopeks, by December, Mr. Gaev said.
And here, he indulges in public relations. The fare increase has been roughly in step with the rise in average salary, Mr. Gaev explains. And inflation has chipped away at the kopek's purchasing power; 50 kopeks today purchases only what 2.5 kopeks purchased in 1990, when the fare was 5 kopeks. "So, though the fare is rising," Mr. Gaev said, "the actual cost is shrinking."

HEADLINE: La Mama Runs Short Of Money And Time

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
The La Mama Experimental Theater Club, a downtown theater institution for 30 years, may soon close its doors.
"I don't see how we can go past the end of March," said Ellen Stewart, the founder and director of the theater institution, which is known simply as La Mama and has played a major role in the establishment of Off Broadway theater in New York City. 
 "I should be closed now."
Unable to raise the $150,000 she needs to finish the season, which ends on June 30, Ms. Stewart is contemplating closing the theater complex, possibly forever.
"We'll close until we can pay our creditors," Ms. Stewart said yesterday. "But I don't know when that's going to be. I don't have any promises for the future."
 
Who Has Dealt the Blows
 Ms. Stewart said La Mama had been hurt by cuts in grants from the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. "We've had a 60 percent cut in our Nysca money and a 16 percent endowment cut. The Rockefeller Foundation continues to support us. We get a small grant from Philip Morris. The Ford Foundation gives us nothing. We can't even get an interview there. We've never got much money from corporate foundations. They simply don't fund places like us."
This year La Mama is getting $200,000 from the endowment and $79,000 from the state council.
The closing of La Mama might seem inconceivable to those who cut their Off Broadway teeth at the theater, seeing plays by such authors as Sam Shepard, Lanford Wilson, Harvey Fierstein and Andre Serban, as well as writers like Tom Eyen, Rochelle Owens and Tom O'Horgan, who helped define the rowdy, influential alternative theater of the 1960's. Mr. Fierstein's "Torch Song Trilogy" opened at La Mama, as did "Godspell" and the Blue Man Group's "Tubes."
At La Mama, it was possible to see performers like Robert De Niro, Richard Dreyfuss, Danny DeVito, F. Murray Abraham and Jill Clayburgh before they became household names. There was an emphasis, too, on international theater, in a tradition that will continue this month with an Italian production of "The Golem," in Italian and Yiddish, and a Korean theater company.
Ms. Stewart talks with typical fervor of those productions, but then reality seeps back into the conversation. "We have enormous insurance and enormous Con Ed bills," she said, adding that insurance costs run $48,000 a year and Con Edison about $60,000 for a 10-month year. The La Mama payroll is $5,500 a week, which covers 21 people who work in a gallery, rehearsal and office space and 3 theaters, all housed in 4 buildings spread out over the Lower East Side. In addition to artists' fees, there are telephone and supply bills to be met, she added, as well as payments on a small mortgage on one of the buildings, and the company's "real deficit," which Ms. Stewart puts at about $176,000. "We've gone deeper, and deeper, and deeper," she said.
One problem, Ms. Stewart said, is that people seem to expect La Mama just to keep going on its own. "Honey, we've tried," she said. "But we just don't fit what people expect. We've been living on skin before these cuts. But I don't have any more money that I can dump into La Mama."
Another problem is that to a great extent, La Mama has remained the kind of seat-of-the-pants artistic operation that it was in earlier, easier economic times, and its freewheeling style is no longer possible in the business of theater.
 
Where It All Began
 Ms. Stewart is uncharacteristically bitter these days. The city has made concessions to the Public Theater and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, she says, asking only symbolic rents from them for city-owned buildings they occupy, but has made none to La Mama on its city-owned space. Few offers of support have come from the stars who came out of the theater, though they have been approached by the Friends of La Mama. "It hurts," Ms. Stewart said.
La Mama had its roots in a tiny basement theater on East Ninth Street, as a place where new playwrights could show their work and where directors could experiment. The inspiration for the venture came, Ms. Stewart said, from a comment by a Lower East Side merchant who befriended her in her early days in the city. She had come to New York in the 1950's to study fashion design, training she said was closed to her as a black back home in Chicago. One Sunday, she found herself walking along Delancey Street, where "this little man came out of his store wearing something black on his head," she recalled. "I didn't know it was a yarmulke. He wanted to sell me something. I told him I didn't have any money."
His name was Abraham Diamond, and he took her into his store to talk. Soon there were regular Sunday visits with his family and gifts of exquisite French fabric. "He'd take me all over the neighborhood," Ms. Stewart said. "I was his daughter the designer."
Mr. Diamond, who had started as a pushcart vendor, told her she needed a pushcart of her own. " 'But don't push it for yourself, push it for someone else,' " Ms. Stewart recalls him saying. And so the theater became Ms. Stewart's "pushcart," she said.
There were no rules. "In the theater, I've always felt we should never be bound to a stage, to being understood through any one language," Ms. Stewart continued. "I always felt there were other ways to communicate."

HEADLINE: Amid 'Shortage,' Young Physicists See Few Jobs

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
EVEN as leading scientists warn that America's educational system is failing to produce scientists fast enough to fill a glaring projected shortage, many young physicists contend that universities are already turning out far more physicists than there are permanent jobs.
If the job market for research physicists does not radically improve soon, they say, growing numbers of gifted young Americans will be turned away from careers in physics, a field deemed by many experts as vital to maintaining America's technological and economic health. 
 Permanent research jobs for young physicists have virtually dried up, partly because the recession has drastically undercut the resources of universities and commercial research institutions. In addition, physicists in senior faculty and research positions who had been expected to retire in large numbers in recent years have not done so. At the same time, a growing tide of physicists immigrating from the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe has begun to exacerbate the glut of American physicists.
The situation was underscored last month when Dr. Robert Hilborn, chairman of the physics department at Amherst College, disclosed that 813 physicists had applied for a single job on the college's physics faculty. About three-quarters were recent recipients of doctoral degrees, while some 200 were experienced physicists, including about 60 from the former Soviet Union.
Few young physicists are completely out of work, but many are in temporary postdoctoral positions with low salaries, poor prospects of advancement, and no job security. Many are deeply dissatisfied.
Senior physicists, labeled by many younger ones as "the establishment," contend that an advanced degree in physics is an excellent education, even if it leads to no job. Besides, physicists are at the pinnacle of science, they argue, and superbly qualified to take jobs as applied scientists, engineers or even plumbers.
But young physicists say that even in industry there are all too few jobs available because of the recession and changing industrial research goals. Major commercial laboratories that once employed many full-time scientists now prefer postdoctoral students working as temporary employees.
Despite the scarcity of permanent jobs for starting-level physicists, most science analysts believe the nation will face a dangerous shortage of physicists in the next century.
 
Anger Among Young Physicists
 But many young physicists were angered by a prediction last year from the National Science Foundation that the United States would have a shortage of 625,000 scientists in two decades. The prediction, say many young physicists, was wildly inaccurate and self-serving, intended mainly to nudge Congress into providing more financing for the agency.
Although junior physicists have no formal organization, an informal "Young Scientists Network" was recently founded by Dr. Kevin D. Aylesworth, a postdoctoral fellow at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington. His information exchange now includes several hundred postdoctoral physicists.
"Established senior physicists simply aren't listening to us postdocs," he said in an interview. "They're too busy finding money for their own institutions and projects. Conditions for us are not what they were when establishment scientists were young. The way things look now, I doubt that there ever will be a shortage of scientists anywhere near as severe as the N.S.F. forecast."
A stream of letters published by the professional magazine Physics Today has echoed Dr. Aylesworth's opinion. "I remain extremely skeptical about the impending Ph.D. shortage that is supposed to occur when large numbers of present faculty members retire," wrote Dr. Robert J. Yaes of Lexington, Ky. Senior faculty members are postponing retirement, he said, and even those who do retire are sometimes not replaced.
 
'Chilling Stories'
 A few young physicists are so embittered by the slack job market that they believe physics education is pointless.
"The only thing clear is that there are fewer jobs for physicists because there is less economic need for physicists," Murray Arnow of Skokie, Ill., wrote in a letter to Physics Today. "The current commitment by the American Physical Society to promote science education is almost folly given the declining demand for physicists."
Dr. Kate Kirby, an atomic physicist with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and chairwoman of the American Physical Society's membership committee, said: "We constantly hear chilling stories. We know of gifted postdoctoral physicists who have held temporary postdoc jobs for seven years or so before reaching the lowest rung of the academic tenure track."
 
Challenge to Gloomy Outlook
 This gloomy view is strongly challenged by Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel laureate in physics and the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
"The opportunities for scientists in general are tremendous," he said. "A physicist may not always find opportunity in his original narrow research specialty, but only 2 or 3 percent of physicists are actually unemployed. The need for scientists to contribute to the defense of the environment is growing, and physicists will also star in the quest for alternative energy sources and many other social needs. There's no question that the nation will need more physicists."
Far from cutting back science education, Dr. Lederman says, the nation must enhance it at every level, and to that end he has organized a group of volunteer scientists who tutor Chicago-area school teachers in the teaching of science.
But Dr. Lederman and other leading scientists acknowledge that many physics research positions in industry have disappeared because of the recession.
 
Cutbacks at Laboratories
 The trend is evident, for example, at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, one of the world's preeminent institutions of physics research whose employees have garnered many Nobel Prizes. The company now employs 172 physicists as permanent staff members and 104 postdoctoral fellows. Very few of the latter group stand a chance of getting permanent jobs with the laboratory, says Dr. Arno Penzias, the laboratory's vice president for research, who is a Nobel laureate himself. On the other hand, Dr. Penzias said, the training postdoctoral fellows receive at the laboratory prepares them for a wide range of physics specialties.
This trend away from pure research has induced some prominent physicists to leave industrial laboratories for academic positions, a shift that has made academic jobs for young physicists even more scarce.
Dr. Charles V. Shank, director of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, worked for 20 years at Bell Laboratories, the predecessor of A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, before deciding to leave. "It's a very competitive world, and A.T.&T. Bell simply felt that it needed research more closely connected to its near-term business interests than was the case in the past," he said.
A would-be scientist who embarks on a career in physics faces more uncertainties than young scientists in other fields, experts agree. A physicist must complete a doctorate and one or two postdoctoral appointments, usually of two years each, before even becoming eligible to look for an academic job. It is a course of study taking roughly the equivalent time to that needed to become a medical doctor, which is generally much better paid. By contrast, a chemist with only a bachelor's or master's degree can usually find a job in the field, although holders of doctoral degrees command higher salaries.
 
More Physicists Each Year
 Suzanne Ellis, educational studies analyst for the American Institute of Physics, said the average postdoctoral fellow in physics draws a salary of about $30,000, and may have to forgo permanent employment for years. Moreover, she said, more physicists enter the system each year. In 1982, for instance, only 912 doctoral degrees in physics were granted in the United States, while in 1989 there were 1,112 and in 1990 there were 1,183.
"The job shortage these days has its roots in the 1980's, when young physicists began preparing for jobs they expected to be vacated by retirements in the early 1990's," Mrs. Ellis said. "Instead, the senior physicists are not retiring."
In 1990, she said, 12 percent of all physicists with recent doctorates seeking positions received no job offer at all, and 50 percent received only one. In 1989, the comparable figures were 7 percent and 45 percent.
In the last three years, some 40 percent of the new United States doctorates in physics went to foreign students, and this has caused some complaints.
 
Immigration Policy Criticized
 Dr. Aylesworth, while not criticizing the presence of foreign physicists in the United States, believes that Congress seriously overestimated the job market for scientists when it passed the Immigration Reform Act of 1989.
Some scientists and engineers are more harshly critical of immigration policies. Merrill W. Buckley, president-elect of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, said last month that immigration of foreign engineers should be curbed in times of high unemployment. "We should be as generous as we can, but we have our own self-interest, from a business and professional point of view," he said in a speech before the Information Technology Association of America.
Few senior physicists agree with this point of view. "Without the foreign physicists who came to the United States during this century, American science would have been in a sorry state," said Dr. Robert C. Dynes, professor of physics at the University of California at San Diego.
But many agree that the current crop of young physicists faces some unusual problems. "The generation born in the 1950's was drawn to physics during the heady post-Sputnik era, when Federal money was pouring into the field," said Dr. Robert L. Park of the American Physical Society. "Now, that population bubble from the 1950's is going through the system, just when the job market is worst. The grim truth is that for the next five years the good jobs in physics research will be hard to come by. "They could become a lost generation," Dr. Park said. "Even worse will be the loss to the nation of all that scientific talent."

Removal of Nitrates

 BODY:
Scientists say they have found a way to use a plant enzyme to rid underground drinking water of nitrates, a dangerous and increasingly widespread pollutant. They say the method is very effective, but they still must work out technical problems to make it economically feasible.
The discovery is important because nitrates are reaching dangerous levels in groundwater in the United States, and scientists have had little success in finding effective treatments to reduce those levels. Nitrates are most commonly used in fertilizers, especially sodium and potassium nitrates. Numerous water wells have had to be abandoned because of the lack of a way to deal with the problem. 
 The researchers, from Germany and the United States, reported in the Feb. 20 issue of the journal Nature that they had designed a system using an enzyme, nitrate reductase, from seedlings of the corn species Zea mays. The substance is immobilized in the device, and an electrical current is applied as the polluted water is passed through. In a two-step chemical process, the nitrates are reduced to nitrogen gas, the most abundant component of air. Such devices could be used to reduce any water pollutant if appropriate enzymes could be found for each contaminant.
Current nitrate-removal methods using chemicals produce residues, including the contaminant aluminum. Methods using microorganisms are slow and incomplete and require the often difficult maintenance of the microorganisms. Often in these processes, nitrous oxide, itself an air pollutant, is produced.
In the corn seedling, the nitrate-reducing enzyme exists in small amounts. To isolate enough enzyme, the researchers had to grind up so many seedlings that the process proved to be too expensive and thus impractical for common use.
"There are technical problems with putting our findings into practice," said one of the study's authors, Dr. Wilbur H. Campbell of the Michigan Technological University. "But theoretically, it's perfect."

HEADLINE: We Need a Global Warming Treaty With Clout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Global Snub on Global Warming" (editorial, Feb. 18), you call on the Bush Administration to adopt "a more reasonable course" on global warming, but voluntary goals are not adequate. Most European governments adopted such goals for limiting carbon dioxide emissions in 1989, but the Bush Administration refused to go along, saying that mere goals could not be taken seriously without measures to back them up.
Since then the Europeans have called for legally binding limits on carbon dioxide as part of the international climate treaty. The Europeans are well along in implementing their own commitments. It is too little and too late for the United States to adopt merely a goal. 
 You cautiously state it is uncertain whether or not global warming will be dangerous. Yet "Washington May Change Its Position on Climate," a Science Times article the same day, notes that both the international science panel of the United Nations and the National Academy of Sciences have concluded that the threat is sufficiently clear and present to warrant a prompt response.
Low-lying countries and island states, whose very existence is at stake, have no doubt that sea-level rise from global warming would be dangerous, indeed, catastrophic. The same can be said for the grain belt, temperate forests, wetlands, coral reefs and other natural ecosystems, all of which face devastation unless the world eventually reduces carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases by more than 60 percent to stabilize the climate.
You have misplaced worries about the cost of curbing carbon dioxide emissions. Inaction on carbon dioxide costs us billions of dollars a year. The energy efficiency and renewable energy investments needed to reduce emissions would create jobs and make the United States more competitive on world markets.
Our research shows that carbon dioxide emissions can be cut 25 percent by the year 2005 and 70 percent by 2030 at a net profit of $2.3 trillion. The Environmental Protection Agency analysis you mention is more conservative, but also concludes that carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 can be limited to 1990 levels at a profit. Only economic models that assume our economy is functioning perfectly reach the conclusion that cutting emissions might be expensive.
The time for voluntary goals is past. There is too great a risk that, like the President's education goals, they will simply be ignored. If President Bush really wants to lead a new world order in which global environmental dangers number among the great threats to our collective security, he must move now to negotiate a global warming treaty with enforceable emission limits.

HEADLINE: We Need a Global Warming Treaty With Clout;
Link With Cholera

 BODY:
To the Editor
Cholera in the United States: curiosity or clarion? Cholera is spreading in the Americas, and scientists have now found a possible link with global warming. Your Feb. 18 editorial and "Lead Us to Rio, Mr. President" by Michael Oppenheimer (Op-Ed, Feb 22), on the United Nations conference on the environment and development, the so-called earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro next June, both urge the United States to join an international treaty on carbon emissions, a pact essential for our health.
Researchers on diarrhea in Bangladesh have long associated cholera cycles with the spring blooms of algae and plankton. Dr. Rita Colwell of the University of Maryland and others have isolated resting forms of cholera in a wide range of marine life. Exposed to unfavorable conditions, the bacteria "hibernate"; with warming and increased nutrients, they emerge. 
 Plankton and algae also proliferate with warming (absorbing carbon and making oxygen through photosynthesis). The current called El Nino is warming the eastern Pacific; unusually large algae blooms are reported at sea, and samples of marine life from the harbor of Lima, Peru, contain cholera.
The hypothesis, then: having possibly arrived in the bilge of a Chinese freighter docked in Lima (Nature magazine), cholera was carried in the abundant coastal sea life to neighboring countries. From this reservoir, it penetrated societies whose water and sanitation systems had become vulnerable from economic hardship and rapid urbanization.
Health professionals are increasingly concerned with the health impact of climate changes. Next June's Rio conference will offer an opportunity to begin a worldwide project to curb greenhouse gases. The United States cannot escape its responsibilities by adopting half measures or by merely contributing to international funds.

HEADLINE: Sanctions on Iraq Punish the Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"How to Squeeze Saddam Hussein" (editorial, Feb. 13) dismisses using force as too dangerous and fomenting upheaval as too risky for "prying the dictator off his perch." But favoring an international embargo on the assumption that it will encourage Iraqis "to rid themselves of Saddam Hussein" ignores the facts.
Before the embargo began, there was no indication it would have such an effect, and the embargo has not weakened Saddam Hussein's power. According to reports by the international study team, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, American Friends Service Committee, Catholic Relief Services and the United Nations, the sanctions are causing widespread starvation, not widespread revolution. 
 My organization, Madre, is a women's friendship organization that supports health care and education for women and children in Central America, the Middle East and the United States. I led a delegation that delivered more than 10 tons of infant formula and pediatric antibiotics to two children's hospitals in Baghdad. We met many Iraqis who told us that bombs and the sanctions have destroyed their country, but not their faith in their leader. A renewed sense of nationalism has galvanized support for Saddam Hussein.
Our visit confirmed what other international relief workers and medical experts have reported: the way to end Iraq's public health catastrophe is to lift the sanctions. Food supplies have dwindled, and prices have risen far beyond the means of most Iraqis. Hospitals lack medicines, anesthesia and basic supplies. Water and sewage systems, power plants and other facilities destroyed in the war cannot be repaired for lack of spare parts. The child mortality rate has tripled. Infant formula sells on the black market at $60 a can. And the No. 1 killer of children younger than 5 is diarrhea.
We need a more creative solution than embargo, one that does not compromise the basic values of human decency and stays within the rules of international law. The sanctions must be lifted now.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Expected to Pressure India on Nuclear Issue

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is expected to press India in high-level talks this week to drop its longstanding opposition to signing a treaty limiting the spread of nuclear arms, American officials say. New Delhi will also be asked to join in regional talks with Pakistan on controlling nuclear development.
Pakistan, whose weapons program led to a cutoff of United States aid in October 1990, has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or to agree to international inspections and safeguards until India does. 
 When Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, with American prompting, proposed a five-nation conference on the nuclear issue last June, the invitation was dismissed abruptly by New Delhi. The Bush Administration now sees the potential for reversing or tempering that rejection of talks that would also include Russia, China and the United States.
The visit of J. N. Dixit, the Indian Foreign Secretary, to Washington this week comes at a time when India and Pakistan have seen their international importance erode with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the winding down of the war in Afghanistan. Both countries, and their friends in Congress, are lobbying for attention in Washington.
Pakistan, under intense Congressional and Administration scrutiny as it buys American military equipment on the open market, has taken several steps in freezing weapons development and modifying foreign policy that could improve its position with the United States, says Robert B. Oakley, the United States Ambassador to Islamabad from 1988 to 1991.
New Delhi, which has made some policy changes recently, including upgrading diplomatic ties with Israel after years of espousing a pro-Palestinian line, has not shown any flexibility on the nuclear issue. Among other considerations, the Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao faces an opposition party committed to weapons production.
India, which set off a nuclear explosion in 1974 and by most experts' accounts has the material to produce more weapons than Pakistan, could avoid pressure from the United States Congress and succeeding American administrations in the past because Washington had little leverage in New Delhi. Pakistan, a recipient of significant American military and economic aid, was in a different category.
But now, India is seeking increased American investment and technical cooperation. Indian officials also want to discuss military training exchanges and subsidized purchases of wheat from the United States. At the same time, India's human rights record -- not only in states where separatist wars have led to an abrogation of civil liberties, but also in society at large -- is coming in for steadier and sharper scrutiny, giving Congress and the Administration more potential for exerting pressure.
Internationally, India has lost the diplomatic and political support provided by the treaty relationship it had with the Soviet Union, as well as preferential agreements on trade conducted through a rupee-ruble exchange that did not require New Delhi to draw on hard currency reserves for military or civilian purchases.
"All the eternal verities on which India's position is built are shifting," an administration official said.
At the same time Pakistan may face new problems in Congress, where some legislators appear intent on plugging the loophole of military sales to Pakistan by private American suppliers. The Administration asserts that the Pressler Amendment, under which Islamabad lost American aid, applies only to the official foreign military sales program or purchases of Government-funded arms.
In addition, the United States has about $400 million in various aid projects still "in the pipeline" to Pakistan. An Administration official said these would be allowed to run their course under the Pressler Amendment.

HEADLINE: Menachem Begin, Guerrilla Leader Who Became Peacemaker

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister who made peace with Egypt, lived much of his life in the opposition. A Jewish underground leader before Israel gained independence in 1948, he openly fought the established Zionist leadership of the struggle against British rule.
Then for nearly three decades, he headed Israel's major opposition party. 
 Ultimately and to many Israelis, surprisingly, his minority bloc ousted the Labor Party, which had governed continuously in the three decades since statehood, and Mr. Begin, as party leader, became Prime Minister. He was to govern an ever more divided and troubled nation.
Mr. Begin, who led Israel from May 1977 until he resigned as Prime Minister in 1983, stretched the national mood from great pride to deep dismay. He guided the nation to a peace treaty with Egypt, the first such pact with an Arab country. But he also presided over a bitterly divisive war against Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon.
If the treaty with Egypt, which brought Mr. Begin a shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize with President Anwar el-Sadat, represented a high point in his political leadership, the war in Lebanon in 1982 and the stalemate that followed, with its steady toll of dead and wounded, were its low point.
Started with the announced aim of evicting Palestinian guerrillas from operating too close to Israel's border with Lebanon, it brought Israeli troops to the outskirts of Beirut. It enmeshed Israel in the lethal sectarian politics of Lebanon, and led to a costly and indecisive occupation.
The invasion in June 1982 was seen by Israelis at first as a justified response to years of border harassment. But when the Israelis advanced to the outskirts of Beirut and bombed and shelled the Lebanese capital for 10 weeks, criticism and anguish arose.
 
Massacres at Camps Deeply Affect Israelis
 Dissent reached a peak in the fall of 1982, when Lebanese Christian militia units entered Palestinian refugee districts at Sabra and Shatila that were supposedly under Israeli guard and killed hundreds of people.
The massacre led to an independent investigation ordered by the Israeli Government, which concluded that Israeli troops watched the killing from a distance and did nothing to stop it. Mr. Begin survived in office, but was shaken politically.
His medical problems -- he had suffered three heart attacks -- became an increasing burden. And in November 1982, his wife of 43 years, Aliza, died while he was on a trip to the United States. Thereafter, Mr. Begin became increasingly listless, participating little in debate in Parliament, taking less and less interest in politics and limiting his public appearances. On Aug. 28, 1983, he announced that he planned to quit and on Sept. 15 he formally resigned as Prime Minister.
Mr. Begin became something of a recluse. He lived with his daughter Leah in an apartment near the Jerusalem residence of his son, Benjamin, now a member of the Israeli Parliament and a leader in the Likud Party.
He was rarely seen in public and left his house only for rare visits to a hospital and memorial services for his wife. Yehiel Kadishai, a close friend and longtime adviser, visited daily and enabled Mr. Begin to keep up with correspondence. Mr. Begin also received visits from a small circle of friends.
When he became Prime Minister, Mr. Begin represented both political and stylistic change. He brought a new demeanor to the Prime Minister's office with his remote manner, a sharp contrast to the earthy and informal style of his Labor Party predecessors. Unlike the bulk of Israeli politicians, he was seldom seen other than in suit and tie.
 
Land and Ideology; Legacy and Withdrawal
 And he moved the country in a distinctly different ideological direction. Hours after his election victory, he visited an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, which had been captured in the 1967 war, declaring it part of "liberated Israel." Labor Governments had avoided such declarations, but to Mr. Begin the West Bank was Judea and Samaria, Jewish land from biblical times.
His Government did not formally annex the West Bank, as it did the Golan Heights, a Syrian promontory captured in 1967 after its long use as a base for shelling northern Israel. But under Mr. Begin, the West Bank began to be heavily settled by Israelis.
He was also to return some Arab land taken in battle, a strip of Syrian territory won in 1973 and a town on the Golan Heights taken in 1967.
But the most significant territorial withdrawal, and for Mr. Begin the most personally wrenching, was in the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel returned to Egypt in three stages from 1979 through 1982. Jewish settlements in Sinai were abandoned despite intense protest by their residents.
The Sinai withdrawal was the last stage of a process that began with Mr. Sadat's landmark visit to Jerusalem in November 1977, six months after Mr. Begin took office.
The Egyptian President, frustrated by the intransigence of Arab neighbors in the dealing with Israel, had hinted that he was prepared to go it alone in seeking peace and had said he would even travel to even Jerusalem, in pursuit of that goal. Mr. Begin responded with an invitation.
On a warm November evening, the wheels of the presidential aircraft, Egypt 01, touched down at Ben-Gurion International Airport. Mr. Begin stepped forward and said: "I am waiting for you, Mr. President, and all the ministers are waiting for you."
Sixteen months of arduous negotiations followed, including the marathon talks at Camp David, Md., with the intercession of President Jimmy Carter. The process culminated in the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty signed in Washington on March 26, 1979.
But Mr. Begin's wariness toward the Arabs, on behalf of what he considered Israel's vital security interests, remained undiminished. In June 1981, he ordered the bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad. This was followed in July by two weeks of bombing in Lebanon.
In December, he pushed through Parliament a measure to annex the Golan Heights. This drew sharp criticism from Washington and other capitals, but Mr. Begin held his ground. His relations with the United States included many other difficult moments. When the Reagan Administration suspended a strategic cooperation pact with Israel and imposed financial sanctions because of the Golan annexation, Mr. Begin said Israel was being treated like a "vassal state."
His relations with Egypt also changed. After Mr. Sadat was shot to death by Muslim extremists in October 1981, his successor, President Hosni Mubarak, seemed determined to calm the hostility toward Egypt in the rest of the Arab world because of its peace treaty with Israel. Relations between Egypt and Israel cooled, especially after the invasion of Lebanon the following year.
The 1977 visit to Jerusalem by Mr. Sadat and the subsequent treaty gave Mr. Begin one of the great satisfactions of his career. He explained his feelings in a forceful and eloquent speech in Parliament that also addressed deeper concerns.
"Why is this peace treaty so important?" he asked. "This is the first peace treaty Israel ever signed, the first peace treaty after five wars in which we have lost 12,000 of our people. Our aim, our yearning and our dream is to smash this helix of hatred. We must sign this treaty because it is a human act of the highest degree."
At the White House signing, Mr. Begin said it was "the third greatest day of my life" -- after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the unification of Jerusalem in the 1967 war.
The Israeli leader was seeking to place the signing into the historical context of his life, a life that until 1977 had been spent almost entirely in opposition -- to the mainstream of Jews in his native Poland, to both the German and Russian invaders of his homeland in World War II, to the established leaders of the Jewish military struggle against British rule in Palestine and to the decades of Labor Party government in Israel.
 
A Zionism Forged By Bible and Holocaust
 He believed fiercely, and contentiously, that the Jews had a right to a national homeland and that it should range over the land of their biblical forebears. This was Zion and he was a dedicated Zionist, if a follower of the Zionist Revisionist organization founded by Vladimir Jabotinsky.
Mr. Begin was marked forever by the Holocaust, which had wiped out all vestiges of his former life in Poland. The pursuit of those goals was a thread that ran through his life. He was to he spend much time explaining and trying to justify what some considered extreme actions and statements.
The best-known of those occurred in 1946, when Irgun Zvai Leumi, the underground terrorist faction he headed during the final years of the British mandate in Palestine, blew up a wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the headquarters of the British administrators of Palestine. The attack killed 90 people, among them Jewish and Arab employees as well as British officials.
The most infamous incident was the Irgun's attack on an Arab village, Deir Yassin, in April 1948, in which more than 200 men, women and children were killed.
Two months after that assault, the freighter Altalena, loaded with arms and ammunition and 900 men recruited by the Irgun, came under fire from regular Jewish forces loyal to David Ben-Gurion, by then Prime Minister, who feared that the new Government of Israel might be overthrown or that civil war might break out after the fight against the Arabs was over.
Another, and sometimes rival underground faction, the Stern Gang, was headed by Yitzhak Shamir, who would in time become Mr. Begin's Foreign Minister, and Prime Minister on his resignation.
Mr. Begin struggled fiercely against Mr. Ben-Gurion, the mainstream Zionist leader and head of the regular Jewish force in the fight for nationhood. After independence in 1948, Mr. Ben-Gurion became Israel's first Prime Minister, and their conflict exploded frequently.
 
From Coalition To Opposition
 From 1967 to 1970, Mr. Begin served in a war coalition, then withdrew when Israel began to consider an American proposal that would have linked withdrawal from the occupied territories with peace. In August 1970 he returned to the political opposition.
Mr. Begin, a brilliant speaker and writer, was also an enigma: often soft-spoken, mild- mannered and personable. Yet this slight but firmly built man, who dressed in gray and never lost the hand-kissing tradition of his early years in Poland, was described as having the flinty looks of a movie terrorist.
There was no doubt about his dramatic flair. Once during a speech in the immigrant quarter of Jerusalem, he began to describe the "guarantees" for Israel that were being offered by American diplomats seeking to encourage Arab negotiations. His voice rose and his manner grew intense. He pointed higher and higher, as if searching for something, until he had everyone looking skyward.
"Guarantees, guarantees -- maybe there you will find guarantees," he said, adding, as he pointed to the ground, "Not here!"
Early in 1977, with the Labor Government riddled by dissension and tainted, in the view of some, by corruption, Mr. Begin finally achieved the political recognition that had so long eluded him. Though weary from a heart attack two months before the election, he emerged with an upset victory and was asked to form a government.
Several things brought about his victory: The Labor Party had become increasingly identified with worsening inflation, frequent strikes and a stagnant economy. Its scandals led to the creation of the Democratic Movement for Change, which drew a valuable 15 seats of 120 from Labor in the election, and briefly joined the new Likud coalition.
In addition, a "second Israel" of Jews from North Africa and the Middle East, the poor of the cities and new towns, had grown to become the nation's majority, and these people were attracted to Mr. Begin. Despite his European origin, they felt that he, too, had been outside the establishment, and he promised greater militancy toward the Arabs.
Mr. Begin retained power in 1981 after his right-wing Likud bloc emerged with a one-seat lead over the Labor alignment of Shimon Peres. His margin of success came from the religious parties, which enabled him to form a fragile governing coalition.
 
The Old Country Proved a Cruel Home
 Menachem Wolfovitch Begin was born on Aug. 30, 1913, in Brest, when it was still part of the czarist Russian Empire. The area was returned to Poland in 1921, occupied by the Soviet Union in 1939 soon after Hitler's attack on Poland, overrun by the Nazis after Hitler turned on Stalin and attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, and ceded to Moscow in 1945.
Zionism was central to Mr. Begin's childhood. His father, Dov Zeev Begin, had been educated in Berlin and traveled widely for his father, a timber merchant. Dov Begin's travels brought him into contact with Jewish nationalists, the Zionist "heretics," as they were called by the traditionally minded.
Menachem, the youngest of three children, developed an early interest in oratory and made his first speech at the age of 10, in a mixture of Hebrew and Yiddish.
At 15 he joined Betar, the Zionist Revisionists' youth movement, and was trained in the use of weapons. Ten years later, with a law degree from Warsaw University, he headed Betar, which by then had 70,000 members in 600 Polish communities.
"My friends and I labored to educate a generation to be prepared not only to toil for the rebuilding of a Jewish state but also to fight for it, suffer for it and, if needs be, die for it," he said, paraphrasing Jabotinsky.
Mr. Begin fled from Warsaw ahead of the advancing Germans in 1939 and was in Polish-controlled Vilna in 1940 when the Russians occupied the city, now Vilnius, Lithuania. He obtained a visa to go to Palestine but gave it to a friend he thought would have more trouble.
The Russians soon arrested him, accusing him of being a Zionist and a British agent, and sent him to Siberia. His wife, whom he had married a year earlier, went on to Palestine, convinced that she could do nothing to help her husband. Later, she became quietly influential in his political life while remaining out of the limelight. Besides their son, Benjamin, they had two other children -- Hasia and Leah -- and eight grandchildren.
In later years Mr. Begin recalled the interrogations of his Siberian incarceration. They turned on the Russian Revolution, on Britain and Zionism, on Herzl and Jabotinsky.
"From my early youth," Mr. Begin said later, "I had been taught by my father, who went to his death at Nazi hands voicing his faith in God and singing 'Hatikvah,' that we Jews were to return to the land of Israel -- not go, travel or come, but return."
It was a tenet that was to sustain him throughout his life. Nearly four decades later, visiting a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, he would chide reporters for calling the area occupied ("These are liberated territories"), for asking if they would be annexed ("You annex foreign land, not your own country"), and for references to the West Bank ("Say Judea and Samaria," the territories' biblical names).
Though sentenced to eight years in a labor camp, he was released by the Soviet Union in 1941 in an agreement with the Polish government-in-exile that freed 1.5 million Poles. Mr. Begin found his sister, the family's only other survivor, then joined the Free Polish Army. That took him to Iran and to Palestine.
Having learned English by listening to the BBC, he served in the British Army in Palestine as a conscripted interpreter until the end of 1943. Then he took over the leadership of the Irgun underground in the battle for a Zionist homeland.
 
Wanted by British With a $50,000 Bounty
 By 1946 the British authorities were conducting an intensive hunt for the man they described as the "grim-faced, bespectacled Menachem Begin," placing a price of $8,000 on his head. Later, it was raised to $50,000.
The Irgun, often working with weapons and explosives purchased from the Arabs, set about breaking the grip of colonial rule. Mr. Begin, in his book "The Revolt," explained the group's actions this way:
"The arrest of British officers in order to secure the annulment of a death 'sentence,' the arrest of more officers which did not prevent the murder of our captive comrades, the whipping of officers in retaliation for the whipping of our young soldiers, hangings in retaliation for hangings."
In the first elections for Parliament, in January 1949, Mapai, the Labor Party, emerged with 44 seats; the left-wing Mapam won 15, the religious bloc, 16, and Mr. Begin's Herut Party, 14.
Leading the opposition, Mr. Begin called for retaliatory raids against Arab irregulars. He fought bitterly against ties with West Germany and was suspended from Parliament for organizing demonstrations.
He was forever demanding apologies in Parliament and being asked to apologize in turn, sometimes for personal remarks and sometimes for policy statements. He would demand preventive war, for example, only to hear an opponent say that "anyone who does so is a criminal against the Jewish nation." A policy dispute would become personal.
By the time of the 1956 war with Egypt, Mr. Begin's party was the second strongest. With the Israeli move into Sinai, the party lost much of the stigma of extremism, for the war was viewed by many Israelis as the expression of a policy long advocated by Herut.
In 1973, Mr. Begin broke an embargo on domestic criticism of the Government's action in failing to accurately gauge Arab intentions leading to the war. The Arab attack on Yom Kippur, he said, only underscored the need to retain occupied territories.
He resisted every pullback agreement, and in 1975 derided Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger for "telling us to trade territory for legitimacy."
"We don't need legitimacy," Mr. Begin said. "We exist. Therefore we are legitimate."
Although Mr. Begin did in time exchange territory, giving up the Sinai and withdrawing Jewish settlements in return for peace with Egypt, he began as Prime Minister with familiar militancy. He visited a West Bank settlement, Elon Moreh, the day after the 1977 election and declared: "We stand on the land of liberated Israel. There will be many Elon Morehs. There will be many, many settlements in the coming weeks."
In supporting the establishment of West Bank settlements, Mr. Begin made a distinction between those in territory within biblical Israel and those outside, like in Sinai.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Begin became somewhat less outspoken and dramatic, learning to accept the necessary compromises of governing. He drew former opponents into the Cabinet: Moshe Dayan, Defense Minister in Labor Cabinets, became his Foreign Minister, only to resign in October 1979 over relations with the Arabs.
 
Bitter and Painful Years: Lebanon, Wife's Death
 In the 1950's, Mr. Begin had called "every German a Nazi, every German a murderer," but as Prime Minister he congratulated the West Germans for freeing a hijacked Lufthansa airliner in Mogadishu, Somalia, and he met with the West German Ambassador.
Politically, he survived a challenge from the Labor Party a year after he took office. He suffered from diabetes as well as a heart ailment, and there were rumors as early as mid-1979, vigorously denied, that he was working on a reduced schedule. There were calls in Parliament for his resignation, but none was successful and he survived many votes of confidence.
While Israel under Mr. Begin returned the Sinai to Egypt, it seemed to strengthen its hold on the other occupied territories -- principally, the West Bank and the Golan Heights -- through the establishment of the settlements. The first settlements, similar to those under Labor Governments, were isolated defense posts, with armed farmers tilling fields. Later settlements were built nearer Arab towns, and then within them, such as in Hebron. By 1982, about 30,000 Israelis lived on more than 100 such settlements. New highways encouraged commuting from prefabricated towns to jobs in Tel Aviv.
Israel, under Mr. Begin, changed the unit of currency from the pound, a vestige of British rule, to the shekel, a coin used by the ancient Hebrews. And Parliament, under his leadership, formally declared all of Jerusalem, a city divided into Jewish and Arab sectors before the 1967 war, to be the nation's undivided and eternal capital -- an act that was not recognized by most other countries.
Mr. Begin's party was narrowly returned to power in 1981 in an election campaign marked by violence, the first such for Israel. The confrontations often pitted Sephardim, the Jews from the Arab lands who identified with Mr. Begin, against the formerly governing Ashkenazim, those from Europe. These clashes, especially disruptive during the Lebanon war, bespoke a rift in Israel that was to deepen, and would come to fundamentally demark Israeli politics and society.
Lebanon was Mr. Begin's last war, perhaps the most bitter one for him, and the election his last as well.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Assessment;
Super Tuesday Transforms Campaign

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 10

 BODY:
Southern Democratic leaders achieved today what they sought in vain to do four years ago: They gave a mighty heave forward to the Presidential bid of a moderate candidate from their own region.
Whether the heave will prove decisive, and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas will capture the nomination in New York this summer, remains to be seen, of course. But his sweep of the Southern states on Super Tuesday 1992 established him as his party's undisputed front-runner with a big lead in convention delegates and gave him a shot at clinching things for all intents and purposes this month. 
 It was a grim day for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. Having failed even to come close in Florida, the only Southern state where he had a fighting chance, he must now win next week in either Illinois or Michigan, with their big blue-collar voting blocs, both ethnic and black.
Neither today nor in earlier primaries have those voters been much attracted to him, and one of his advisers, Ted van Dyk, said tonight that Mr. Tsongas was facing "a Stalingrad in the Midwest" in whose snows his candidacy could easily perish.
The Democrats' system of proportional representation insured the former Senator, even in defeat, of some delegates from all the major Super Tuesday states. Even if he lost both Michigan and Illinois, he would probably get delegates there, too, and Mr. Clinton would not be able to put a mathematical lock on the nomination until many more states had voted.
But without at least one victory in the big Great Lakes states next week, Mr. Tsongas would run short of money quickly and Mr. Clinton might look unstoppable. Mr. Tsongas's next chance to win a dramatic, image-reversing victory would not come for three weeks, in the New York primary on April 7.
The question that lurked in many minds, even as Mr. Clinton won six primaries in the South, including the hard-fought contest in Florida, was whether the Democrats were playing into the Republicans' hands. The Arkansas Governor, in the view of many political professionals, would be highly vulnerable to assault by the Republicans this fall because of questions about his extramarital relations, his draft status during the Vietnam war and his financial dealings while Governor.
"He looks like Jack Dempsey at the moment," said a Senator from a border state, "but the Republicans haven't started punching yet."
 
Situation in the Fall
 Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston, said that "fear about jobs trumps concerns about character in really hard times." But with Mr. Clinton as its nominee and the economy ticking along a bit better, he continued, the Democratic Party might find itself this fall "having problems not with its message but with its messenger."
As if in response to such comments, Mr. Clinton said in a victory speech in Chicago tonight, "The true measure of character in politics can never be perfection, because if it were, no one could pass."
President Bush also won everywhere in the South, but once again, he failed to decisively dispatch his main challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan. In the two electoral powerhouses of the region, Texas and Florida, the President once again lost 30 to 35 percent of the vote, as he has around the country. Only in Tennessee was Mr. Bush able to overwhelm his rival's protest votes.
As a result, he is closer to the nomination, in a numerical sense, but no closer to party mastery.
Voters who backed Mr. Buchanan in Texas and Florida were mostly people who think the economy is stumbling, who are angry about Mr. Bush's breaking his pledge not to increase taxes and who want "to shake things up." But nowhere were there enough of them to put him close to victory, and Republican Congressional leaders began urging Mr. Buchanan tonight to fold his campaign.
In this campaign as in most, expectations and perceptions play a large part, and at the moment they are working against Mr. Bush and for Mr. Clinton. For the President to lose a third of the vote in state after state, most of it to a television commentator who has never run for office, seems a signal of weakness to many. But for Mr. Clinton, a much less well-known figure than Mr. Bush, winning 50 or 60 percent of the vote constitutes quite a success.
 
Why Super Tuesday
 Super Tuesday was created as an antidote to the tendency of early-voting states to make inevitable the nomination of liberals like former Senator George McGovern, in 1972, and former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, in 1984. Convinced that they were unelectable, the Southerners grouped their primaries early in the political year as a means of getting leverage. But in 1988 the Southern hope, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, was buried in the South by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, both liberals.
Mr. Clinton learned something from Mr. Gore's experience. Although he never seemed likely to beat Senator Tom Harkin in Iowa and knew he faced a fight from Mr. Tsongas in New Hampshire, he plunged into a number of early tests, unlike Mr. Gore, who hung back until Super Tuesday, allowing his rivals to become far better known.
Even when he was taking a daily battering in the newspapers and on television on the character issue, even when it was all but impossible to get any attention for his substantive points, Mr. Clinton gritted his teeth and carried on, knowing that every day brought him closer to the South.
Like Mr. Dukakis, he invested money and manpower in Florida and Texas, creating an organization that Mr. Tsongas, like Mr. Gore before him, could not match.
Mr. Tsongas lacked a skill that proved valuable to Mr. Dukakis: his ability to appeal in Spanish to Hispanic voters. Mr. Dukakis scored heavily among such voters four years ago, but a poll of Texas voters leaving the booths by Voter Research and Surveys, a cooperative venture by four television networks, showed Mr. Tsongas gaining the support of only about 20 percent of the Hispanic electorate.
Surprisingly, the same survey showed Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton splitting the Jewish votes in Florida, one of the main building blocks of the Dukakis victory here in 1988. Mr. Clinton had sought to convince Jewish retirees, of whom tens of thousands are clustered in South Florida, that the former Senator was lukewarm in his support of Israel and Social Security.
In some ways, Florida was a demographically ideal state for Mr. Tsongas, certainly far more suited to him than Illinois or Michigan, with their urban wards filled with Polish-, Ukrainian- and Italian-Americans.
According to the exit poll, more than 60 percent of the participants in the Democratic primary in Florida had some college education. Those were the kinds of voters among whom the former Senator had done best in previous elections. He easily carried those with undergradute and graduate degrees, but Mr. Clinton trounced him among the large group with only some college.
In the end, Mr. Clinton appeared to have won the bitter debate over whose economic plan would do more for the country; in both Texas and Florida, the Governor got a majority of the votes of those who said they thought the economy was in poor shape.
About 20 percent of the voters in the Democratic primaries said that Mr. Clinton's draft experiences made them think less of him, and it cost him some support. Even so, he managed to capitalize on an electoral schedule that was created to help put someone like himself in the White House.
Mr. Clinton's sweeping triumph in the day's eight primaries, broken only by Mr. Tsongas's victories in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, means trouble not only for Mr. Tsongas but also for the third Democratic contender, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California. He, too, needs to make a better showing next Tuesday than he did today to avoid seeming irrelevant.
A handful of influential figures will now come into focus as power brokers in the Democratic race.
One is Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, a less commanding presence than his father, but still, even without a machine, a good man to have on one's side. Another will be Mayor Coleman Young of Detroit, one of the nation's leading black politicians. And then there are the leaders of the trade unions who had been backing Mr. Harkin before he pulled out and who are now hard-pressed to find a candidate.
Mr. Tsongas has offended organized labor by advocating the right of companies to hire permanent replacement workers for striking employees. And Mr. Clinton, who comes from a right-to-work state, has never been popular with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. at home, which accuses him of promoting low-paying jobs.
Although Mr. Brown causes labor few ideological problems, he is a long way stylistically from the kind of lunch-bucket voter the unions represent.
Owen Bieber, the head of the United Auto Workers, rattled by news of plant closings at General Motors and by the slump at all of the Big Three manufacturers, has kept his counsel so far. But the 15 national unions that had backed Mr. Harkin are planning to meet Thursday to see if they can agree on a new candidate.
Both Jay Mazur, the president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and William Bywater, president of the electrical workers, have suggested that labor would eventually see Mr. Clinton as the lesser of two evils. But if their support is lukewarm, it may produce few votes for him.

HEADLINE: Nixon's 'Save Russia' Memo: Bush Feels the Sting

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
By warning that the United States has provided "pathetically" insufficient assistance to Russia, former President Richard M. Nixon has stung the Bush Administration and focused attention on an issue that the Administration and Congress have been hesitating to address for months.
President Bush's discomfort was evident today when he was asked about Mr. Nixon's critique just before a meeting with Republican leaders. First, Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Nixon had spoken and they were actually in total agreement. Then Mr. Bush said his Administration had already done a great deal -- contradicting Mr. Nixon's whole critique. 
 In arguing forcefully that the Administration is missing the opportunity of the century to transform Russia into a democracy, Mr. Nixon has raised the possibility of a "who lost Russia" debate if the infant democratic institutions in Russia and other former Soviet republics are toppled.
That is perhaps the worst fear of senior Administration officials: that all their foreign policy successes -- from German unification to the gulf war -- could be washed away in assertions that they "lost Russia" if President Boris N. Yeltsin is ousted by hard-liners.
 
'Who Lost Russia?'
 As Mr. Nixon put it in his memorandum circulated to foreign-policy analysts: "The hot-button issue in the 1950's was 'Who lost China?' If Yeltsin goes down, the question 'Who lost Russia' will be an infinitely more devastating issue in the 1990's."
That is a question that virtually every policymaker in this Administration has in the back of the mind. While they will never say so publicly, officials acknowledge that they could be vulnerable to a harsh historical judgment on whether they did enough to insure that the democratic revolution in Russia led by Mr. Yeltsin succeeds. Even those who favor Mr. Bush's cautious approach say they know that if Mr. Yeltsin goes down they will be blamed.
Mr. Nixon, of course, is an expert in "Who lost . . ." arguments, and he knows their political power. It was he and a coterie of post World War II Republicans who began their political careers by leveling such arguments against government officials who they said were responsible for letting China slip into Communism. And yet it was Mr. Nixon who also understood the power of reversing himself in reopening relations with China 25 years later.
The response of Bush Administration officials up to now has been to suppress any fears and try to make as much as possible out of the relatively little that the Administration has done. But at the same time, they are refraining from asking Congress or the American taxpayers for anything more substantial, which they consider politically unwise at this time, and are somehow hoping that Mr. Yeltsin will muddle through.
 
Democrats Back Memo
 Speaking to reporters today at a White House meeting of Republican leaders, Mr. Bush defended the Administration's record, which Mr. Nixon described as "penny ante."
"There are certain fiscal financial constraints on what we can do, but we have a huge stake in the success of democracy in Russia and in the other C.I.S. countries," said Mr. Bush, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent of States. "And so we will be working in every way possible to support the forces of democracy. Certainly we've done a lot in terms of supporting the people that might be afflicted by starvation, real hunger, and similarly on medicine. So there's a lot of taxpayer money going into this already -- a lot of it in terms of guarantees for agricultural products, which was their emergency requirement."
Speaking generally of the Nixon memo, Mr. Bush said, "I didn't take it as personally critical, and I think he would reiterate that it wasn't."
Mr. Nixon's critique has won the respect even of some Democrats, or as Senator Joseph R. Biden, chairman of the Senate Europe subcommittee put it: "It seems to occur randomly, but this time Mr. Nixon has it right. What we need from the Bush Administration is a comprehensive plan to buttress democracy from Prague to Vladivostok. I have urged Secretary Baker to submit such plans to Congress and I have pledged to support the Administration in the bipartisan spirit that these crucial issues demand."
 
'They're Afraid'
 Yet Democratic Presidential candidates have not shown much enthusiasm for spending a great deal of money at the moment to support Russian reforms, and tend to get a little vague when the issue is raised.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, asked about the Nixon memo, said: "I think Baker and Bush have good instincts on what to do in the former Soviet republics, but I think they've been a little too timid in doing it. I think they know they ought to be with the republics. They know they ought to be trying to dismantle nuclear weapons. They know they ought to be trying to help convert the currency, but I think they're just a little timid on it. I think they're afraid of looking like they're too preoccupied with foreign policy."
Brad Mackenzie, assistant press secretary for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, said the candidate's position is that given the enormous amount of money spent during the cold war to counter Communism, the least the United States could do now is to take $2 billion immediately out of the defense budget and put it into a large-scale humanitarian effort to get the former Soviet republics through the winter.
Over the long term, he said, Mr. Tsongas supports the establishment of an "Executive Peace Corps," that would be made up of retired businessmen and entreprenuers who would go to Russia and other republics to help new capitalist enterprises there.
 
Talks Wwwith I.M.F.
 Asked where Mr. Tsongas stood on the big ticket item -- the question of the United States contributing to a multi-billion dollar fund to stabilize the Russian ruble, an essential ingredient for economic reform there, Mr. Mackenzie said, "We are taking a look at that, but don't have a position yet."
While that debate was swirling in Washington, Konstantin Kagalovsky, Mr. Yeltsin's chief negotiator with the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions, was just completing a round of negotiations at the fund's headquarters here on Russia's financial needs.

HEADLINE: Cuba Seeks Friends and Tourists in Caribbean

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica

 BODY:
For many in the Caribbean, the most readily visible face of Cuba was long represented by olive-green military advisers, or young bearded doctors sent abroad from Havana to share the fruits of the revolution in the hopes that others might deecide to emulate it.
But as leaders of the English-speaking Caribbean gathered here recently to discuss issues of common concern like tourism and regional economic integration, they were joined by what Havana hopes will rapidly take hold as its new image. 
 As they have at other recent regional meetings, nattily attired Cuban officials worked the hallways here at a February summit of Caricom, as the Caribbean Community is known, buttonholing business leaders, exploring investment possibilities and renewing political contacts that have in many cases lay dormant for years.
Cuba's rediscovery of the Caribbean has become a centerpiece of Havana's high-priority push to build bridges to the rest of the hemisphere at a time when the island needs new friends.
And after years of wariness toward Cuba, at least in part for fear of invoking Washington's displeasure, many of the Caribbean's leaders are tentatively reciprocating Havana's interest.
"There is quite a widespread view that we would like to see some measure of reintegration of Cuba," Prime Minister Michael N. Manley of Jamaica said. "We are a democracy and they are not, but we have always felt it was good to cooperate in ways that do not compromise our principles."
Mr. Manley's friendship with Cuba brought him Washington's hostility from when he previously served as Prime Minister in the 1970's, but he and other Caribbean leaders suggested that with most of the region consisting of democracies that are pursuing free-market style reforms, contact with Cuba no longer araouses the same suspicion it once did.
With its sugar industry in serious decline, the cooperation that most interests Havana involves finding ways to tap into the Caribbean's multi-billion-dollar tourism industry.
Deprived of regular airline connections with the United States, which were severed as part of Washington's three decade-long embargo, Cuba is seeking to help its travel industry by building links to other Caribbean islands in the hope that more vacationers, including Americans, will take side trips to the island.
Already, in the last year Cuba's strategy has produced payoffs in the form of hotel investment from Jamaica and both chartered and scheduled flights with a growing number of islands, including the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica.
"We have always felt the solution for tourism is to create a regional market," Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi of Cuba said.
But Cuba's full-scale integration into the region, whether in tourism or other areas, has been blocked by factors ranging from hard feelings that date to the island's former interventionist policies to concern for human rights and an eagerness in many Caribbean capitals to avoid incurring the displeasure of Washington by granting Havana too many favors.
Some participants at the Caribbean meeting, however, invoked fear of economic competition from a tourism- and investment-hungry post-Castro Cuba, the region's largest country, to explain their hesitation about accepting Havana's overtures.
Others said Cuba is aproaching what could be a dramatic transition and they preferred taking a wait-and-see attitude before significantly altering their attitude toward the island.
"If it were a transition to a market economy and liberal democracy, I think Caricom would be very eager to help Cuba," said Sir Shridath Ramphal of Guyana, who is head of the West Indian Commission, a Caribbean Community advisory group. "But right now I don't quite see how we could."
Others, however, said that far from fearing the competitive consequences of Cuban liberalization, if it were to come, Caribbean investors should scout opportunities in Cuba now before a change of government or economic policy attracts large corporations that would leave them little place.

HEADLINE: Tight Budgets Bring Abandonment of Pets

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
As the region's economy continues to sputter, increasing numbers of household pets are being turned over to animal shelters, animal-welfare officials say.
"People who have lost jobs are saying they can't afford their pets anymore," said Marc Paulhus, a vice president of the Humane Society of the United States. "In the last six months, we've heard from animal shelters that an increased number of animals are being turned over because of direct or secondary effects of the recession."
 
Statistics Are Scarce
 Statistics on the abandonment of pets are scarce. But the Bide-a-Wee Home Association, which operates three shelters in Manhattan and on Long Island, said 1,701 animals were given up for adoption from September through February, compared with 1,295 in the comparable period last year, a 31 percent rise. As a result, for the first time Bide-a-Wee now has a two- to three-month waiting period for accepting animals for adoption, said George Wirt, a spokesman. 
 At the Central Westchester Humane Society in Elmsford, N.Y., "More people are coming in, saying 'I can't afford to feed them,' or 'My animal is ill, so I can't afford the vet bills,' " said Mimi Stone, the director. "For people who have been laid off, pets seem to be the first thing to go. They say they have to feed their children."
Animal-shelter directors say older animals, which are prone to illness, and large dogs, which can eat as much as 30 pounds of food a week, are the ones most likely to be dropped off at shelters.
Although pet-food costs may seem nominal, feeding several pets can be expensive, and veterinarians' bills can be overwhelming, pet owners say. These can be as much as $50 for an office visit, $100 a year for rabies or feline-leukemia inoculations, $150 for spaying and many times that amount for surgery.
 
Feeding 4 Dogs and 6 Birds
 "Dog food is 79 cents a can, and with vet costs, I spend $2,000 a year," said Miriam MacGregor, who lives in Milford, Conn., with her four Shih Tzus. Because she is on a limited income since her husband's death, she said, she has cut her dogs' daily rations in half.
Mrs. MacGregor, who also has five parakeets and a cockatiel, has been able to keep her pets with the help of a pet-food bank that recently began operating at a center for the elderly in Milford. In this makeshift adjunct to an existing food bank, bags of Natural Life dry dog food and cans of 9 Lives cat food are piled high beside shelves stocked with canned vegetables and boxes of macaroni and powdered milk.
"With the recession and the new state income tax, we're concerned that people who are so marginally surviving are probably sharing their food with their pets," said Kathi McDonnell-Bissell, a founder of the pet-food bank and executive director of the Milford Council on Aging.
"Originally our concern was mainly for the elderly," she said. "But now, it's reaching across the board. The elderly only account for about three percent of those who come to the food bank. We're seeing people with three mortgages, single parents, people in their 30's, 40's and 50's, who are so embarrassed they can't look you in the face when they come in for food."
 
Feelings of Shame
 Linda Reilly, who also lives in Milford, acknowledged that she felt some shame about coming to the pet-food bank with her 12-year-old poodle, Martea. But even though she buys generic dog food and feeds Martea table scraps, her $422 a month in public assistance still makes it hard to find money to spend on her aging pet's veterinary bills.
"People who have had pets for years that then get sick are broken-hearted at the cost of veterinary care," said Kathy Johnson, director of the Bergen County Humane Society/Lost Pet Inc., a nonprofit group in Hackensack, N.J. "Vets aren't cutting their prices or trying to help. They aren't even giving us discounts."
To Ms. Johnson, one of the most disturbing trends is the increase in the number of pet owners who are forced to give up their animals because they have been evicted for failing to pay their rent. Just last week, her organization had five animals put up for adoption by people being evicted in Bergen County, she said.
As far as pets' being dumped in parks or along roads, the evidence is contradictory. While some animal shelters say they are picking up more stray dogs and cats, others say the number of roaming dogs has actually declined.
"The number of strays we pick up has increased slightly," said Patricia Liptak, the Milford Animal Shelter warden. "What really surprises me is that we're now seeing a lot of pure breeds being found."
What becomes of pets given up for adoption varies quite starkly. In general, public dog pounds and local chapters of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals can sometimes keep animals alive for only a few days because of the sheer volume of animals they handle, although these organizations usually provide care for as long several weeks. In New York City, about three-fourths of the 59,000 animals turned in to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were "euthanized" last year, said Herman Cohen, executive vice president of the national organization. Humane societies and other "no kill" shelters like Bide-a-Wee keep animals alive until they are adopted.

HEADLINE: A University Provost Is Named at Harvard

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The president of Harvard University, Neil L. Rudenstine, has appointed a provost to oversee academic planning and fund-raising for the university's 11 schools, fulfilling a promise he made when he became president last July.
The new provost is Jerry R. Green, a professor of economics at Harvard, who becomes the second to hold the post in Harvard's 356-year history. 
 The appointment of a provost, or universitywide academic administrator, is a major change for Harvard, which has long been characterized by its decentralized organization. Each of Harvard's schools and colleges, including the undergraduate college, the business school, the law school and the medical school, is responsible for its own finances and academic decisions.
While each school will remain independent, the provost will oversee academic planning between schools and help establish interdisciplinary curriculums as well as organize joint fund-raising ventures for universitywide improvements, said Mr. Rudenstine, a former provost himself at Princeton University.
Most universities have provosts, but Harvard had one only from 1945 to 1953, when major changes at the university, including coeducation, required more cooperation between departments.
"The major public policy problems of the day require cooperation between disciplines," said the 45-year-old Mr. Green.

HEADLINE: '91 Productivity Gain Was First in 3 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Helped by a surge in the fourth quarter, America's non-farm productivity last year grew for the first time in three years, as businesses tried to maintain output with a smaller work force during the recession, Government figures showed today.
Productivity rose 1.7 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and three-tenths of 1 percent for the full year, the Labor Department said. The yearly figure was higher than the Government's last estimate of a two-tenths of 1 percent gain. 
 "In the midst of a recession, employers try to get by with fewer people," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "This was especially true for 1991, when we tried to shed some of the fat we acquired in the 1980's."
 
More Improvement Seen
 Some analysts said productivity would continue to improve modestly as the economy strengthened.
Norman Robertson, an economist with the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said he expected significant improvement in manufacturing productivity in the second half of this year.
Others were not so sure. Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington economic forecasting company, said growth would be restrained by a lack of business investment in new equipment, a decline in education and a rash of inhibiting Government regulations.
The Labor Department said the 1991 gain in productivity was the first for a full year since a nine-tenths of 1 percent rise in 1988. Productivity fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in 1989 and one-tenth of 1 percent in 1990 as the economy slid into recession.
Increased productivity, defined as getting more output per hour of work, is considered vital to increasing Americans' standard of living without increasing inflation. It also helps the competitiveness of United States goods overseas. Exports are one of the few strengths in the economy as it wrestles with the recession.
Annual productivity growth averaged 2.4 percent in the 1960's, 1.3 percent in the 1970's and eight-tenths of 1 percent in the 1980's.
Last year's fourth-quarter productivity growth of 1.7 percent followed an increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter and a 1.9 percent gain in the second quarter.
The full-year increase resulted from a 1.6 percent drop in output at the same time that the number of hours worked fell 1.8 percent.
Full-year manufacturing productivity increased faster than that of non-farm workers generally. It rose 1.4 percent in 1991, after an advance of 2.5 percent in 1990.
Output rose at a six-tenths of 1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, while the number of hours worked fell at a 1.1 percent rate. Fourth-quarter productivity growth was initially reported to have been 1.1 percent.
Productivity of factory workers rose at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a 4 percent gain during the previous three months.
Total business productivity, including farming, was up two-tenths of 1 percent for the year, matching the growth in 1990. It rose at a 2.2 percent rate during the October-December period, compared with 1.1 percent from July through September.
The report also showed that unit labor costs, a key barometer of business costs, increased 3.7 percent among non-farm workers in 1991, well below the 5.3 percent increase in 1990 and the smallest rise since 1988.

HEADLINE: For Some in U.S., Peace In Salvador Brings Fear

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAKOMA PARK, Md.

 BODY:
Six weeks after the war ended in El Salvador, tens of thousands of Salvadorans in the United States are worried that peace may make their already tenuous position here even worse.
"Everyone is shaking," said Manfredo Granados, a 31-year-old refugee in the Washington suburb of Langley Park, Md. "People don't know what is going to happen to them." 
 Despite lives of poverty and longing for family and friends left behind, the refugees are not ready to return home and are not sure they will ever be. The Government of El Salvador also prefers that they stay away because they send back millions of dollars that the country desperately needs and because the country can barely take care of the people already there.
The Salvadoran Government estimates that the refugees sent back about $700 million last year, financing an estimated 60 percent of all home purchases in the country. The Salvadoran Ambassador to the United States, Miguel Salaverria, said the total was more than the foreign aid from the United States or the profits of El Salvador's largest industry, agriculture.
 
For a Time, No Fears
 At the end of 1990, about one in five Salvadorans in this country, 186,000, signed up for an 18-month safe haven, offered because of the civil war. Some had survived as illegal aliens in the United States for as long as 10 years, but the temporary residency freed them from fears of being deported. It also gave them work permits that made it a easier to look for jobs, typically as dishwashers, housekeepers and other low-paying occupations.
This safe haven, officially known as "temporary protected status," is scheduled to expire June 30, and many Salvadorans believe that the cease-fire, which took effect Feb. 1, will prevent it from being extended. The Justice Department, which oversees the Immigration and Naturalization Service, declined to comment on its plans.
Last month the immigration service began warning the Salvadoran refugees with temporary residency status, ordering them "to show cause for why you should not be deported." Although it says hearings will not begin until next year, the wording in large type at the top of the page -- "Warrant for arrest of alien" -- has spread panic.
Mr. Granados said he did not worry about deportation before he signed up for temporary residency. "But this is different," he said. "Now the I.N.S. knows where to find me."
To register for the temporary protected status, Mr. Granados and others had to give their names, addresses and other personal information to the immigration service. Every six months, they must return to an immigration office to update it.
Mr. Granados, a construction worker who came to the United States in 1983, said he signed up for the temporary status when he was having difficulty finding a permanent full-time job and his wife was expecting a child. It did little good; he still works only part-time.
"I have a lot of friends who are now saying 'I told you so,' " Mr. Granados said. "People think there's going to be a mass deportation, like the Haitians."
But Duke Austin, a spokesman for the immigration service, dismissed the fears of a mass deportation as "ridiculous," saying the agency cannot round up 186,000 people.
 
'Be Pacing the Floor'
 Attorney General William P. Barr could still choose to extend the safe haven for Salvadorans. In recent months, Mr. Barr has granted temporary residency to people from three other countries that have been embroiled in civil wars: Lebanon, Liberia and Somalia. But he has denied it to the Haitians and refused to extend it for the Kuwaitees.
James McGovern, an aide to Representative Joe Moakley, the Massachusetts Democrat who is widely credited with gaining passage of the special status legislation, said, "If I were a Salvadoran, I'd be pacing the floor."
He went on: "The whole thrust of the temporary protected status is that you're here because there's a reason not to send you back. If there's peace, and it looks like it's for real, the justification is no longer there."
The Salvadoran Government and leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front signed the peace agreement on Jan. 16. It ended a 12-year war that left more than 75,000 people dead and was marked by a series of tragedies, from the assasination of the Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 to the murders of five Jesuit priests in 1989.
Mr. Salaverria, El Salvador's Ambassador to the United States, said his Government had requested an extension of the safe haven because the arrival of thousands of refugees could harm the Salvadoran economy and thus "would endanger the peace process."
"The Salvadorans who live abroad are a strong part of our economy," Mr. Salaverria said. "They are the middle class upon which we will build a strong democracy."
Opponents of an extension said jobs should not be used as foreign aid, and they called the plea for temporary residency a ploy by the Salvadorans to achieve permanent residency status.
"They're being disingenuous," said Alan C. Nelson, a former Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now a consultant to the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which opposes letting the Salvadorans stay. "They think that they can chip away at the laws until they can stay permanently."
"Things may not be perfect in El Salvador now, but most of the world is fragile," Mr. Nelson said. "What do you do? Not require them to go back?"
In interviews with two dozen Salvadoran refugees from across the United States, all said that they planned to remain in this country for the next few years. They said that El Salvador, devestated by bombings and the cost of waging a long war, offered them little opportunity for work.
The refugees also described their difficult lives in the United States: they share crowded homes, go years without seeing parents and spouses and spend much of their days looking for work. Several refugees told of households where a half-dozen or more people used the beds during the night, only to give them up to another group in the morning who had worked night shifts.
"Everybody feels fearful about what's going to happen," said Gloria M., 30, a refugee who would not give her last name because she did not want to draw the immigration service's attention. "I miss my country, but I honestly don't want to go home. It's difficult here, but we're comfortable."
Another refugee, Juan A., a 42-year-old janitor in Takoma Park, said he would lose his work permit if his temporary residency status ended. That, in turn, would mean that he could not legally keep his $18,000-a-year job as a janitor at a local church and that he might have to stop sending the monthly $300 checks to relatives in El Salvador that helped them put a new roof and walls on a house that had been strafed with machine gun fire and hit by mortar shells.
Although Juan's wife and other children remain in El Salvador, it is hard for him to imagine returning to live among the people who, he said, fired bullets through his door and then threatened him with death.
"When I left El Salvador in 1985, a life was not worth more than a penny," he said. "I want to go back, but it is too soon. The peace agreement is still only a piece of paper. I want to save some money. I want my son to graduate high school."

HEADLINE: The View From the Bench;
Once a Prosecutor, Now a Federal Judge: A Harried but Happy Life in the Law

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
At 5 A.M., he wakes to down a bowl of cold cereal in an otherwise sleeping house in the remote northern suburbs. By 6:05 he is on his Metro-North train, another harried commuter balancing legal briefs and statute books on his lap.
A little more than an hour later he is waiting on the Grand Central subway platform for a No. 4 or No. 5 express to Brooklyn Bridge, and by 7:30 he is at his desk on the fifth floor of the columned United States Court House on Foley Square, sipping from a container of steaming tea. 
 So begins another workday for Louis J. Freeh, the newest Federal District Judge in the Southern District of New York, another day of juggling accident claims, prisoner lawsuits and criminal charges -- another day in the making of a judge.
 
A Basement Courtroom
 It is a day that will see him exiled once again to a temporary basement courtroom while his is torn apart for renovation. It is day that will be filled with the intricacies of civil law, a noontime three-mile run, a jury trial, last-minute plea talks and ultimately, a missed train home.
To follow the 42-year-old former Federal prosecutor and F.B.I. agent through a random day is to gain an unusual glimpse into the harried and hallowed life of a special kind of public servant -- a judge who need never fear unemployment but who must deal short-handed with a backlogged court calendar, a man who has spent a career in law but is now viewing the system through the fresh eyes of a rookie.
Sometimes it seems as if Judge Freeh is drowning in the minutiae of disputes that are more appropriate for a rural justice of the peace or a psychotherapist to resolve than a Federal judge. But he claims, with persuasive enthusiasm, to find every case absorbing. "Being a trial judge is the greatest," he exulted during a series of interviews since taking the bench in September. "There's something about the ebb and flow of human events, ordinary and sublime, all the different hues of human nature."
His is a road that other nominees are likely soon to tread. Four more candidates -- including the latest, Richard Conway Casey, 59, a blind lawyer who would be the first judge with such a disability on the Federal bench -- are in various stages of confirmation for lifetime appointments to the Southern District bench, where 7 of the 28 seats are vacant.
For most of the judges in the eight-county region from Manhattan north to Dutchess County, the civil caseload exceeds 300 in addition to criminal trials and motions. One overburdened judge was recently clocked with a civil caseload approaching 500.
 
Impressive Credentials
 Judge Freeh (pronounced FREE) comes to the job with impressive credentials, colleagues agree. He went from Rutgers Law School to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where from 1976 to 1980 he helped run the waterfront racketeering investigation that convicted the former longshore boss Anthony Scotto and more than 125 labor leaders, shipping executives and underworld figures.
In 1983, having left the bureau to become an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, he headed the prosecution team that severed a billion-dollar Sicilian Mafia heroin ring. The case became known as the "pizza connection" because of the ring's use of pizza parlors to mask drug trafficking. And last year he served as the special Justice Department deputy who built a complex circumstantial case to convict a Georgia man, Walter Leroy Moody Jr., in the mail-bomb murders of a Federal appeals court judge and a civil rights lawyer.
He took the bench admittedly wary of still thinking like a prosecutor and struggling to master the complexities of civil law that are new to a longtime criminal litigator. There have been some gaffes. Barely a month into his appointment, he was listening to a lawyer's motion when he announced, "The Government will grant your application."
There was a puzzled silence until the lawyer asked, "You mean the court?"
"The court," Judge Freeh said. "The court."
Admittedly wobbly in what he called "the interstices of the civil docket," he pores over civil statute books in spare moments. He has also collected catalogues listing how-to manuals and pamphlets and tapes from the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, resources with titles like: "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Hearsay But Were Afraid to Ask," "The Art of Judging," and "How to Remember Names and Faces."
 
Oral Arguments on Mondays
 While the job has meant a rise in status and a raise to $129,500 a year, from the $96,000 he was paid as a Government attorney, much about him has not changed, longtime associates say.
Athletically built with closely cropped hair and dark-hollowed eyes, he still wears scuffed shoes, starts work compulsively early, eats lunch at his desk or at a Chinatown pizza parlor, worries about not spending enough time with his wife and three young sons, and speaks with an adenoidal Jersey City accent that turns "time" into "toyme," "job" into "jawb," "court" into "koo-urt" and "law" into "lohr."
A recent day began with Judge Freeh's courtroom deputy, Paul Blumberg, a 12-year court veteran at age 38, heralding the judge's arrival at his temporary basement courtroom No. 35 with three hearty slaps on the door and a robust "All rise."
From Judge Edward J. Devitt, a mentor and the senior district judge in Minnesota who presided over the mail-bomb case after a change of venue from Georgia, Judge Freeh has adopted the method of hearing oral arguments on Mondays. A case is never as fresh as when both sides argue it out in court, he said.
Before coming to court, Judge Freeh had read all the briefs pertaining to the day's cases and discussed them with his two 28-year-old law clerks, Burke Doar, who had worked briefly in the organized crime unit of the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, and Eileen Minnefor, a Harvard Law School graduate who had previously clerked for a New Jersey Supreme Court justice.
First before him was a motion to dismiss a lawsuit over a three-year-old truck accident on the Cross Bronx Expressway. The case had landed in Federal Court because the two trucks involved came from different states. The Founding Fathers thought that a state court might not give an out-of-stater a fair shake so they gave the Federal courts jurisdiction over all civil suits above a threshold, now $50,000, in which the parties come from different states. The doctrine is known as "diversity."
When one lawyer started arguing particulars, Judge Freeh cut him off. "I know the underlying facts," he said drily. "Why don't you discuss the legal issues?" He later ruled from the bench that the diversity doctrine did not apply and remanded the case to State Supreme Court.
 
Discussion With Decorators
 Then there was a lawsuit about a bicycle accident that hinged on whether the plaintiff had been a resident of Indiana and whether Indiana law applied at the time of the injury. He put the parties on the "ready trial" calendar, subject to 48-hour call.
After lunch, Judge Freeh took his daily run, a route he varies day to day for security reasons.
He ate his lunch, a bologna sandwich, banana and bottle of mineral water, while discussing legal points of a liability case with his clerks. A former manager of B. Altman, who had a chair collapse from under her two and a half years ago, was suing the department store, which has since gone out of business, and the out-of-state chair manufacturer.
In two hours he and the lawyers selected a six-member civil jury with six alternates and began the trial. There was a flurry of excitement as the accused -- the chair -- was wheeled in.
The trial was adjourned for the day at 5 P.M. Judge Freeh was wrapping up when Mr. Blumberg said the lawyer for a defendant in a large drug conspiracy case had arrived with his client and the prosecutor to offer a guilty plea.
The judge re-robed and called home. "Hello darling, I'm going to take a plea in one of the cases so I'm going to be late." Pause. "Yeah, this is one of the cases, so I'd better take it." Pause. "No, not real late." Pause. "The boys O.K.?" "Ah, that's cute."
Back in the courtroom, there were two lawyers, each claiming to represent the defendant. Each had a different view of the proposed deal. "I think you have to do more homework," Judge Freeh said.
"You're quite right, your honor," said one of the lawyers. "I'm sorry, your honor," said the other.
"I just missed my train," said Judge Freeh.

HEADLINE: Bond Broker Is Target Of Inquiry

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City is investigating whether the investment bank underwriting $1 billion worth of city debt improperly bought city bonds with the intent of selling them back to the city at a premium, officials said yesterday.
The focus of the investigation is the First Boston Corporation. In late February, the company bought $13 million of $84 million of bonds that the city planned to repurchase. That could have given First Boston a profit at the expense of the city. 
 As the city's main underwriter of the bond transaction, First Boston is responsible for insuring that the city obtains the best possible deal on both the sale of the new bonds and repurchase of the outstanding debt. City officials are counting on the proceeds from the bond transaction to help reduce the city's swelling budget deficits.
At issue here is whether First Boston violated its fiduciary duty to the city by failing to disclose its purchase of the bonds quickly and whether First Boston intended to sell the bonds back to its client at a premium.
It would be a major embarrassment to Mayor David N. Dinkins if the city's investigation determines that First Boston had acted improperly, as Mr. Dinkins is a close friend of Ron Gault, a top official in First Boston's public finance division. Mr. Gault declined to comment on the inquiry last night.
 
Repurchase Plan
 The investigation of First Boston by the city's bond counsel -- Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett, Smith -- involves a series of financial transactions that First Boston is undertaking on the city's behalf to decrease the interest that the city pays on $84 million worth of taxable bonds. Under the transaction the city will use proceeds from an offering of more than $1 billion in bonds issued at low interest rates to repurchase the $84 million worth of bonds at a higher interest rate. The transactions were expected to save the city about $100 million.
But First Boston insists that it bought the bonds for the city, with the city's permission, and that it planned to sell them back to the city at cost. City officials said, however, First Boston did not notify them of its purchase.
Records from the investment bank are ambiguous, city officials said yesterday. They ask why it took First Boston several days to report the multimillion-dollar purchase to the city if it was being done on the city's behalf. That failure has created suspicions among many city finance officials that First Boston may have been trying to profit from the buyback.
The city has also investigated whether First Boston misappropriated information not available to the public for use in making its decision to buy the $13 million in bonds. The city's Corporation Counsel, F. Peter Sherwood, said last night that the city has concluded that no insider trading occurred.
 
Seeking the Motivation
 But Mr. Sherwood said that the city is trying to determine First Boston's motivation for buying the bonds. "What we are unable to determine is precisely what First Boston intended to do with the bonds," he said, "and we believe that they should have notified us of the purchase earlier."
While the city's investigation began on March 3 when First Boston notified city officials of its bond purchase, details of the case were disclosed for the first time yesterday in a letter to William R. McLucas, head of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A telephone call to Mr. McLucas's Washington office last night was not answered.
Archibald Cox Jr., president and chief executive of First Boston, strongly denied in a statement that the his concern had done anything improper. "There is no ambiguity," Mr. Cox said. "First Boston bought the bonds as agent for the city and as such we would not have marked up the bonds in question." He added that First Boston had provided all the information pertinent to the bond purchase to the city and its lawyers.

HEADLINE: Study Says 'Spring Borrowing' Ban Has Little Effect

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 10

 BODY:
The 1990 law aimed at halting New York State's practice of borrowing billions of dollars each spring for routine expenses has had just a minimal effect on improving the state's troubled financial picture, a watchdog group said yesterday.
The report by the group, the Citizens Budget Commission, on the spring borrowings was disputed by the Cuomo administration and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan. They said the law was achieving its aim and represented a significant first step toward insuring greater fiscal responsibility. When it was enacted, the law was hailed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo as "the most sweeping fiscal reform in a generation." 
 Under the law the state will ultimately convert its debt, which had risen over 30 years to nearly $5 billion, into long-term bonds and impose severe restrictions on its ability to resort again to the borrowing.
 
$1 Billion Last Year
 The spring borrowing, which grew nearly every year and helped the state make payments to school districts and local governments, is a complex transaction that essentially involved the state's lending increasing amounts to itself to pay off the previous year's loan with interest. It is perhaps the most infamous of all the measures used to achieve at least technical balance in budgets during years when the state routinely spends more money than it is taking in.
The study today found that the law had been largely ineffective because it did not actually insure that the state will end any particular fiscal year without an operating deficit. Indeed, last year a gap in the budget forced the state to borrow $1 billion in a transaction that was entirely separate from the spring borrowing, and similar borrowing for about $500 million is expected this year.
Cynthia Green, a senior research associate with the Citizens Budget Commission who wrote the report, likened the law to "moving the bill from the left side of your desk to the right side of your desk." She said that although it had accomplished the goal of phasing out the spring borrowing, it had "nothing to do with real fiscal reform."
A more meaningful package of laws, she said, would mandate balanced budgets each year and set aside money to reduce the state's accumulated deficit, which will grow to nearly $7 billion this year, when the state issues deficit notes to cover a $531 million deficit in the current budget.
Administration officials said that the law was never intended to wipe out those deficits and that it was misleading to suggest that it was ineffective. The law "has been a success," Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, wrote today in a letter to the commission.
"It was designed to reduce the spring borrowing," Mr. Bulgaro added. "And that is exactly what it has done."
 
Covenants on Borrowing
 Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin said that although the law was one of several measures needed to improve finances, it was clearly a step in the right direction. "We cannot simply get off of the train just because someone thinks the train is not moving fast enough," Mr. Weprin said.
The 1990 law established the Local Government Assistance Corporation to be responsible for the debt with long-term bonds. The covenants in the bonds strictly limit the ability of state leaders to borrow their way out of problems, and the law stipulates that when the leaders did borrow, they would have to adopt a plan to pay back the money in three years.
But the persistence of huge deficits, which state officials attribute to the recession, means that even as the spring borrowing is curtailed, a new form of financing can undercut those gains. When there is an operating deficit, officials issue "deficit notes" at the end of the year. Those notes are supposed to be paid back immediately, but continuing deficits can amount to a form of permanent borrowing.
Mr. Bulgaro said it would be impractical to set aside huge reserve funds now that would guarantee there would never be any deficit in future years. The reserve funds, he said, "would not educate any child, build any bridge, house any homeless person, or provide any care to the needy people of this state."
"But," he added, "it would satisfy a few accountants."

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Chief Vows Broad Authority to Deputy

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates has ordered the man chosen as his deputy to go over his head and report directly to the President should Mr. Gates ever be seen to be violating the law in his position as Director of Central Intelligence.
Vice Adm. William O. Studeman, the nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, told a Senate panel during his confirmation hearing today that Mr. Gates "has given me full authority to essentially go around him -- in fact enjoined me -- and stated under the strongest possible terms that that should in fact occur if in fact it is my belief that he is not behaving in the proper manner as it relates to covert action, illegal activities" or other questionable actions. 
 Admiral Studeman added that if such transgressions occurred "clearly you have to go up essentially to the level of the President."
The 52-year-old Admiral was responding to a question by Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Intelligence Committee. He asked what the nominee would do if faced with the situation Mr. Gates found himself in in the mid-1980's.
As Deputy Director in those years, Mr. Gates received reports about the possible diversion of profits from illegal arms sales to Iran to Nicaraguan rebels, and he took that information to William J. Casey, who was then Director of Central Intelligence.
The issues of what Mr. Gates knew about the Iran-contra affair, whether he did enough to stop it and whether he misled Congress about his role dominated much of Mr. Gates's confirmation hearings last fall. He was repeatedly asked why he took such a passive role and never made his suspicions known to President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Gates testified that he thought that making his discomfort known to his immediate superior was sufficient.
In his testimony today, Admiral Studeman said Mr. Gates "has clearly been, I think, significantly impacted by this experience."
When Mr. Boren again asked the nominee if he would go to the President if he felt that Mr. Gates was "acting improperly," Admiral Studeman replied, "Absolutely."
 
Most Senators Skip Hearing
 Today's hearing revealed more about the confirmation process and the committee members than about the thinking of the nominee. Unlike Mr. Gates, who was subjected to a six-month confirmation process and grueling hearings that examined in detail his years as a senior intelligence official, the admiral was questioned for only 90 minutes.
Only 3 of the 15 Senators on the committee were at the hearing despite the importance of the job at stake. In addition to Mr. Boren, Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is vice chairman of the committee, and Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, questioned Admiral Studeman. He is expected to win swift and easy confirmation by the committee as well as the full Senate later this month.
Although the admiral, who now serves as the director of the National Security Agency, said in his prepared statement that the cold war had dominated the focus of his career, there were no questions about such subjects as his assessment of instability in the former Soviet Union or the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Nor was he asked about his public statement in July 1990 that the security agency's electronic espionage network could be asked to gather economic intelligence on the United States' allies.
The National Security Agency is the largest and most expensive of the country's intelligence agencies. It monitors communications around the world and keeps official United States' communications channels secure.
Admiral Studeman presented himself as a seasoned career military intelligence officer who knows little about covert operations or how to manage them. "Covert action and the details of national clandestine operations management will be virtually new to me," he acknowledged.

HEADLINE: Keycorp, by Looking West, Skirts Pitfalls Close to Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, Victor J. Riley, chairman of Keycorp, wanted very much to expand his Albany-based banking company into neighboring New England, but was generally excluded by state laws that fostered mergers of local banks and kept New York rivals locked out.
Frustrated, Mr. Riley turned westward and starting acquiring banks in the Northwest states. It was a change of course he does not regret. 
 While New England banks are still licking their wounds from the recession, Keycorp is enjoying record profits and has the financial strength to be among the buyers in the merger and acquisition movement now sweeping the banking industry. Under an agreement announced Monday, Keycorp will acquire the Puget Sound Bancorp in Tacoma, Wash., with $4.9 billion in assets, and merge it with Keycorp's existing $1.5 billion Washington bank. The deal will make Keycorp the second-largest bank company in Washington and one of the 25 largest in the country.
With banks in eight states and 765 branches, once the latest deal is completed, Keycorp is one of only a handful of banking companies that can label itself as more than a regional company. That geographic diversification means that an economic downturn in one state or region is not necessarily crippling in another. With its acquisition of Puget Sound, Key expects its cluster of Western states will provide about 44 percent of profits, up from 32 percent.
But the diversification strategy has not been widely imitated by other banking companies that have preferred to grow in their own regions. Mr. Riley had said two years ago that in New England, for example, local banking companies "promoted the idea of super-regional banks -- they judiciously protected it -- and in the long run, it has been their downfall."
In all of the states where it does business, Keycorp follows a similar strategy: focus on small cities and towns where competition is sparse and it can collect good prices for its services, and concentrate on consumers and local businesses.
"We don't try to compete on the basis of price, and people who shop around will find we are not the cheapest," said Lee Irvin, senior vice president and treasurer of Keycorp. But the expenses of operating a large branch network in small towns -- the average town for a Key branch has a population of only 17,000 -- "requires that we charge a bit more and keep people satisfied with good service."
 Keycorp's recent success is an example of how the stronger banking companies seem to be growing stronger while the weak are languishing. The growing disparity between the industry's best and worst was noted on Monday by William Taylor, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He observed that there was a "very, very large chunk of the industry earning quite a bit of money, actually more than has historically been the case," while "a significant portion of the industry is not doing well at all."
In Keycorp's case, success has bred success. Because of the company's history of reasonably good earnings, the company could raise $122.5 million in early 1991 from the sale of new shares. That extra capital helped persuade Federal regulators that Key could readily absorb a large part of Goldome, a failed savings bank in Buffalo. In acquiring $7 billion of Goldome deposits, Key both solidified its position as the No. 2 bank in Buffalo, after the Manufacturers and Traders Bank, and laid the groundwork for much faster earnings growth in subsequent quarters as it made loans and investments with the deposits it acquired cheaply.
With record earnings in 1991 of $188 million, Keycorp's stock price rose sharply, making it easier to buy Puget Sound without issuing so many new shares that existing stockholders would be hurt. Because its stock price has doubled in the last 15 months, and its dividend has been increased three times, other bankers are inclined to view Keycorp favorably when it offers to buy their banks with new shares of stock.
 
 
Expects Much Higher Profits
 The acquisition of the Puget Sound bank promises more rewards. Key expects to reduce costs of its newly created Washington bank by $37 million a year beginning in 1994, mostly by consolidating Puget Sound's computer center with operations Key already has in Tigard, Ore., and by closing about two dozen overlapping branches in Washington state.
At a meeting with bank analysts on Monday, Keycorp executives said they expected sharply improved profits within a few years, with the company earning $1.20 of profit for every $100 of assets -- the banking equivalent of hitting .300 in baseball.
Analysts are inclined to believe the projections. For example, Frank Barcocy at Advest, a Hartford securities firm, raised his recommendation on Keycorp yesterday from "accumulate" to "strong buy." "The acquisition of Puget Sound puts Keycorp in an even better position to bid for the Washington deposits that Bank of America and Security Pacific are selling as part of their merger," Mr. Barcocy said.
Mr. Riley's penchant for diversification also extends to lending policies under which his banks concentrate on many small loans to consumers and local businesses, leaving large loans and risky ventures in real estate and corporate takeovers to other banks.
 
 
Culture of Avoiding Risks
 Although Keycorp gives its local bankers leeway to pick and choose customers, policies set in Albany set a risk-avoiding tone that reaches all parts of the company. In the credit-card business, for example, the banks issue cards only to checking-account customers. A decision in 1988 to limit condominium lending of all Key banks to a total of no more than $75 million is one reason the company has weathered the last few years without the sharp rise in loan losses that have hurt other banks.
Although Keycorp is large enough, conceivably, to make loans as large as $250 million, it has approved only 20 loans of more than $12.5 million. As a rule, no loans above $25 million are considered; its largest loan, for $37 million, is to a company that owns two Albany office buildings where Keycorp is the primary tenant.
Because any loans above $12.5 million must be approved in Albany, "the local bankers are encouraged to concentrate on smaller credits," said Mr. Irvin, the treasurer. "It's a policy that encourages people to hit a lot of singles, but no home runs."

HEADLINE: Bush Plans Trade-Policy Change Soon

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Despite a chorus of objections, the Bush Administration is expected to change its antitrust policies within 7 to 10 days to allow Justice Department lawsuits against the American operations of foreign cartels, senior Administration officials said today.
Attorney General William P. Barr said on Feb. 21 that he foresaw such a policy change, but today's comments put a specific time frame on the Administration's action. The comment provoked criticism from Japanese officials, who called the plan unacceptable, and complaints from the State Department, which had not signed off on the decision. 
 The change, which would revive a policy in force until the end of the Reagan Administration, is intended to prevent foreign companies from conspiring to avoid buying American exports. It is aimed as much at jawboning the Japanese to enforce their own antitrust laws more vigorously as it is at filing immediate cases, Administration officials said.
 
No Cases Planned
 Although investigations of foreign companies have begun, the Justice Department has no immediate plans to file any cases. The department is changing its policy in principle while waiting to develop a case that it feels sure of winning.
While the policy change is politically opportune during an election campaign in which criticizing Japan has proved popular among candidates, Administration officials insist that the change has been two years in the planning and is not aimed at any particular country.
Although the Justice Department has stopped filing such lawsuits, a case in the early 1980's illustrates how they work.
The department sued the American operations of a group of Japanese corporations led by C. Itoh & Company, a Tokyo-based conglomerate. Government lawyers contended that these Japanese companies had secretly agreed to buy only small quantities of American shellfish from the Pacific Northwest and to offer only very low prices.
The Justice Department contended that even though the decision to limit purchases might have been made in Tokyo, the case could be brought in United States courts because the American operations of the Japanese companies actually purchased the shellfish. The case never went to trial because the Japanese companies signed a consent decree in 1983 in which they did not admit guilt but agreed not to collude in the future.
Companies are already able to sue the United States subsidiaries of foreign groups of companies that they assert collusively refuse to buy American goods. But few have done so because of the exorbitant cost of antitrust lawsuits, the risk of offending foreign partners in joint ventures and the poor likelihood of success as long as courts can look to a Justice Department policy of not filing such cases.
Hiroshi Hirabayashi, the deputy chief of the Japanese Embassy here, said his Government wanted the United States to consult with the other 23 industrialized nations in the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development before changing any policies.
"We think -- many countries think -- that it's a violation of established international laws and practices," the diplomat said of the proposed Justice Department change.
A committee of the international organization has been reviewing differences in member countries' antitrust laws for many years, with the United States consistently arguing that countries should be able to apply their laws more often to foreign companies. An American official said today that the planned policy change was not broad enough to be included in the O.E.C.D. talks.
 
Plan Worries Diplomats
 The Justice Department's planned policy change has pitted diplomats worried about possible damage to diplomatic relations with foreign governments against Administration trade officials frustrated by the reluctance of Japanese companies to buy American goods even as the Japanese Government eliminates legal and regulatory barriers to imports.
The Commerce Department and Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative and a former head of the American Bar Association's antitrust section, both endorsed the policy change last year.
The State Department was unhappy when Mr. Barr made his remarks on Feb. 21 because it had not endorsed the policy change and wanted to set up an interagency process to review all such cases before they are filed, a department official said.
Charles F. Rule, the former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, who banned cases filed on behalf of exporters at the end of the Reagan Administration, said that eliminating the ban now would be a mistake. The Justice Department risks reawakening bitter disputes with its allies over international lawsuits and offending Japanese law enforcement officials whose cooperation is needed on many other cases, he said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Move In Senate For Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Republicans in the Senate called today for passage of a tax cut for families, a cut that President Bush had proposed and then de-emphasized, as they sought a politically comfortable stance for opposing the Democratic proposal of tax cuts for the middle class and increases for the well-off.
They announced their plans, but not how they would pay for the cut, after their leaders met with President Bush in the White House and as the Senate began debating a Democratic tax bill that its sponsors say would make the tax code fairer. 
 Despite Republican efforts to present a bill with more political appeal than Mr. Bush's, their leaders said today that they expected to lose in the Senate, and President Bush said he would veto the Senate Democrats' bill, as he said earlier he would veto a comparable House Democratic measure. There is no chance that a veto could be overridden.
 
An Issue for Buchanan
 Mr. Bush first proposed a change in tax exemptions in his State of the Union speech. But he said he wanted it adopted later in the year, after a seven-point plan stressing growth. His Republican challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, told New Hampshire primary voters that the delay showed that Mr. Bush was abandoning the middle class.
Mr. Bush said today of the Democrats' proposals : "The centerpiece of both these bills is a huge tax increase that will kill job creation, particularly by small businesses. So there's got to be no mistake about this: Raising taxes on the American people, given the situation, is simply not acceptable."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, replied that "our bill will mean higher taxes for fewer than 800,000 people at the top of the income scale in order to cut taxes for the 31 million Americans" who would be helped by the bill's tax credit for children, modifications in the earned-income tax credit, and capital gains changes tilted toward moderate-income taxpayers.
The Democratic bill features a $300 tax credit for each child under 16, available to parents with incomes under $70,000. The Republican plan would add $500 to the personal exemption for a child, raising it from $2,300 to $2,800. The addition would thus be worth $155 to upper-income taxpayers who pay a 31 percent rate, but only $75 to those in the 15 percent bracket.
The problem the Administration has faced with the exemption is how to pay for it. While estimates vary a bit, the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation projected its cost as $23.8 billion for five years, an amount that is hard to raise without a tax increase.
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told reporters today that he expected the cost of the increased exemption to be met largely by counting Defense Department cuts toward it, a change in budget procedures he said he might oppose.
 
Doing the Accounting
 Mr. Domenici said the Republican proposals would be paid for without new taxes and without accounting changes -- the main approach relied on by the Bush Administration to support its seven-point program emphasizing capital gains tax cuts, accelerated depreciation on new investment and several aids to the real estate and housing industries. Many Republicans scorn those accounting shifts.
Speaking to reporters after the Republican caucus, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said the financing method "will be legit." He was asked if he meant to distinguish that approach from Administration accounting changes. "Right," he said.
While Democrats have been urging for months that the 1990 budget act's prohibitions against transferring military savings to domestic needs be modified, Republicans have generally objected. But in his introduction to the budget in January, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Mr. Bush would be prepared to consider a modification of the act to pay for the increased tax exemption.
But some Republicans consider that a risky approach, suggesting that advocating a change would lead down a slippery slope that Democrats, with their Congressional majorities, could dominate.
The Republican senators plan to add one other item to Mr. Bush's short list of proposals for prompt action -- repeal of the luxury tax on expensive cars, boats, planes, furs and jewelry. Mr. Bush proposed only repeal on boats and planes. The Democratic bills added repeal of the taxes on furs and jewelry and proposed indexing the tax on cars against inflation.
Those luxury taxes were created, largely for symbolic purposes, in the 1990 budget act to show that the rich were being forced to bear a greater burden. But some of the taxes, especially those on boats and yachts costing more than $100,000, have been widely attacked in both parties, accused of having cost jobs while raising little money.
The automobile tax is the only one that raises substantial revenues, about $1 billion over five years. The other four would raise only $500 million over five years.
The tax increase in the Senate bill to which Mr. Bush objected would increase the maximum individual tax rate from 31 to 36 percent, on taxable income (after deductions) of $150,000 for individuals and $175,000 for couples. That would raise $43 billion over five years. Another $8.5 billion would come from a surtax of 10 percent on taxes attributable to taxable income over $1 million, a provision affecting about 60,000 people.
 
Scheduling the Votes
 There were only speeches and no votes today, but action on various amendments will begin Wednesday. A battle more along regional than party lines is expected over an effort backed by Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, to replenish the United Mine Workers Health Fund with taxes on coal companies.
The Republican proposals may not be put forward before Thursday, when Senate leaders hope to have the bill approved.
Because Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has a primary election next Tuesday, a House-Senate conference on the two differing measures would not be held before next Wednesday, two days before the deadline Mr. Bush proclaimed for Congressional action on his seven-point program.

Saatchi & Saatchi Posts Loss for '91

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. yesterday announced a loss for last year, as expected, though some results were better than financial analysts had anticipated.
The London-based advertising company, which owns Saatchi & Saatchi, Backer Spielvogel Bates and Campbell-Mithun-Esty, among others, reported a pretax loss of 58.4 million, or $103.3 million, after charges of 54.9 million, or $97.1 million. That compared with pretax income of 14.6 million, or $25.8 million, in 1990. Dollar figures are based on the company's conversion rate of a pound equaling $1.768. 
 The company's loss, before the charges of $6.2 million, was much less than some analysts' forecasts of around $26.5 million.
Revenues fell by 2.3 percent, to 739.8 million, or $1.31 billion, from 757.6 million, or $1.34 billion, in 1990, primarily because of the recessions in the United States and Britain.
At a news conference in London, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Saatchi's chief executive, said he expected pretax profits of about 17 million this year, in line with analysts' forecasts. He added that because the company's planning for 1992 was "still pretty conservative," he foresaw "a slight decline" in revenues.
Asked about reports that Saatchi might form a third international agency network, by linking Campbell in America with KHBB in London, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus said executives were trying to determine if that was feasible.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 15.87 in Busy and Volatile Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks made modest gains in heavy trading yesterday, with bouts of program buying adding a fair amount of volatility. After being ahead as much as 30 points during the day, the Dow Jones industrial average gave half of that back to end at 3,230.99, up 15.87.
Ricky Harrington, director of equity investment for Marion Bass, was not surprised by the market's performance, noting four days of declines that saw the Dow drop about 80 points. 
 He said investors were in the market hunting for bargains, and he said he thought it was more a technical recovery with nothing new in the way of economic news or fundamental background for investors to focus on.
Traders said the strength in the buying was across the board and followed recent declines that left the market in a mildly oversold position. It gave investors the incentive to enter and buy up stocks that had taken sharp corrections recently.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 203 million, up from 160.8 million shares on Monday, as the Big Board composite rose 0.87 point, to 225.02. The number of gaining issues handily outpaced losers by 1,076 to 630.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was up 1.68 points, to 406.89, and the American Stock Exchange composite gained 1.33 points, to 408.54. Trading on the Nasdaq was hectic, pushing the composite up 7.64 points, to 623.46, while the Russell 2,000 gained 1.34 points, to 208.20.
Investors yesterday snapped up auto, airline, drug and technology issues.
In other trading, Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/2, to 76 5/8, on repeat "buy" recommendations from Dean Witter Reynolds and Smith Barney, Harris Upham following favorable press about the company's successful laser printer business and growth in inkjet printers, a fast-expanding category.
Archer-Daniels-Midland down 1/8, to 27 7/8, got a repeat "buy" recommendation from Leonard Teitelbaum, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. The analyst said they were waiting for President Bush's Clean Air Act. If it favors a higher oxygen level for the environment, fostering a greater use of corn-derived ethanol, it should bode well for Archer-Daniels.
Analysts at Shearson Lehman and Morgan Stanley repeated their "buy" recommendations on RJR Nabisco, based on a weakening in the price of the stock after the United States Surgeon General requested the company stop using the "Joe Camel" cartoon character in cigarette advertising.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Two-Day Rally Ends on Late Selling

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell and interest rates rose in thin trading yesterday, ending a two-day rally.
Most of the selling occurred late in the session, after rumors that Congressional Republicans had reached a compromise on taxes and that President Bush was not doing well early on in the rash of Super Tuesday primaries. 
 In addition, there was talk that the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment survey would show a big increase in consumer confidence for the first two weeks of March when the results are sent to subscribers later this week. That would point to stimulation for the economy, possibly leading to inflationary pressures disliked by the bond market.
But even before the rumors, traders were expressing doubts about whether the market could hold on to the gains recorded on Friday and Monday.
 
Poor Underlying Demand
 "We aren't getting great distribution of securities," one government-securities trader said, "which means we are constantly reminded of how bad underlying demand for securities really is."
Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc., said, "The economic setting should be reasonably good for short-term securities, but until the fiscal policy situation is resolved in Washington, the market will not be able to have a sustained rally."
Mr. Moran said the recent rise in short-term interest rates was unjustified because the economy is likely to remain quite sluggish through mid-year, and the Federal Reserve Board is not apt to tighten monetary policy anytime soon.
Market participants have been worried for some months that Congress and the Bush Administration will agree on a tax package that will stimulate the economy to such a degree that inflationary pressures will intensify.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1015/32 late yesterday, down 10/32 , to yield 7.89 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10015/32 , down 7 32 , to yield 7.42 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, down 3/32 , to yield 5.57 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to slightly higher.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4 percent late yesterday, unchanged from late Monday. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 4.15 percent.
New-issue activity in the corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets was heavy yesterday.
Roughly $1 billion worth of new corporate issues were priced, and the World Bank sold its first global bond denominated in Japanese yen.
 
Valassis Offering
 Leading the corporate issuers was Valassis Inserts Inc., a consumer products promotion company in New York, which offered a total of $420 million worth of securities through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
Senior 8 3/8 percent five-year notes maturing March 15, 1997, were priced at $99.68 to yield 8.46 percent, 1.65 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Senior 8 7/8 percent seven-year notes were priced at $99.60 to yield 8.953 percent, 1.83 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
And 9 3/8 percent senior subordinated seven-year notes were priced at $99.60 to yield 9.45 percent, 2.33 percentage points over the prevailing yield on seven-year Treasury notes.
The two senior note offerings are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The senior subordinated notes are rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.
The World Bank's 250 billion yen, 10-year issue was sold simultaneously in Far Eastern, European and North American financial markets.
The 5.25 percent bonds were sold at a price of 99.23, to yield 5.35 percent. Interest on the securities is payable semiannually.
IBJ International, J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Nomura Securities acted as joint-lead managers for the offering.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a competitive sale of $220.6 million worth of New York State general obligation bonds was won by a bid from an investor group led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
Serial bonds were reoffered to investors at yields from 4.50 percent in 1994 to 6.40 percent in 2002 and 6.70 percent in 2007.
Term bonds maturing in 2022 were priced to yield 6.90 percent.
The issue, which is rated A by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's, received decent support from both retail and institutional investors.
By late yesterday, bankers at Bear, Stearns said that $62 million worth of the securities remained unsold.
In a negotiated sale, the State of Connecticut offered $465 million worth of general obligation bonds.
The securities were priced on a preliminary basis with yields from 3.25 percent in 1993 to 6.60 percent in 2010. Term bonds maturing in 2012 were priced to yield 6.65 percent.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated AA by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Companies' Team Effort Yields Hotel in Rochester

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, March 9

 BODY:
For five years, all that existed of this city's long-awaited Hyatt Regency Hotel was a 27-story skeleton of girders and concrete that marred the downtown skyline and embarrassed City Hall.
Last week, though, the $47 million, 350-room hotel finally opened -- but only after 10 locally based corporations, including the Eastman Kodak Company, Wilmorite Inc. and Bausch & Lomb, provided $10 million in start-up funds and virtually built it themselves. 
 "Every day, I used to look out my window and see this shell of a building," said Daniel E. Gill, chairman and chief executive officer of Bausch & Lomb. "It became important to take what had become a negative symbol of Rochester and turn it into a positive one."
 
'A Business Initiative'
 Partnerships between government and business may not be unusual, but for a consortium of companies to provide all the initial equity for a hotel is almost unheard of, particularly if none of them are in the hotel industry.
"This was a business initiative," said Thomas T. Mooney, president of the Greater Rochester Metro Chamber of Commerce. "Business solved the Mayor's problem."
Thomas P. Ryan Jr., the Democratic Mayor here for 18 years, first announced the project in the summer of 1983 as an important link with the adjacent Rochester Riverside Convention Center, which opened two years later. His administration used $11.2 million to acquire and clear the site. It also hired a Buffalo developer, Paul Snyder, to build the project.
But the project ran into problems later in 1983 when Federal grants were unexpectedly cut, and Mr. Snyder could not get additional financing.
After a year's delay, ground-breaking took place in 1986 and Hyatt, which was hired to manage the hotel, began to accept reservations, with the opening scheduled for September 1987. Construction stopped, though, in early 1987, when the building was half-finished, because of a dispute between Mr. Snyder and the general contractor over cost overruns and late payments.
Later in 1987, after being unable to secure additional financing, Mr. Snyder abandoned the project. And by 1990, when it became clear that no developer would be able to obtain the financing to complete the hotel, city officials were left with few options other than tearing down the half-built structure.
"This was the most significant embarrassment to the city for four or five years," Mr. Mooney said. "The failed hotel that sat there was an image of what the city was."
Later in 1990, an informal breakfast meeting of local business leaders and city officials led to a breakthrough. The 10 corporations agreed to invest $10 million to restart the project and obtain financing. Wilmorite, a nationwide shopping-mall builder, agreed to resume construction.
The hotel, which has created 400 jobs and is expected to provide $8.8 million in annual tax revenue to the city, opened on March 3. It was designed by the architectural firm of Gruzen Samton Steinglass of New York City, which was also involved with the renovation of the Royalton Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
The 10 companies, which include the Xerox Corporation, Wegman's Food Markets Inc., Rochester Gas and Electric, Rochester Telephone, Chase Lincoln First Bank, Central Trust Company and Gleason Memorial Fund, hope to sell the hotel in about seven years and expect to have annual returns of only about 5 to 7 percent.
 
'A Civic Reason'
 "The intention is to get it on its feet and then find a buyer," said Thomas C. Wilmot, president of Wilmorite. "People did this for a civic reason more than anything else."
Karen Noble Hanson, president of CORH Associates, the organization formed by the 10 companies to build the hotel, said the group's members were so pleased with the outcome of the Hyatt that they were now considering other projects in which to merge their investments.
She cited an article in The Harvard Business Review last summer that mentioned the hotel and called Rochester an experiment in community-based economic renewal with "the spirit of old-fashioned barn-raisings."
"It's really been a terrific experience in public-private partnership," Ms. Hanson said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Japan Denies Chip Pact Has Failed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 10

 BODY:
Japan's electronics industry today denied American charges that a semiconductor trade agreement with the United States was "on the verge of failure."
Until recently, the Bush Administration hailed the agreement as the model of its future economic relations with Japan. But on Monday, an American group, the Semiconductor Industry Association warned that the agreement was near collapse because United States companies had failed to gain a larger share of the Japanese market. 
 The problem, the Japanese countered, is that American companies have not yet done enough to generate business in Japan. The Japanese also said that their own efforts to buy more American components had been hampered by the recession.
 
Different Ideas of Success
 The statement issued by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan indicated that less than a year after the two countries renewed the semiconductor accord, they have widely diverging views over whether its goals are being achieved. A primary purpose of the agreement was to expand the American share of the Japanese market.
Japanese officials, though they deny that the agreement is about to be broken, have also said in recent days that they are concerned the issue could become an additional source of political tension, amid continuing arguments over autos and the size of the United States trade deficit with Japan.
The dispute was touched offthis week by a report of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the American trade group. "Frankly, for a nation as successful as Japan, the unwillingness of Japanese companies to comply with this trade agreement is appalling," Andew A. Pracassini, the president of the association, said on Monday, in releasing the report.
 
Veiled Reference to Sanctions
 The tone of the American industry association's report was in sharp contrast to the statements of several of its members, who have said until recently that they are fairly pleased with the direction of their business in Japan. There has been a continuing stream of new partnerships between American and Japanese chip makers, and a series of announcements by Japanese companies that they are increasing the amount of American-made components they purchase.
The association said the United States "should begin to consider additional actions that may be helpful in spurring greater Japanese compliance," a veiled reference to sanctions against Japan. The Reagan Administration imposed trade sanctions against Japanese electronics companies, but there are sharp differences of opinion over whether they had any effect.
In a response issued today, the Japanese side said it was "making every effort to expand foreign market share," which the United States says has stagnated at 14.3 percent. Japan, which uses a different formula, says that the true figure is 16.2 percent. The agreement refers to an "expectation" by the United States that the foreign semiconductor market share in Japan will reach 20 percent by the end of this year, though the Japanese association noted that the "figure is not a guarantee."
 
Recession Seen as 'An Excuse'
 One of the vexing issues that neither side anticipated was a sudden slowdown in Japan's own economy. The American semiconductor association says that it does not view the recession as "an excuse for the lack of improvement." The Japanese side, in contrast, insists that the slower economy is indeed a good excuse.
"Under such a circumstance," the Japanese group said, "it is a business reality in any market in the world that users would try to maintain the traditional supply sources with whom they have long-established relationships." Those suppliers are largely Japanese.
The Japanese association said many of its members "try to place orders from foreign makers at the sacrifice of Japanese makers." Nonetheless, the group said, the recession had placed a crimp in that effort.

A Plan to Bankroll Deposit Insurance

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
COULD Uncle Sam again be caught holding the bag in a banking scam on the scale of the savings and loan debacle? Knock on wood, probably not.
Last year Congress ordered Federal deposit insurers to take over ailing banks before the institutions managed to throw good taxpayer money after their own bad debts. And under rules that go into effect next year, banks that are inclined to take chances will be obliged to buffer the risk with more capital. 
 But safety is only half the deposit insurance story; the other half is efficiency. While the United States Treasury is now better armored against assaults from future Charles Keatings, deposit insurance remains a crude regulatory tool that only a bureaucrat could love.
Federal regulators must still make subjective calls about when to padlock the doors on friendly neighborhood banks. Moreover, insurance premiums still do not mirror the risks of individual bank portfolios, a failure that implicitly subsidizes the high rollers. It is no surprise, then, that many economists see deposit insurance as a necessary evil, the inevitable price of securing the national money supply.
Many, but not all. Bert Ely, who runs Ely & Company, a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., thinks he knows a better way: private deposit insurance. And he has found a patron in Thomas Petri, a Republican Congressman from Wisconsin with a soft spot for smart schemes to buy better government for less money.
The banking industry already insures itself. Premiums go into a pool, with the proceeds dedicated to making good on individual banks' promises to depositors. But civil servants, not the contributors, are in charge of setting premiums and keeping banks on the straight and narrow. And without a market to discipline the process, regulators are unlikely to make economically rational decisions.
That is where the Ely-Petri plan fits in. It would eliminate the middleman, converting deposit insurance into a true industrywide self-insurance plan. Banks would be required to obtain insurance from syndicates of other banks and perhaps other financial institutions with deep pockets. The syndicates, in turn, would be required to reinsure with other syndicates against losses of a magnitude that could tap them out. And to cope with the incredibly unlikely event of the whole system running through its capital, the Government would reinsure the reinsurers.
Syndicates, managed by professional agents, would set premiums at any level they wished and negotiate their own criteria for withdrawing coverage -- much the way a fire insurer deals with corporate policyholders. Competition between syndicates would prevent rate gouging, as well as creating pressures to price policies according to the perceived risk in banks' investment strategies.
Markets, not bureaucrats, would decide when banks closed: A bank that could not obtain insurance, or could not make a profit at the level of premiums demanded, would be forced to merge or liquidate.
Would it work? Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, thinks the plan is "conceptually quite elegant." The big imponderable, he suggests, is whether a deep, competitive market in deposit insurance would emerge. After all, the existence of opportunities for profit do not always attract investors or expertise -- especially in games that require big bucks to play.
One specific worry is whether syndicates would favor large banks over small because the costs of supervising smaller institutions would be high, per dollar insured. Another is that the syndicates would be excessively conservative, effectively forcing even well-managed, well-capitalized banks to shed higher-risk loans.
But it is not entirely clear that these are drawbacks. If small banks are more expensive to regulate than large ones, why should they not pay more? And if banks are driven to hold lower-risk portfolios, there is still reason to believe that less-than-blue-chip borrowers would have access to capital.
Finance companies and investment banks that specialize in commercial paper would probably pick up part of the slack. And the trend toward securitization, in which banks package everything from home mortgages to credit card debts in multimillion-dollar bundles and sell them to institutional investors, would no doubt accelerate.
Whether or not the Ely-Petri approach would do the job is irrelevant, of course, if it cannot attract serious support in Washington. One strategy for making it relevant, Mr. Litan suggests, would be to start with only large banks.
That would cheer up smaller banks, which resent the current Federal inclination to discriminate in favor of institutions that are "too big to fail." And it might pick up some support from the healthiest mega-banks, which now chafe at paying high insurance premiums to carry their deadbeat competitors.

HEADLINE: 1991 Profit Is Reported At S.& L.'s

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The nation's savings and loan institutions that remain privately owned posted their first profit in five years last year, earning almost $2 billion, regulators reported today.
They said the turnaround represented the clearest sign so far that the Government's multibillion-dollar savings and loan bailout had pulled the industry out of its crisis. 
 The report said that the 2,096 savings associations that have managed to hold their own without Government help had, in general, shed many of their sour loans and unattractive real estate holdings and that 86 percent of them were profitable by the end of the year.
 
Higher Loss Cushions
 In addition, the report showed, the savings associations significantly strengthened their financial positions last year by increasing their funds that serve as cushions against possible losses.
But the report from the Office of Thrift Supervision primarily reflected the fact that the industry's worst institutions had been weeded out. The same 2,096 institutions posted a profit of $1.1 billion in 1990. But the industry over all lost almost $3 billion that year, dragged down by 246 associations that were ultimately sold or that had collapsed and had to be taken over by the Government in 1991.
"The results last year indicate the industry is stabilizing, and I believe we are now in the eighth inning of the thrift cleanup," said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the industry.
 
Fewer Rescues Seen
 Mr. Ryan predicted that if the economy stayed on its present course or improved, only another 55 to 100 institutions, holding more than $35 billion in assets out of the nearly $900 billion in total industry assets, would need to be rescued.
So far, nearly 700 institutions have been seized since the cleanup effort began in the summer of 1989. Most of them have been closed, sold or had their deposits transferred to other institutions.
The Bush Administration, which at first dramatically underestimated the number of failing savings associations and their cost to taxpayers, later revised its figures and predicted that as many as 1,000 savings associations might fail.
It has estimated that the effort could cost taxpayers as much as $160 billion, excluding interest charges and the expenses from failures that occurred during the Reagan years. Some estimates have put the total cost including interest and the earlier failures as high as $500 billion over 40 years.
The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency that serves as a kind of morgue for dead savings associations, has not yet reported the 1991 losses for the more than 200 institutions under its control last year. For the first nine months of 1991, the agency has said, those savings associations had operating losses approaching $1.7 billion.
Industry executives were ebullient about the Office of Thrift Supervision's latest earnings report.
"Things are looking a lot brighter," said Fred Webber, president of the United States League of Savings Institutions, a trade group based here. "We've rejustified our existence. The industry has bottomed out. People who were writing our obituary two or three years ago were premature."
 
Caution on Conclusions
 While hailing the latest figures as a milestone, Mr. Ryan expressed some caution about whether they represented a conclusive sign of the industry's return to health.
One of the strongest reasons for the profitability of many savings associations, he said, was that interest rates are at their lowest in many years. The low rates have enabled savings associations to sharply increase the spread between the rates at which they borrow money and the rates at which they lend.
These wide spreads, particularly at the end of the year, translated into huge profit gains. For the three-month period ended in December, the healthy institutions reported profits of $894 million, compared with a $286 million loss in the comparable period of 1990.
But in recent weeks, interest rates have begun creeping up, signaling that the windfall to the industry may be ending.
Mr. Ryan declined to predict whether the slumping California economy, the latest threat to savings associations and commercial banks in the region, had bottomed out or could get worse.
Two big Los Angeles institutions, GlenFed Inc., which has $21 billion in assets, and CalFed Inc., with $19 billion, have already fallen below regulatory capital requirements. Another large California savings company, the HomeFed Corporation of San Diego, is insolvent by some measures.
In the Western region of the nation, the percent of non-current real estate loans continued to increase in last year's fourth quarter and is now 2.8 percent. In all other areas of the nation, the figure remained constant or was down. In the Northeast, which includes all of the states north of Virginia and Maryland, the percent of non-current loans is at a national high of 4 percent, but was unchanged in the quarter.

HEADLINE: Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit showed mixed results for the week ended today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks bank rates.
"No one yet has a firm handle on when, or whether, interest rates will rebound from their current flatness," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "Just as many institutions are raising rates as are lowering them, which reflects the general uncertainty." 
 Mr. Heady said the financial markets were seeing conflicting signals almost daily from the Government and industry. "This only adds to the bankers' indecision when they set their numbers." he added.
Among New York area commercial banks, the average money market account yields gained 2 basis points, to 3.47 percent, from last week. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Among the savings institutions in the area, money market accounts averaged 3.99 percent, off 2 basis points.
Also indicative of the mixed actions, the Marine Midland Bank raised its money market account interest rate by 31 basis points -- the biggest increase among the area banks. At the same time, the Greater New York Savings Bank led the way with the sharpest drop in the rate on three-month certificates, with a cut of 10 basis points, while Midlantic Banks of New Jersey cut its six-month certificate by 15 basis points, more than any other New York-area bank.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area declined by a relatively small amount, a basis point, to 3.589 percent for money market accounts; their six-month certificates averaged 3.86 percent, unchanged from last week.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the average rate was 4.02 percent and 4.13 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Slow Trading; Gold Is Mixed in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose in uneventful trading on world foreign exchange markets yesterday, benefiting from declines in other currencies.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion for current delivery settled at $349.00 an ounce, up 10 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $348.80 an ounce, unchanged. 
 Analysts said the dollar benefited more from weakening foreign currencies rather than from any fundamental strength of its own.
"The dollar traded up, but there was not a lot happening in dollar terms," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston. The dollar's sharp rise against the Japanese yen was attributed to Japan's weakening economy, a stock market that has fallen to a five-year low, and the tendency for Japanese corporations and fund managers to buy dollars ahead of the March 31 close of the fiscal year.
John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V., said the pound suffered a setback after the British Government released its pre-election budget, which disappointed investors who were hoping for more aggressive measures. The prospects for economic growth in Britain remain "dismal," he said.
The German mark remained under pressure because of rising inflation there, Mr. McCarthy said. "It's really weakness of the other currencies," he added, that is driving the dollar.
Trading was relatively quiet. Some dealers hoped the release later this week of data on February unemployment claims, retail sales and producer prices would lend some fundamental direction to the dollar.
Until then, Mr. Lawrie said, the market "is just sitting on its heels."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 132 yen, up 0.27 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 132.85 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 132.90 yen, up from 131.96 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7160, from $1.7240 late on Monday. In New York, it cost $1.7175 to buy 1, less expensive than Monday's $1.7245.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6705 German marks, up from 1.6620; 1.5165 Swiss francs, up from 1.5075; 5.6725 French francs, up from 5.6430; 1,251.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.00, and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1921.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
EVERY year at this time, Wine and Spirits, a consumer magazine for wine enthusiasts, publishes a survey of what people are drinking in restaurants. Since many people try out wines in restaurants before taking them home, the survey, while not scientific, gives some insight into what will be happening in wine shops this year.
The current report, in the April issue, indicates that Americans are continuing their tried and true wine-drinking patterns. Chardonnay is still the all-out favorite wine. Make that California chardonnay: of the 15 top chardonnay producers cited in the poll, 13 are California wineries. Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards is in first place, Kendall-Jackson Vineyard second and Robert Mondavi Winery third. 
 The highest-ranking foreign wine maker, Louis Jadot, a prominent Burgundy firm, took fifth place. The only other foreign house in the top 15 is Louis Latour, at 14th.
The scores were compiled from rankings submitted by restaurants around the country that responded to the magazine's query. The restaurants were asked to list the 10 wines most frequently ordered. The top name on each list was assigned 10 points, the 10th one point.
Sonoma-Cutrer, of Windsor, Calif., won on the points scored by its three chardonnays, Russian River Ranches, Les Pierres and Cutrer. Louis Latour's rating was based on three wines, too: Chardonnay de l'Ardeche, St.-Veran and Pouilly-Fuisse. Over all, chardonnay accounted for 42 percent of the most-ordered wines.
Cabernet sauvignon was the favorite red. Again, all the 15 top choices were California wines except 2: Chateau Greysac, which was in sixth place, and Chateau Beychevelle, in 13th. Both are Bordeaux properties, in the Medoc. The top three in the cabernet group were Jordan Vineyard and Winery, Robert Mondavi and Silver Oak Cellars.
Over all, the respondents reported red wine sales at 37 percent of total wine sales in 1991, as against 34 percent in 1990. Many restaurants noted that sales went up after a segment of the CBS News program "60 Minutes" suggested that moderate consumption of red wine may contribute to a lower rate of heart disease in France.
"People who never drank before are now having a glass of red wine every day," one respondent reported.
The favorite merlot labels were Rutherford Hill, Shafer Vineyards and Duckhorn Vineyards, all from the Napa Valley. Saintsbury, a winery in the Napa portion of the Carneros region, was the most poular pinot noir, followed by Etude and Robert Mondavi, both Napa wine makers.
The No. 2 white wine in the survey was sauvignon blanc, and the favorite producer was Robert Mondavi, followed by two other Napa concerns, Frog's Leap Wine Cellars and Grgich Hills Winery.
In sparkling wine, the favorite was Louis Roederer -- not the California Roederer, but the parent company, the Champagne maker in Reims, France. In fact, of the six labels that made it to the list, four are French. Domaine Chandon, in the Napa Valley, was second; Moet & Chandon, the Domaine's parent in Epernay, France, third; Schramsberg, in the Napa Valley, fourth, and Veuve Clicquot and Perrier-Jouet, both French Champagne makers, fifth and sixth.
Among the French restaurants taking part in the survey, Louis Jadot's wines ranked No. 1 in sales, with the wines of Georges Duboeuf, mostly Beaujolais, ranking second. Three other Burgundy firms -- Louis Latour, Joseph Drouhin and Prosper Maufoux -- were third, fourth and fifth. What was particularly interesting was the report that 57 percent of the top-selling wines in the French restaurants were American wines.
In overall ranking, the 11 top wine labels demanded by restaurant patrons last year were Robert Mondavi; Sonoma-Cutrer, in Sonoma County; Jordan, Sonoma; Kendall-Jackson, Lake County; Louis Jadot; Grgich Hills; Beringer, Napa; Cakebread Cellars, Napa; Clos du Bois, Sonoma, tied for ninth place with Rutherford Hill, and Sterling Vineyards, Napa.
Given the state of the national economy, the average prices tell quite a bit about American tastes in fine wines. Cabernet was the most expensive; the average bottle price was $37.11. Pinot noir was $34.61, chardonnay was $33, merlot $30.56 and sauvignon blanc $22.94. The average price paid for a bottle of Jordan cabernet, the most popular, was $44.
To some extent, these prices must reflect the kinds of restaurants polled. In New York, for example, restaurants that responded included the "21" Club, Lutece, La Caravelle, the River Cafe, and Montrachet. All are luxurious.
The editors of Wine and Spirits noted that their poll was taken "in the middle of a recession and during some of the heaviest price resistance restaurants have felt in years." Sixty-four percent of the respondents said they were "holding the line" on wine prices, but in fact they have become more dependent on wine sales: 53 percent said wine sales had increased as part of total sales.
In all, 900 copies of the poll were sent out, most to the 40 most popular restaurants in the Zagat Restaurant Surveys for each of the 17 markets in which the Zagat guides appear. Among the respondents, 51 defined themselves as American, 41 French, 21 Italian, 11 seafood, 5 Spanish and 36 "other."
The poll indicates that American wine drinkers are conservative; with all the dozens of varieties available, they are not ready to be adventuresome. It indicates, too, that they are willing to pay considerable sums for wines whose names they recognize.
What the poll does not address is the very large group of people who dine out and like wine, but not at $35 a bottle. As the editors say, "The poll observes activity at the very top of the market, both in the selection of the restaurants and their further selection of their top-selling wines."
So be it. The poll also begs a very intriguing question: What does everyone else drink?
 
TASTINGS
Sella & Mosca Cannonau di Alghero red table wine, Sardinia, 1986; about $12.
 Cannonau is the name in Sardinia for the grenache grape, a principal variety in the Rhone Valley in France and an important grape in Spain. It is thought to have been introduced to the island in the 18th century by the Spanish. Sella & Mosca have taken what can be a tough grape that produces good but rustic wines and tamed it to make a wine of considerable elegance. It has a richness reminiscent of some of mainland Italy's new cabernet blends. Two days of carbonic maceration give it attractive color and fruit. Three years in oak casks round it off beautifully and guarantee it a moderately long life. Sardinian wines are rare in this country; Sella & Mosca could change that.

HEADLINE: The Need to Lead, for Russia

 BODY:
Election year: It's the best time for politicians to show leadership. Freedom in Russia: It's the finest imaginable cause. But even as Russia urgently asks for aid that could mean the survival of reform, President Bush dithers. His response has been, as Richard Nixon puts it, penny-ante -- "pathetically inadequate."
Patrick Buchanan still can't win more than a protest vote with his "America first" campaign. Yet he has Mr. Bush cowering, leaving Secretary of State Baker to take the lead. The Democrats, meanwhile, hang back, waiting for the President. If America stands for anything, it is freedom. If Mr. Bush stands for anything, he must now explain to Americans the need to help it thrive in Russia. 
 Notwithstanding President Bush's political travail, Mr. Nixon recently circulated a paper harshly criticizing the Administration's inaction on Russia. But even Mr. Nixon remains transfixed by the all-or-nothing calculus of the cold war, and so he exaggerates the dangers of not aiding Russia. Likewise, he overpromises the benefits of aid. But there are four realistic arguments the President could now make for helping Russia:
It's the chance of a lifetime for America. Russia is no longer the superpower enemy. But it's still armed and dangerous. While there's no guarantee, aid could transform Russia into America's ally and save untold billions in defense spending.
Russian reformers need help. Russia has embarked on a transformation even more dramatic than Europe's in its recovery from the devastation of World War II or Mexico's radical reform of the 1980's. Such leaps forward succeeded only because outsiders provided a safety net.
America can afford to give the aid. A relief package for Russia would cost about $20 billion a year for five years. The European Community, Japan and Saudi Arabia would share the burden, leaving $2 or $3 billion for the U.S. to put up. That's not insignificant, but would be a small fraction of the potential defense savings.
Aid could pay off for America. Investment in Russia's reforms could return rich dividends if recovery eventually enables it to expand markets for U.S. goods and repay its debts.
Of the $20 billion total, about $6 billion a year would be reserved to stabilize the value of the ruble. If reform alone gives the ruble purchasing power, that fund need not be tapped. Another $6 billion would allow Russia to refinance its debt; if reform succeeds, this money would be repaid.
The rest of the $20 billion would help Russia import food and consumer goods and keep freed prices from soaring out of the reach of ordinary Russians. This money could be a loan, pledged against Russia's oil and gas reserves, to be repaid once the country is back on its feet.
There are hopeful signs that the West is waking up. Secretary of State Baker has invited proposals to set up a stabilization fund for the ruble. Western leaders have decided to bring Russia and other republics into the International Monetary Fund as early as April. The I.M.F. is now in Moscow negotiating a reform package.
But the West has not yet authorized the I.M.F. to pledge much. And a $12 billion U.S. contribution to the I.M.F. is stalled in Congress. Unless Mr. Bush steps out front to raise the money now, it won't be available when it's needed.
Russia's Boris Yeltsin has offered the West a shining opportunity. After defending democratization against last year's coup attempt, he has slashed military spending, decontrolled prices and plunged on to privatize the economy. Now it's the West's turn to defend freedom inside Russia.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton, in Black and White

 BODY:
Of all the numbers pouring forth from Super Tuesday, an exemplary one stands out. While winning half the total Democratic vote in Florida, Bill Clinton, white Southerner, won approximately 75 percent of the black vote.
Governor Clinton may or may not go on to win the Democratic nomination, and he may or may not give President Bush a hard run in the fall. But either way, that one figure gives healthy evidence, probably for the first time since Robert Kennedy's Indiana primary campaign in 1968, that it is politically possible to bring poor blacks and blue-collar white voters together. It is finally possible for Americans to transcend racial division and look instead to mutual interest. 
 When the Democratic campaign began last fall, Bill Clinton looked like fortune's child. As a progressive Arkansas Democrat, he knew from the start he could hope to do well on Super Tuesday, with all its Southern contests. The problem was how to get from here to there.
How to loosen Jesse Jackson's hold on black voters? Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia took care of that by announcing his candidacy. How to resist Mario Cuomo's national appeal? Governor Cuomo took care of that by checking out at the last minute.
How to neutralize the early psychological effect of the Iowa caucuses? Senator Tom Harkin took care of that; no one could compete with a native son. How to minimize the momentum of New Hampshire? Paul Tsongas was not exactly a favorite son but his Lowell, Mass., home is barely 10 miles from the border.
Then good fortune suddenly collapsed into what rivals called a scandal a week. Governor Clinton was beset by accusations of marital infidelity -- and skepticism about some of his rebuttals. Days later he came under criticism for supposedly dodging the draft, even though he behaved no less honorably than millions who despised the Vietnam War.
Now the tide has turned again. Last week, on the way to Super Tuesday, he won his first primary, in Georgia. And now, on the big day, he has won and won and won, most notably in Florida, where Mr. Tsongas, trying to mobilize momentum against money, fought the hardest.
The triumphs pile up a formidable heap of Clinton delegates to the Democratic Convention. And they vindicate the vision of a political analyst named Al From, who in 1985 founded the Democratic Leadership Council as a vehicle to drive Democrats back to middle-class voters. Governor Clinton was one of its founding members.
This council espoused pragmatic positions on national defense, national service and other subjects, but on none has it, or Bill Clinton, been wiser than race. Consider what he said last fall, and repeated during the campaign: For years, when times get tough, the Hard Right finds "the most economically insecure white people and scare[s] the living daylights out of them. . . . We want to be part of a nation that's coming together, not coming apart."
The Clinton campaign may suffer further jolts; the relationship he and his wife had to a failed savings and loan operator remains to be better understood. Or perhaps next week's Illinois primary will give him a decisive lead. But either way, the Clinton campaign has already accomplished something worth remembering: It has enabled Americans once more to say, without irony or bitterness, black and white together.

HEADLINE: Put Politics in Its Place

BYLINE: By Ernest F. Hollings; Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, is a member of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The two Congressional tax-writing committees have passed their anti-recession plans. As the strict party-line votes make clear, these plans have little to do with economic stimulus and everything to do with political stimulus.
It has been a classic election-year set piece: The Democrats stick it to the rich, and the Republicans bullyrag the Democrats for raising taxes. Senator Bob Dole explained the game this way: "While Democrats [get] their issue of 'class warfare,' they've got to explain to the people why they voted to raise taxes." Meanwhile, the President has promised a veto, and the prospect is for no pro-growth package this year. 
 This charade nicely serves the election-year purposes of Democrats and Republicans. But it grossly disserves a nation starving for economic leadership. The gamesmanship is all the more disgraceful when you consider that both parties essentially agree on the shape of an economic package. Here's the consensus:
Capital gains, everybody gains. It is silly to tout a capital gains tax cut as the holy grail and equally silly to demonize it. Most of us appreciate that if a cut is structured to reward long-term investments, it can make a difference. Democrats on both Congressional tax-writing committees have voted unanimously for cuts in capital gains taxes. Indeed, the Ways and Means Committee's plan would be even more generous than the President's.
Lollypops for the middle class? Pollsters tell politicians that this tax cut is a sure-fire vote-getter. But economists from John Kenneth Galbraith to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, ridicule it. Given our love of Sonys and Nintendos, this consumption-oriented cut is more likely to jump-start the Japanese economy than our own. Most politicians are (vaguely) for a middle-class tax cut in public statements, but in private most admit it is the same old game of buying votes with deficits.
Investment in the private sector. We don't need a jump start, but America's great capitalist engine needs a new battery. To that end, we need investment-oriented tax incentives including a capital gains cut, investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation and more. The challenge is to increase innovation and investment -- and jobs. Even Democrats have come to realize that you can't be anti-business and pro-jobs.
Investment in the public sector. Just as Democrats have embraced business-oriented tax incentives, mainstream Republicans favor robust investment in public-sector infrastructure and human capital. A Democrat could have delivered President Bush's State of the Union Message: he's for a boost in Head Start, in the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, Pell grants for college students, highway spending and more.
Indefensible defense spending. The President proposes cutting the Pentagon by $50 billion over five years, and he insists "this much and no more." But just about everyone else believes we can reap a bigger peace dividend. We don't need five more B-2's at $1 billion each or 150,000 troops in Europe. And, heavens above, why do we still have 45,000 G.I.'s in Japan?
Goose the economy, not the deficit. All must agree on this: with a whopping 20 percent of outlays going to pay interest on the $3.8 trillion national debt, the anti-recession package must not add a dime to the deficit.
Last week, Mr. Greenspan advised Congress to reject both the President's plan and Democratic alternatives. Many others believe that the best plan is no plan at all. But they are wrong.
Given the remarkable extent of Democratic-Republican agreement, why are we being so disagreeable? Let the Democrats pass their plan, and let the President have his veto. Then let's move a truly bipartisan plan through Congress this month.
For 50 years, we have had great success with American plans for Asia and Europe. Today, we desperately need an American plan for America.

HEADLINE: Financing Research For Nonmilitary Uses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Research Spending Is Declining in U.S. as It Rises Abroad" (front page, Feb. 21), reporting on the findings of the National Science Board, points to the need to rethink our country's science strategy in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union.
In the 1980's, the boom in research and development spending (particularly Federal spending) was fueled by huge increases in military spending and was skewed toward development, rather than toward basic research. That's one reason that all the additional research money did relatively little to improve our economic competitiveness. 
 Now the end of the cold war, in combination with the recession, is taking a toll on the research budget -- eliminating even the chance for indirect economic benefits from weapons research. The Government and industry have to find a way to move from their military orientation without impoverishing the productive research establishment of the United States.
One place to start would be by increasing financing for such new efforts as the Commerce Department's advanced technology program, which helps corporations finance innovative civilian research.
If we can come up with ways to help Soviet scientists who have been set adrift by the new world order, we ought to be able to do at least as much for our own. If we don't, the Japanese, who have been setting up corporate research institutions in the United States, may be happy to pick up the slack.

HEADLINE: Japanese Mistranslated on Work Ethic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The problem with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's now infamous remark that Americans lack a work ethic is that he never said it. It was a mistranslation by the press that has helped inflame anti-Japanese feeling in the United States to what some observers say is the highest level since World War II.
Despite protests by the Japanese Government and press, the American press has continued to repeat the misquotation, apparently relying on the original mistake. You state Feb. 4 (front page) that Mr. Miyazawa "said that America 'may lack a work ethic.' " A Feb. 13 front-page article refers to "Mr. Miyazawa, who said that Americans 'may lack a work ethic.' " A Feb. 18 article states he "even characterized American workers as lacking a work ethic." 
 Other reports have inaccurately lumped his comment with that of Yoshio Sakurauchi, House Speaker, falsely presenting a trend, despite Mr. Miyazawa's renunciation of Mr. Sakurauchi's remarks. Your Feb. 13 headline refers to Japanese leaders "Bashing U.S." A March 3 article states, "Japanese leaders have recently been calling Americans lazy."
Much of the reporting was influenced by an Associated Press article that quoted Mr. Miyazawa as saying of Americans, "In this respect, I have thought for some time that they lack a work ethic."
All of these variations are inaccurate. I am able to read some Japanese and looked at Mr. Miyazawa's remarks in the original. I showed them to translators. I checked translations and accounts from Japan's most respected news organizations -- the Asahi Shimbun newspaper and NHK TV -- and from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The disputed remark came when he was speaking about an American economic shift from producing goods to money manipulation, such as leveraged buyouts and junk bonds. According to the sources I consulted, a faithful translation of the much-quoted remark is, "In this area, I have long thought that something like a work ethic may be lacking."
That's a different statement. "In this area" refers to his immediately preceding remarks about nonproductive money manipulation. He also said the same problem exists in Japan's "bubble economy." He never referred to all Americans or their work ethic in general, much less to American workers. He merely said a work ethic is lacking in the so-called "money game" sector of both countries. That's not nearly so inflammatory as saying, "Americans lack a work ethic," which is easily taken as an insult to the American character.
The press should honestly re-examine its reporting in this case. Otherwise, Mr. Miyazawa's purported remark will enter the historical record and continue to poison the American mind against Japan, not only harming the world's most important bilateral relationship, but also adding fuel to what one recent article called a new "climate of fear" for people of Asian heritage in America. It will also continue to erode the credibility of the United States press in Japanese eyes and contribute to a growing Japanese disillusionment with the United States.
