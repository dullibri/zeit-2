HEADLINE: Baghdad Now Seen Exerting Economic Pressure on Kurds

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 5

 BODY:
The Government of President Saddam Hussein is applying economic pressure against the 3.5 million-member Kurdish minority in northern Iraq, apparently to force its reconciliation with Baghdad.
The pressure campaign over recent weeks has reduced gasoline deliveries to at least two major cities, Erbil and Sulaimaniya, and may also be interrupting some food and electricity supplies to the region, Kurdish and relief agency officials said. The campaign also has included a threat to the civil-service jobs of thousands of Kurds. 
 A United Nations official in Baghdad said he had witnessed a food truck being turned away from Sulaimaniya at an Iraqi Army checkpoint during a tour of the north last week. While the Kurds have not retaliated, Kurdish guerrillas control and could cut Baghdad's key highway route to Turkey, from which hundreds of food trucks arrive every week.
Referring to Baghdad's actions, a Kurdish spokesman in Washington said, "I think this is Saddam Hussein saying that if you don't deal with me, you will all starve to death."
 
Autonomy Talks Under Way
 Kurdish leaders have engaged in difficult autonomy talks with Baghdad since Mr. Hussein's forces crushed a Kurdish uprising in March in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war and United States-led forces occupied part of northern Iraq to insure the safe return to Iraq of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees.
Kurdish leaders met in nothern Iraq today over whether to negotiate or go to war with Baghdad.
The new pressure from Baghdad comes at a crucial time both for the Kurds and for Mr. Hussein. Over the summer, most of Iraqi Kurdistan once again slipped out of Mr. Hussein's control as Kurdish guerrillas pushed, cajoled and intimidated Iraqi security forces to relinquish their ground.
This has been possible in part because United States and allied warplanes are the omnipresent power in the skies over northern Iraq, and Mr. Hussein's armed forces have been unwilling to risk another allied intervention by challenging the Kurdish guerrillas' gradual expansion of control.
 
Tanks Seen Pulling Out
 Ten days ago, a reporter touring the north observed Iraqi tank brigades pulling out of positions in and around Erbil and Sulaimaniya. The redeployment appeared designed to cede control of these cities to Kurdish guerrillas while perserving Iraqi control over the main highways to Kirkuk, the northern oil center that Mr. Hussein insists on keeping out of Kurdish hands.
In effect, the Kurds have been able to accomplish incrementally and bloodlessly much of what they failed to gain through their uprising in March after the allied victory over the Iraqi Army in Kuwait. And the question of what should be the next step for the Kurds has divided its leadership council.
Kurdish officials say the most alarming aspect of Baghdad's pressure campaign for thousands of wage-earning Kurds was a notice sent around Oct. 22 to civil servants throughout the region informing them that to keep their jobs they would have to relocate to cities under Government control, like Mosul and Kirkuk. No one has been dismissed yet, officials said.
The Kurdish chieftain Massoud Barzani said in an interview in Dohuk on Oct. 26 that he had asked Baghdad to rescind the order.
 
Already Suffering Deprivation
 Government salaries for teachers, police officers and local utility employees are often the principal income in many homes in the region, which is already suffering the deprivations of postwar Iraq and the effects of the United Nations trade embargo.
Jalal Talabani, who leads one of the two largest Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, declared last week that the steps taken by Baghdad represented the onset of "economic warfare" by Mr. Hussein's Government.
Mr. Talabani said he was headed for a political showdown with Mr. Barzani over whether to continue negotiating with Baghdad for Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq, or to take a more confrontational approach such as establishing a provisional independent government for all Iraqi opposition groups in northern Iraq.
This step would in effect mark the beginning of civil war in Iraq, and Mr. Barzani has said he will oppose any attempt by Mr. Talabani to establish a rival government in Kurdistan.

HEADLINE: A Soviet Correspondent Goes Home Again

 BODY:
Viktor A. Linnik arrived in New York City four years ago as a foreign correspondent who sought to immerse himself in United States culture and write articles for his newspaper, Pravda, that described everyday American life for his Soviet readers.
Roaming across the United States, he sent reports to Moscow about the struggles of farmers in the American heartland and about the immigrants who were flooding into the cities of a country that had fascinated him since his days as an American literature major at Moscow State University. 
 But Mr. Linnik's tour of duty in the United States has been cut short, an indirect victim of the failed hard-line coup in the Soviet Union in August. Pravda, the once mighty Communist Party newspaper, has flirted with bankruptcy as it tries to survive at a time when the party has been outlawed and the Soviet economy is in shambles.
Mr. Linnik, 47 years old, said he has received little money from his editors since August, forcing him to curtail his travels and pushing him nearly $15,000 into debt. With little means to keep up its staff of foreign correspondents, Pravda is closing its New York City office, and Mr. Linnik is to return home this month.
For now, though, he trying to gather money to pay off his loans so he can board the plane for Moscow. He feels, he said the other day, like a sailor stranded at sea.
"I've been essentially living on whatever I can manage to scrape here and there," he said in perfect American English with only the faintest of accents.
"I can't use my car," he added, explaining that he had not been able to make payments on his car insurance in months. "What life is there for a reporter if he can't use his car?"
Other Soviet correspondents in the United States, like those from Tass, the Soviet press agency, and Izvestia, the Government newspaper, have not been as seriously affected by the fallout from the failed coup. Being the official organ of the Communist Party, Pravda received the brunt of the ire from the Moscow leaders who stood against the coup plotters. President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic closed the newspaper for a week after the coup.
Mr. Linnik's voice was tinged with bitterness as he spoke about the upheaval in his country and the shock waves that reached as far as his apartment and office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Even though he had been a party member since 1977, he said he did not mourn the death of Soviet Communism. But he stressed that the leaders who were empowered after the failed coup were little different from their predecessors.
"One thing that needs to be understood: the democrats, the reformers back home come from the same roots -- the party," he said. "They have the same vindictiveness, the same unscrupulousness. People now have stopped realizing this."
Mr. Linnik came to New York in the early days of the reforms instituted by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when journalists were beginning to test the boundaries of the censorship that had defined the Soviet press for so long. During the cold war, Soviet reporters in the United States usually filed home reports that sought to trumpet the failings of capitalism through reports that emphasized America's problems -- the unemployed, the drugs, the racial strife.
"What happened after 1985 was another extreme," Mr. Linnik said. "Everything that was written later was shown through rosy glasses. Everything was beautiful about America. This was the ideal country."
Mr. Linnik does not know what awaits him when he returns to Moscow with his wife and two young daughters. Because of his ties to the party, he fears he may be blacklisted and will be unable to work at Pravda or another newspaper.
"I'll have to see whether the country is changing for the better," he said. "It's a very depressing time -- for the country, for me personally. We're in a period of great instability, with the worst yet to come."
But Mr. Linnik said he leaves the United States buoyed by four years of memories.
"I've learned a lot," Mr. Linnik said of his tour here. "I will miss it."

On MTV, Talking About the MTV Generation

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
They are the twentysomethings and, between the ages of 21 and 25, there are some 22 million of them. Sometimes they are called the MTV generation. Now MTV is devoting an hourlong special report to these young adults struggling to establish a cultural niche for themselves, something that will distinguish them from the hippies and baby boomers and yuppies of times past. Skittishly provocative, the program, "MTV Generation," can be seen at 10 tonight.
Produced and directed by Lauren Lazin, who also co-wrote the program with Kurt Loder, "MTV Generation" makes a broad sweep of the country and finds a youthful landscape of enormous diversity and troubling doubts. These are the young men and women, we are told, who "grew up with a feel-good President and a Wall Street boom that's now bottomed out." 
 More than a few are cynical. Most television is dismissed as propaganda of one sort or another. Among their most vivid memories are Watergate and the Challenger explosion, described here as "a symbol of our nation going up in flames."
Perhaps more than anything else, there is uncertainty. About 40 percent of them come from a background of divorce, which might account for "The Brady Bunch" being their "most liked" television series. A fan of that show notes, not entirely sarcastically, how the mother had no job and "just went shopping." Among the more positive portraits gathered for this documentary is that of a close-knit Miami family of Colombian immigrants in which the mother and daughters work together to realize their dreams.
Dreams, in fact, seem to be in short supply. All of those interviewed want to do better than their parents, but that prospect, once so ordinary, is no longer assured. One Wisconsin man, struggling to support a wife and child, says he wants only "a nice steady job with good hourly pay." The auto plants in his area, however, have been shut down in recent years and nothing has emerged to replace them.
Diversions have become crucial. In Boston, one young man has a day job in an insurance agency "to pay the rent" and then spends most nights and weekends performing in a rock band. "You should be loud and boisterous and do whatever you want," he says. "And make big ugly mistakes and learn your lessons." The unemployed Wisconsin man has more limited options, one being to take the family out for a four-wheel-drive spin in a muddy field. "Makes me feel I can do anything," he says, pulling furiously at the steering wheel.
And then there is this generation's fascination with the past, evidenced in everything from the careful reconstruction of 1950's diners as hangouts for James Dean wannabes to 1970's discos bouncing with old recordings like the Village People singing "Y.M.C.A." Psychedelic 1960's? Catch the Doors revival. Exasperated with the retro-mania, John Kinney, a 25-year-old, became a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Time, urging "people our age" to "just say now" and concentrate on the present.
There are no prototypes in this group portrait. One man in Boston sees the world as divided into pimps and whores, the former being the bosses. Another in Eugene, Ore., raised in a hippie commune and speaking warmly of his family of radicals, says he is for peace and against large companies. But he says he also believes that money is important because it "plays an important part in what people can achieve." He's interested in real estate.
On the subject of the Persian Gulf war, opinions are predictably divided. Some take a proud "we're No. 1" stance; others note wryly how the world now knows that the United States can destroy 100,000 lives with maximum efficiency. Despite President Bush's speeches about a new world order, many younger people interviewed here don't seem to detect much change, at home or abroad. A sense of drift, of uneasiness, is reflected on the documentary's sound track as Michael Jackson sings "Man in the Mirror."
There is also mention of how young adults seem to be able to take in more information in a shorter time than could their counterparts in the past. MTV, of course, is a major force in this phenomenon with its hourly bombardments of rapid-fire editing. In that sense, "Generation" is pure MTV, tailored to short attention spans and packaged as tightly and energetically as any music video. In this instance, subject and style are remarkably compatible.

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION;
WOFFORD WINS SENATE RACE, TURNING BACK THORNBURGH; G.O.P. GAINS EDGE IN TRENTON

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 5

 BODY:
In a stunning upset that will raise the hopes of Democrats and the fears of Republicans facing elections next year, Harris Wofford, a little-known Democrat with an anti-Bush message, today trounced former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
Mr. Wofford, who was appointed to the Senate in May, was initially given almost no hope of winning the election. But in a trial run for themes that are certain to be important next year, he concentrated on the need for national health insurance and the problems with the economy and offered general pledges to help the middle class. In the last month he climbed in the polls by an average of almost a percentage point a day, and today he leapt ahead. 
 With 87 percent of 9,428 precincts reporting, the vote was:
 
Wofford . . . 1,594,443 (56%)
Thornburgh . . . 1,270,355 (44%)
As about 500 campaign workers and friends roared "Harris! Harris! Harris!," Mr. Wofford stepped to the microphone at 11:30 P.M., saluted the group and said "The first Democratic Senator in 23 years reporting for duty!"
 
'It's Time for Change'
 In his 15-minute minute speech in the ballroom of a Philadelphia hotel, he choked up as he thanked his wife, Clare, and every member of his family as well as his extended family, which he said included every Pennsylvanian. He said he had just received a "gracious" telephone call from Mr. Thornburgh conceding the race and wishing him well. Mr. Wofford responded in kind, telling the group that Mr. Thornburgh was a "true Pennsylvania gentleman and a good public citizen" who has "contributed much to this commonwealth and this country."
He said of his election: "I thank Pennsylvania for sending me as its messenger, and the message is it's time for change. The people of Pennsylvania on this glorious day have used the power of the ballot to send a wake up call to the President and to the Congress and Republicans everywhere."
 
'Hard-Fought Victory'
 And echoing a former boss, President John F. Kennedy, he said: "Let the word go forth from this place on the the Delaware to our nation's capital on the banks of the Potomac. We want national health insurance!"
Across the state, Mr. Thornburgh came to a ballroom in the basement of the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh with his four sons, two daughters-in-law and his wife to make his concession speech.
He told the crowd he had called Mr. Wofford and congratulated him on a "hard-fought victory." Mr. Thornburgh said that voter concerns about the economy and the cost of health care "obviously commanded much greater attention in the campaign than we anticipated."
He made no references to President Bush, who had campaigned for him in the state.
At Thornburgh headquarters, State Attorney General Ernest D. Preate Jr., a Republican, told reporters, "Things have got to improve in Washington, or it's going to be a difficult future for Republicans in Pennsylvania."
Mr. Wofford will serve the remaining three years of the term of Senator John Heinz, a Republican, who was killed in a plane crash over Philadelphia in April.
By defeating Mr. Thornburgh, who was a popular two-term Governor of Pennsylvania, Mr. Wofford becomes the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Pennsylvania since Joseph Clark in 1962. He was the state's Secretary of Labor and Industry when he was appointed in May to fill Mr. Heinz's seat until the election.
In recent weeks Mr. Wofford's campaign had swayed many voters, and the latest polls, made public last week, showed he had closed the gap with Mr. Thornburgh, who had emphasized his ties to Washington.
Republican strategists asserted that the election was not a referendum on President Bush's domestic policies, even though Mr. Wofford laid the blame for much of the nation's economic woes, social problems and political embarrassments on Mr. Thornburgh, who was also chairman of the President Bush's Domestic Policy Council. But Democratic strategists disagreed.
There is little dispute that the election showed how vulnerable incumbent Republicans are in this recessionary period and that Democratic proposals for national health insurance are tapping into voters' anxieties about the troubled economy and the fragility of their jobs.
Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of DYG Inc., a market and social research firm in New York, said: "This sends a very dramatic message, first to the White House that Bush is not invincible and that health care is one of the cutting edge issues of the 1992 elections. This race in Pennsylvania is a rehearsal of it."
A supporter of Mr. Thornburgh, Barbara Hafer, the state Auditor General, said Mr. Thornburgh was hurt by his failure to enunciate a message that connected with voters. "Democrats have to cross over in Pennsylvania for a Republican to win and we didn't give them a reason," Ms. Hafer said. "There was no compelling reason for them to break ranks."
The race may also give some insight into the conventional wisdom that Democrats who have voted Republican in recent national elections will come home to support their own party's candidates in a recession.
"There are many lapsed Democrats in Pennsylvania who voted for George Bush in 1988," when Mr. Bush carried the state with 50.9 percent of the vote, said Sandra Featherman, a political analyst and a vice chancellor of the University of Minnesota at Duluth. "They are Republicans on social issues and Democrats on economic issues."
 
Debate Over Health Care
 But precise reasons for people's votes may be hard to come by. Exit polls would have provided answers, but poll takers did not take an interest in the Pennsylvania race until after it had become a dead heat last week, and by then it was too late to organize the surveys.
 Conversations with voters indicated that many Wofford supporters were taken with his ideas on national health care. "Health care costs have ballooned at a ridiculous rate and poor people are shut out," said Dan Levitt, a 33-year-old independent film producer who lives in West Philadelphia.
But other voters were repelled. Standing outside the Spruce Hill Community Association in West Philadelphia where she had voted for Mr. Thornburgh, Eva L. C. Higgins, a 45-year-old biophysics researcher, said that she was voting against Mr. Wofford and his health plan. "Who is going to pay for it?" she said. "I come from Denmark where it's not working there anymore. It's too expensive."
At the same community center, Jim Mosetter, a 58-year-old paint salesman, said he had voted for Mr. Thornburgh. "I think he did a good job as governor and attorney general," he said.
But Jim Hoffman, a dairy farmer in North Annville Township in Lebanon County, said he was voting for Mr. Wofford, who he thought would be more sympathetic to farmers and their economic problems. "I hope he can help us," he said, adding that milk prices had sunk to 1972 lows.
Today, both candidates stayed near their home bases, Mr. Thornburgh in Pittsburgh and Mr. Wofford in Philadelphia. Both voted early and then roved on foot and by car in a low-key day of campaigning with their families.
Mr. Thornburgh toured a home for disabled children; Mr. Wofford spoke with students and faculty members at Temple University in North Philadelphia before having lunch at Day's Deli in downtown Philadelphia. Both candidates urged their campaign workers to get out the vote.
After Mr. Heinz's death, Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, spent a month searching for a temporary replacement, someone who would wage a strong campaign against Mr. Thornburgh, who was even then expected to be the Republican candidate. In May after several people, including Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation who is a Pennsylvania native, rejected the overture, Governor Casey appointed Mr. Wofford.
The 65-year-old Mr. Wofford, who was also an aide to President Kennedy and a former president of Bryn Mawr College, had never run for elected office. Most political analysts minimized his chance of winning when he began campaigning this summer, and the candidate's own polls showed him running more than 40 points behind Mr. Thornburgh.
But by Oct. 1, polls showed Mr. Wofford's campaign was taking hold, dealing a setback to Mr. Thornburgh, who was campaigning on his record and his familiarity "with the corridors of power" in Washington.
Mr. Wofford and his campaign managers were able to set the agenda for the rest of the campaign, calling for an extension of unemployment benefits, a greater effort to keep jobs in this country and tax cuts for the middle class. But more than anything else, his campaign was a crusade for national health insurance, although it provided few specifics. The latest polls, made public last week, showed that Mr. Wofford had nearly closed the gap and that the race was too close to call.
Mr. Thornburgh spent most of his 70-day campaign reacting to Mr. Wofford's platform, calling the health plan "untried, untested, radical and costly." But political analysts say he failed to present a clear message. The campaign was largely waged on television with 30-second advertisements that grew negative after the Thornburgh campaign in mid-October released a commercial portraying Mr. Wofford as a "liberal college president" who was partly accountable for Governor Casey's $3.3 billion tax increase this year.
The Wofford campaign responded with advertisements criticizing Thornburgh's performance as Attorney General, and were widely considered more effective and more damaging.

Symphony Of Grace And Grit: The Detroit

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
One has to admire the tenacity of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, which has struggled to stay alive in the face of a sharply deteriorating Michigan economy. Determination, of course, is not sufficient reason to keep an orchestra with a $17 million budget afloat. But at its Carnegie Hall concert on Monday evening, the musicians showed that what is at stake is a first-class ensemble with a sound that is impressively polished and warm. Its lower strings, in particular, provided a rich, glowing foundation in Arvo Part's ruminative "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten." And the transparency of the wind and brass playing gave the last two movements of the Ives First Symphony an alluringly springy, Romantic sound.
The orchestra was conducted by Neeme Jarvi, who is now in his second season as its music director. Mr. Jarvi is not a flashy conductor, but his gestures are clear and expressive, and sweeping when they need to be. 
 He began the concert with the Part, a mysterious and passionate work in which a simple descending string theme is treated as a mensuration canon, with each entry set in a different meter and at half the tempo of the previous entry.
But the effect is greater than a description of its materials would suggest. After a moment, the repeated, metrically varied theme creates a rich, hypnotic effect, and by the end of the six-minute work, one hears an interesting amalgam of Part's Minimalist accent and the lush string textures common to many of Britten's string orchestra works.
Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, the soloist in the Sibelius Violin Concerto, gave what seemed, at first, to be a more conventional performance than listeners have come to expect of her. Although she tinkered with the score's dynamics from the outset, some of the detailing she brought to the solo line early in the opening movement was thoughtful, sharp-edged and provocative, but not unreasonable.
By the time the movement ended, though, the eccentricity index had increased considerably, as did the quotient of pitch problems. Those problems increased in the final two movements. Intensity and inventiveness are qualities to be prized, but when they come at a cost in coherence and technique, the enterprise is devalued.
On the other hand, sometimes recasting a work's shape does it wonders. After the intermission, Mr. Jarvi took the Ives First, a patchwork of Brahms and Dvorak influences, leavened with Ives's own ingenious twists, and went a long way toward shaping it into a likable, cohesive piece. The orchestra responded to his efforts admirably, and played the symphony as if it were a top-drawer masterwork.

HEADLINE: The Law That Ate the Future

 BODY:
The Budget Agreement. It was the Holy Grail of 1990, the painful compromise between a Republican President and a Democratic Congress. It was holy because both sides solemnly pledged to abide by the deal for five years, and grail because the quest for honest deficit reduction took so many elusive turns. "Read my hips," President Bush gibed -- before finally accepting new taxes after all.
The same agreement has, in a different world, become the hair shirt of 1991, scratching at members of Congress who think the deal has gone sour yet feel a duty to stick with it. The truth is, however, that to preserve the 1990 budget agreement, it must be scrapped. 
 That's not sophistry. The budget law was designed to lower the deficit by $500 billion over five years, thereby spurring investment and economic growth. Had the world stayed put, it might have worked.
But 1990 was a light-year ago. Then, the Soviet Union was a military menace; now it barely survives as one country. Huge military programs justifiable a year ago make no sense today. And, compared with a year ago, the estimated cost of financing the Administration's defense program has soared so fast as to break the spirit of the budget agreement. To meet the deficit target now would force savage, unanticipated gouges in domestic programs.
It's easy to forget that deficit reduction is not an end in itself. Its purpose is to slow Washington's raid on private capital markets, freeing funds for investment. But viewed a year later, the budget law now threatens to protect private investment by trashing public investment in education, job training, transportation and research. That's why Congress must change the law.
The 1990 law called for reducing the deficit gradually. The cuts were backloaded, that is they bite especially hard after 1993, in order to avoid punishing the sluggish economy. And the law imposed an unprecedented pay-as-you-go discipline that would force Congress to pay for new entitlements with tax hikes or spending cuts.
So far so good. But the leadership imposed -- without consultation or debate -- a pernicious condition. For three years, non-entitlement spending would be capped in a way that would keep Congress from switching defense savings into domestic programs. Not until 1994 could non-entitlement spending be raised. What kind of sense does that make in this post-Communist world when Americans urge their Government to look homeward?
One remedy would be to collect the peace dividend now and use it to reduce the deficit, as the budget law would allow. But that's unlikely. Congress won't spit in the eye of defense contractors and workers on behalf of abstract virtue. If the choice is deficit reduction versus defense, defense will win every time.
Another remedy would be to stick with the budget agreement until 1994 before cashing in the peace dividend, letting unnecessary defense programs survive temporarily. But that turns out to be masochistic. New weapons systems, once started, can't be instantly stopped. The wasteful expenditures will roll along well past 1994, a course ruinous to worthy domestic programs.
The Congressional Budget Office provides a frightening estimate. If military spending proceeds as agreed last year, come 1994 and 1995 all non-entitlement spending will have to be sliced by a whopping 10 percent. Such cuts would brutalize investments in education, job training, technological research and every other public investment -- unless the country starts collecting the peace dividend now. That means renegotiating the budget agreement.
Broadly speaking that's hardly a novel idea. In recent weeks, members of Congress have rushed to propose that defense reductions be used for neither deficit reduction nor public investment. They want -- an election year's coming up -- tax cuts. This is a dangerous, cynical game.
Because the budget law was backloaded, the largest share of spending cuts was scheduled for 1994 and 1995. Even if taxes were not reduced one dollar, all manner of domestic programs would have to be savaged just to meet the modest deficit-reduction goal.
Preserving desperately needed public spending will require the entire peace dividend, and then some. To give it away in tax cuts borders on the unconscionable. Still deeper cuts in defense are needed; every cent of tax revenue is needed; the budget agreement is not.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Foreign Aid Follies

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Representative Dante Fascell is an old lion, gruff and friendly, and much liked by his House colleagues. Many of them wanted to vote for the new foreign aid authorization bill mainly out of respect for the long-serving chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Democratic leadership did a private head count before the vote and said all was O.K. But last week after dozens had risen to orate and fulminate on the House floor, the bill was defeated by 262 to 159.
There's nothing terribly unusual about not passing the bill to authorize foreign aid. Congress has not approved any such bill since 1985, while it went on to pass less conspicuous resolutions and appropriations bills to spend the aid money anyway. This quaint arrangement allows many legislators to say they opposed "foreign giveaways" even as the aid continues to flow. Most likely the story will heed that same script this year. 
 And yet there was a certain deep rumble in last week's vote. Call it fear, fear of a voter backlash for approving foreign aid in the face of economic hardships at home. Most Republicans generally oppose the aid bill, for reasons of party tradition and outlook. But this time they were joined by nearly half the House Democrats, an almost unprecedented number.
The Democrats are the traditional backbone of unpopular foreign aid bills. Were they contemplating realignment? Representative Howard Berman seemed to think so. The California Democrat scolded his colleagues during the floor debate for making "the antidote for George Bush's mistakes [on the economy] . . . a return to isolationism."
The Republicans sensed Democratic confusion and panic and moved in for the kill. Representative Gerald Solomon, Republican of New York, wielded his familiar rhetorical ax. Either vote against this "giveaway" measure, he taunted the Democrats, or "knock off your criticism of President Bush" for not doing enough for Americans.
Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, saw this political haymaker coming before it landed in the House. Which explains why he began advocating taking funds from foreign aid to pay for extended unemployment benefits. His stratagem would put the burden back on Mr. Bush, who badly wants the aid money to conduct his foreign policy.
Here the story takes a complicated turn. Though Mr. Bush yearned for the aid money, he said he would veto the bill anyway. Why? Because the Senate-House bill provided funds for family planning abroad, including abortion counseling. Mr. Bush found that provision intolerable, as did most Congressional Republicans.
But, and here the tale becomes still more intricate, most Republicans would have rejected the bill even without the abortion provision. Why? Because over and above the regular two-year $25 billion aid package, it also authorized a $12.2 billion increase in the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund. And who requested this extra money? None other than Mr. Bush himself.
This $12 billion kicker might also drive the Democrats off the aid reservation. But wait, there's yet another wrinkle that is almost certain to hold Democrats in the foreign aid camp. Remember the $10 billion loan guarantees for Israel? The Congress-White House deal, after Mr. Bush faced down the Israeli lobby, was to defer the issue until February. When that bell rings, Democrats will support the bill in order to get the guarantees, which could add $1 billion more to the aid tab.
But will Mr. Bush back those guarantees? Yes, if Israel suspends new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. No, if the settlements continue. But if he opposes the guarantees, the Democrats might not support the rest of the foreign aid bill he desperately desires.
And don't forget the $1 billion in emergency relief for the Soviet Union that House and Senate conferees just tacked onto the Pentagon budget bill. This soon will be voted on by both houses.
So everybody wins, or loses, or wins and loses or something, as official Washingtonians work themselves into a classic shaggy dog story. They can cut foreign aid and give the money to the unemployed. Or they can propose increases in aid, then vote against the aid bill. Or they can approve everything and just increase the deficit. However they choose, the nation will stand in awe.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
THE first thing I noticed was an occasional blurriness when I perused medical journals, especially when the print was small and light. Then the New York City street map became increasingly difficult to decipher while driving in less than bright daylight. But it was not until I had trouble reading my own cookbooks and had misread and therefore misdialed several numbers from the phone book that I finally decided to have my eyes checked.
Though I feared the worst -- cataracts or maybe retinal damage from the sun -- the diagnosis was "normal" presbyopia, the natural and unavoidable effects of aging on the lens of the eye. The solution was simple, too: reading glasses to help bring close objects into better focus.
 
A Universal Fate
 I was 49 years old when I sought help for my vision problem, and the ophthalmologist who examined me said I was lucky, since most people are for 40 to 45 when they first come in with the same complaint. He also emphasized that nothing I had done had caused it, nor was there anything I might have done to prevent it. 
 Presbyopia occurs when the lens, the convex disk that sits over the colored portion of the eye, loses its flexibility. Normally, muscles change its shape by contracting or relaxing, determining where light rays passing through the eye converge. If, as they should, they converge on the retina in the back of the eye, you get a clear image. If they converge in front of or behind the retina, the image will blur.
Youthful eyes have no trouble making the needed adjustments. But by the late 30's or early 40's the lens begins to lose its flexibility. The muscles still tug, but the lens is less and less able to assume a rounder shape that permits a clear focus on nearby objects. Instead the rays converge somewhat behind the retina.
To compensate, many people begin holding reading matter further and further away from their eyes or step back from it, changing the angle of the rays enough to permit them to focus on the retina. But eventually one's arms become too short. Or the print is simply too small to be seen from the needed distance. Other interim solutions include reading in brighter light or using a magnifying glass to see fine print, as in maps and phone books, where 3, 5 and 8 may become impossible to distinguish.
Eventually, however, usually by the age of 45, comes the day when glasses are needed to read with clarity and comfort. Among symptoms that send people to a vision professional are headaches and discomfort around the eyes toward the end of the day or after reading for a long time.
Dr. George Garcia, associate chief of ophthalmology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, pointed out that when presbyopia develops in people who are nearsighted (myopic), they often have to take their glasses off to read clearly. In the nearsighted eye the rays converge in front of the retina. However, when such an eye ages, the focal point for close objects is shifted further back toward the retina. Eventually, however, they will need glasses for reading as well as for distance vision.
People who start out farsighted usually need reading glasses sooner than others. As they get older, they may also need correction for distance vision because the lens can no longer make the accommodation that allows the distant image to focus on the retina; instead, light rays converge behind it. Farsighted people often end up needing bifocals or trifocals to get clear images at various distances.
The degree of stiffness of the lens gradually increases over 10 or 15 years, then usually stabilizes by the mid-50's.
 
What Can Be Done
 No exercise, medication, food or nutrient has been proved to slow or reverse this normal aging process. Going without glasses for as long as you feel you can get away with it or starting to use glasses sooner rather than later will neither forestall the problem nor make it worse. Eyes are neither strengthened nor weakened by corrective lenses; all that correction does is enable you to see more clearly without discomfort.
Nor does struggling to read fine print or reading a great deal injure your eyes. You may experience eyestrain if your vision is blurry, but your eyes will not get worse from such abuse any more than a camera would wear out sooner because it was used to take sharp or blurry pictures.
But the good news is, most people with simple presbyopia can get by very well with inexpensive reading glasses purchased over the counter at drugstores and other retail outlets. "Ready-to-wear reading glasses are effective, safe and economical," the American Academy of Ophthalmology's committee on ophthalmic procedures assessment, concluded in a statement published in September.
Such glasses are sold with a range of magnifications, from a correction of 1 diopter to up to 4 diopters in most states. Federal law specifies that they be made from impact-resistant glass or plastic (almost all are plastic ), and most meet or exceed national standards for both lenses and frames. Look for an endorsement on the label.
Over-the-counter reading glasses typically cost $10 to $15, instead of the $100 to $200 many pay for prescription glasses. Weaker lenses can be replaced as presbyopia advances. Most presbyopic eyes eventually stabilize at a correction of 2.50 to 3.50 diopters.
The academy committee pointed out, however, that if you started out with a significant refractive error (an astigmatism, or irregularity of the lens), or if your eyes differ considerably in focusing ability, over-the-counter glasses will not correct the problem.
In choosing the right magnification, Dr. Ben Ho, a San Francisco ophthalmologist, suggested using the guide that is mounted on the glasses' display case. Consider your usual work distances, for example, when reading or working at a computer terminal, when you try the various lenses for clarity. Or, Dr. Ho said, you might want to purchase two different pairs, one for reading and another for word-processing. Also consider the distance between your eyes; be sure the glasses let you see out of the center of the lens with each eye.
If you happen to choose wrong, you will soon know it because things will not be quite in focus and you will begin to experience eyestrain -- tiredness or achiness around the eyes.
It is important, too, to have a complete medical eye examination before buying over-the-counter glasses, to be sure there is no underlying disease contributing to your vision difficulties. Even if you have no problem seeing clearly, you would be wise to undergo a thorough medical eye exam by the age of 40. Thereafter, exams are recommended once every two to four years until 65, and then every year or two.

 CORRECTION:
The Personal Health column yesterday, about a loss of flexibility of the eye's lens in middle age, misstated the lens location. It is behind the iris, the colored portion of the eye, not over it.

HEADLINE: Ah, Smell the Gifts! Will Pizza and Buns Be Under the Tree?

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
WHEN gingham dogs and calico cats replace frills and furbelows in the nation's decorative psyche, it must be time for retrofood. Handmade brownies and wood-smoked barbecues now have more cachet than architectural desserts rising out of spun sugar and a crown roast of lamb.
Cost has something to do with it: $50 will buy you a lot more brownies than fancy sugar creations, more barbecue than crown roasts. For anyone who must cut costs on holiday gift giving but doesn't want the recipients to notice, experts recommend food. 
 "Food is the perfect gift that cannot be priced," said Jay Walker, chairman of Catalog Media Corporation, a marketing and promotional agency. "If I am trying to save money and I buy you a sweater you'll know what I spend. If I buy you a dozen figs from Israel do you have any idea what I spent?"
Expounding on his theory that mail-order food is a no-risk gift, Mr. Walker said: "You'll pay $18 for 14 pears not because they are worth $18 but because 14 pears is a really neat gift. It's better than a sweater because it's unique and I never met anyone who didn't like a pear or a pie. Nine out of nine people like pears; two out of nine people like the sweater you bought them."
Those people who are willing to spend $18 on pears apparently have more money than time; at least three million to four million of them shop by mail. Despite the recession, Mr. Walker said there are more mail-order shoppers now, enough to provide many mail-order companies with a tidy living.
With spice cakes and lemon cakes, pizzas and chutneys, granola and sticky buns, this year's mail-order gift list is down-home, but not so down-home that there are no blockbuster presents. There are three pounds of very large, very fresh shrimp, for example.
The mail-order packaging may not be elaborate, but the quality of the food is as high as ever. To find the best products, all the gifts considered for our list were purchased under names that would not be recognized by the companies. Companies unable to fill the orders properly or in a timely manner or whose product arrived in poor condition were eliminated from consideration.
The shipping costs for some items, often as much as the product itself, made several gifts impractical. Both the United States Postal Service and United Parcel Service have raised shipping rates in the last year, in some cases as much as 40 percent.
Endorsement of one product made by a company does not mean that everything that company sells is of comparable quality; only products tasted are on the list. In some cases, different combinations of products are available for gift packages. For the most complete information, telephone or write the company. Most have toll-free numbers.

From Page to Screen
When CBS paid a record $8 million this week for the American television rights to "Scarlett," people both inside and outside the movie and publishing industries gasped. But it was only the price that shocked them. Hollywood and the television producers have been on a mad shopping spree through bookstores and publishing houses lately, elbowing each other to pick up titles like shoppers at a holiday sale. 
 A glance at the television listings and movie pages these days is like looking at a book catalogue. Among the films currently playing in theaters are "Billy Bathgate," based on the E. L. Doctorow novel and starring Dustin Hoffman; "Rambling Rose," starring Laura Dern, based on the novel by Calder Willingham; "Shattered," a feature film based on the novel by Richard Neely, and "Year of the Gun," based on the novel by Michael Mewshaw.
Among other books that have led to television movies recently been broadcast or now in production are Danielle Steel's "Daddy" for NBC (which has bought a number of the author's other best-selling novels), Scott Turow's "Burden of Proof" for ABC and James Neff's "Mobbed Up," about Jackie Presser and the teamsters, which HBO is producing.
Movie producers have always looked to books for material, but the trend has taken off recently, as production costs have risen and the numbers of independent producers and cable television stations grow, increasing the competition.
"There is a growing stream of production types who come to your office, looking on your shelves to see jackets for books that are not due out for eight months, hoping to get a jump on the competition," said Esther Newberg, a New York literary agent who has negotiated film rights for many clients' books. "There are just so many more outlets, the competition is much stiffer and, frankly, the better ideas are coming from books. Screenwriters seem to be getting lazy. They are coming to us for books to turn into screenplays instead of coming up with original ideas."
Adapting a book can also cut development time by as much as six months, said Ruth Slawson, senior vice president for movies and mini-series for NBC Entertainment. "Economics plays into everything," said Ms. Slawson, who added that she believed it was comforting for viewers to see a familiar title in these days of overwhelming television choices.
One book clearly not destined for the screen is "The Devil's Candy: 'The Bonfire of the Vanities' goes to Hollywood," by Julie Salamon, soon to be published by Houghton Mifflin, about the debacle of producing the film based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel.
 
Penguin's Nobelists
 For years people at Penguin Books had been hearing that one of their authors, Nadine Gordimer, was on the short list to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. Each year the publishing house geared up for the announcement, and each year it was disappointed. The rumors surfaced again this year as Penguin prepared to published the paperback edition of "My Son's Story." This year however, Miss Gordimer won the prize, though not in time to add "Winner of the Nobel Prize" to the cover.
Then, after finally getting one current Nobel laureate on its list, Penguin discovered that it had two. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader who is under house arrest, won this year's Peace Prize, and Penguin plans to publish "Suu of Burma: Symbol of Hope," a collection of her writings, in the spring.
Penguin also publishes the works of John Steinbeck, who won the literature prize in 1962.
 
Double Strategy for North
 The spine of Oliver North's new book, "Under Fire," written with William Novak, gives a one-word hint about one of the publisher's strategies for marketing the book: Xondervan.
In an unusual joint venture within its own company, HarperCollins simultaneously published Mr. North's memoirs under both its adult trade division and Xondervan, a religious imprint within the company that one employee described as a "real Bible-Belt, serious God" division.
The company has used the same strategy only a few times before, most recently with the autobiography of Tom Landry, the Dallas Cowboys' coach. But William M. Shinker, senior vice president and publisher of the adult trade division, said he jumped to do it again with "Under Fire" because Mr. North is an evangelical Christian and book publishing is a fiercely competitive business.
Having the North book in both regular and Christian bookstores -- especially in The Family Bookstore, the largest chain of Christian bookstores, which is owned by Xondervan -- could really raise sales, Mr. Shinker said.
Xondervan is distributing and promoting about 10 percent of the 500,000 copies of "Under Fire" that have been printed. And in a true separation of church and state, the two branches are handling their promotions and sales independently.
"They don't know how to sell to our customers," Mr. Shinker said, "and we don't know how to sell to theirs."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY ELECTIONS;
With Anti-Florio Voting Wave, Republicans Win the Legislature

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

 BODY:
Riding a tide of anger over a record tax increase enacted by Gov. Jim Florio and the Democrats 16 months ago, New Jersey Republicans seized control of both houses of the Legislature last night for the first time in 20 years, possibly with veto-proof majorities.
 Some races remained in doubt early today, but decisive returns gave the Republicans at least 26 seats in the 40-member Senate, just one short of the 27 needed to override any veto by Governor Florio, a Democrat. The Republicans also appeared to have won 56 seats in the 80-seat Assembly, enough to override a veto, and possibly as many as 59 once close races are decided. 
Even Steven DiMicco, executive director of the Democratic State Committee, said the best the Democrats could hope for was a slim hedge against a veto-proof Republican majority.
 By that assessment, he said, the Assembly majority would be 52 to 28 in the Assembly and 26 to 14 in the Senate. The worst case, he said, would be a two-thirds majority, enough to override any Florio veto -- 56 to 24 in the Assembly and 27 to 13 in the Senate.
 The Republican sweep also included victories in 16 of the 21 races for county freeholder boards, including one in Middlesex County not controlled by Republicans for 62 years.
 Going into the election, the Democrats held a 43-to-37 edge in the Assembly and a 23-to-17 lead in the Senate. Setback for Florio Program
 The Republican victory bodes ill for the sweeping program that Governor Florio pushed through the Legislature last year, which included tax increases, more spending on education in poor districts and the nation's toughest ban on military-type assault firearms. Republicans have pledged to repeal or drastically revise all of them.
 In a statement released at Democratic headquarters in Trenton, Governor Florio said: "I congratulate the winners from both parties and I'm looking forward to working with them to steer our state safely through a national recession and deal with issues like controlling health-care costs."
 Issued with the statement was a second page labeled "Divided Government in New Jersey," tracing the history of the legislative sessions over the last three decades when Governors had one or both houses controlled by the other party.
 The breadth of the Republican victory also could spell trouble for Mr. Florio's own bid for re-election in 1993 if he chooses to seek a second term.
 And the outcome in New Jersey, a swing state whose voters have a reputation as barometers of national electoral attitudes, is sure to be sifted for its significance elsewhere as Republicans and Democrats prepare for the 1992 Presidential election.
 While Mr. Florio's troubles -- particularly his difficulty in justifying his harsh fiscal program -- were uniquely his, they also had meaning for many Democrats elsewhere, and for not a few Republican Governors as well, in his struggle to balance the books of an economically pressed state and then explain his drastic measures to the public.
 "Thus far we have heard no bad news," said the New Jersey Republican state chairman, Bob Franks, at a temporary party headquarters at the Somerset Hilton Hotel in Somerset. "It appears there is a landslide working its way across the state."
 The Democratic state chairman, Philip M. Keegan, conceded a little more than an hour after the polls closed at 8 P.M. that the Democrats would have difficulty holding onto their majority.
 
Some Bitterness
 Mr. DiMicco of the Democratic State Committee unofficially conceded the loss of the Legislature with some bitterness. "Clearly, I guess there is some percentage to acting as an irresponsible minority," he said. "And I hope that now that a new Republican majority is established, they understand the burdens of governing in difficult times."
 Democrats have accused Republicans of irresponsibly pledging to roll back at least part of the tax package enacted by Governor Florio and the Democrats last year.
 Last night, the Republican minority leader in the Assembly, Chuck Haytaian of Hackettstown, who is almost certain to replace Joseph V. Doria Jr., a Bayonne Democrat, as Assembly Speaker, reiterated a pledge to roll back the one-cent increase in the sales tax that was part of the Democrats' tax package.
 A number of Democratic names went down to defeat in the rout. The Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Laurence S. Weiss of Middlesex, was defeated by a Republican, Randy Corman, in the 19th Legislative District.
 Others included Senators Gabriel M. Ambrosio, Paul J. Contillo and Francis J. McManimon, along with Assembly members Marlene Lynch Ford and Anthony J. Cimino. Assemblyman John Paul Doyle lost to a Republican, Andrew R. Ciesla, in the 10th District in Ocean County.
 Mr. Haytaian said the sales-tax reduction was "the first priority."
 The Democrats have said that such a rollback would reduce revenues by at least $550 million, and possibly as much as $1 billion, a cutback they say is impossible in the face of a projected shortfall in next year's budget.
 Also at issue is Congressional redistricting, in which New Jersey will lose a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Republican leaders say they expect the lame-duck Democratic Legislature to attend to the matter rather than give the Republicans the opportunity to draw the new district lines.
 With 283 candidates in the field and campaign costs reaching $14 million, it was among the most crowded legislative races in New Jersey history, and certainly the costliest.
 And it was a bitterly fought contest. From the first day to the last, Republican candidates, incumbents and challengers alike, ran not against their opponents but against Governor Florio and taxes, neither of which was on the ballot.
 Besides the anger over the $2.8 billion tax increase rammed through the Legislature last year, Republicans benefited from the advantage normally held by the minority party in midterm elections and from redistricting -- a result of growth in the Republican-leaning suburbs -- that hurt Democratic urban areas.
 Republican radio and television commercials, newspaper advertisements, billboards, fliers and mass mailings -- whether the race was for courthouse or statehouse, the mayor's office or the Board of Chosen Freeholders -- all carried a common theme.
 Thus, newspaper ads for Bob Prunetti, a Republican candidate for Mercer County Executive, read as if he were running for the Legislature. He "opposes the Florio tax plan," "opposes higher salaries for state legislators" and "supports initiative and referendum -- the right of citizens to place proposed laws on the ballot."
 On the other hand, his opponent, Joe Bocchini, bought a full-page Election Day ad in The Trenton Times noting that he was "born and raised in Mercer County," "taught school in Hamilton" and "learned the values of hard work, honesty, loyalty and commitment."
 Nowhere in the ad did Mr. Bocchini mention one aspect of his "loyalty and commitment," his party affiliation. He is a Democrat.
 
Accent on Distance
 Indeed, putting distance between themselves and the Democratic Governor seemed a preoccupation for some Democrats. In the 13th Legislative District in Monmouth and Middlesex Counties, the Democratic incumbent in the Senate race, Jim Phillips, who was not in the Legislature when the Florio tax plan was passed, grew tired of being linked to the taxes by his Republican opponent, Joseph Kyrillos. Mr. Phillips went so far as to cart around a cardboard cutout of Governor Florio and "push it aside" during campaign appearances.
 Not to be outdone, Republicans circulated a picture of Mr. Phillips with the cutout in a brochure labeling him "the real tax-and-spend Democrat."
 Republicans made no bones about the fact that they were running against the Governor. "We definitely ran on the anti-Florio theme," said Jeffrey Michaels, executive director of the Republican State Committee. "It's the first time in many years that Republican candidates, top to bottom, have been running on the same issue. All Republicans are fighting Florio -- that doesn't happen all the time."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed After Fed Lowers Its Discount Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate.
Gold prices were also mixed, rising modestly in New York after falling overseas. 
 The financial markets were surprised by the timing of the Fed's decision to drop the discount rate -- the interest it charges commercial banks -- half a percentage point, to 4 1/2 percent. While Fed action to stimulate the economy was widely anticipated, the central bank was not expected to move until later this week at the earliest.
The early morning announcement knocked the dollar down to 1.6300 German marks, from 1.6330, but the dollar rebounded in a "quick rubber band movement," said Walter Simon, a vice president with Bank Julius Baer & Company.
The dollar closed at 1.6370 marks in New York, down from 1.6385 late Tuesday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6395 marks from 1.6425.
A drop in United States interest rates undermines the dollar because lower rates reduce demand for American investments. But because the Fed was expected to push rates lower at some point, the immediate damage to the dollar was short-lived.
Mr. Simon said the dollar moved aimlessly for much of yesterday's session.
"A lot of people are trying to square their books ahead of the long weekend," he said. Monday is Veterans Day, and many traders are expected to take the day off.
The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen in New York, slipping to 129.90 yen, from 130.025 late Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 129.88 yen in late London trading.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Breakfast Cereals Lose Some Luster

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
CHECKED the coupons in a Sunday newspaper lately? There are enough in one day's offerings to save shoppers more than $12 on breakfast cereals from General Mills and Kellogg. The recent costly marketing battles between the largest ready-to-eat cereal makers, while good for consumers, have taken some snap and crackle out of several analysts' views on the stocks.
"The competition clearly has intensified," said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, who is advising investors to hold the cereal stocks. One reason is the drag on earnings from the costly marketing battles. They added $100 million, a 25 percent increase, to Kellogg's selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter. 
 Some analysts also believe the stocks are fully valued, having risen sharply in the last year as the industry fared better than expected. Kellogg's closed yesterday at $104.25, up from a 52-week low of $68; General Mills closed at $63.75, roughly 50 percent over its 52-week low of $41.62. Several analysts estimate the companies' price-earnings ratio will be about 18 in 1992.
Despite the short-term caution, some analysts note the cereal business's long-term growth potential, both domestically and abroad. Many are recommending the companies as long-term investments.
Although Americans already eat a yearly average of 10 pounds of breakfast cereal, their growing appetite is fueling the $7.5 billion ready-to-eat cereal business. The industry has regained its historical 3 percent growth rate after two near-flat years. Analysts say a bowl of cereal, at about 20 cents a serving for consumers, is perceived as a solid value in a recession, and generous coupons may also be sending more shoppers down the cereal aisle.
Kellogg is the No. 1 cereal maker, with 37.4 percent of the American market. Some analysts say they admire even more the marketing smarts of General Mills, which derives about a quarter of its sales and almost half its earnings from cereal. Its other businesses include Red Lobster restaurants and Betty Crocker products. While Kellogg is seen as relying too heavily on its core brands of Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes, General Mills has introduced several "flanker" cereals that spin off its core products, like Apple Cinnamon and Honey Nut Cheerios. These helped drive General Mills' domestic share to 24.5 percent from 21 percent in 1988. Mr. McMillin believes Kellogg, whose primary business is cereal, is spending heavily in part to block its competitor from increasing its share.
The battle between Kellogg and General Mills is also eating into the market share of second-tier cereal producers, including Post, Nabisco, and Quaker Oats and Ralston Purina, which makes many private label brands. Given the marketing and distribution heft of General Mills and Kellogg, Mr. McMillin predicted the strongest would get stronger at the expense of smaller cereal makers. But because cold cereal is a smaller portion of the second-tier companies' business, the industry's prospects should not drive investment decisions for those companies, Mr. McMillin said.
The international market is more dynamic than the domestic one, with steady growth rates of 6 to 10 percent. The amount of cereal eaten in the sizable Japanese market, for example, has doubled in three years to a still small six-tenths of a pound of cereal per capita per year.
Internationally, Kellogg is considered the Goliath to General Mills' David. More than half of Kellogg's tonnage is sold outside the United States, and it has an aggregate market share of more than 50 percent in the 130 countries in which it sells cereal. It has plants in 17 foreign countries, and recently broke ground on a plant in Latvia. The company will build a plant in India next year, and has expressed interest in manufacturing in China.
But General Mills is also marketing heavily in Europe with its new partner Nestle. The company wants the joint venture, Cereal Partners Worldwide, to control $1 billion of the European market in the year 2000, when General Mills predicts it will reach yearly sales of $6.5 billion. It currently owns roughly 7 percent of the European cereal market.
In the cereal business, profit margins of 20 percent are not uncommon, and margins improve with volume gains. Given projected growth rates internationally, many analysts predict the companies will achieve yearly double-digit earnings growth through the year 2000. "It's very hard to find companies growing at such a rate," said Nomi Ghez, a Goldman, Sachs analyst in New York.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
With Soviet Aid in Limbo, Wheat and Soybeans Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wheat and soybean futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade as more traders gave up hope that the Bush Administration would announce a new Soviet food-aid package soon.
Wheat for delivery in December settled at $3.57 1/4 a bushel in Chicago, 5 1/4 cents below Tuesday's settlement; December corn fell 2 3/4 cents, to $2.46 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 1/2 cent, to $1.29 3/4 a bushel, and November soybeans dropped 6 cents, to $5.57 a bushel. 
 The crop markets opened lower and remained weak all day after President Bush said Tuesday that the United States' ability to help feed the Soviet Union was limited by Federal budget constraints.
Although Mr. Bush said he was still studying the Soviet Union's request for $3.5 billion in loan guarantees and direct aid, "it's clear we are not on the brink of any credit decision to the Soviets," said Rich Feltes, research director with Refco Inc., a Chicago commodities brokerage.
Grain prices rallied last week amid signals from Washington that an announcement on Soviet food aid was imminent. But analysts say President Bush appears to have grown more hesitant about helping the Soviets after Tuesday's election defeats of incumbent politicians and criticism that he has focused more on foreign policy than the domestic economy.
President Bush's failure to mention any possible Soviet aid yesterday was "very disappointing," said William Biedermann, research director with Allendale Inc., a commodities brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid signs that supplies are adequate for the time being.
Prices for refined petroleum products fell because home heating oil supplies are high as a result of a relative lack of cold weather earlier this fall, traders said.
Light crude oil for delivery in December settled at $23.40 a barrel, down 38 cents; December home heating oil fell 0.82 cent, to 71.02 cents a gallon; December unleaded gasoline fell 0.88 cent, to 66.28 cents a gallon, and December natural gas slipped 0.8 cent, to $2.063 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Tax-Exempts Mixed; Taxable Funds Off

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt money market funds were mixed in the week that ended yesterday. Taxable-fund yields continued to decline, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues The Money Fund Report.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, said total assets of the tax-exempt funds rose by $361 million, to $89.9 billion, in the week. The average days to maturity of holdings in the tax-exempt portfolios remained at 60. 
 "Money fund yields clearly will continue to decline," Mr. Frank said. "We also expect for the next few weeks we will see large institutional inflows into the money funds, coming out of money market holdings, such as Treasury bills and overnight money.
"We would expect," he said, "that unless the economy responds in the short run, which is unlikely, we may get further easing by the Federal Reserve in addition to the easing today."
Yesterday's cut in the discount rate by the Fed, Mr. Frank said, will start to show up in yields beginning next week.
Competing rates for bank products like certificates of deposit will drop faster than money fund yields for next three or four weeks, he said.
The seven-day compound average yield for tax-exempt funds was 3.98 percent, up 4 basis points. The seven-day simple yield was 3.90 percent, up 4 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The compound yield for 30-day funds dropped nine basis points, to 3.93 percent, while the 30-day simple yield was 3.86 percent, down from 3.94, a decline of eight basis points.
 
State-Specific Funds
 Among tax-exempt funds investing in individual state securities in the area, the top New York fund once again was the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.59, compared with 4.51 percent the previous week.
In Connecticut, there was a tie for the lead between the Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, and the Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market series -- each showing a yield of 4.28 percent.
Calvert Tax Free Reserves led the way in New Jersey once again, with a yield of 4.54, compared with 4.49 a week earlier.
The highest-yielding tax-exempt fund among those with assets greater than $100 million continued to be the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 5.05 percent, up 4 points from 5.01 percent last week.
 
Taxable Funds
 Assets of taxable funds, Mr. Frank said, rose $1.5 billion in the week, to $463.7 billion.
"Virtually all of the increase," he said, "came from institutional investors seeking the higher yield of money market funds as market yields dropped in respose to the Federal Reserve's recent easing action, not including today's action."
Average maturities of portfolio holdings were unchanged at 63 days.
 
7-Day Taxable Yield: 5.05%
 The seven-day compound yield of taxable funds dropped to 5.05 percent from 5.10, while the seven-day simple yield for the taxable funds dropped by 4 basis points, to 4.93 percent.
The average compound 30-day yield was 5.11 percent, down 5 basis points. The 30-day simple yield was also down, to 4.99 percent from 5.03.
The top-yielding fund among the taxables was Merrill Lynch Ready Assets Trust, with a seven-day compound yield of 7.18 percent. Explaining the extremely high rate, Mr. Frank said it was the result of the fund's unusual accounting method.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 4.86 percent, from 4.92 a week earlier, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

U S West Taps Digital For Financial Officer

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
U S West said yesterday that it had hired as its new chief financial officer, James M. Osterhoff, who recently resigned from the Digital Equipment Corporation, the big computer maker that has been hurt by the recession.
Mr. Osterhoff said in September that he had planned to resign from Digital but left his departure date open. U S West said yesterday that he would assume his new post on Dec. 6. 
 Mr. Osterhoff, 55 years old, replaces Howard P. Doerr, 62, who will remain as a U S West executive vice president until he retires on Dec. 30.
This is the second time that Mr. Osterhoff has switched to a completely different industry. Before joining Digital, he had worked for 20 years at the Ford Motor Company, where he had been an executive in Ford's automotive, credit, tractor and corporate staff divisions. "I was almost born and raised at Ford," he said in an interview yesterday.
When Mr. Osterhoff became Digital's chief financial officer in 1985, he had been the chief financial officer at Ford's credit unit. He presided over Digital's boom in the mid-1980's, but also over the company's sluggish profits in the late 1980's, as well as the losses posted this year.
Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., has about $14 billion in revenues for the fiscal year that ended on June 30, while U S West's revenues totaled about $10 billion in 1990.
"As far as finance, there is not a great deal of difference between automobiles and computers," Mr. Osterhoff said. "But they were completely different businesses as far as poduct cycles. You've got a five-year product cycle for cars, but for computers, it's often a year or less."
He said he wanted to go to U S West for a similar challenge of learning a new industry. "I'm 55 and I've been at Digital for nearly seven years," he said. "This is my opportunity to make that last big career change."
He denied a recent report in The Wall Street Journal that he had quit Digital after clashing over the company's financial restructuring plan with John F. Smith, a Digital senior vice president. Mr. Smith is close to Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's 65-year-old founder, whom The Journal portrayed as autocratic and unwilling to appoint a successor.
"Nothing in that story struck a responsive chord in me," Mr. Osterhoff said.
A native of Frankfort, Ind., Mr. Osterhoff received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University and an M.B.A. from Stanford University in 1963.
Although Mr. Osterhoff plans to move before December to the Englewood, Colo., area, where U S West is based, his wife, Marilyn, and their teen-age daughter, will move in June. The Osterhoffs have two other daughters who have graduated from college.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Rejected for A 2d Term

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee killed President Bush's nomination of Robert L. Clarke to a second term as Comptroller of the Currency today, first rejecting the nomination and then blocking further consideration of it by the full Senate.
Both 12-to-9 votes were strictly along party lines. They came a day after the President and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had lobbied the Democratic members of the committee in the hope that they would be able to turn two of them to join the Republican minority and approve Mr. Clarke's nomination to serve another five years as one of the nation's senior banking regulators. 
 After the vote, Mr. Brady accused Democrats on the committee of crass politics and character assassination and persecution.
 
Supervises 4,000 Banks
 "On a practical level, it makes no sense to take this action when credit availability is lacking, the economic recovery is sluggish and the American people ask for leadership," Mr. Brady said.
The Comptroller supervises more than 4,000 nationally chartered banks, including many of the country's largest institutions, holding about two-thirds of the industry's assets.
With President Bush expected to use Congress's rejection of his banking legislation as an issue in the next election, analysts said today that the Democrats were likely to seize upon the Clarke vote to blame the Republicans for the industry's problems.
"The Clarke vote suggests to me that what's happening to banks will be an issue in the next Presidential election," said James Barth, a former Government economist who now teaches at Auburn University in Alabama.
 
First Term Expired
 Mr. Clarke's first term expired in December. He was nominated for a second one in January and has continued to serve in the post. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Clarke declined to comment on today's vote. Under law, he can stay on the job until a successor is confirmed by the Senate, although today there was considerable confusion about how long he would stay.
Treasury officials said they were surprised that the full Senate would not be able to consider the nomination and that senior Administration officials had not yet begun to consider a replacement for Mr. Clarke. One choice mentioned today was T. Timothy Ryan Jr., who is director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the agency that regulates the nation's savings associations.
Two of the largest failures in banking history, at the Bank of New England and the First Republic Bank of Texas, came during Mr. Clarke's tenure. Critics have contended that he did not act promptly to discourage banks in the 1980's from making excessively speculative commercial real estate loans and to avert failures.
Mr. Clarke did not dispute a General Accounting Office conclusion that his regulators limited the scope of its examinations of the Bank of New England and took no enforcement actions until 1989 when it was too late. That banking company failed in January and may ultimately cost the bank insurance fund $2.5 billion.
 
Took Office in Boom
 "He took office in the middle of a boom and was very much deregulatory -- he did not flash a yellow light when all the banks went into real estate," said Robert E. Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration. "He basically got religion on the tough supervision in 1989, at a time at which everyone got religion. I view him as a victim of circumstance. I don't think he was a bad Comptroller. He just got caught in events beyond his control."
During today's debate, Republicans insisted, as they have in previous hearings on the nomination, that Mr. Clarke was a scapegoat who was no more responsible for the plight of the banks than Congress, the Administration and the other regulators.
Privately, some Republicans also said the campaign against him, led by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Banking Committee, was intended to cleanse Mr. Riegle's own record. Mr. Riegle was rebuked by the Ethics Committee for having intervened with regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., who ran one of the largest savings associations that failed.
"I guess we all assume that politicans are exempt by God from the sin of hypocrisy," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, shortly before the vote.
 
Sending a Message
 Democrats again maintained that Mr. Clarke's deregulatory approach depleted the insurance fund that protects bank deposits. Then, they said, he overcompensated by adopting standards that have contributed to what they have called a credit crunch.
"We have to send a message," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, whose local economy has been battered by scores of bank failures, high unemployment and a wave of business bankruptcies. "I've never before cast a vote on the basis of a message. Unfortunately, Bob Clarke must be the messenger."
Mr. Clarke, a 49-year-old Texas lawyer and Republican fund-raiser who is a native of Tulsa, Okla., came to Washington near the end of 1985 on the recommendation of a fellow Texas lawyer, James A. Baker 3d, who was then the Treasury Secretary. But Mr. Clarke's position in the Adminstration has not always been secure. Both the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher argued strenuously against renominating him.
In May, after criticism in Congress for his investments in high-yield junk bonds, he decided to put many of his personal assets in a qualified blind trust. The Comptroller of the Currency also serves as a director of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the savings-and-loan bailout agency that holds an enormous portfolio of junk bonds that have been taken from failed institutions. An Office of Government Ethics investigation cleared Mr. Clarke of any wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE CONTINUES PUSHING LOAN COSTS DOWN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
With the economy at a standstill and political pressure mounting, the Federal Reserve today reduced the interest rates it controls to levels not seen since the 1970's.
Banks across the country responded immediately and reduced their prime rate, the rate that determines the cost of many mortgages and other consumer and commercial loans, to 7 1/2 percent from 8 percent, the lowest since 1987. Credit card rates will probably not be affected, but the lower bank rates could save money for people who plan to borrow money to meet Christmas expenses. 
 Some analysts on Wall Street expressed surprise that the lower rates were announced in the middle of the Treasury's quarterly sale of securities and suggested that the move might have resulted directly from Republican losses in Tuesday's elections.
 
Decision Before the Election
 But a Federal Reserve official said that the key decisions were made at Tuesday's meeting of the central bank's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, before the election results were known, and that they were announced at the first opportunity this morning.
The Fed's actions had been so widely anticipated in the financial markets in light of recent economic data that the demand for new Treasury securities remained very weak, and the stock market hardly responded. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,038.46, up 7.15 points. [Page D10.]
The Federal Reserve Board met at 8 A.M. today and voted, 4 to 1, to cut the discount rate, the rate it charges banks for loans, to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent. This is the lowest rate since January 1973. Wayne D. Angell was the only member voting against the cut. There are two vacant seats on the seven-member board.
 
Quick Reaction by Banks
 As soon as they opened for business, big banks, led by J. P. Morgan, Citicorp and BankAmerica, cut their prime rate, and economic policy makers say they hope that portends increased consumer borrowing and spending during the Christmas season.
Finally, late in the morning, the Federal Reserve in New York bought large quantities of Government securities to indicate that it wanted to reduce the Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from 5 percent. It was the second reduction in a week in this critical rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, putting it at a level last seen in early 1977. The decision to cut the funds rate was made Tuesday afternoon at a meeting of Federal Reserve Board governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, a Fed official said.
The flurry of activity this morning came shortly after President Bush left for Rome for a two-day meeting of the leaders of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Bush has faced mounting criticism from his political opponents for concentrating on foreign affairs at the expense of dealing with the sour economy, and the White House announced Tuesday night that he was canceling plans for a two-week trip to the Far East after Thanksgiving.
At a news conference on the White House lawn just before he boarded his helicopter for a flight to Andrews Air Force Base, the President said he hoped lower rates would encourage consumers to borrow and spend. "I think when you look at historically low interest rates," the President said, "a lot of people will suddenly wake up and say this is a good time to buy a home, a good time to buy a car."
Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview, "It was clearly a responsible move in the right direction and should help the economy in the months ahead."
The economy has hardly grown during the Bush Presidency, a fact that is increasingly worrisome to top officials as the election year approaches. With the budget deficit forecast to be about $350 billion this year, far and away the highest ever, there is little room for the Government to lower taxes or increase spending, the normal responses to stimulate the economy before an election. So the Administration has become unusually dependent on the Fed to bolster the economy by reducing interest rates.
Since December, the discount rate has been cut by two and a half percentage points, from 7 percent, and the Federal funds rate has been reduced by two and three-quarter percentage points in 10 different installments.
 
Economic Malaise Persists
 So far, however, that has done little to stimulate lending, and in recent weeks, just when it seemed to be rebounding from the recession that began in the summer of 1990, the economy took a turn for the worse.
On Friday, for example, the Labor Department reported that payroll jobs fell slightly in October after two straight advances and that the unemployment rate edged up to 6.8 percent. And the Commerce Department that day disclosed that its index of predictive indicators turned down by one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the first decline since January.
Other recent grim statistics were an 8 percent drop in sales of cars and trucks during the final 10 days of October, a nose dive in consumer confidence for the month and drops in orders for durable goods and in sales of new single-family homes.
One of the few positive figures, a 2.4 percent rate of increase in third-quarter gross national product that broke a string of three quarterly declines, provided little comfort. Economists maintained and Commerce Department officials acknowledged that the strength was concentrated in the early summer and that most of the momentum had been lost by September.
 
Unusually Tight Credit
 In its official announcement today, the Fed said it had cut the discount rate because of slow growth in the money supply and unusually tight credit conditions.
In fact, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is known to believe that what he repeatedly refers to as "the credit crunch" is the main cause of the weakness in the economy.
The demand for business loans at banks has been declining for a year, and bankers around the country said in interviews today that they doubted the lower rates would make much difference.
The comment of Douglas K. Freeman, chief corporate banking executive at Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla., was typical. "The demand for credit is not driven by half-point changes in interest costs; it is driven by businesses' expectations of future demand for their products," he said. "Right now, that demand is just not there. I don't expect any line around the bank tomorrow."
 
Lower Rates on C.D.'s Seen
 While the lower rates could benefit borrowers, savers can expect a drop in the rates paid on certificates of deposits and money market accounts.
The main reason so little money is being borrowed, Mr. Greenspan agrees is that consumers lack confidence and businesses do not want to expand. But part of the reason -- perhaps 10 percent, he holds -- is because banks are tightening their belts unnecessarily and are not willing to lend to credit-worthy customers. That 10 percent, he feels, could be the difference between a healthy and a struggling economy.
Federal Reserve officials said a vote to reduce the discount rate could have been taken as early as last Friday when the latest data about a weak economy were released. But with an Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan, who prides himself on maintaining a collegial atmosphere at the central bank, decided to wait and discuss the matter with the bank presidents.
 
Fed Tries to Keep a Grip
 Action on the two rates was needed because the Federal Reserve avoids letting the funds rate fall below the discount rate. If that happened, there would be little reason for banks to borrow from the central bank, and the Fed would thus lose some leverage over the economy.
Mr. Angell gave no reason for voting not to cut the discount rate. But in the past, he has expressed concern that cutting the short-term rates the Fed controls was having little effect on long-term rates, suggesting that the markets still fear inflation.
The difference between short-term and long-term rates -- what economists call a steep yield curve -- is unusually large. Three-month Treasury bills are selling at about 4 3/4 percent, and 30-year bonds are selling at about 8 percent.
Private economists generally welcomed the Fed's actions today, but many of them attributed the decisions as much to politics as to economics.
"The perception in the market was that this move was a result of extreme political pressure from the Bush Administration," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a securities firm. "The Fed may not have intended it that way, but that is the result."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
10-Year Note Sale Disappointing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's decision to reduce the two interest rates it controls did not help the Treasury sell $12 billion worth of new 10-year notes yesterday.
Given the economy's poor performance and low levels of inflation, analysts and traders had little quarrel with the Fed's decision to cut the discount rate to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent and cut the target on the overnight Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from 5 percent. But some analysts said the timing of the moves was strange. 
 "One of the rules of thumb has been that you don't change policy in the middle of a refunding, if only because it adds to uncertainty in the market," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president at S. G. Warburg. "I have a real problem understanding the timing of this move."
The Fed's moves had little positive impact on the auction, but they did help to raise prices of outstanding short-term Treasury notes and bills. But long-term bond yields, which are higher now than they were the last time the Fed cut the discount rate on Sept. 13, moved only modestly lower.
 
Second of Three Auctions
 The 10-year note sale was the second leg of a three-part auction of debt securities the Treasury conducts four times a year.
It was also the second auction conducted under bidding rules that have been revised by the Treasury in the wake of the Salomon Brothers scandal. The disappointing 10-year auction followed by a day a disastrous three-year note sale. Both auctions pushed up borrowing costs for the Government.
Changes in monetary policy have been considered ill advised around refunding auctions because until recently these debt sales addressed the bulk of the Government's quarterly financing needs.
But the sharp rise in the Federal budget deficit has forced the Treasury to issue more debt more frequently, thereby reducing the importance of the quarterly auctions.
Still, the Fed's decision to reduce the discount rate during the refunding yesterday was the first such step in 11 years, said James Fralick, a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
"The market is still very uncertain of the auction dynamics," Mr. Fralick said. "And the Fed's move didn't help matters."
Traders said that bidding at the auction was sloppy, and that demand for the new securities, which were sold at an average yield of 7.53 percent, was weak. At the last 10-year note sale in August, the securities were sold at an average yield of 7.94 percent.
"What we are seeing is dealers that are playing things very cautiously, because there is less information about where the market is." Mr. Liro said. "That means that if you have an order book, you cover those orders and don't buy as much on speculation."
The fact that the market's price discovery system is not working as efficiently as in the past was visible in the discrepancy between where the new securities were trading seconds before the auction, and the levels at which bids were submitted.
 
Costly for the Taxpayers
 Just before the 1 P.M. bidding deadline, the new notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.51 percent.
But bids were placed as high as 7.56 percent for the securities, and as low as 7.50 percent. Analysts said the wide spread cost the Treasury at least $250 million in higher borrowing costs over the life of the issue.
After the rise in interest rates on the securities on Tuesday, an increase touched off in large part by the very poor sale of new three-year Treasury notes, some market participants said they had expected the 10-year note sale would have gone better.
That did not occur, and today the Treasury will sell $12 billion of 30-year bonds, the most speculative securities they issue.
Late yesterday the bonds to be sold today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.98 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the outstanding 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 101 13/32, up 6/32, to yield 7.99 percent, compared with 8.02 percent late Tuesday.
But, not surprisingly, the Fed's move to lower short-term interest rates helped to increase prices of shorter-term notes and bills.
By late in the day, for example, the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 100 23/32, up 6/32, to yield 5.611 percent. And the 6 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.95 percent. Shortly after the auction on Tuesday, those securities were offered at a price to yield 6.05 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell sharply.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.60 percent late yesterday, down 14 basis points, or one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 12 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.67 percent. And rates on one-year bills fell by 11 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.69 percent.
Despite the heavy issuance of new Treasury securities, corporations continued to price new debt issues.
Among the issuers yesterday was J. P. Morgan & Company, which offered $250 million of seven-year subordinated notes through an underwriting group led by Kidder Peabody & Company.
The 7 5/8 percent notes were priced at $99.882, to yield 7.647 percent, 50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 7.15 in Light Volume

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks made mild gains yesterday in light volume, as trading kept within a narrow range. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.15 to close at 3,038.46.
Confusion reigned, as investors held off from doing any meaningful buying, traders said. They focused more on a sputtering economy and weak corporate profits. 
 The Treasury's quarterly refunding, always a distraction to the stock market, was a disappointment at the 10-year note auction yesterday, the second bad auction in two days.
"Once the Government is done with its refunding, fundamental factors will again reassert themselves on the stock market," said John H. Shaughnessy, the senior vice president and director of research for Advest Inc. "With all the money there is around, this market has a shot at new highs before the end of the month."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 167.4 million shares, down from 172.1 million on Tuesday, with gaining issues outpacing losing ones, 896 to 728. The Big Board composite index rose 0.62, to 215.30.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was up by 1.26, to 389.97, and the American Stock Exchange index rose by 1.71, to 386.65.
Trading on the Nasdaq moved the composite index up by 0.66, to 539.48, as the Russell 2,000, a measure of smaller company stocks, rose by 0.40, to 184.36.
After initially opening higher on news of a cut in the Federal discount rate, blue-chip issues retreated, as investors shifted their focus to a sluggish economy. Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, picked up two buying and three selling programs that had a dropped the Dow by about 13 points. When news that the 10-year note auction did not go well reached the market about 2:30 P.M., a buy program already in progress, flipped into a sell, the firm said.
 
Amsco Up to $19.375
 In the market yesterday, Amsco International, which makes infection-control equipment, rose 3/4, to 19 3/8. Traders said Jean Queally, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, upgraded her long-term rating to "buy," from "above average," based on several new products. One is a vaporized hydrogen peroxide product that is expected to bring strong demand from dentists needing to sterilize hand power tools.
Unum Corp., whose business is in disability insurance, employment benefits and pensions, rose 2 3/8, to 72 1/8. David Seifer, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, reiterated his "recommend" rating, after an analysts' meeting on Tuesday with company officials, in which the insurer discussed its decision to pull out of the 401(k) market and take a $16 million charge in the fourth quarter.
U.S. Healthcare, which expects sales to be about $1.7 billion this year, rose 1 1/2, to 33 1/4. Traders said Joyce Albers, an analyst at First Boston, repeated a "buy" recommendation after analysts met with company officials on Tuesday. She said U.S. Healthcare was working on several new products for the self-insured market, particularly those that would expand into the $61 billion worker's compensation market.
A Shearson Lehman analyst, Edward White, lowered the 1992 earnings estimate on Adaptec, a manufacturer of computer data-flow systems. The stock fell 2 5/8, to 13 5/8.
Analysts said AST Research and Dell Computer were down yesterday amid concern that their dominance in the low-end market for personall computers would be threaten by Compaq Computer. AST was off 1, to 19 3/4, while Dell Computer fell 1 3/8, to 23 1/2. Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said he saw the low-end market as much easier to penetrate, so there was room for more players.
Meanwhile, Compaq, fell 5/8, to 27 1/4, after analysts lowered their 1992 earnings estimates following their meeting with company officials on Tuesday.
Lower earnings estimates by analysts on Weyerhaeuser, based on continuing prospects for the pulp and paper market, dropped the stock by 1 3/8, to 25 3/8.
On the heels of a new business strategy announced by W. R. Grace, which may include the sale of certain assets, the stock was up 2, to 40 1/4, as investors responded positively to the divestiture news.

HEADLINE: Maxwell Family Sees No Financial Upheaval

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Robert Maxwell's heirs and their investment bankers insisted today that the family-controlled publishing empire faced no immediate financial crisis and that they would not have to go beyond existing plans to sell some operations.
"I don't see any change in strategy," said Kevin F. H. Maxwell, who has been chief executive of the Maxwell Communication Corporation and who today became chairman, succeeding his father, who died on Tuesday. 
 He spoke in an interview in a ninth-floor office of the Daily Mirror building, where his father had presided over the empire.
 
Senior Family Member
 Kevin Maxwell, who is 32 years old and has emerged as the most prominent family member in the businesses, talked after a meeting with his investment bankers: Samuel Montagu & Company of Britain and Salomon Brothers and Rothschild Inc. of the United States.
Mr. Maxwell said the family's collection of private and public companies would not need to ask bankers to restructure its billions of dollars in debts, and he was clearly irritated by rumors of a pending financial crisis. He also said he did not think estate taxes posed a threat to the family's control of the group. "I don't envisage any issues of that nature," he said.
But investor jitteriness was apparent even though trading did not resume today in the shares of the two flagship companies controlled by the Maxwell family, Maxwell Communication and Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. Trading had been suspended on Tuesday. Analysts said nervousness about loans to Maxwell companies caused the stock prices of several large British banks to drop.
 
'One More Thing to Worry About'
 "It may not be as big a problem as people think, but it's one more thing to worry about," said Julian Robins, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd Securities Ltd. He noted that bank stocks had already fallen in recent weeks as banks informed analysts that their second-half results would be worse than many had expected because of problems stemming from Britain's recession.
In interviews, several lenders to the Maxwell empire said they were not panicking about Robert Maxwell's death but wanted assurances that the planned divestitures would proceed. They were eager to meet with Kevin Maxwell and his 35-year-old brother, Ian, who together formally assumed control of the group today.
A spokesman for Goldman, Sachs & Company, a lender whose loans are backed by big blocks of shares in Maxwell companies, gave no sign of being worried. This suggests that the American investment firm is confident that the price of the shares will not plunge to levels approaching a default when trading resumes.
"Those margin loans are entirely manageable in size for us," the Goldman, Sachs spokesman said. "We're quite satisfied with the collateral we've got." The collateral consists of 24.2 million shares of Maxwell Communication and 40 million shares of the Mirror Group.
 
Two Deals Seem Imminent
 It appeared today that the consummation of two deals that had been in the works before Robert Maxwell's death was imminent: the sale of Maxwell Communication's computer books division and of all or part of its 56 percent stake in Berlitz International Inc., the language-product and services group.
There was speculation today that a $160 million deal for the computer books unit was near completion. And trading in Berlitz's shares has been halted on the New York Stock Exchange, pending an announcement.
"There are other sales in process," said Robert S. Pirie, president and chief executive of Rothschild. "But I don't think Bob was heading towards selling core businesses and I don't think there's any rush to dump that policy."
In a statement, Ian Maxwell said that approach certainly applied to the Mirror Group, which he now heads. "We are not going to be taken over or sold off," he said. In May, the Maxwell family sold to the public 49 percent of the shares in the Mirror Group, whose properties include The Daily Mirror and four other British tabloids, racing newspapers in the United States and Britain, two free Scottish newspapers and minority interests in printing and forest-products companies.
 
North American Spinoff
 Kevin Maxwell said a decision would be announced later this month on how to proceed with a proposed spinoff of the North American operations of Maxwell Communication as a separate company, and to offer part of it to the public. Those businesses -- which include the book publisher Macmillan Inc., Official Airline Guides and Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing -- account for the vast majority of Maxwell Communication's assets and earnings.
So far this year, divestitures by companies owned or controlled by the Maxwells have totaled more than $1.9 billion. Analysts and British newspapers have estimated that the group has net debts of 2.2 billion to 2.6 billion, or $3.9 billion to $4.6 billion at the current exchange rate.
When asked about the 2.2 billion debt estimate that was mentioned today in The Financial Times of Britain, Kevin Maxwell replied, "I've seen so many numbers I wouldn't comment on that."
But he confirmed that the debt of the family's private companies totaled about 1 billion, or roughly $1.77 billion, early this year. He indicated, though, that this amount and the total debt of the public companies had fallen. "We've gone a long way towards reducing the indebtedness of the group," he said.

HEADLINE: Woolworth Profit Falls 49%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings skidded 49 percent as the continuing slump in consumer spending took a heavy toll on the retailer's business.
The variety and discount retailer said it earned $41 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 26, down from $80 million, or 62 cents a share, in the period last year. Revenue fell 1.9 percent, to $2.42 billion from $2.47 billion. 
 Woolworth said revenue from its chains, which include Kinney shoe and Foot Locker outlets, rose 7.6 percent. But revenue from general merchandise stores, including Woolworth and Woolco branches, was off 9.9 percent.
The company's revenue from its foreign operations was down 7.5 percent.
Woolworth's chairman, Harold E. Sells, said the sluggish economy, which has prompted consumers to curtail their spending, sliced into the company's sales in the United States and Canada. A new tax on goods in Canada also affected results.
The company's stock dropped $1.75, to $26.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Japan, in Rare Move, Charges Price-Fixing of Food Wrap

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Attempting to show it is getting tougher in enforcing long-neglected laws against monopolies, Japan's Fair Trade Commission charged eight major chemical companies today with fixing the price of plastic food wrap, the first criminal charges the commission has brought in 17 years.
Although some described the charges as more symbol than substance, since the food wrap business is much smaller than other industries where price fixing is said to be rife, most agreed that the symbol was a potentially powerful one. The commission also conceded that the charges had resulted from United States pressure to open the Japanese economy. 
 "This can be described as a sign of our tougher stance," said Fumio Noguchio, deputy director of the commission's investigation division. "It won't be another 17 years before we file more criminal charges."
 
Agency Called Toothless
 The Fair Trade Commission has long been reviled both inside and outside Japan as a toothless lapdog to industry that tacitly sanctioned the many cartels that control large sectors of the economy and keep consumer prices at or near the highest levels in the world.
The heads of sales at each of the eight companies were also charged, which added sting to the announcement, for it was an almost unheard of instance of executives being held responsible for carrying out corporate policies. They face prison sentences of up to three years and fines of up to about $3.85 million if convicted.
The companies are parts of most of Japan's major keiretsu, or industrial groupings held together with inter-locking share ownership, and included one manufacturer that is half- owned by Borden Inc. of the United States and half by the Hitachi Chemical Company.
The seven others are Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Mitsubishi Plastics Industries, Shin-Etsu Polymer, Gunze, Nippon Carbide Industries, Denki Kagaku Kogyo and Riken Vinyl Industry. The Government said they secretly agreed to raise prices twice last year, increasing the bulk price of the plastic wrap by 40 percent.
The companies have not yet had to file a plea to the charges, and they said they had not decided how they would respond.
 
Termed an Important Move
 "Today's announcement involves only one case, and it will take more to convince people that the Fair Trade Commission will really enforce the laws strictly," said Masahiro Murakami, an expert on monopoly law at Yokohama National University. "But most companies are going to realize clearly that they cannot continue with their old practices. This is an extremely important case for that reason."
The Japanese Government has never suggested that it intends to break up the cartels, which critics say exist, for instance, in the beer, construction and industrial materials industries. The Finance Minister recently characterized the securities industry, which is dominated by four large firms, as an oligopoly.
But after facing heavy criticism and pressure from the United States, the Government finally agreed last year to stiffen enforcement and increase penalties for violations of the antimonopoly laws to insure greater openness in the economy. After a series of trade talks known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, Japan agreed, among other things, to apply its antitrust laws more rigorously.
At times the attempts to demonstrate a new toughness have bordered on the ridiculous. Last year, the commission ordered some travel agencies to withdraw brochures on summer trips near the Arctic Circle that promised visitors they would see the midnight sun; the commission said that some of the travelers went to areas where there were actually only a few hours of darkness.
 
Civil Cases Filed
 But there have also been recent civil cases against construction companies for bid-rigging, a practice that is believed to be endemic, and against cement companies, charging that they agreed to reduce supplies to some areas to maintain high prices.
Mr. Noguchi said the commission sought criminal charges against the chemical companies because their actions were so blatant, because five of the companies had faced sanctions earlier for other antimonopoly violations and because consumers were directly affected by the conspiracy. Gunze, for instance, was penalized two years ago for cutting off supplies of underwear it manufactures to discount retailers.
The last criminal case was filed against 12 oil companies in 1974, charging that they rigged prices after the first energy crisis. Although the Government fined the companies, consumers never won compensation, and it is doubtful that they will this time. The Supreme Court held in the oil price-fixing case that consumers could not prove that the existence of a cartel increased prices beyond what market forces would have done.

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
London Venture Tests JMB Skills

BYLINE: By Richard D. Hylton

 BODY:
THE partnership that owns Randsworth Trust P.L.C., one of the most closely followed investments in European real estate by Americans, has stopped paying interest to Citibank on a 185 million loan and is negotiating with the bank to recapitalize Randsworth, people close to the negotiations said.
The troubles with Randsworth underscore how treacherous it can be for even the most knowledgeable real estate investors to put together foreign deals, especially with substantial leverage. With the venture not meeting its heavy debt payments, it now appears that a Dutch pension fund, which is already the largest Randsworth investor, will come to the rescue with a cash infusion. 
 Some of the American pension funds in the deal, including the Pension Reserve Investment Management Board, in Boston, have seen their multimillion-dollar equity investments wiped out as the value of the portfolio has dropped. Pension Reserve, for example, has written its $25 million investment down to zero.
In 1989, the purchase of the Randsworth Trust portfolio by the partnership of pension funds and the JMB Realty Corporation, the privately owned Chicago-based property giant, was heralded as the most significant entry of American institutional money into the European real estate market. But since 1990, the Randsworth partnership, which carries a large amount of debt, has been battered by high interest rates in Britain. More important, the partnership has not been able to sell off parts of the portfolio to pay down the debt it took on for the acquisition, because almost nothing is changing hands in the London market. The troubled deal has been a great embarrassment to JMB, which has a wide following among institutional investors and manages more than $22 billion worth of property for its own account and its clients.
The properties in the Randsworth portfolio are widely regarded as a good buy. But in the West End of London, where most of the property is, vacancy rates are around 10 percent, and in the City, the London financial district, the vacancy rate ranges from 18 percent to 20 percent and values generally are falling. The portfolio, which is now generating about a 4 percent return, has debt service that starts at 10 percent and goes up. At the end of 1990 the portfolio was written down 11 percent.
"It was a very good buy, but in hindsight the market turned bad and they made a strategic mistake in terms of leveraging the deal," said one executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Some real estate executives who are unconnected to the deal have expressed dismay at its failure because they fear it will now be more difficult to get pension funds to invest overseas. Neil G. Bluhm, JMB's president, acknowledged that negotiations to recapitalize Randsworth were under way, but he would not elaborate.
"We are negotiating and analyzing it with the investors and the bank to come up with a deal," Mr. Bluhm said. "We are a lot further along with discussions of specific ideas, but at this point nothing has been agreed on by anyone."
JMB Acquisition Partners, the limited partnership that holds about 16 percent of Randsworth, is trying to reduce the company's senior debt by replacing some of it with additional money from all of the equity partners. The largest equity holder, a Dutch pension fund known as A.B.P., or Algemeen Burgerlijk Pensioenfonds, is expected to be a key contributor of fresh capital, but just how much and under what terms has not been settled. JMB is now negotiating to determine what interest payment concessions Citibank would grant in exchange for paying down the loan.
The existing capital structure of the company consists of 135 million of publicly traded notes that pay a fixed 10 percent rate and mature in 25 years; 185 million in senior debt from Citibank; about 190 million of initial equity contribution, and an additional 57 million of equity contributed by some of the pension funds when JMB made a capital call last year, shortly after the deal was closed. About half of the Citibank loan has been fixed at an average rate of roughly 12 percent, but last year much of the debt was floating from 14 percent to 16 percent, further hammering the deal.
The Dutch fund, which already owns 25 percent of the equity in Randsworth, is likely to acquire an even larger position. Some of the other pension funds in the deal, which balked at making additional contributions when JMB made last year's capital call, are expected to refuse to contribute more money this time as well.
Meanwhile, the London commercial property market continues to soften, with new buildings still being added to the glut of office space.

HEADLINE: NATO CHIEFS SEEK TO DEFINE ITS ROLE

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 6

 BODY:
With NATO still looking anxiously for its place in the post-cold-war world, leaders of the 16-nation alliance who meet in Rome on Thursday are expected to point once again to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to justify the 42-year-old pact's continued existence.
This time, though, with the Soviet Union no longer posing a credible military threat to the West, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be responding to requests by Moscow and its former satellites that the alliance expand its political role and become a security pillar for all of Europe. 
 At their two-day summit meeting this week, President Bush and other NATO leaders therefore plan to approve creation of a new 25-nation cooperation council as a way of giving a formal structure to growing links between the alliance and the former Soviet bloc, including the three newly independent Baltic countries.
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, in particular, have been seeking security guarantees from NATO, even signaling their desire to join the alliance, while only last week President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he strongly favored turning NATO into a broad political organization.
 
Meeting Planned for Brussels
 The council, which should hold its first meeting at the foreign ministers' level in Brussels on Dec. 20, will have a mandate to discuss regional security issues and promote confidence-building measures at a time of growing nationality disputes across the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
But while NATO seems agreed on how to deal with its former enemies, there is no such consensus about its own military and political future and, above all, its relationship to other competing European organizations. And this debate is certain to continue well beyond the Rome meeting.
The military side of the issue looks relatively simple, with the NATO leaders due to endorse an 18-month-long strategy review under which the alliance will reduce its troop strength and create a new rapid reaction corps.
 
Decisions Already Made
 In practice, though, NATO leaders will be formalizing decisions that have already been made, including the gradual cutback of American troops stationed in Europe and the elimination of all but 700 warheads of the alliance's current arsenal of 3,600 nuclear weapons in Europe.
The unresolved question is whether NATO should lift its ban on "out of area" operations, a rule that prevented the alliance from playing more than a consultative role in the Persian Gulf war, even though many of its individual members participated.
Far more complicated, however, is the political profile that NATO should adopt, specifically whether it should acknowledge that the collapse of Communism in Europe has removed its principal reason for existence or whether it should redefine its role.
The United States has repeatedly stressed that it sees its place in Europe in the context of a strong NATO. Its European allies are eager for some American troops to remain here as a shield against instability in the former Soviet bloc and as a counterweight to Germany's growing power.
 
Europeans Seek Greater Role
 But as the European Community moves toward increased economic and political union, many European governments believe they should play a greater role in their own defense.
The demand by former Soviet bloc nations for closer ties to NATO reflects disappointment that the European Community has discouraged them from seeking membership and their recognition that the European Security Conference has little real power.
"We regard NATO as our long-term partner and we intend to develop our relations with this organization on a solid and wide-ranging basis," the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Yuri Deryabin, said recently after a visit to NATO's headquarters in Brussels to discuss closer ties.

HEADLINE: In Congress, Calls for a Caucus for Area's Goals

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Bridge closings. Higher bus and subway fares. And, ultimately, slow economic strangulation. That was the apocalyptic picture painted this spring as lawmakers from the New York metropolitan region mobilized opposition here to an ambitious Bush Adminstration proposal to rebuild the country's transportation systems.
In a rare show of unity over what is expected to be the country's largest public works program for the rest of the century, Republicans and Democrats from the region worked together on House and Senate versions of the transport bills to get millions of additional dollars for the area. 
 The success of the lawmakers in shaping the two bills, which will soon go before a conference committee, is fueling a new effort to create a regional Congressional caucus. Supporters hope it can add muscle to the area's efforts to grab a bigger piece of the Federal financial pie.
"It's desperately needed," said Representative James H. Scheuer, a Queens Democrat. "In unity there's strength. If we get together and do a little trading, we've got a lot of clout. We're sending tax dollars down there as if it's going out of style. But the Reagan and Bush Administrations have just about closed up shop when it comes to urban programs."
A variety of studies show that the difference between what the region pays to the Federal Government in taxes and what it gets in Federal spending is the largest in the country.
The 31 counties within 100 miles of New York City, including parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, last year sent $110 billion, which was $32.8 billion more than they got back, according to the Regional Plan Association, a research organization for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. That is enough, for example, to pay for the entire New York City budget -- $28 billion.
The most recent annual survey of Federal spending and taxing done by the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, found that New Yorkers last year paid $1,178 more in taxes than they received in Federal outlays; New Jerseyans fared even worse, suffering a per-capita deficit of $2,487; Connecticut residents had a $2,011 deficit. New Mexico residents, by comparison, received $2,776 more per person than they sent to Washington.
"If I were a voter looking at these delegations," said a regional official, "I would have to say, 'Hey, what are you doing down there?' " The official asked not to be identified because he works with the area's lawmakers.
 
Social Engineering
 Traditionally, Mr. Moynihan says, lawmakers from the Northeast have focused on everything but bringing home the bacon. He says that unlike other regions' legislators, who have approached the Federal budget as a scavenger hunt with billion-dollar prizes, the area's lawmakers more often have used the Federal purse to shape national priorities in what amounts to social engineering. While the country may have benefited, he says, the region was shortchanged.
Lawmakers from the region say it also is a victim of bias. Any bill viewed as favoring New York City starts with two strikes against it, they say, while legislation that hurts the city rides a current of natural support.
"The prevailing attitude appears to be wishing New York wasn't here," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association. "New York has a lot of needs that should be addressed on a collective basis."
There have been a number of previous attempts to set up a New York metropolitan region caucus. But all have collapsed amid regional competition and jealousies.
So far, Mr. Andlerson said, about a dozen of the 47 legislators from the region have committed themselves to the idea of a regional caucus or shown active interest in it.

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION: The Loser;
The Search for a Culprit In Thornburgh's Defeat

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Nov. 6

 BODY:
For Murray Dickman, the chief political adviser to Dick Thornburgh, Tuesday, Oct. 29, was an ominous sign of things to come.
On that morning, a poll by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette showed that his boss's lead over Senator Harris Wofford, Mr. Thornburgh's Democratic opponent in the race for the United States Senate, had been sliced one percentage point. Then, after Mr. Dickman had dropped off his boss at the airport, Mr. Dickman's car broke down. 
 "It was one of those days and times when the lightbulb goes on and you know things are going badly," he said.
 
A Warning for Others
 In remarks after his loss, Mr. Thornburgh suggested that things could go badly for President Bush if he did not respond to a tide of voter discontent and economic worries that drowned his Senate candidacy.
But other experts pointed out that Mr. Thornburgh could also blame himself. Republicans and Democrats agree that Mr. Thornburgh presided over a slack campaign and that he became a victim of his own hubris as he migrated across the political spectrum from Republican centrist to hard-nosed Reaganite.
"This election result has dated Dick Thornburgh fatally," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican and the publisher of the American Political Report. "He had been an independent Republican and a moderate when he was Governor of Pennsylvania. The 1980's turned him into a galvanized Reaganite, a pin-striped insider and a defender of the status quo. I don't see how he gets back that which first made him successful."
Other Republican strategists say it is too early to write his political obituary, though he is expected to go into political hibernation in the near term.
"I would not pronounce Dick Thornburgh politically dead," said Eddie Mahe, a Washington-based Republican strategist. "But he certainly is wounded."
 
Pointing Fingers
 As is often the case in the wake of losing campaigns, fingers are being pointed everywhere and reasons for this defeat are being proffered that have nothing to do with the campaign. In this case, Mr. Thornburgh and his aides blame a general mood of anxiety and discontent among the voters.
"We were smashed by a tidal wave that was bigger than Dick Thornburgh and Harris Wofford and the health-care issue put together," said Greg Stevens, president of The Media Team, a subsidiary of Ailes Communications and the company that handled Mr. Thornburgh's electronic-media campaign. "There was a tremendous confluence of dissatisfaction, anti-incumbency and anti-Washington mood that is driven by the state of the economy."
Even when their candidate had a commanding lead in the independent polls, Mr. Thornburgh's aides say, their own polling showed that 72 percent of the voters in the state felt the country in general was on the wrong track.
Although the Thornburgh camp lamented the state of the economy, unemployment in Pennsylvania has not changed greatly from the time that President Bush and the Republicans were riding high in the polls. Last month the state's jobless rate, seasonally adjusted, was 6.5 percent, slightly below the national average. In February, when President Bush's approval rating was rocketing in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, the rate was 6.7 percent.
Yet some of Mr. Thornburgh's aides do concede that his campaign must accept its share of the blame for its failure in taking Mr. Wofford too lightly and in not seizing upon a theme that would evoke a visceral response among the voters.
Mr. Thornburgh, who served two terms as Governor of Pennsylvania and was Attorney General under Presidents Reagan and Bush, had not run a campaign since 1982.
"We were rusty," Mr. Dickman said. "For example, in 1982, we were never as dependent on television as we are now."
Surrounded by a group of reporters eager to hear his view, Mr. Thornburgh said, "While I may style myself as a casualty of sorts of the gelling of these feelings in Pennsylvania this year, in the longer run it will cause a re-examining by all those who hold high office in Washington of precisely what they have to do to fulfill their responsibilities to the people."

HEADLINE: Election Cited in Push for Jobless Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Buoyed by Harris Wofford's victory in Pennsylvania, Senate Democrats moved today toward trying to freeze foreign aid and using the money saved to pay for extended unemployment benefits for people out of work at least half a year.
Even without committing themselves to that way of paying for the $5.6 billion bill, they were using it as a political club to swing at President Bush. 
 The President's budget director criticized the plan as a violation of last year's budget act. But Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, retorted, "Why is the President so ready, eager and willing to help people overseas and so reluctant to help people in need in America?"
 
Hesitancy on Effort
 Republicans and House Democratic leaders were wary of the Mitchell approach, which would limit foreign-aid spending in future years to the level being spent in the current fiscal year. But they agreed that it might carry overwhelmingly in both houses, perhaps at veto-proof levels, if allowed to get to the floor. And the savings of $7.7 billion would easily pay for the extra benefits of as many as 20 weeks that Senate Democrats have insisted on.
The unemployment benefits issue, which seemed on the verge of agreement just last week, remains bogged down not only over this bluntly partisan question of a freeze in foreign aid but also in a swirl of personal rivalries and arguments over numbers and the sanctity of the budget act.
Even though both parties in both houses seem agreed that the time has come to find a way to get an unemployment bill passed, negotiations have continued day after day without clear evidence of progress.
Last week House and Senate Democratic leaders agreed on one approach to financing: higher estimated taxes from high-income taxpayers with sharply fluctuating incomes. But the agreement dissolved after the House Ways and Means Committee balked at endorsing the plan with only 45 minutes' notice, and complained that it would be too harsh on taxpayers who depended on income from mutual funds and partnerships.
Following Mr. Mitchell's lead, the Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee met Tuesday, and again today, and coalesced behind the approach of freezing foreign aid, even though their own chairman, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, proposed using the increase in estimated taxes.
As for the Republicans, they signaled last week that they were ready to deal, and Mr. Bush, who had killed two earlier bills to help the jobless on the ground that the measures would raise the Federal budget deficit, began calling for quick action.
That appeal was renewed today by Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who complained of "the two parties' vying for political position," and by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin, who issued a statement saying: "The Democratic Congress has fiddled long enough. By waiting for the right moment for political one-upmanship, they have lost sight of the need."
But the Democrats were listening todifferent drums today -- the ones from Pennsylvania, where Mr. Wofford, having forged a campaign in which he portrayed Washington as indifferent to the nation's domestic needs, retained the Senate seat to which he had been appointed against the Republican challenge of Dick Thornburgh, the former United States Attorney General.
For example, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, in joining a number of floor speeches calling for extended unemployment benefits, said, "Yesterday the people of Pennsylvania sent a message that they're no longer going to tolerate the absentee-landlord approach of the Administration."
And, using a news conference hailing Mr. Wofford, Mr. Mitchell attacked Mr. Bush over foreign aid and promised to keep the Senate in session until extended benefits become law.
One uncertain factor is the stance of Congressional Republicans. Their leaders have said they want to negotiate but have not made clear publicly whether they agree with the insistence of Mr. Bush and his budget director, Richard G. Darman, that in the process the budget act must be complied with completely.
Mr. Mitchell's plan would clearly violate the act, as Mr. Darman said. First, it would not pay for itself in each year, because most of its costs would be paid out in the current fiscal year and the foreign aid savings would occur in future years. Second, it would take money from foreign aid spending and use it for domestic purposes, a shift the act forbids before Oct. 1, 1993.
In addition, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, denounced the plan as "capriciously irresponsible" because it would slash foreign aid without first studying how the cuts would affect American policy.
 
Assessing Plans
 Generally, Republican lawmakers find the Bentsen plan more enticing on its own merits and because they consider it easier to deal with its backers, Mr. Bentsen and Representative Dan Rosentowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, than with the more partisan Mr. Mitchell.
But the Bentsen plan, too, would fall short of paying for itself in its first year and Mr. Darman has made that point while also calling for a reduction of the benefits it would provide. Mr. Bentsen's plan also includes retaining a $900 million employers' unemployment insurance tax in 1996, when it is scheduled to expire. Mr. Darman has also labeled that measure unacceptable.

HEADLINE: A Soviet Company Offers Nuclear Blasts for Sale to Anyone With the Cash

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A new Soviet trading company is trying to market the power of underground nuclear explosions for commercial application to anyone in the world who has the cash.
It is the first time that nuclear blasts are known to have been put up for sale, but the venture is surrounded by great uncertainty given the political turbulence in the Soviet Union and rising opposition around the world to nuclear blasts. 
 The atomic exposions are being marketed by the International Chetek Corporation of Moscow, a private trading company tied to the Soviet arms complex. Its initial goal is to carry out blasts in the Soviet Union for the incineration of toxic wastes. But the company says it will eventually try to do whatever the customer wants, as long as it is commercial and peaceful in nature, including conducting nuclear explosions in other nations.
 
Dangers Cited
 The move has startled Western experts, who say nuclear blasts could damage the environment and that the nuclear devices would be at risk of falling into unfriendly hands. Other experts, however, say the Soviet ideas may have technical merit and should be evaluated.
There apparently are no international accords that bar one country from selling nuclear devices to another for peaceful purposes.
The nascent marketing effort shows the lengths to which the crumbling Soviet bloc will go to acquire hard currency by converting military industries to civilian ones.
"We're willing to entertain all ideas," said Danny Wolfson, an agent for Chetek at Ph.D. International Trading Inc., a small concern in Montreal, Quebec. "It doesn't matter who, where or when. We have all the technologies and they're going to be used."
Mr. Wolfson said Chetek is owned by shareholders that include company officers, private Soviet enterprises, a scientific center, and most importantly, the Soviet ministry charged with production of nuclear weapons.
 
Has Many Uses
 Of the world's nuclear nations, only the Soviets have an extensive record of using underground nuclear blasts for civil ventures. Applications have included the creation of underground storage vaults, seismic exploration of geologic formations and the stimulation of gas and oil production.
Opposition to the fledging effort at commercializing the blasts is widespread among environmentalists and arms-control experts who know of it.
Dr. William C. Potter, an official of the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, tried to foster public debate over the marketing effort after visiting Chetek's office in Moscow last month. He wrote an article appearing on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times today.
"Chetek is representative of a general danger," Dr. Potter said in an interview. "Soviet weapons scientists are faced with tremendous economic hardships and are going to be tempted to sell their services to anyone who is prepared to provide hard currency."
Tariq Rauf, a senior associate with the Canadian Center for Arms Control and Disarmament, in Ottawa, has also investigated and publicized Chetek and similar Soviet ventures that are getting under way.
"Everybody in Moscow wants to make a deal," he said. "These people are not really concerned about the consequences of the sales. They only want the dollars."
Dr. Ray E. Kidder, a weapons expert at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said the notion of using nuclear blasts to incinerate hazardous wastes and even nuclear warheads had technical merit.
"It would be cheapest way to dispose of them, by far," Dr. Kidder said. "But lots of environmental questions would have to be settled. You'd also have to find ways to make sure the blasts would not be used covertly for the further development of nuclear arms."
Underground detonations are essential for perfecting new warheads. Thus, their cessation is often seen as a way to halt the nuclear arms race.
The Non-Proliferation Treaty, ratified in 1970, has no apparent prohibitions against commercial sales, as long as the blasts are for peaceful purposes. Its only conditions are that transfers from a nuclear power to a non-nuclear one occur "under appropriate international observation and through appropriate international procedures," and that the price be fair.
For decades the Soviets have led the world in applying nuclear detonations to civilian efforts, conducting more than 120 blasts. The United States also investigated such peaceful applications of the atom, but dropped the effort in the 1970's as fears arose about the contamination of the environment with radioactive residue from the work.
The Soviet Union used the blasts to create underground cavities for storing fuels and disposing of chemical wastes such as the brine produced by oil fields. Another use was to stimulate the production of gas and oil fields by shattering rock and releasing trapped pockets. They also used blasts to extinguish stubborn fires in gas wells, and to generate powerful shock waves that helped geologists learn more about the earth's crust and mantle.
Chetek, an acronym formed from the Russian words for man, technology and capital, was formed late last year to try to sell these and other nuclear technologies to the world. In particular, it has promoted the novel idea of using nuclear blasts to vaporize all kinds of extremely dangerous wastes. The destruction would occur a little more than a half mile beneath the earth's surface, where a nuclear bomb was surrounded by waste and then exploded.
 
Marketing Campaign
 The company's president, Vladimir B. Dmitriev, began a quiet marketing blitz in early April, hailing the process at an international scientific conference in Moscow on the elimination of chemical arms. "It will be possible to export services," Mr. Dmitriev told the conference. "The problem of chemical weapons and highly toxic waste products destruction is urgent for many countries of the world."
Later in April, Mr. Dmitriev traveled to Ottawa for a scientific meeting on the environmental consequences of underground nuclear testing, sponsored by the Canadian Center for Arms Control and Disarmament, a private group. There he startled the audience by detailing his company's plans and suggesting that a trial waste-elimination blast be conducted in the Soviet Union under international supervision.
Also at the meeting and backing the waste plan was Dr. Alexander K. Chernyshev, a department head at Arzamas 16, the principal Soviet bomb-design laboratory.
"Everybody in the room thought they were nuts," recalled John M. Lamb, executive director of the Canadian center and the meeting's chairman. Later Mr. Lamb objected strongly when Chetek sought to say in a promotional brochure that the Canadian meeting had "discussed and approved" the nuclear technology.
 
Moscow Backed Plan
 The commercial effort did, however, soon get boost from Viktor N. Mikhailov, the Soviet deputy minister of atomic energy and industry. He wrote the United Nations to endorse Chetek and the notion of using nuclear weapons to incinerate all kinds of wastes.
On Oct. 7, Mr. Dmitriev of Chetek signed an agreement with Ph.D. International Trading to have the exclusive rights in North America for any waste destruction, and the international rights, excluding Europe, for all other nuclear services or technologies. "This process will be carried out by the company together with the ministry of nuclear energy of the U.S.S.R.," said the agreement.
Mr. Wolfson said that he has had preliminary discussions with companies in the United States and Canada about the destruction of chemical wastes as well as other peaceful applications of nuclear blasts.
Mr. Wolfson played down the idea that bombs would be traveling between countries, saying there would probably be strong political objections to such transfers. Even though such exports are envisioned by Chetek, he said, they might never materialize.
For the waste-incineration plan, he said, the initial strategy is for waste material to be shipped to the Soviet Union for destruction there. He said his company has already made arrangements for special canisters, trucks and ships that could safely transport even radioactive wastes.
 
Price Range
 The cost for waste destruction, he said, ranged between $300 and $1,200 per kilogram, or 2.2 pounds. "It goes by the danger," he said. "We just can't take a back loader and go after it. You need specialized equipment. The actual transport is done at night because you don't want to bother anybody.
"People may not like it," he added, "but it's the cheapest, easiest way to get rid of really dangerous wastes."
Opposition to such blasts is great and growing, however, even in the Soviet Union. Last month, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a unilateral, one-year moratorium on underground nuclear tests and urged other nuclear powers to follow suit.
Mr. Wolfson, without being specific, said the moratorium posed no difficulty. Private arms experts say that Chetek and the Soviet Defense Ministry are pushing to have the moratorium interpreted as applying only to blasts for arms development.
Christopher E. Paine, a senior research associate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in Washington, said the whole idea of marketing nuclear blasts was dangerous.
"It's, 'Have bomb, Will travel,"' he said. "It's serious and has huge implications for weapons proliferation. The largest nuclear establishment in the world is undergoing a process of financial and political disintegration."

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION: The Winner
Man in the News: Harris Llewellyn Wofford Jr.;
Backstage No Longer

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania toiled for decades in obscurity as a backstage political operator and idea man, gaining the ears of figures like President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
But his election to the Senate on Tuesday marked Mr. Wofford's ascent to center stage as a political giant slayer. 
 It is an unlikely role for Mr. Wofford, who, with his courtly, professorial disposition, was portrayed by opponents as a 65-year-old remnant from the 1960's who was more ready for retirement than the Senate: an unabashedly liberal former law professor who seemed more at home mulling over abstract ideas than dealing with the politics of Capitol Hill.
But Mr. Wofford fooled the Republicans and many in his own party. By packaging himself as an outsider, and underscoring the reputation of Dick Thornburgh, a former Attorney General in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, as a purveyor of Washington's "inside the Beltway" mentality, Mr. Wofford tapped an apparent unhappiness among voters about politics as usual, winning his first election.
 
'I Am the Messenger'
 In keeping with his unpretentious demeanor, Mr. Wofford asserted at a news conference in the Capitol today that voter discontent was as significant in his election as his own qualities as a candidate.
"I am the messenger of a message that came through strong and clear," he said. Sounding themes of his campaign, Mr. Wofford declared that people are "fed up and they want action to get our economy off dead center and get us moving out of this recession and they want national health insurance and they want it now."
John P. Coyne, a friend of Mr. Wofford since he worked for him in the Peace Corps in 1962, said he was by his side in a Philadelphia hotel when the returns came in. "I told him, 'You've always been the bridesmaid and now you're the bride,' " said Mr. Coyne, a novelist who lives in Westchester. "One side of Harris is the philosopher-theologian and the other side is the very cool and capable political operative. Now he's in the position of having the ideas and having the opportunity to make them work."
Mr. Wofford said he made his first telephone call this morning to Teresa Heinz, Mr. Heinz's widow, assuring her, "I will do my best to carry on that legacy, which is one of a Senator who reached out beyond his party and beyond his region to represent all of Pennsylvania."
But his critics say they fear Mr. Wofford is too ensconced in an ivory tower to be responsive to his constituents.
"I have the sense that he's not liable to be taken seriously -- he's liable to be taken as a relic of the 60's," said Abe H. Frumkin, a Philadelphia lawyer who was Mr. Heinz's campaign treasurer. "He's too unconnected between his ideals and the reality of accomplishing them."
Mr. Wofford has had little time to make a mark in the Senate, but he was careful to behave like an outsider, refusing to accept the pay increase that was approved in July as well as some free mailing privileges. His Democratic colleagues did their best to pull Mr. Wofford into the limelight that benefits an incumbent, repeatedly including him in news conferences on extending unemployment benefits although he was not a significant player in the legislation.
Mr. Wofford's campaign against Washington in some ways echoed that of Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who was the only candidate to defeat a Senate incumbent last year, and who looks on the Pennsylvanian as a political soulmate.
"Other senators viewed him as kind of professorial when he came here," Mr. Wellstone said. "He proved to be an extremely good politician. He intuitively understood that the only way to win was to express just outright indignation with politics in Washington. No holds barred. And he did."
Harris Llewellyn Wofford Jr. was born on April 9, 1926, in New York City. He spent his early childhood in Johnson City, Tenn., where his parents owned an insurance agency, and his teen-age years in Scarsdale.
Mr. Wofford's Democratic leanings were already apparent when he was 10 years old. He tells the story that in the 1936 Presidential campaign, he walked to school for months so he would not have to ride in the family car, which displayed a bumper sticker supporting Alfred M. Landon, the Republican candidate.
After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1948, Mr. Wofford and his wife, Clare, traveled to India and wrote a 1951 book about Mohandas K. Gandhi, "India Afire." As an informal adviser to Dr. King, Mr. Wofford later arranged for the civil rights leader to travel to India to discuss tactics for non-violent civil disobedience.
Mr. Wofford earned law degrees from both Yale University and Howard University, where he was one of the first white students. He then worked at the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, then for the United States Civil Rights Commission. He taught law at Howard and Notre Dame before before joining the Kennedy Administration as a special assistant on civil rights.
Mr. Wofford was a founding staff member at the Peace Corps and was its associate director until 1966, when he became President of the New York State College at Old Westbury. From 1970 to 1978, he was president of Bryn Mawr College.
 
Sons Worked in Campaign
 After practicing law at a Philadelphia firm for several years, Mr. Wofford was named chairman of the state Democratic Party in 1986 and a year later was appointed by Gov. Robert P. Casey, his mentor, as the State Secretary of Labor and Industry.
The Woffords' sons, Daniel and David, both worked on the campaign, and describe their father as having a passion for books and enjoying swimming and poking around the vegetable garden. The Woffords' eldest child, Susanne, teaches English at Yale University.
But his family members are also quick to note that beneath his academic exterior, Mr. Wofford has an easy sense of humor. That surfaced today, when the Senator recalled for reporters the initial press coverage of his appointment.
"I began with a headline saying, 'What is Harris Wofford? It sounds like a town in Great Britain,' " he said. "Which didn't help with my Irish friends."

As Senator Harris Wofford basked in victory and television lights during a morning of nonstop interviews in a hotel lobby here, his two top campaign strategists sat nearby, sipping coffee and marveling at their strategy's success.
"This is the rarest thing in politics, an upset landslide," said James Carville, a 47-year-old strategist from Louisiana, whose partner, 30-year-old Paul E. Begala of Houston was the Wofford campaign's manager. 
 "This is like one time in my life where all the lines just crossed," Mr. Carville added. "It was an off-year election, a statewide election with national implications; it was an election against a well-known candidate by an unknown and it was a tested candidate against an untested candidate. There won't be another one like this."
 
A Winning Message
 Mr. Wofford and his message clearly crossed the right lines with voters, who crossed party lines, changed voting habits and braved unseasonably cold weather to vote for a man most of them barely knew. Political analysts who followed the campaign closely say Mr. Wofford won because he was a credible, qualified Democratic candidate who tapped into the deep well of middle-class anger at incumbents.
His call for national health insurance resonated profoundly with people who had concerns about their jobs, family health, personal finances or the direction of the economy. And his opponent, Dick Thornburgh, ran a defensive and ineffective campaign.
This was a David versus Goliath race. Mr. Wofford, whose June polls showed him trailing Mr. Thornburgh, a former two-term Governor of Pennsylvania, by a 67-to-20 margin, transformed that into a shocking 55-to-45 victory margin. Mr. Wofford, a former college president and one-time aide to President John F. Kennedy, had never run for elected office before; Mr. Thornburgh is one of the state's best known politicians, who when he left the governor's office in 1986 had a 72 percent approval rating.
But one asset the Wofford campaign had, Mr. Begala said, was that Mr. Wofford himself knew the central issues he wanted to champion from May 9, the day Gov. Robert P. Casey appointed him interim Senator to replace John Heinz, a Republican who was killed in a plane crash in April.
 
'Going for Change'
 And people who voted for Mr. Wofford got his message, loud and clear. "I am going for change," said Ralph D. Salyards, a 73-year-old Republican who lives in Hollidaysburg, in central Pennsylvania. "I am very dissatisfied with President Bush."
Debbie W. Klotz, a 37-year-old homemaker from York said: "I liked national health care for the simple reason that being unemployed, we are paying our own health insurance, and we can't afford it, but we can't afford to do without it."
And Maryanne O'Brien Donohue, a Scranton homemaker, said, "I really feel this is a time when the Democratic party is representing the middle class."
Even though Mr. Wofford was an unknown entity to most voters, few questioned his qualifications, Mr. Carville said. "What really helped, in this short campaign with intense coverage, was Harris's credentials," he said. "The media took him seriously from Day One. You know, they said, 'All right, in the forest of Senatorial timber, this guy is a redwood.' "
Mr. Carville, a lawyer, has run political campaigns since 1982, with Mr. Begala assisting him since 1984. This Senate race was their 10th consecutive statewide victory since 1986. "Notice I said 'statewide,' " Mr. Carville said. "We actually lost a mayor's race in Houston, but we're like doctors, we bury our mistakes."
The team's statewide candidates included Governor Casey of Pennsylvania, Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson of Kentucky, Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, and Senator Frank R. Lautenburg of New Jersey, all of whom are Democrats. The unlucky mayoral candidate was Fred Hofheinz. The Wofford campaign was Mr. Begala's first as manager, though he has worked with Mr. Carville since graduating from law school in 1984.
Cliff Zukin, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, said: "Carville is extraordinarily effective and ruthless. The race between Pete Dawkins and Frank Lautenberg is widely regarded as the nastiest Senate race in the history of New Jersey politics."
Voter turnout, at 63 percent of Pennsylvania's 5.3 million registered voters, was considered moderate to high for a non-Presidential-election year, and analysts believe many people went to the polls because of the Senate race, which had taken on the character of a referendum on President Bush's domestic policies. By all accounts, Mr. Wofford succeeded in tarring Mr. Thornburgh, who served as chairman of President Bush's Domestic Advisory Council, with just about everything that anyone did not like about President Bush's policies.
"From Day One, Harris said the two Federal issues he was concerned with were national health insurance and extending unemployment insurance," Mr. Begala said. "Harris said he had run up against those two issues almost every day in his job as secretary of labor and industry. He said that health insurance was the Gordian knot, to use a Woffordian phrase, of every labor-management dispute he'd been involved in for the past five years."
 
The Health Insurance Issue
 When people responded extremely positively to the candidate's speeches and the campaign's first advertisement, Mr. Begala said, the campaign team realized that national health insurance would be its central issue. In that advertisement, Mr. Wofford said that if people have a fundamental right to a lawyer when accused of a crime, that working people should have a right to a doctor when they get sick.
Even when Mr. Thornburgh belatedly criticized the national health insurance plan, late in the campaign, the Wofford team was not concerned. They had done a survey in July of about 600 registered voters across the state, and it had included a presentation of the three most powerful concerns people have about national health insurance: that it would lead to higher taxes, would create massive Government bureaucracies and would take away people's ability to choose their own doctors.
"We lumped the three horribles together and, by a 63 to 30 percent margin, people said they still wanted national health insurance," Mr. Begala said.
People responded positively to Mr. Wofford's campaign, saying in interviews today that they sensed he was not just a candidate up on a soapbox telling them what he thought they wanted to hear. Mr. Wofford's discursive, rambling speeches and his rumpled, professorial appearance seemed to reinforce his image as a man of the people; a guy who milked cows at 4:30 A.M. to make friends with a few farmers.
"I felt Wofford was talking directly about the issues," said Bill Patterson, a 26-year-old unemployed librarian who particularly like Mr. Wofford's ideas on national health insurance and extending unemployment benefits. Mr. Patterson said he had been a Democrat until 1988, when he registered as a Republican and voted for George Bush. He said he would not vote for President Bush next year.
But political analysts say that it was campaign strategy as much as the issues that won the election.
"Far too much attention is being given to health care, and too little attention is given to the way the Wofford campaign controlled the agenda," said Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia. "Other than the quality of the candidate, that is the secret of success in any campaign. And Carville is always very aggressive, forcing the other candidate to react to his agenda."
The Carville-Begala team is bold. On Labor Day, after a summer of "awful, awful, awful" fundraising, the campaign had dredged up only $250,000, Mr. Begala said. "We had to get our message out to get more money," he said. "So we put it all into ads the week of Sept. 9. We went for broke."
Or, in Mr. Carville's poker metaphor, "We moved the stack to the center of the table." After that week, the Democratic National Senators Committee kicked in $500,000, and the Wofford campaign ultimately received and spent $4 million in the final 70 days.

HEADLINE: West Moves Cautiously on Renewing Zambia Aid

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Western donors, who often had stormy relations with Kenneth D. Kaunda, the defeated President of Zambia, say they are taking a "wait-and-see" approach before offering new aid to the country's newly-installed Government.
The restoration of the Zambian economy, one of the weakest in Africa despite the nation's fertile farmland and wealth in minerals, would be a long process with even more hardships ahead, they said. 
 Some expressed concern that President Frederick Chiluba, a labor union leader who was sworn in Saturday, had still not named a Cabinet today. Mr. Chiluba has pledged to dismantle state-run corporations and introduce private enterprise and market economics.
"The new Government was very critical of many of the policies of the old Government," said Duncan Wai, a World Bank official in Washington. "But we want to see what they are going to put on the table. We don't know to what extent these disagreements will be translated into policies."
But Mr. Wai said his international lending agency had not given up on Zambia despite the country's lack of progress over the years. "We are committed to work with Zambia as long as they unite on a position that the bank thinks is on the right track," he said.
Mr. Kaunda, who had presided over Zambia's largely nationalized economy since its independence from Britain in 1964, once described the International Monetary Fund as "a mad doctor" who prescribed quinine for every patient regardless of its illness. In 1987, objecting to the fund's economic austerity recommendations, he broke relations with the fund and the World Bank.
He invited them back, but relations were again derailed in September when Zambia failed to make a debt payment and reneged on a promise to halt food subsidies for the urban poor. As a result, the bank refused to go ahead with a $200 million loan.
With a population of nearly eight million and a debt of about $7 billion, Zambia is reported to have the highest per capita debt ratio in Africa.
Several Western diplomats said Zambia would likely get some short-term aid from their countries as a reward for the smooth transition from an authoritarian government to a democratically elected president and Parliament. But the disillusionment with the economy was such that new aid would not be sustained unless Mr. Chiluba lived up to his promises quickly.
The United States, which ranks behind the Scandinavian countries and Britain in the amount of its assistance to this country, canceled $15 million in agricultural aid and $20 million in food aid in May, after Mr. Kaunda balked at halting corn price subsidies.
Senior members of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, the new party that swept the elections against Mr. Kaunda, say they believe that the key to an economic rebirth in Zambia lies with the farmers.
 
Weak Export Figures
 "Agriculture is a big part of the answer," said Guy Scott, chairman of the party's agricltural committee and a likely Minister of Agriculture.
Zimbabwe and Malawi, two neighboring countries, earned well over $400 million in tobacco exports alone, Mr. Scott said. By comparison, he said, Zambia exported only about $20 million in agricultural products, even though the soil was better and the countryside less populated. He added that the poor export figures were due to farmers not being offered adequate prices and being paid up to two years late.
In the last year, farmers rebelled by not growing corn, the staple food here, or by smuggling their crops across the borders into Zaire or Malawi where higher prices were paid, Mr. Scott said.
In the last month, he added, Zambia was spending the last of its foreign exchange buying corn at market prices from South Africa.
Mr. Chiluba pledged during the last week of his campaign to halt the corn subsidies that Mr. Kaunda had insisted upon keeping in order to placate the nation's urban poor. The World Bank has said that among the first requirements for restoring Zambia's economy is the lifting of the subsidies. Mr. Scott said he did not know when this would happen.

HEADLINE: Men Say Worry About Harassment Leads Them to Tone Down Conduct

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
The nation's new sensitivity to sexual harassment is stirring men to rethink the protocols of working with women.
Out of respect for women or out of fear of recrimination, they say they are trying harder to keep lewd jokes, raunchy language and the voyeur in their blood to themselves. 
 Some rules now seem clear, said more than three dozen men interviewed here recently, including business owners, laborers, clerks, and students preparing to join the work force. Female co-workers are not to be propositioned, pinched or fondled. The men say that they would not proffer promotions or raises in return for sexual favors, and that they do not make remarks about legs or breasts -- although they do say they witness such things.
But other matters are not so clear: whether to ask female colleagues out, how to address them, whether to comment on their appearance. For the most part, the men said, they choose caution, not all of them happily.
"Now you've got to be defensive as hell," said Louis Regnier, the 63-year-old president of a downtown real estate firm with 20 employees, a third of them women. "You can say, 'You look great today,' and get some screwball saying that's a sexist remark."
Vincent Del Nero, 30, construction manager for an electrical contractor, said: "You have to be more reserved. I'm treating women in the office less like friends. It means the workplace is less fun now. You can't kid around as much."
 
Thomas Hearings a Factor
 Some of the restraint and tension among men here is a result of the Clarence Thomas hearings in October: Each man interviewed said he watched them. But the men say the new attitudes also emerge from the sea changes in society that have brought so many women into the work force.
Providence, a windswept city of 161,000 at the center of New England's economic renaissance and subsequent collapse, provides a barometer of men's changing attitudes. Women poured into the work force here, driving the growth of employment in the services, though that is abating now with 9 percent unemployment and the collapse of banking institutions. Women also drive trucks and have joined construction crews and the police force; a few have reached the pinnacles of business, the professions and government.
The city's residents come from clashing cultures that contribute to confusion about women. A shrinking minority of Yankee patricians controls the oldest institutions, banks at the Hospital Trust Company and plays golf at the Agawam Hunt club. Second- and third-generation Irish and Italians vie for control of state and local government, and newer arrivals -- blacks, Latin Americans, Cambodians and Laotians -- have been moving into blue-collar and menial jobs.
"The stereotype of Italian men is that they're warm-hearted," said Sheldon S. Sallosy, president of the Providence branch of Manpower Inc., the temporary services firm. "They think nothing of putting an arm around a woman. Should they do that? The answer might be they should only do it to Italian women."
Age is also an issue. "I say 'dear,' and 'honey,' " said Mr. Sollosy, who is 64. "Somebody else might do the same thing and it would be construed altogether differently."
 
Restroom Graffiti
 Rhode Island has its own stories dealing with sexual harassment, a few of them unusual. One court case concerns the complaint of a warehouse worker who was dismissed after a female co-worker accused him of displaying his buttocks.
At Brown University, a 15-minute walk up College Hill from downtown, some female students last year covered their restroom walls with names of male students they deemed guilty of date rape. The women said they acted out of dissatisfaction with the university's response to their complaints; they stopped when the administration called a campus forum on sexual assault and harassment and strengthened its policies protecting women.
Gene Booth, executive director of the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, said he has been handling an increasing number of sexual harassment complaints since 1989, when the commission started keeping track of them, and that all sex discrimination cases, including harassment, now outnumbered complaints of race discrimination before the commission. He said the Thomashearings inspired an increase in inquiries not just from potential complainants, but also from men who feared they may have done something wrong and sought advice.
In dealing with female co-workers, men seem most concerned about the protocols of dating. A minority simply abstain, in part, they say, because of fear that a woman could sabotage a boyfriend's job if things don't work out. "I try to direct that energy someplace else," said Wayne Miranda, 29, a data entry clerk at Fleet National Bank. "I meet people at the laundromat and the supermarket, standing in the check-out line."
Inevitably, though, some people do mix work and courtship. When they do, the men said, they are treading more cautiously than ever.
"You try to find out her name first and a little background," said Gilbert Hackney, 33, a stockroom worker at a Macy's clearance store. "Don't rush into it. Ask her out for lunch. If she says yes, you take her out. You go back to your job for a good week or two. Give her a little time. Then ask if she would like to go out for dinner."
Wayne Gomes, 18, who works at Applebee's Neighborhood Bar and Grill with a score of other young waiters and kitchen hands, said: "It's simple. You ask, 'Do you want to go out on a date with me?' If she says no, leave your number. If she's interested, she'll call."
The old convention of asking for the woman's number could be imprudent today. "You call her," Mr. Gomes said, "and you could be harassing her on the telephone."
Some others say they limit their overtures to a single rejection, but not because of sensitivity to harassment. "It's my male ego," said Bruce DiTraglia, 40, a clerk-dispatcher who is president of a state employee union.
By contrast, Allister Greenidge, 26, the single father of two children and a worker at a telemarketing company, said persistence could pay, within limits. "A man knows when a woman's not interested," Mr. Greenidge said. "But if I see someone who might come around, I'm not afraid of her saying no. I'll work through her friend, who will tell her I'm not that bad of a guy."
 
Looking Versus Leering
 Under the new rules, men are also trying to differentiate between looking at women and leering at them. John C. Drew, 52, an insurance agent, grabs the binoculars by his desk. He lets the focus fix on women from the Rhode Island School of Design passing his office building and erupts in a hoot inaudible to the women. But he said he was appalled when construction workers jeered and whistled within sight and earshot of women passing by. "Cro-Magnons," Mr. Drew said.
Matthew Simeone, 22, a recent graduate of the University of Rhode Island and an aide at a state sewage-control commission, said: "It's acceptable to look a woman in her eyes. But looking up and down her body, that's harassment."
The rules are changing, too, in how men react to women dressed in revealing attire. "Stay away from them," advised Mr. Miranda, the data entry clerk.
In the climate of today's workplace, men here say they are reluctant to comment on the apparel for fear of provoking a complaint. "It would be harassment to say, 'That sweater looks good on you,"' Mr. Simeone said. "But I could say, 'You look nice today.' "
Mr. Gomes said he would not even say that now. "Before I would have complimented her on how nice she looked," he said. "Now I don't think I'd comment at all."
 
Terms of Address
 The men here say they are also rethinking how they address women. "A word like 'hon' becomes a friendly nickname," Mr. Miranda said. "But that can be offensive, and I stopped using it a couple of weeks ago. I'm not sure I'd like to be called that at the workplace either."
To get around salutations like "gals" and "girls," men say they try harder to learn a woman's name and use that. "For women, there's no parallel term for 'guys,' said Stephen Cohen, 23, a 1990 graduate of Wesleyan University who works at the Macy's clearance store while he looks for a more promising job. He uses names or "women."
At the law firm of Hinckley, Allen, Snyder & Comen, the use of "Mr." for the lawyers and "Miss" for secretaries disappeared as the firm started hiring female attorneys, said John Pendergast, head of the firm's labor relations team. Now most people there use first names. In today's less formal offices, honorifics seem stilted.
Some men say women hold them to a double standard. "Liberation, equal rights, that's all well and good," said Robert Hunt, 61, a newly wed construction plan review officer in the state government. "They should have that, totally," he said. "But a lot I run into say they like a guy to open the door for them, to do the gentlemanly things. That's kind of a contradiction."
In view of the contradictions, some men say a woman should let her own limits be known, rather than leave men guessing. "Let women draw the line," said Ronald Freemen, 43, a laid-off construction worker. Mr. DiTraglia, the union president, said: "Women call me 'honey' all the time, and if I call somebody 'honey,' I'm not trying to score. If a woman doesn't like it, she should turn around and say, 'Call me so-and-so.' "
Because of the scrutiny the Brown community has given harassment since the graffiti episode, men there are probably more alert than most to such things. The prevailing wisdom there, said Warren Brown, a junior, was that in addressing a group people should use language the group finds most acceptable.
Chad Nelsen, a senior, noted that being sensitized to women's concerns could serve Brown men well as they enter the workplace. "A new dynamic of our generation is we're going to work for women," Mr. Nelsen said. "You're not going to want to upset the boss."

HEADLINE: Aiding Amazon Forest Gains Support in West

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Western countries, including the United States, are becoming more favorable to the idea of a major international program to protect Amazon forests and jungles, diplomats in Bonn and Washington say.
For the last several years, the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has been the only leader of a wealthy industrial country who has pressed the cause of rain forest preservation at international summits. As recently as last July, he sought action at the London summit of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, but without notable success. 
 There are signs, however, that the United States may soon join the effort. Last month, the State Department sent a cable to Bonn and other capitals signalling new American interest in an ambitious Amazon project supported by Germany that could cost donor countries $1.6 billion over five years.
The project would create large Amazon reserves in which business would be restricted or banned. The $1.6 billion would be used not only to buy land and protect it, but also to find new, environmentally sound work for ranchers, farmers, prospectors, loggers and others who exploit the Amazon.
"To our great surprise, we received this memo from the Americans suggesting that they may be interested in taking part in this," said an aide to Chancellor Kohl. "Up to now, they have been very reluctant."
An official in Washington familiar with the memorandum said copies were sent to the governments of major industrialized countries.
"The United States is saying that we are going to participate in this project in some way," said the official. "We need a lot of information, because the United States is very conservative when it invests this kind of money abroad.
"There is a constituency pushing us to be more active, but we are not yet prepared to commit ourselves to one-seventh of $1.6 billion. That's a huge amount of money. What we are doing now is asking questions to people in Brazil, in Germany and in other places."
 
World Bank 'Pledge Session'
 Officials in Bonn and Washington said a World Bank meeting scheduled for December could become a "pledge session" for countries interested in protecting the Amazon. They said that outlines of a new American policy, as well as new views from Britain and others, may emerge there.
Scientists say the Amazon and other large tropical forests play an important role in keeping the world climate stable. Many believe that destruction of forests has contributed to global warming, a trend that threatens to flood low-lying regions of the world.
Environmental consciousness has grown sharply in Germany since the 1970's, when the Green Party became a force in national politics.
Some of Chancellor Kohl's critics in Bonn are skeptical of the depth of his environmental commitment.
"The trip to Brazil had a lot to do with publicity," said Liesel Hartenstein, an opposition member of Parliament. "He is giving aid to Brazil without requiring that it be administered in cooperation with native peoples, and without asking for land reform in Brazil or an end to tax subsidies for development in the forest. And he is not confronting what German companies are doing to encourage deforestation of the Amazon."

HEADLINE: Albany Deeply Divided Over Budget Gap Plans

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 6

 BODY:
As Gov. Mario M. Cuomo tonight began considering his Budget Director's plan to close the state's nettlesome budget gap, key legislators were deeply divided over their own approaches to the problem.
The lawmakers and their aides said that the Republican-controlled Senate favors closing the budget gap primarily through steep cuts in Medicaid and other social services. Members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly have begun to push a plan to restructure the state's finances over the next 18 months -- an approach that could mean both more long-term change and more gradual cuts. 
 The Governor has said that he hopes to avoid tax increases, but little else about his own approach to closing the $689 million gap in the current $30 billion general fund budget. Mr. Cuomo received a proposal from his budget staff tonight that charted a course for closing the gap. He is expected to adopt a strategy for attacking the problem by the end of the week.
 
The Presidential Question
 Mr. Cuomo has said that New York's recurring fiscal problems, and his obligation to address them, pose a major impediment to his running for President in 1992. His aides have speculated that the Governor would feel far more comfortable making the race if he could forge a quick legislative consensus around a plan to close the budget gap.
In addition to closing the gap for this fiscal year, which ends on March 31, Mr. Cuomo also wants to get a clearer reading of the expected gap in next year's budget, his aides said. If Mr. Cuomo is going to be on the campaign trail, the aides believe, he would want to use this year's deficit reduction plan to get a head start on attacking next year's problem.
Next year's budget gap is already projected at more than $2 billion by Mr. Cuomo's budget division. That number could grow quickly if the recession continues to choke the flow of tax revenues while causing rapid growth in expenditures on Medicaid and other social services.
In the absence of tax rises, it is likely that the Governor's plan will include deep cuts in the budgets of state agencies that have already been cut severely in the last 11 months. Cuomo aides said the proposal submitted by Budget Director Patrick J. Bulgaro also may include a small cut in aid to schools and cuts in social services programs.
Even before receiving a proposal from Mr. Cuomo, key legislators and their aides were skeptical today that a consensus could be forged quickly around such a plan. And the Governor conceded on a statewide television call-in show tonight that closing the budget gap "will require a lot of fighting with the Legislature."
The Assembly Democrats have suggested solving the problems of this fiscal year by restructuring the state's entire budget-making process. Under the complex plan envisioned by Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, the start of the fiscal year would be moved to July 1, and the legislature would pass a new budget in the coming months that would control state spend9ing until June 30, 1993.
By stretching out the budget, Mr. Miller's plan theoretically would soften the impact of cuts that otherwise would be needed to avoid a deficit in the current budget.
The Senate Republicans meanwhile have called for closing most of the gap with cuts in Medicaid and other expenditures on social services. "I'd like to see about $500 million of the $700 million gap closed through cuts in social services," said Senator John B. Daly, Republican of Lewiston.
Mr. Cuomo has called for containing Medicaid costs, and Mr. Miller has said there should be "no sacred cows." But Assembly leaders and aides to Mr. Cuomo believe Mr. Daly's proposal is unrealistic.
"There isn't that kind of money available in social services," said Assemblyman Saul Weprin, Democrat of Queens, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
The chasm between Mr. Daly and Mr. Weprin illustrates the difficulty of the task facing the Governor. But Mr. Weprin acknowledged that Mr. Cuomo may have added incentive this year to forge an agreement, raising the possibility that some unusual deals may be cut.
"I think he's got a great incentive to do that," Mr. Weprin said. "If he decides to run for President, he'll be able to devote his time to it."

HEADLINE: YUGOSLAV FIGHTING BREAKS CEASE-FIRE

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Croatian and Serbian forces engaged in artillery duels across the breakaway republic of Croatia today, shattering the 12th and latest European-brokered cease-fire accord less than 24 hours after it was reached.
For the second consecutive day, shells, apparently from Croatian artillery, fell on Serbian territory, hitting the town of Apatin and a village near the town of Sid. Serbian officials also asserted that Croatian forces shelled areas in the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which the pro-Serbian Yugoslav Army is using for its thrust into Croatia's eastern panhandle. 
 Artillery batteries and a naval gunboat of the pro-Serbian army blasted a major Croatian defense position and other targets around the historic town of Dubrovnik for about four hours today in what Croatian authorities called the worst bombardment in the Serbs' five-week-long siege of the town.
 
Croatian Asks for 6th Fleet
 In Zagreb today, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia called for the United States to send its Sixth Fleet into the Adriatic Sea to help stop the fighting.
"Ideally some ships from the Sixth Fleet should be sent into the Adriatic and air traffic should be blockaded just as it was in the Persian Gulf war," Mr. Tudjman said in the Croatian capital.
"These planes are striking civilian targets," Mr. Tudjman said, referring to the Yugoslav air attacks in Croatia.
European Community ministers have threatened Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, with economic and political sanctions if it does not agree to accept a peace plan by Friday. Serbia says that it will not be bullied into accepting the breakup of the country.
All five of Yugoslavia's other republics have accepted the proposal, which calls for a loose confederation of sovereign states within their present borders. Serbs oppose such a formula, saying it would create international frontiers between Serbia and many Serbs living in the other republics.
At least 2,000 people have been killed and 350,000 people have fled their homes since fighting began in Yugoslavia soon after Croatia declared itself independent on June 25.
Yugoslav warplanes rocketed the town of Daruvar today, and heavy clashes were reported in Karlovac, Pakrac and Nova Gradiska in Croatia.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Tax-Freeze Plan Needs M.A.C. Nod

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's plan to freeze property taxes for two years depends on $1 billion that has not been raised yet and might not be unless the state Municipal Assistance Corporation loosens its purse strings.
To raise the funds, the corporation would put off repaying bonds that mature over the next four years. It would refinance the bonds, extending payments through the year 2008, much like a homeowner taking out a second mortgage and getting an immediate cash windfall. 
 But Mr. Rohatyn, who is a close adviser to Governor Mario M. Cuomo, has repeatedly said he would not refinance the bonds unless the Dinkins administration satisfied him that the money would not be used merely to fill an existing gap, like paying for a wage settlement.
 
'It's a Gap Filler'
 He has insisted on a fundamental overhaul of the government that would hold down taxes and cut costs for years to come. He has hinted he would support using the M.A.C. money for priorities he holds dear -- schools and rebuilding the city's infrastructure.
But yesterday Mayor Dinkins included the $1 billion in his financial plan as "transitional funding" that would help the government avoid $500 million in property tax increases in each of the next two years, a proposal that has drawn fire from business leaders and the City Council. The Mayor's plan calls for the property tax increases to kick in again after the M.A.C. money runs out in 1995 and 1996, to the tune of about $330 million each year.
"It's a gap filler," the Mayor said of the M.A.C. money. "We can't dedicate it."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Rohatyn was cool to the idea. "If you want to take the simplest approach to this, it is borrowing money to finance a two-year tax cut," he said. "In effect, the M.A.C. money bridges over into the new taxes. Is this an appropriate use of M.A.C. funds which we have consistently indicated we felt should be an investment in the restructuring of the city and not a gap-closer?"
The $1 billion, if it is provided, would not come without a cost. While stretching out bond payments would provide the city with $1 billion in the short run, it would eventually cost taxpayers an extra $500 million in interest payments.
Several fiscal watchdogs -- including bond rating agencies and the city and state comptrollers -- yesterday questioned the wisdom of using the M.A.C. money solely to delay tax increases without assurances the sprawling government will be pared down in the long run.
"It's stetching debt so that current New Yorkers don't have to pay it but future New Yorkers do," said Ray Horton, president of the Citizen's Budget Commission.

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION: The Restive Voters;
Mixed Results at Polls Show Both Parties That Status Quo Won't Satisfy the Nation

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
The White House hit the panic button. The Democrats rejoiced in some states and mourned in others, and around the country the voters served notice that they are in a sour mood and that incumbents should ignore them only at their peril.
Both parties tried today to put the best face on a mixed outcome, but there were omens and alarms aplenty as the nation heads into the 1992 Presidential campaign, with the economy ailing and public attitudes bubbling on health care, race relations and taxes. 
 President Bush, who only months ago seemed headed for a stately stroll toward re-election, discovered this week that there are minefields strewn across the political landscape. The stunning Democratic victory in the Pennsylvania Senate race, and the White House's fumbling reaction to it -- canceling a trip abroad on Election Day but denying it was connected to the results -- sent a clear signal to the Republicans that their political operation needs work and their message retooling.
 
Rejecting Status Quo
 Still, this election was hardly a roaring repudiation of the party in the White House; Republicans scored sweeping gains in the New Jersey and Virginia Legislatures and defeated Ray Mabus in the Mississippi governor's race. Many analysts said the nation's electorate simply wanted something other than the status quo.
"The only good thing that happened for incumbents is the defeat of the term limit referendum in Washington," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. [Articles on the term-limit and assisted dying referendums in Washington State appear on page B16.]
Linda DiVall, his Republican counterpart, said: "Anyone who defends the status quo or gives the appearance of not paying attention to the voters is going to suffer the consequences. And whether you're talking about Mabus or Thornburgh or the New Jersey legislators, it's not enough to say here's what I did for you eight years ago or four years ago or two years ago."
 
Trial Run for Democrats
 The Pennyslvania Senate race dominated the day, much to the Republicans' chagrin, and offered some intriguing hints of the Presidential campaign to come. Harris Wofford, a Democrat appointed last summer to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Senator John Heinz, delivered a thumping defeat to former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. Fresh from the Bush Cabinet, Mr. Thornburgh was informally advised by Bob Teeter, the President's poll taker and principal strategist.
Mr. Wofford talked about national health care, about the ailing economy and the need to shake up the status quo in Washington -- the very themes that many Democrats hope to use against Mr. Bush next year. Mr. Wofford ran as very much the outsider, the agent of change, and that made all the difference, analysts in both parties said.
Democrats were ecstatic, contending that Pennsylvania was a laboratory for a new message of "middle-class populism" that can carry the beleaguered party back to power, a message already being sounded by Presidential contenders like Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Mr. Teeter, while cautioning that no "broad conclusions should be drawn from off-year elections," agreed that the election showed the power of the economy and health care issues.
Mr. Wofford and other Democrats argued that the country has reached a critical mass politically on health care, comparable to the moment when it lurched forward on Social Security. But some analysts cautioned that the broad consensus for the notion of universal health care breaks down quickly when it comes to the means and the costs of providing it -- issues that were not fully explored in the Pennsylvania Senate race but could loom large in a Presidential election.
Pennsylvania could have another effect on next year's campaign: Some Democrats say it could be one more prod to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York to enter the race, one more tantalizing hint of Republican vulnerability.
 
A Chastened Bush
 The significance of Pennsylvania was only underscored by the White House's reaction to it. Even as the returns came piling in, the White House announced that Mr. Bush was canceling a scheduled trip to the Far East later this month. Democrats, who have been campaigning gleefully against Mr. Bush's travel schedule, trying to make it a symbol of his neglect of the domestic agenda, could barely contain themselves. They have been handing out T-shirts all week declaring, "George Bush went to Rome and all I got was this lousy recession."
Some Republicans were dismayed at the way the White House reacted Tuesday, which seemed to feed the perception that Mr. Bush was flummoxed by the recent turn of domestic politics, from the worsening economy to the escalating Presidential campaign. "You would have thought we had lost 26 House seats," a Republican strategist said.
Mr. Bush held a defensive news conference before departing for the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Rome, denying that his canceled trip to Asia had anything to do with the election. But he seemed chastened, saying he understood that people were worried about the economy. "As far as I'm concerned we'll go the extra mile and we'll try even harder," he said.
For Mr. Bush, the election had to point out how much his political team has weakened since the 1988 campaign, when he could rely on James A. Baker 3d, now the Secretary of State, and Lee Atwater, who died of a brain tumor earlier this year.
 
Tax at Their Own Peril
 But Republicans were taking heart from their gains elsewhere. A year ago, as states struggled with strained budgets and all the hard decisions that requires, voters punished many of their governors at the polls; this year, they seemed to be continuing the trend, turning out Mr. Mabus, a Democrat, in Mississippi, and ventilating their discontent with state government in Virginia and New Jersey, where Republicans scored big legislative gains.
As Mr. Bush put it, "Our man in Mississippi won big, New Jersey won tremendous, blew them away in Virginia." Democratic professionals were closely watching the New Jersey results as a sign of the anti-tax sentiment generated by Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat. Frank Greer, a media consultant to Mr. Clinton, asserted, "The old style liberalism, which is to raise taxes and give money only to the poor, doesn't work."
In Mississippi, however, some Democrats, including Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, asserted that the Republicans prospered in part by using racially based appeals, like opposition to quotas. Clayton K. Yeutter, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, countered that the Democrats persistently cry race when they lose elections. But the Republicans, who today escalated their criticism of David Duke, the former Klansman running for governor in Louisiana, are clearly uncomfortable with the charge.
The anti-incumbent mood had its limits, of course: Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, seemed delighted to have beaten back a term limitation measure in his home state of Washington that would have cost him his job. But some analysts noted that the Washington measure was unusually strong, applying retroactively to those presently in office; they also noted that it would not have been a small thing for a state to force a Speaker of the House out of office.
But generally, the voters seemed to be in a demanding mood, and that signals that next year's Presidential campaign will be very different from that in 1984, when Ronald Reagan glided triumphantly to re-election. The economy could sharply change in the months ahead, and Mr. Bush retains enormous advantages, by virtue of the Presidency and his personal popularity.
Still, as Ms. DiVall said: "It's not morning again in America. You can't be a defender of the status quo." As the White House regroups for the 1992 campaign, this is one of the strongest signals.

HEADLINE: THE 1991 ELECTION: Election Roundup;
Wave of Voter Discontent Sweeps Many From Office

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Tuesday's elections across the country were a sharp expression of voter anger, with mixed results for Democrats and Republicans.
The Democratic Governor of Mississippi, Ray Mabus, lost to a conservative Republican businessman, and in the day's most celebrated contest, Pennsylvania's Senate race, Harris Wofford scored a major triumph for the Democrats by defeating Dick Thornburgh, the former Attorney General. On a local level, new people will be moving into mayor's offices in several cities. 
 "It was clearly us versus them, and them lost," said William Schneider, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "Underlying it all was a kind of populist discontent that took different forms in different states because they have different underlying political cultures."
In Pennsylvania, for example, Mr. Wofford's winning campaign revolved around his call for national health insurance and emergency extension of unemployment benefits.
But in Mississippi, Kirk Fordice's winning campaign -- like the platform of David Duke, who faces Edwin W. Edwards in Louisiana's gubernatorial election next week -- stressed opposition to racial quotas and criticized welfare recipients. It marked the first time since Reconstruction that a Republican won the governor's office in Mississippi.
In the view of Mr. Schneider, "it was left-wing economic populism that won in Pennslyvania," while it was "right-wing social populism" that helped Mr. Fordice.
 
Voter Anger
 In Kentucky, voter discontent may have helped Lieut. Gov. Brereton C. Jones easily defeat a seven-term Republican Congressman, Larry J. Hopkins, for the governorship. Mr. Hopkins, who received campaign help from President Bush, was hurt when it was recently revealed that he was among the lawmakers who had insufficient funds when they wrote checks on the House of Representatives bank.
Voter anger also surfaced in New Jersey, where residents furious over Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8-billion program of tax increases gave Republicans control of both houses of the State Legislature for the first time in 20 years.
Several Mayors were also victims of the mood of disenchantment. The incumbent in Houston, Kathryn J. Whitmire, finished last in a three-way race. With voters in a near frenzy over Houston's growing crime problem and jail overcrowding, her record 10-year term was ended by a developer, Bob Lanier, and State Representative Sylvester Turner.
Mr. Lanier will face Mr. Turner, who is seeking to be the first black elected Mayor of Houston, in a runoff on Dec. 3.
 
Surprise in San Francisco
 In San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos came in a surprise second to his former chief of police, Frank Jordan, in a five-way race. Because neither won a majority, the two men will face each other in a runoff on Dec. 10.
The strength of the vote for Mr. Jordan, who garnered 31.8 percent to 27.5 percent for Mr. Agnos, was seen as an expression of voters' displeasure with what they view as a deterioration of the city and its services. Mr. Jordan ran on a tough conservative platform that criticized Mr. Agnos for failing to solve the problems of homelessness and panhandling in San Francisco.
By contrast, in two cities where the incumbents faced little serious opposition, voters re-elected their mayors, Raymond L. Flynn in Boston and Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore.
Mr. Flynn, a Democrat whose politics blend old-fashioned liberal economics with social conservatism, won 75 percent of the vote, the biggest margin ever by a Mayor of Boston. In an interview today, Mr. Flynn said that his victory, combined with the results in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, "make this election a real wake-up call both for the Congress and the President."
Mr. Schmoke in Baltimore won a second term with 72 percent of the vote after largely ignoring his Republican adversary, Samuel Culotta, a lawyer, whom he had defeated before.
But Mr. Flynn and Mr. Schmoke were exceptions in Tuesday's results, and Mr. Flynn seemed in many ways to fit the profile of what voters may be looking for, said Ralph Whitehead, a professor of journalism at the Unversity of Massachusetts. Mr. Flynn embodies the mix of "economic populism and social conservatism that is selling this year," Mr. Whitehead said.
 
Split Results
 In the two United States House races decided on Tuesday, the Democrats and Republicans split the results. In Philadelphia, Lucien Blackwell, a Democrat and former city councilman, won the seat vacated by William H. Gray 3rd, a Democrat.
In Charlottesville, Va., George F. Allen, a Republican state lawmaker and the son of the former Washington Redskins football coach, beat Katherine E. (Kay) Slaughter, a Democrat, for the seat being vacated by her cousin, D. French Slaughter Jr., a Republican.
Some significant referendum issues were also decided Tuesday. Voters in the District of Columbia approved a measure aimed at holding the makers and sellers of some assault weapons liable for the injuries and damaged those weapons cause.
In Maine, voters approved a measure that will stop the planned expansion of the southern part of the Maine Turnpike and will require the state to come up with alternatives to car and truck transportation. The measure had been opposed by Maine's Governor and most of the state's leading businesses.
Voters in St. Paul and San Francisco rejected efforts to repeal ordinances protecting the rights of homosexuals.

HEADLINE: Florio Still Firm on Some Issues, But Vows to Work With G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Giving a hint of what the next two years will be like in New Jersey government, Gov. Jim Florio pledged today to cooperate with the new Republican-controlled Legislature but said there were some issues on which he would be unyielding.
A day after Democrats suffered a devastating defeat at the polls, Mr. Florio met with reporters for an hourlong news conference during which he bristled, joked and jousted with reporters over questions about how much his economic policies and his own unpopularity contributed to the outcome. 
 "The answer is I don't know," said the Governor. "I know that there is a constituency out there that used the election as a way of saying they wanted a leadership referendum. I'm not sure that I believe that everyone who voted Republican wants everything that was done to be undone."
 
Angry Voters
 Exploiting voter anger over a $2.8 billion tax package that Mr. Florio pushed through a Legislature dominated by Democrats 16 months ago, Republicans gained a 58-to-22 majority in the General Assembly and a 27-to-13 lead in the Senate on Tuesday.
The outcome made Mr. Florio the first New Jersey governor since Richard J. Hughes, another Democrat, in 1968 to face a veto-proof opposition in both legislative houses.
Mr. Florio spent the entire day at Drumthwacket, the whitewashed Colonial mansion that serves as his official residence, where he said he took a string of telephone calls from people offering him advice, including Mr. Hughes.
"Governor Hughes called and one of the things he said was be as accommodating as you possibly can, but never walk away from your principles," Mr. Florio said.
 
No Direct Answer
 Mr. Florio invited journalists to the mansion for a midafternoon news conference, where he was inundated with questions about how much his own political problems influenced Tuesday's election. He avoided giving a direct answer, saying that it might have "motivated" some voters to vote against Democrats.
"I heard some important messages in yesterday's results," he said. "There is a sense of fear and anxiety about the future. And there is anger and pain about the present.
"Something else I hear from this election is that there is a great deal of antagonism on the part of people toward the entire political system."
The closest Mr. Florio would come to the contriteness that some of his questioners tried to draw from him was an admission that "one could always do better."
Mr. Florio said that he intended to meet as soon as possible with the new Republican legislative leadership and that he felt he shared similar goals with them.
"The people have chosen divided power," he said. "But they don't want paralyzed government. Now is the time to put politics aside and govern well. I'm prepared to do that and I'm pledged to do that."
But the Governor said he would not compromise on his support for abortion rights, his opposition to assault-style weapons and any effort to raise property taxes.
He said he would be flexible on other taxes, like an unpopular increase that raised sales taxes to 7 percent last year, from 6 percent.

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YONKERS, Nov. 6

 BODY:
This troubled city made a decisive break with the defiance and dissension of recent years by electing a new Democratic mayor, Terence M. Zaleski, a state Assemblyman who wants Yonkers to obey a Federal housing desegregation order.
Mr. Zaleski, 38 years old, will be the first beneficiary of a new form of government, giving him executive powers previously vested in a city manager and a longer term of office. 
 "It could be a whole new era of leadership for Yonkers," Gail S. Shaffer, New York's Secretary of State, said in an interview today.
 
'Breath of Fresh Air'
 "Terry is a breath of fresh air," added Ms. Shaffer, who also heads a state control board overseeing Yonkers's finances. "His election shows a maturation among the voters that they want to face reality and get on with the important challenges facing the city."
The victory of Mr. Zaleski, the son of a factory worker and a onetime science teacher and lawyer, came as something of a surprise to this sprawling town of 188,000 in southern Westchester County, New York State's fourth biggest city.
Many thought that a former Mayor, Angelo R. Martinelli, would make a political comeback on the strength of his name recognition, union backing and charisma. Mr. Martinelli, a Republican, ran on the Independent line, preaching compliance with the housing order.
Others here bet that the moderate positions of Mr. Zaleski and Mr. Martinelli on the housing question would divide voters, giving the lead to Peter A. Chema, a Republican City Councilman and a strong foe of the subsidized housing. But instead, Republican voters seemed to split between Mr. Martinelli and Mr. Chema.
Another factor was Mr. Zaleski's campaign performance. The three-term Assemblyman asserted himself in the primary by purging the entrenched leadership of the city's Democratic Party, which he labeled a "meddlesome political machine."
 
Call for Professionalism
 Mr. Zaleski hammered away at a single theme throughout his campaign: professionalism in a city government beset by economic woes and a growing crime rate.
Implicit in that campaign theme was a commitment to comply with a Federal judge's order to build subsidized housing in white neighborhoods. That order followed a 1986 ruling by Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan that Yonkers was guilty of four decades of segregation in housing and education.
The court-ordered housing remedy, calling for 200 units of public housing on the mostly white east side and another 800 middle-income apartments, angered many residents. In the summer of 1988, as city officials defied Judge Sand and incurred huge fines for contempt of court, Yonkers was pushed to the edge of bankruptcy.
Since then, as the housing program inched forward, the city has filed lawsuit after lawsuit challenging the desegregation order.
Though Mr. Zaleski said he always opposed the housing order, he felt it should be obeyed after it was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. Perhaps most important in this election was the simple fact that the public housing -- the most dreaded part of the desegregation order -- is now mostly built.
"The bitter end is already here," Mr. Zaleski said before the election. "The experience over the last few years has shown the futility of banging our heads against the wall. People are tired of the issue and want it resolved."
 
An Unresolved Issue
 Still to be resolved is the affordable-housing component of the order. Judge Sand has agreed to consider alternatives to the 800 units since few developers have expressed interest in the undertaking. Mr. Zaleski has said he wants to bring all parties together to devise a mutually acceptable plan. In addition, he said, he will try to make the "low-income units succeed so they don't create enclaves."
For the last two years, Henry J. Spallone, who was more defiant of the housing order than any elected official here, occupied the Mayor's office. He failed to stop the public housing, and largely because of that failure, lost his bid for the nomination in the Republican primary.
Mr. Spallone's singular focus on fighting the desegregation order practically paralyzed Yonkers when it came to other issues such as the struggling public school system, stagnant economic development, rising crime and troubled city finances.
At a news conference today, Mr. Zaleski vowed to tackle those issues immediately. He said he had already been in touch with Ms. Shaffer to discuss a $110 million revenue shortfall in the four-year financial plan submitted by the previous administration to the state Emergency Financial Control Board.

HEADLINE: Empty Offices Offer Guide To the Region

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
There are enough empty offices across the New York metropolitan area to fill 15 World Trade Centers, according to some experts. Planners, real-estate executives and local officials say the shape and health of the region are likely to be defined largely by the way those offices fill up -- or fail to fill up -- when and if an economic recovery begins.
Company choices about whether to locate in New York City, in the downtowns of cities like Stamford or White Plains or in the suburban office parks that sprouted across the region in the 1980's are likely to influence not only the vitality of Manhattan but also the quality of life throughout the metropolitan area. 
 "The future of the region for the next decade will be determined to a significant extent by which office space rents first," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association.
The association, the dominant private planning group in the New York area and for decades the source of influential planning concepts, estimates that there are 60 million square feet of vacant office space in Manhattan, 50 million square feet in northern New Jersey and 15 million square feet in southwest Connecticut. Which of those vacancies might rent first in a recovery is especially difficult to predict because of the combination of a slow economy now and an office inventory that many experts say could take 10 years to fill.
 
The Goal: Simply Renting
 That office glut interrupted trends of the 1980's that included both a dispersal of office rentals throughout the region and a healthy office market in Manhattan. The stimulus for new office rentals would come from the types of businesses that would revive first and fastest; no one knows which businesses those are.
For local planners, any effort to channel office growth has become a luxury. In Westchester, for example, planners have long sought to encourage office rentals in White Plains' rehabilitated downtown, which competes with office parks along nearby Route 287. But Patricia Lynn Oliva, Westchester County's Acting Commissioner of Planning, said that because of the economy, officials are eager to bring business anywhere into the county.
Because so much is affected by where people work and how they commute, some experts say, housing, transportation, the environment and a host of other regional concerns are at stake. "The recovery will tell you where you are going in the region," said David Shulman, who analyzes the real-estate market for Salomon Brothers.
Office rental patterns could multiply some of the region's current problems -- traffic jams, for example, or air pollution -- by increasing the number of people who drive to work.
And some experts say office-leasing patterns could accelerate changes in the quasi-urban centers developing in the suburbs and stretch the borders of the metropolitan area, sending people farther afield for affordable housing. That could speed the evolution of what will probably amount to a single densely populated metropolis ranging from eastern Pennsylvania across New Jersey and much of eastern New York State into Connecticut.
The decisions made in the early stages of recovery promise to have such an impact on the region because the office vacancy rate rose to nearly 20 percent in much of the area after the office building frenzy of the 1980's collided with the recession. In all, nearly 150 million square feet of office space may be vacant across the metropolitan area, according to the Regional Plan Association.
More than a third of that, or 60 million square feet, is outside the area's old downtowns. Much of it is along overburdened thoroughfares like the Long Island Expressway, Route 1 in New Jersey and Route 287 in Westchester. In some cases, the vacant buildings are isolated in the middle of what were once cornfields.
Some planners are sounding a traditional alert, warning that it is crucial to foster centralization by keeping offices in the region's old downtown business districts instead of scattering them among comparatively remote office campuses and roadside sites. Concentration, they say, is the only way to revitalize urban centers and insure the efficiency of public transportation and such services as sewer, water and electric lines.
 
Revitalizing Urban Centers
 "If the dispersed office locations are filled initially, it will create more traffic congestion in an already overburdened system and lead to environmental and social consequences that the region is not prepared to deal with," said Mr. Anderson of the Regional Plan Association.
Some of those studying office vacancies as a key to the future say the planners have already lost their war to keep the region's business life centered in its old downtowns. Others note that New York City received more than a quarter of the jobs created in the region during the 1980's, though it had received only about a tenth of those created during the 1950's and 1960's.
No one now knows whether that pattern would continue in a recovery, filling offices faster in Manhattan, or whether the growth would take place in the region's other downtowns, in suburban office parks or in former cornfields. As the economy slowed, rental prices fell across the region and vacancy rates climbed, setting the stage for fierce competition as owners compete for tenants.
Asking prices for office rentals on Park Avenue in Manhattan, for example, fell to $44 a square foot in June 1991, from $52 a square foot in June 1990, according to the Edward S. Gordon Company, a corporate real-estate consultant.
 
How to Structure the Sprawl
 In the Morristown area of New Jersey, the suburban area that is home to more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies, 22.66 percent of about 3.31 million square feet of high-quality offices are "available," according to the Gordon Company. In the area of the New Jersey Meadowlands, 35.14 percent of about 5.48 million square feet is available, and in the Newark area the availability rate is 15.96 percent of about 2 million square feet of high-quality space.
Even many of those who say they believe the area's old downtowns will hold their own in a recovery say that a crucial issue is how to structure the office sprawl that now has many more people commuting between suburbs than from the suburbs into New York City.
After World War II, about half of Long Island's wage earners commuted to Manhattan, according to the Long Island Regional Planning Board. Now, the board says, 86 percent of them work on Long Island.
 
'Put the Genie Back?'
 Whatever the planners' hopes, some experts say, market forces created the office vacancies and market forces will dictate where and when offices fill up. That, some of them say, means that in the vast swath across New Jersey, New York City's northern suburbs and southern Connecticut, a new growth spurt propelled by the leasing of empty offices is inevitable. Even if downtown offices rent proportionately as well as those in outlying areas, some experts say, there are now so many offices dispersed across the region that a recovery will spur the region's sprawl.
Christopher J. Dunleavy, the executive director of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce in New York, said that trend had been established over generations. Now, he said, the issue is, "Do we try to put the genie back in the bottle or do we try to manage the problem?"
Some experts said that the broad outlines of the region's future were already clear and that new office rentals would simply continue to increase density across the region. In "Edge City," a new book that has become influential in planning circles, Joel Garreau, a Washington Post reporter, argues that new quasi-urban centers are forming on the edges of New York and other old big cities across the country. These edge cities, Mr. Garreau says, offer much of what people wanted in old downtowns, including jobs, transplanted to what was once known as suburbia.
The first criterion that Mr. Garreau uses in determining whether a new center is becoming an edge city is whether it has at least 5 million square feet of leasable office space, about half as much as the World Trade Center. In the New York region, he has identified 17 such places, from the Princeton corridor along Route 1 in New Jersey to the Westport area along Interstate 95 in Connecticut.
Planners in some of the edge cities say they are acutely aware that new office rentals will bring a host of new problems.
 
New Rentals, New Problems
 Marvin R. Reed, the Mayor of Princeton Borough in New Jersey, said he feared a vast expansion of the gridlock that now seizes Route 1 during rush hours. New office rentals along the highway, he said, would mean that "the time within which Princeton people would not be able to, in effect, get out of their town would dramatically expand."
"It is not in our interest to foster this in and around us," Mr. Reed said. "It would be much better if it was focused down toward New Brunswick and Trenton."
Some planners say they fear that filling empty offices will be destructive to communities. Traditionally, they say, suburban centers have encouraged office construction as a clean form of industry that draws new residents and spurs housing construction. But many communities have found that such housing is affordable only to top executives. Potential employees from central cities find the new jobs inaccessible, and the largest number of employees, those at the middle and lower levels, must travel long distances to find affordable homes.
In Morris County, N.J., for example, a revival of the office market is likely to drive more and more employees to eastern Pennsylvania in search of housing, said Carol J. Rufener, the executive director of Morris 2000, a planning agency. That, she said, will extend the sprawl of the metropolitan area.
 
Where to Live?
 And the long commuting trips that sprawl creates are likely to leave employees feeling dissatisfied, Ms. Rufener said, because they cannot participate in community activities like baseball leagues and political parties. "When they're commuting and hour and a half each way," she said, "it's harder for them to have a sense that they're from anywhere." That sort of alienation, Ms. Rufener warned, could spur more corporations to abandon the metropolitan area entirely.
The first sign of a dramatic change in the regional office market, the experts say, will be like the starting gun in a race. Much about that race cannot be foreseen, they say. But some things are certain, some of them say, despite efforts spurred by the Regional Plan Association and others in recent months to foster regional economic cooperation. The office rental race, some of those in the field say, is likely to reignite rivalries as old as the region.
"Are we going to compete with the City of New York? Absolutely," said Lee Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
The Manhattan developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman said: "You have to worry about Princeton, White Plains. You have to worry about all the suburban locations."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Woos Rohatyn's Aid On Budget Gap

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Striving to win support for his handling of New York City's fiscal problems, Mayor David N. Dinkins pledged yesterday to shrink government and to freeze property taxes for two years by using $1 billion in aid from the Municipal Assistance Corporation to tide him over to better times.
But the chairman of the Assistance Corporation, Felix G. Rohatyn, said he was not yet persuaded that the Mayor's plans were anything more than borrowing from the future to cover current costs. And a major Wall Street credit rating agency, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that "at first glance, the proposals fall short of a structural change in city finances and operations." 
 Mr. Dinkins has been seeking the $1 billion from the Assistance Corporation for months, but yesterday was the first time he outlined how he would spend it. The announcement appeared aimed primarily at gaining the approval of Mr. Rohatyn, the Governor, state fiscal monitors and Wall Street.
Submitting a five-year fiscal blueprint to the State Financial Control Board, Mr. Dinkins said the Assistance Corporation money would give the city time to bring its spending and revenues into line without the need to increase property taxes until 1995, when he would raise them by $330 million. He would cut 16,400 full-time jobs from the quarter-million now on the city payroll through attrition.
He included no money for pay increases for municipal employees through June 1994 but said he would negotiate raises in exchange for concessions to make workers more productive -- agreements that have eluded him for months.
His plan to balance the budget also rests on highly uncertain new revenues, including gasoline taxes or auto use fees, that require approval by a State Legislature that has long resisted them. The Mayor also said he would press Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature to enact the partial takeover of the city's Medicaid costs that the Governor has proposed.
Mr. Dinkins was required to submit the plan to the State Control Board, which was set up to monitor the city's finances in the last fiscal crisis and could reimpose binding powers over its spending if the budget fell out of balance. In the coming weeks, the board, headed by Governor Cuomo, will review the plan, and Mr. Rohatyn has said he would want the board's assurances that the plan is balanced before making the Assistance Corporation money available.
Yesterday, the board's executive director, Allen J. Proctor, said he could not comment until he had reviewed the proposal in detail. If Mr. Rohatyn refused to give the $1 billion, the Control Board would undoubtedly say the Mayor's plan was unbalanced should he try to include it.
Even as he outlined his long-term plans, the Mayor said the city faced a gap of about $210 million in the current $28.5 billion budget, which runs through June 30. His aides said they would close it primarily by cutting the purchase of supplies. For next year, the city estimates, there will be a gap of $1.2 billion and annual gaps of about $2 billion in the following three years.
Mr. Dinkins said the work force reductions would mean more pain for New Yorkers used to round after round of budget cuts the last two years, but he said he could not quantify them. And his aides said it was too soon to project agency-by-agency breakdowns of where the trims would fall. Since the Mayor pledged to maintain his ambitious police hiring program, it appeared inevitable that programs from parks to libraries to health care that have aleady taken deep cuts would be hit again.
The City Council and business organizations, which have sought a tax freeze, generally praised the Mayor's plan, with the New York Chamber of Commerce calling it a "welcome outline."
 
Serious Reservations
 But if the main pitch was to Mr. Rohatyn, it fell short. He could provide the $1 billion by refinancing -- stretching out payments on some of the corporation's bonds -- freeing city sales tax revenues that would otherwise be needed to make payments on them. The Mayor would use that money in the 1993 and 1994 fiscal years -- just as he would be running in what is expected to be a tough re-election campaign -- to avoid the $500 million property tax increases that he had previously planned.
Yesterday, while approving the broad outlines of the the Mayor's plan, Mr. Rohatyn said he had serious reservations about its reliance on what would amount to money borrowed from future taxpayers to plug holes in the city's operating budget, without assurances that the city would improve efficiency.
"It certainly would appear that the city is essentially using the M.A.C. funds to close budget gaps in lieu of real-estate taxes," said Mr. Rohatyn, who has urged the city to freeze taxes. "I think that would be a real problem for us. I think it will be a problem for the rating agencies, too."
Wall Street credit rating agencies have threatened to reduce the city's bond rating, forcing it to pay millions more in interest, if it relies too much on "one shot" revenues. Yesterday, Standard & Poor's said it needed more information before judging the city's plan when the Mayor submits his preliminary budget in January for the fiscal year that starts on July 1.
Standard & Poor's repeated its warning that without other cost-saving or revenue proposals, using the M.A.C. money for a tax freeze "would be little more than deficit financing" of the sort that has been forbidden since the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's.
"They have a lot of homework between now and January," said Hyman C. Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's. "But the requirement for homework has been out there for a couple of years. I expected more progress."
Anticipating such criticism, the administration sought to accommodate others whose support will be vital to put political pressure on Mr. Rohatyn to cooperate. For example, it adopted the Council's calls to freeze taxes and dropped the idea of placing tolls on the East River bridges that are now free, and it pledged to explore a range of other pet ideas of the Council.
In return, the Mayor won a warm, and rare, tentative endorsement from the Council Speaker, Peter F.

HEADLINE: A Traveling Showroom Of Design

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
Hot dogs and ice cream -- this is the stuff usually sold from vans on the street. But next week, architects and designers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut can order wood cabinets handpainted to resemble chestnut, iridescent silks to cover sofas and rolls of wallpaper -- from a van.
The 27-foot van is painted hunter green with "David Parrett and Associates" in gold lettering. Mr. Parrett, who represents eight manufacturers of home furnishings, has modernized the idea of the traveling salesman. Outfitted with cabinets painted faux chestnut, silk curtains, a damask-covered loveseat, a television, a videocassette recorder, a phone and a refrigerator filled with cold drinks, the van is Mr. Parrett's answer to the recession: a showroom on wheels. 
Mr. Parrett used to take books of wallpaper and fabric samples and catalogues of cabinetry to clients' offices. "Business was tightening two years ago," he said, "and I wanted to make a more professional presentation in a controlled environment. If somebody pulls up to your office and you spend one hour with him instead of spending a whole day in Manhattan showrooms, you, as a designer, have made better use of your time."
Mr. Parrett ordered the van in March and it was delivered in June. He has filled it with wallpaper and fabric samples and furniture, at a total cost of $60,000.
Inside, it looks like a living room, decorated mainly in shades of cream accented with black. The wallpaper, from Osborne & Little, is printed with black laurel wreaths on a cream background. An easy chair is covered in a cotton fabric that features a black leaf on a pale gold ground.
Smallbone, an English cabinet manufacturer, built the cabinets, two painted faux chestnut and one in stippled bamboo. Smallbone's artisans will go to a client's house and paint the cabinetry to suit the owner.
"We even painted cabinets to match someone's china pattern," said Jacqueline Scott, vice president of sales and marketing of Smallbone, which has a showroom in Manhattan. She designed the interior of the van in collaboration with Linda Banks, an architect in Norwalk, Conn.
Before Mr. Parrett takes to the road, hoping eventually to reach 600 architects and designers, he will add a desk and a compact disk player.
What music will he be playing, as he drives through the three states?
"Classical," Mr. Parrett said. "I prefer Bach." For information, call (201) 635-5545.

HEADLINE: Fate Orphans The News

 BODY:
Robert Maxwell died in the Canary Islands early enough on Tuesday for his thunderstruck employees at New York's Daily News to honor his memory with exemplary coverage and comment. The timing was their only consolation.
Still recovering from a calamitous five-month strike, The News was only beginning to bounce back when it was struck twice by fate. Two weeks ago its new managing editor, John Cotter, died just before he was to begin work. And now its new British owner has perished in circumstances as improbable as his astonishing rise to riches. 
 It will take weeks for the mists to lift on the future of Mr. Maxwell's communications empire. But few doubted his commitment to The Daily News. Inevitably, there is the uncertainty of succession, compounded by billions of dollars in corporate debts.
"Ford to City: Drop Dead" snapped the celebrated News headline when Gerald Ford shrugged off New York's financial crisis in 1975. Now the paper contends with providential instead of Presidential disfavor. Yet anyone visiting The Daily News's offices yesterday encountered professional calm, not despair. "It's one more thing," remarked a composed Ellis Cose, the editorial page editor. "We'll fight the good fight."
Mr. Maxwell was, as The News said, "a titan in the old style." The offspring of Czech Jews who died at Auschwitz, he made a new life in Britain, won a Labor seat in Parliament and implausibly teased a fortune from scientific publications.
However demanding he may have been with his subordinates, and whatever the truth about controversies that engulfed him -- including the recent charge that he secretly worked with Israeli intelligence -- Mr. Maxwell's zest for life and combat was exhilarating. That spirit may be his most precious legacy to a much-beleaguered, suddenly orphaned Daily News staff.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dinkins's Vague Virtue

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins of New York yesterday offered up a new financial plan. Plan is an overstatement. The proposal makes painfully clear how much work he and his advisers have ahead.
This is a well-intentioned effort that continues to cut the work force. Recognizing the need to send a sympathetic message to recession-weary taxpayers, it calls for a two-year freeze on property taxes. But so many details are sketchy, missing or left to the future that no precise judgment is possible. Fortunately, the Mayor has time to turn this preliminary effort into a detailed blueprint by January, when his next financial plan is due. 
The most heartening aspect of the proposal is that it reveals his willingness to change his mind and hold the line on property taxes rather than plug future deficits with repeated tax increases. New Yorkers have already taken two tax jolts in two years. In place of taxes, the city plans to close deficits by restructuring and by relying on $1 billion from the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Both sources of money are questionable. Spending the M.A.C. money in two years would allow the city to avoid tax increases. But then what? Without credible commitments for new revenues and savings, spending money amounts to relying on one-shot revenues. It comes perilously close to deficit financing.
What is the restructuring that's supposed to save money? The Mayor presents a menu of options of varying plausibility. Some, like increasing the gas tax 5 to 15 cents, require action from a resistant State Legislature. Others aren't even spelled out, like "other user fees directly related to the transportation network."
The proposal fudges even more on work force reductions. It claims to cut 26,000 jobs over five years, but that includes part-time workers who are not in the official head count, and jobs not even financed by the city. The actual proposed reduction in full-time workers totals only 16,400. And all those would come from attrition, a humane but dubious technique for targeting agency cuts. Missing are any details on how many jobs the Mayor would cut from each agency; that makes it impossible to judge the impact on services.
Missing, too, is a sense of what reforms the Mayor wants from city unions. He says the unions will not get raises without gains from efficiencies and concessions that he has so far failed to extract from them despite months of trying. Nor does he specify which efficiencies and concessions would satisfy him.
Mr. Dinkins has provided an outline of where he wants the city government to go in the next two years of his administration. But it's not yet a plan.

HEADLINE: The Voters Said: What About Us?

 BODY:
Remarkable results. The Democrats got pounded in New Jersey. A nationally known Republican got pounded in Pennsylvania. Different states, different circumstances, different losers. But there was the hint of a common thread: Americans, particularly all those who think of themselves as the middle class, feel they're stuck on dead center. They're dismayed by stagnant incomes, a drifting economy and unresponsive government.
In New Jersey, where Republicans seized control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 20 years, voters rose up against a Governor who had raised their taxes but, in their view, delivered little in return. 
 In Pennsylvania they defeated Dick Thornburgh, who was President Bush's Attorney General. They voted instead for a Democrat, Harris Wofford, who spoke directly to their personal economic concerns, including unemployment and the cost of health care. In both states, the margins were big.
These outcomes appear to be less the result of specific anger directed at incumbents than of general dismay about policy. True, the New Jersey vote was a severe slap at Gov. Jim Florio, who rammed through a $2.8 billion tax increase last year. True, Pennsylvania voters may have been penalizing Mr. Thornburgh for his connections to the nation's most visible incumbent, the man in the White House.
Yet the larger message was frustration. The voters of New Jersey, for example, might have been more forgiving of Mr. Florio's tax policies had they sensed any improvement in their own lot. Like most Americans, their after-tax incomes have gone virtually nowhere since 1973, and real disposable income is actually lower than it was when Mr. Florio -- and Mr. Bush, for that matter -- took office. Housing and medical care costs have risen, and for many families, two incomes are essential just to keep up.
Mr. Wofford exploited this point, blaming Mr. Bush and Mr. Thornburgh for the country's economic woes and -- much like the Republicans in New Jersey -- portraying himself as the last true friend of the middle class. It was to them that he pitched his tantalizing but distressingly vague promises of jobs, tax cuts and health insurance.
The Wofford victory has alarmed Republican strategists, and on Tuesday the President canceled a two-week tour of the Far East later this month. Mr. Bush may finally be hearing what the polls have been suggesting for weeks: However admirable his achievements abroad, he appears singularly inattentive to problems at home. That's probably the most important message the voters sent Tuesday; he better be listening.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Cuomo and Wofford

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
If Mario Cuomo decides to run for President -- a question not yet settled in his mind -- he almost certainly will not resign as Governor of New York, even though he would feel it necessary to wage time-consuming campaigns in most state primaries.
Mr. Cuomo is "very close" to a decision that he will not quit as Governor even if he enters the Presidential race. After nine years in office, and facing "the hardest part" of his tenure -- the state's and New York City's deficit problems -- he cannot "imagine dropping it here and saying there's something more important." 
 The question is a crucial part of the Governor's larger decision, because he stayed out of the 1988 Presidential race largely on grounds that he could not both govern New York and wage a strong national campaign. Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the 1988 Democratic nominee, is widely considered to have been handicapped, moreover, by his dual role and responsibilities in an election year.
Mr. Cuomo is not considering the possibility that he might retain the Governor's office and enter only a few selected state primaries -- such as those in New York and California. This strategy would be "offensive" to voters, in his opinion, since other candidates would be entered in most of the state contests; if he did not do so, he might be thought to be seeking "special rules" for himself.
Besides, a number of the state primaries take place early in 1992 -- "a whole bunch of them" in a brief period in March. It's at least possible that the outcome of the nomination race will be determined then -- well before the California and other primaries.
In explaining some of the pros and cons he is weighing, Mr. Cuomo did not mention the smashing victory of another Democratic liberal, Harris Wofford, in the Pennsylvania senatorial race -- though that event could hardly be absent from his deliberations. Pennsylvania has numerous blue-collar voters and Democrats who defected to Ronald Reagan and George Bush; so Mr. Wofford's aggressive campaign and his defeat of former Governor and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh encouraged the idea that President Bush also might be vulnerable in 1992.
The Pennsylvania upset seems to teach Democrats at least two lessons. One is that they need to "set the agenda" next year, as Mr. Wofford did in making national health insurance and economic recovery the dominant issues; the other, related lesson is that the Democratic Presidential nominee should press an attack on Mr. Bush on these and other popular questions, and not allow him or herself to be forced on the defensive.
Mr. Wofford's campaign could be seen to be catching fire in recent weeks; so his victory was not the most surprising result of the 1991 elections. That distinction goes to the defeat, in Washington State, of a radical measure to limit the terms of state and Federal legislators; the limitations, if approved, would have been retroactive, so that the state's entire Congressional delegation would have had to step down in 1994.
Pre-election polls had suggested that 60 percent of Washington's voters favored term limitation; but after a strong opposition campaign by Speaker Tom Foley and others, the proposition lost by about 54 to 46 percent. This decisive setback seems bound to restrain what had appeared to be a rising political tide that might have had term-limitation measures on the ballot in about 17 states next year. Some form of term limitation already has been approved in Oklahoma, California, Colorado and several municipalities.
Opponents of term limitation, in Washington and elsewhere, have argued that this drastic step would shift power to the executive branch (nationally and in the states), throw out good legislators with bad, restrict the freedom of voters to choose and retain officeholders they like. Some think the movement represents, at root, a Republican effort to break the Democrats' hold on Congress and state legislatures.
The Washington result also suggests something less frequently mentioned -- that term limitation would shift Congressional power from small states to large. A small state often wields outsize power because one of its House members serves at length and becomes chairman of a committee. That would not be likely under term limitation, throwing Congressional power to the sheer numbers of large state delegations.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Great Reshuffle

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The Great Reshuffle is under way in the lives of nations. The Era of Political Dissolution is overlapping the Age of Economic Reassembly.
Political imperialism is on the wane. Russia is spinning off its losing acquisitions; Yugoslavia is breaking up bloodily, Czechoslovakia amicably; the Quebecers may part from Canadians and Scots quit Brits. 
 At the same time, economic unionism is waxing. In Asia, the flying tigers of trade are sitting down with the old lions; in North America, the Canadians and Mexicans are coming to see themselves as eco-Americans; and in Europe, you can hardly hear the rumble of political disintegration for the screeching of economic amalgamation.
Here is a quick way to encapsulate the Great Reshuffle: Politics is zigging while economics is zagging.
The zigging is good: with the breakup of empires, the end of statist Communism and the breaking of forced contracts binding different cultures, we are getting more personal freedom and a greater sense of the control of national destiny. Smaller nations, each speaking one language and proud of its special character, are more responsive than centrally controlled monoliths, provided new majorities respect minority rights.
The zagging, provided it is limited to the extension of economic freedom, is good too. Free-trade zones with tariffs no longer hindering trade should expand business horizons, increasing jobs and raising the standard of living. The three great trading communities (America, Europe, the Far East) will -- if good sense prevails -- agree to compete fairly, with the world's capitalist socks held up by the happy garter of price elasticity.
Then why, in the midst of the greatest forward thrust in two centuries of world history, all the grim faces and sour looks? Because in the zigging away from empire, there is concern about healthy nationalism's flip side of ethnic repression and local war; and in the zagging toward regional confederation, there is worry about getting free trade confused with imperialism under a new banner.
Here in Britain, fatherland of individualism and fond ally of its American colony, the fear is that the rush to European commercial union may involve a transfer of political power to French statist bureaucrats, as well as a loss of the Atlantic connection that has helped preserve its liberty.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, on the eve of British embrace of greater economic union with Europe, has denounced the intrusion of the Continentals into the "nooks and crannies" of a proudly independent culture: Brits don't like Brussels bureaucrats dictating environmental standards to British road builders and soft-drink bottlers.
That's only the beginning of resistance to union; the pressure by the European Commission leader, Jacques Delors, to adopt a single currency with Bonn bankers deciding London interest rates is being called "Delorean" (a play on the name of the failed auto maker), and his notion of a United States of Europe is looking less appealing all the time.
Now we're at the spot where the zigging intersects the zagging. Economic interdependence is helpful only as long as it does not impinge on political independence; then free trade begins to bother free people.
Which force is greater -- the trend toward economic union or the march to political self-determination? Extreme Eurocrats say the train of amalgamation is leaving the station, and point to how the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet union are eager to join, thereby creating a superstate of over 500 million.
I think the Brits will go part of the way, linking currencies, but not all the way, linking their national life to the French and Germans. Less is to be gained on the swings of prosperity than is to be lost on the roundabouts of restriction.
As economic bureaucrats overreach, political sovereignty will be reasserted; in the end, a common language and set of values forges a nation's identity and determines its decisions.
The tug-o'-peace between those two forces -- zigging to political freedom, zagging to economic interdependence -- will shape the politics of the runup to the millennium. Neither need totally win, but in the end, the yearning for political freedom will dominate the desire for economic security.

HEADLINE: New Mayor in Bridgeport Faces the Same Old Problems

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 6

 BODY:
Joseph P. Ganim presented himself to this troubled city's voters as a sort of anti-matter alternative to the incumbent Mayor, Mary C. Moran: what she was, he was not, and vice versa.
Where Ms. Moran was hot-tempered, impetuous and difficult to get along with -- traits that many residents in this tough-minded city still admire -- Mr. Ganim said he would be a cool, decisive coalition builder. Ms. Moran, he charged, had dragged the city down over her two-year term and made it a symbol of urban failure with a bankruptcy filing that drew national headlines. He promised that he would make Connecticut's largest city great again, first of all by making it safe. One hundred new police officers would be added to the force. 
 The strategy worked. Mr. Ganim, a 32-year-old Democrat in a heavily Democratic city, won 54 percent of the vote on Tuesday and took the 58-year-old Ms. Moran's job.
But as different as the two candidates seemed during the campaign, Mr. Ganim is now poised to begin traveling much the same road that led his predecessor to see bankruptcy as a desirable option. Bridgeport, the only municipality in Connecticut that has its finances supervised by a state panel, is under a state order to raise its property taxes by 18 percent to fill a $16 million gap in the budget for the year that began on July 1.
 
Taxes and Promises
 Ms. Moran simply said she would not do it. If resisting the order meant a public feud with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and a prolonged bankruptcy court battle, well, then that was simply one of the costs.
Mr. Ganim, while arguing that bankruptcy is not the answer, also thinks the tax increase is unnecessary. And he has some expensive campaign promises to deliver on. The new police officers will cost an estimated $5 million a year, on top of the already existing budget gap.
He said today in an interview in his law office that he had spoken with Mr. Weicker on the telephone and that the two men had promised to try to get along. But the same stumbling block remains: The state review panel has not revoked its order to raise taxes here, and the chief executive-elect says he does not think he will have to raise them.
"I believe taxes will stay stable," Mr. Ganim said.
Residents are bracing for a continuing rocky road.
"The taxes will go up," said Grace Moran, co-owner of CAS News, a convenience store in the city's north end. "He's got to get the money from somewhere."
Ms. Moran, who is no relation to the departing Mayor, was robbed at gunpoint a few years ago and heartily endorses Mr. Ganim's law-and-order platform. The store next to hers has been vacant for more than two years, and she now sells self-defense "pepper gas" from a display next to the cash register. Higher taxes, as hard as they may be on struggling businesses, may be worth it, she said, if crime can be brought under control.
 
View From the Bottom
 Other residents say whatever Mr. Ganim does, things are so bad now that it could look like progress.
"How much worse can they get? We're already bankrupt," said Rich Deaguila, a truck driver who voted for Mr. Ganim.
But crime and unemployment also go only so far as issues in a mostly blue-collar city that has long enjoyed a reputation as a place where politics is no fun unless someone howls in pain. Mayor Moran, for whatever else she achieved or did not, certainly knew how to bruise people. In her concession speech on Tuesday night she called the vote "Bridgeport's loss." She did not return calls to her office today.
Some people said that Mr. Ganim, who has never before served in public office, will have to learn fast how to be mean or he won't last at all.
Mr. Ganim received 15,768 votes to 10,951 for Ms. Moran and 2,258 shared between two minor party candidates.
In Waterbury, voters also threw out the incumbent mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, who came in last in a three-way race, behind even a third-party independent candidate who had never run for public office before. The voters there returned former Mayor Edward D. Bergin, a Democrat, to the office he held nine years from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's.
Mr. Santopietro was indicted earlier this year by a Federal grand jury on corruption charges. He pleaded not guilty and told voters he could continue his duties as mayor while fighting to stay out of jail. He received only 6,635 votes out of 32,496 votes cast.
In Hartford, Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry, a Democrat, ran unopposed, while in New Haven, the state's third-largest city, Mayor John C. Daniels was re-elected to a second term. He is that city's first black chief executive.

HEADLINE: Growth Amid Blight: Uneasy Worlds Coexist

SERIES: Life at the Bottom; Mott Haven, the Bronx -- Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
David Lee has a collection of bullet shells that he picks up on the way to his knitwear factory in the morning. Stephen Mayo occasionally has to step around crack vials that collect in front of his office-products factory during the weekend. Lenny Gamss notes with bemusement that the free coffee he provides customers at his hardware store is often enjoyed by prostitutes on their way to work around the corner.
These are just some of the ways that local business people -- pioneers, really -- have learned to accommodate themselves to the torn landscape. For myriad reasons -- the lure of $3-a-square-foot rents, historical happenstance or transportation needs -- they have staked their capitalist claims in and around Mott Haven, one of the poorest neighborhoods in one of the poorest places in New York, the South Bronx. 
 At first glance, Mott Haven is the stuff that movies are made of. Drug dealers hawk their wares openly, store windows display bullet holes from shootings, children mill about, surrounded by addicts and prostitutes who are often their parents.
But look deeper, and Mott Haven is actually the uneasy intersection of two worlds: a fractured social-welfare state, and an unlikely experiment in economic development. Between them lie several pressing questions: How well can businesses adapt and thrive in such a seemingly hostile environment? Can economic development translate into help for a community where half the residents are estimated to be unemployed and the median family income is just $7,600? And what role should government play in bringing the two worlds together?
Virtually the only commercial activity in Mott Haven takes place on a two-block stretch of 138th Street. There, one can buy inexpensive household goods at Woolworth's, shoes at Fayva or fast food from Blimpie's. Yet one short block away, at 139th and Brook Avenue, lies what the police have identified as one of the most active drug-dealing spots in the city.
The "above ground" business exists in part because of the government-financed safety net. After all, Mott Haven contains one of the three largest concentrations of public housing in the city; housing projects, as well as renovated apartments and shelters for hundreds of formerly homeless families. About half of the residents living in the area are estimated to receive some form of government assistance.
 
'A Social Welfare State'
 Such a dense population of residents with guaranteed incomes, albeit small ones, translates into business opportunity for some. When asked where the money comes from to support retail stores in the area, Mr. Gamss, the hardware store owner, shrugged and said, "We live in a social welfare state."
As a result, commercial establishments on 138th Street are bustling with customers seeking inexpensive clothes, furniture and baby products. Other stores, which sell $125 sneakers and offer new and repaired beepers, seem to be geared more toward the drug trade.
So promising is the local market to certain entrepreneurs that one investment group recently built a 16,000-square-foot retail mall on 138th Street, and another is putting in the foundation walls for a 38,000-square-foot store across the street.
Local residents may not have large incomes, said Albert Srour, who is building the large store, but, "They still have to eat, they still have to dress and they need to buy necessities."
But the economy of Mott Haven is not just discount retailers and those who cater to drug dealers. Some small manufacturers in a nearby neighborhood are also thriving and expanding, despite the recession. Their growth provides jobs to residents of Mott Haven, often because no other workers will venture into the area.
This economic activity, in turn, is helping to chip away at the area's high unemployment rate, or at least is keeping it from increasing. It provides one of the few legitimate forces shoring up the neighborhood.
Take K.D.dids, a manufacturer of high-quality knitwear for dancers that has been growing at 30 percent a year, exports 20 percent of its goods to Japan and now employs 14 people, many of them from the neighborhood. One of them is 30-year-old Maria Santiago, who was on welfare for 13 years, raising three children, before she joined the company last year. She earns $6 an hour, a typical wage for the area. She now makes $960 a month, compared with $722 from welfare and food stamps. But having a job means more to her than money. She no longer has to make constant journeys to get her checks or answer invasive questions about her personal life. And she likes having a life and friends outside the house.
"I was kind of shy when I came here," Ms. Santiago said. "I didn't know how I would feel, what they would think of me. But they were friendly, and taught me, and gave me time to do what I have to do."
 
Companies Provide More Than Jobs
 Many companies seem to have accepted the notion that they must serve as more than places of employment, perhaps even as quasi-social workers.
Faced with a work force that is primarily Spanish-speaking, woefully uneducated and often with little or no previous work experience, business people in the area expect to train their new employees intensively. Many managers have had to learn Spanish in the process. Considering all the trouble, why not hire from outside Mott Haven? Some companies say they are committed to working with the community, while others say they have no choice. Newspaper ads that give a South Bronx location get little response.
Some companies have gone so far as to recruit from the local homeless shelters and prison work-release programs. American International Medical Equipment Sales, which manufactures and distributes medical products, became so involved with its work-release program that it held a Fourth of July barbecue and invited all the prisoners' families, many of whom were having a hard time accepting their relatives back into the fold. The company hoped it would help for them to see the prisoners in a more normal setting. It also hired a part-time psychiatrist.
Virtually all the employers interviewed in and around Mott Haven had nothing but good things to say about their local workers. Few had encountered any problems with drug abuse or theft. Most said that once their training was complete, the workers were among the most dedicated they had ever known.
"You can't believe how smart they are and how much they want a job," said Tricia Kaye, a co-owner of K.D.dids. "But nobody would train them."
Still, there is only so much small companies can do to pull a community up by its bootstraps. What is unclear is what role local government can, or should, be playing.
On the face of it, Mott Haven enjoys more intensive economic development assistance than most city neighborhoods. To the northeast is Hunts Point, the location of a huge wholesale produce market, which generates 22,000 jobs, many of them unskilled. Directly north is the commercial hub on 149th Street, with 100 stores employing 4,000 shop assistants, clerks and other employees from the area. On the southern flank is the Port Morris Industrial Park, which the state designated as an economic development zone in 1987. There, 650 companies employ 20,000 people, 80 percent of whom live in the Bronx.
Companies in the Port Morris development zone get wage credits if they hire a certain proportion of local people. They also get up to a 30 percent discount on their electricity, 5 percent on their telephone bills, and rebates on sales tax for materials used to expand their operations.
"If you look at the opportunities for jobs within a proximity of Mott Haven, it's actually pretty good," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the city Economic Development Corporation.
But critics say that while the city has painted some impressive broad-brush strokes, problems often arise from the clash of the two Mott Havens: the business community and the welfare state. Economic Development Corporation officials speak proudly about how they have helped to revitalize 138th Street by rebuilding the sidewalks. But at the same time, the city put a shelter for 100 homeless families just down the street. Local merchants complain of a general deterioration in the area since then, thanks to an increase in petty theft, car break-ins and prostitution.
Similarly, in 1987, the city took the largest remaining parcel of city-owned property in the area and turned it into a tow pound. The decision was a direct affront to the Borough President's office, which had been lobbying for a satellite center for the garment industry or a development centered on artists' studios.
"They totally ignored us," said Cecil P. Joseph, who heads Borough President Fernando Ferrer's economic development efforts. "They came in overnight and paved it over."
 
Measuring the Value Of an Industrial Park
 In one of the most incongruous developments yet, the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which has been an important lifeline to the business community in the area, is using city funds to help an elegant row of townhouses prosper as an antiques center.
Questions have even been raised by some in the community about the true value of the Port Morris Industrial Park. In designating the area as an opportunity zone, the state projected that companies there would invest $72 million and hire 1,329 full-time and 243 part-time employees. But state officials acknowledge that they have not confirmed how much of that investment actually occurred. Anecdotal evidence suggests that more companies are coming to Port Morris than are moving out or closing down, and that many are expanding.
S & S Industries, for instance, which makes wires for bra cups, has tripled its space and doubled its work force in the last year. Mr. Mayo's Artistic Office Products company has gone from 50 to 75 employees. Zaro's Bakery, which has its headquarters in Port Morris, has increased its work force there from 120 to 150.
But few companies are expanding because of government incentives. Of the 55 companies that have partaken of the state's menu of benefits, only 8 have availed themselves of wage benefits, which are among the most beneficial. Most of the rest have only enjoyed a reduced electricity bill.
What concerns business executives far more is the difficulty they have had obtaining low-interest loans from the city or the state that were supposed to be available to small companies and manufacturers.
Andrew Brown, chief executive of American International Medical, recalls that after he won a contract with the Defense Department to produce 10 million surgical gloves, he approached state and city agencies for a loan to help buy equipment. He was already convinced that banks had been shunning the area because in 1981 he had so much trouble getting a mortgage on his building.
With a guaranteed government contract, a 20-year manufacturing record and a reputation as a good corporate citizen, Mr. Brown figured the city and state would surely lend him the $1.1 million he needed. The state Urban Development Corporation approved its half without much delay, but the city Financial Services Corporation spent months pondering his application. It finally granted an approval with so many conditions that the bank that was being asked to make a bridge loan to the company did not feel it had the guarantee it needed from the city to insure that it would be repaid. By that point Mr. Brown's contract with the Defense Department had expired.
Mr. Brown's experience is not unusual. Since 1987, when Port Morris received its special state status, the Urban Development Corporation has made loans to just two companies, while the city's financing agency has made eight.
Still, even if the state and city were to develop every vacant piece of land in Port Morris, it would not be enough to absorb the unemployed of Mott Haven. By placing so many high-rise housing projects in one area, the government has created a density of population that requires similarly dense employment opportunities. But many of the buildings in Port Morris are one- or two-story warehouses and factories, and the average business there employs only 30 people.
The real issue is why Mott Haven residents have not been able to find work elsewhere. The answer, Mr. Weisbrod says, lies with with much broader issues like illiteracy, drug abuse, poverty and a lack of social support services.
"The real problem is the degree of social investment that has to take place, beyond just providing housing," he said. "What we're witnessing are the consequences of the withdrawal of the Federal Government from domestic programs."
Mr. Brown says he too worries about the long-term consequences of government policies. "It's unfair for young people in the Bronx not to have an opportunity to learn how to make a living," he said. He thought things were bad in the slums of his native Glasgow, but he has since learned they can be worse.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the business community in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx misstated the timing of New York City's approval of a loan to American International Medical Equipment Sales. The city's Financial Services Corporation approved the loan in December 1989, before a similar approval was given by a state agency, the Urban Development Corporation.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Are Down As Weak Economy Is Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver and platinum futures fell sharply yesterday amid perceptions that this week's cut in interest rates would spur neither an economic recovery nor a rise in inflation.
Silver for delivery next month fell 7 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $3.998 an ounce, the contract's first close below $4 since Sept. 11. 
 December gold dropped $1.10, to $354.70 an ounce on the Comex, while January platinum deliveries tumbled $6.20, to $358.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The selloff followed a weak performance by the precious metals on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve and large American banks lowered key lending rates in hopes of stimulating an economic recovery.
Some analysts said the failure of precious metals to rally strongly on Wednesday signaled a lack of confidence in the economy and set the stage for yesterday's selloff.
"It's like crying wolf," said William O'Neill, the senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures. "We've had so many interest-rate cuts, and it really hasn't done anything. The markets want to see some kind of results."
Analysts said the drop in silver and platinum indicated pessimism about future industrial activity and perceptions that the inflation rate would remain relatively low. Investors tend to buy precious metals as a hedge against inflation.
The decline in commodity prices that began on Wednesday and continued yesterday was yet another sign of future economic weakness, said Bernard Savaiko, the senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
He said general weakness in commodity markets "is the first indication that the economy is going to follow."
Mr. O'Neill said silver futures were also under pressure from selling related to today's expiration of silver options contracts.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain and soybean contracts fell for the fourth straight day amid ideas that the fall harvest would be bigger and a Soviet food-aid package would be smaller than had been thought.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil slipped as rumors that Iraq would resume large oil exports gave traders reason to take profits.
Light crude for delivery in December fell 20 cents a barrel, to $23.20; December home heating oil fell 0.70 cent, to 70.32 cents a gallon, and December unleaded gasoline tumbled 0.92 cent, to 65.36 cents a gallon. Natural gas for December rose 1.9 cents, to $2.082 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Up by 14,000

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose 14,000 in late October, the Government said today.
For the week ended Oct. 26, there were 420,000 Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment help, up from the previous week's revised 406,000, the Labor Department said. 
 The increase was not viewed as entirely discouraging, however. It erased only a portion of a 46,000 plunge from the previous week, when claims had fallen from 452,000. Because claims rose by just 14,000, that means the 46,000 improvement in the previous week was not a fluke caused by the Columbus Day holiday, said Irwin Kellner, economist with Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
Mr. Kellner said the data, considered together, could be a sign that the trend toward increased layoffs "may have run its course."
Still, the 420,000 people filing claims is above lows of 400,000 during the summer.
To have 420,000 new people heading to an unemployment office during any given week "is not a level of claims indicative of a smooth, functioning economy," said Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities.
And yet, he noted, the four-week average of claims is about 425,000. "There isn't any sense of things having gotten worse," Mr. Brusca said.
Because the claims number can be extremely volatile from week to week, analysts generally hesitate to read a lot into one week's movement.
Government figures on joblessness that were released last week showed that companies failed to add workers in October and that some layoffs continued. The nation's jobless rate rose to 6.8 percent from September's 6.7 percent, as 8.6 million Americans remained without jobs.

Net Up 25% At Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that its earnings rose by 25 percent in the third quarter, as the nation's largest retailer once again outperformed its competitors.
Wal-Mart said it earned $353.2 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Oct. 31, compared with $282.8 million, or 25 cents a share, in the comparable 1990 period. 
 The retailer's sales rose by 34.1 percent, to $10.73 billion from $8 billion. The company's stock rose $2 yesterday, to $48.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Faring Better Than Others
 Wal-Mart, with its low prices and reputation for good customer service, has fared far better than other retailers while the economic recovery has stumbled. Many other store owners are expected to post earnings declines because of the continuing slump in consumer spending.
Sales at Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark, have surged as it opened 126 new stores this year. The retailer had 1,652 Wal-Mart stores, 194 Sam's Clubs and four Hypermart stores operating at the end of the quarter.
Joseph Ronning, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc., said he was pleased with the report, which was about as expected.
"The customers are responding to Wal-Mart's low-price image," he said. "They have the right product at the right price at the right time."

HEADLINE: Skepticism On Effects Of Rate Cut

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators are trying to stimulate more bank lending by reducing interest rates and rewriting guidelines for examining real estate loans. But many bankers say the weakness in the economy will overpower those efforts and bank lending will remain sluggish.
"So long as the public is convinced that we are not out of the recession, I don't think rate reductions are going to have much immediate impact" on demand for loans or bank lending, said Ezekiel S. Ketchum, president of Meridian Bank in Reading, Pa. "People do not go out and buy a car just because rates are down half a point," he said. And businesses that do not foresee a sustained increase in demand for their products are not likely to borrow to increase inventories or production.
 
Bankers Worry About Inflation
 While bank profits would benefit by an increase in loan demand, several bankers warned this week that the recent initiatives were worrisome because they could eventually help revive inflation. 
 "Politically, the Fed cannot afford to sit on its hands, even though economically that might be the best thing for them to do," said Phillip E. Peters, chief investment officer at Boatmen's Bancshares in St. Louis. He noted that the inability of the Fed to bring down yields on long-term bonds was a sign that the financial markets were worried that inflation might not remain in the recent 3 percent to 4 percent range.
When the Fed announced a cut in the discount rate Wednesday to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent, it noted that the action came "in an environment of abating inflatonary pressures." That view is widespread among economists now, but has not been persuasive to many investors. Bond yields fell to 8 percent in February, but have not dropped much below that level even though the Fed has steadily reduced overnight rates for bank loans to 4 3/4 percent from 6 1/4 percent in that period.
 
How to Fine-Tune Prices
 "In one respect, lenders would like some inflation" because it could help some borrowers repay their loans, said Robert Aspinwall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. But the problem, he said, is that economic policy makers do not have any fine-tuning policy tools to make sure that "they can get prices to rise, but not too much."
The danger of an overreaction by the Fed led Wayne D. Angell, one Fed governor, to vote against the latest discount-rate cut. Mr. Angell said yesterday that he did not expect the economy would be helped much by a cut in short-term interest rates. The best monetary policy for now, he said, is one which helps the housing market by bringing down long-term interest rates. But reductions in long-term rates require confidence, which is currently lacking in the financial markets, that the Fed is still fighting inflation.
Mr. Aspinwall is not the only banker to realize that a revival of inflation could benefit banks burdened by delinquent real estate loans. Often those loans are backed by buildings that are not attracting tenants and cannot be sold except at discounts of 30 percent or 40 percent from the amount lent by the bank.
 
Good for Real Estate
 John S. Reed, chairman at Citicorp, said at a meeting with analysts last month that periods of inflation had traditionally been the best time to own real estate. While he did not predict or recommend that the Fed adopt an inflationary monetary policy, he noted that the end of tight money could help attract more buyers for the real estate Citicorp owns.
The clarified guidelines issued yesterday by banking regulators for evaluating real estate loans was another part of the recent effort to stimulate more bank lending. However, the guidelines stopped far short of changes that would let banks relabel troubled loans as problem free.
"There is really not much regulators can do to make any dramatic change," said Steven Roberts, national director for financial institution regulation at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm. He noted that with earlier problems, like loans to third world countries issued by large banks or the loans to farmers at small banks in the Midwest, regulators gave banks several years to solve the problems without forcing them to immediatly recognize their losses.
But in the wake of the savings and loan industry's problems, which were aggravated by years of regulators' tolerance of weak capital and poor lending practices, "forebearance has become a dirty word," Mr. Roberts said.

HEADLINE: Easier Rules For Banks Are Issued

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
As part of a drive by the Administration to stimulate the economy, the four Federal bank regulatory agencies announced new guidelines yesterday to make bank examinations less tough and encourage banks to make more loans.
The measures would permit examiners greater latitude in reviewing commercial real estate loans to try to "insure that regulatory policies and actions do not inadvertently curtail the availability of credit to sound borrowers," the agencies said in a joint statement. 
 Their action was intended to draw attention to an effort begun by the Adminstration in March to relax tight credit by making it easier for banks to make loans so that business could expand and grow. But some bankers and analysts said the guidelines would do little to help an economy hobbled more by a lack of loan demand than by an unwillingess of banks to lend. And others feared that yesterday's action could cause banks to make the kind of poor loans they did in the 1980's, which are causing problems today.
 
More Scrutiny of Regulators
 This also comes as greater attention is being paid to the actions of regulators. On Wednesday, a Senate committee rejected Mr. Bush's attempt to reappoint Robert L. Clarke as Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of some 4,000 nationally chartered banks, in part because Mr. Clarke was considered too lenient in the 1980's and was seen as having failed to head off a wave of bank failures. And it comes as Congress is considering a complex bill to overhaul the banking industry and mandate earlier regulatory intervention at troubled banks.
"All this stuff is pretty marginal as far as I'm concerned," said Robert E. Litan, a banking industry analyst at the Brookings Institution. "I don't think the new regulations will do much to change things and the key thing is what message gets to the troops. In reality, examiners are probably totally perplexed. They've just seen their leader whipsawed in Congress and they know the climate on the Hill is to be tough rather than lenient. I think examiners are going to be very nervous about getting too liberal all of a sudden."
The measure, however, was praised by representatives of the banking and real estate industry, but raised concerns among others who feared any relaxation in regulatory standards. The document, which will be distributed to bank presidents and examiners, was drafted by the Comptroller's office, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Last March, these agencies issued general guidelines and the document released yesterday provides specifics to guide examiners.
"A lot of this is common sense stuff," said Wendy B. Samuel, general counsel of the National Coucnil of Community Bankers. "But I can't picture a lot of bankers immediately changing their lending practices. Bankers would love to make loans and are finding that the sort of loans they want to make are just not there."
 
'Constructive Approach'
 Steven A. Wechsler, president of the National Realty Committee, said the guidlines were a "constructive approach to restoring regulatory balance to the system," while Robert H. Dugger, chief economist at the American Bankers Association, said the new guidelines "will definitely help."
But Herbert M. Sandler, chief executive of World Savings and Loan Association, one of the nation's largest, said "I'm concerned that a message not be given to go back to the old practicies of the 1980's when people received credit for loans which should never have been made. Now we're saying, gee, we're wrong, let's go back and give these people credit."
Among the specifics of the guidelines are details about when real estate loans should be classifed as in danger of default and how much should be set aside as reserves against them. One important move welcomed by the American Bankers Association was a shift in emphasis from evaluating existing loans on a worst case scenario based on current market conditions to judging real estate loans based on future market conditions.
The agencies also said they will convene a national meeting of senior bank examiners in December to review this policy statement. They will also undertake a random audit program to check up on how examiners are following the guidelines and plan to allow bank holding companies to use a greater amount of preferred stock to meet regulatory capital guidelines.
The argument against greater use of preferred stock is that it is a security considered to be similar to debt. But the change is intended to help Citibank and several other large money center banks meet their regualatory capital standards.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Investors Lured to Long Bond

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The third and most speculative part of the Treasury's $38 billion quarterly refunding auctions got the best reception of the three from investors yesterday as the wide gap between long-term and short-term interest rates created demand at the sale of $12 billion worth of 30-year bonds.
The bond auction came on the heels of disappointing auctions of new 3-year and 10-year notes, and that had created concern among many market participants about who might be willing to venture a bid on the new 30-year securities. The longer out in time the securities go, the riskier they are to hold because their value could decline if inflation heated up, driving up interest rates, but yesterday the higher yield on the long-term bonds attracted buyers. 
 The demand for the bonds was especially strong from smaller investors who normally avoid the Treasury's most speculative debt instrument.
The new bonds were auctioned at an average yield of 8 percent, down from an average yield of 8.17 percent at the last 30-year bond auction in August.
 
Stocks React Favorably
 "When you consider the economy and inflation, I think it makes sense to own bonds at 8 percent," one Government bond trader said.
The favorable auction results lent strength to the stock market, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.65, to 3,054.11, and the broader Nasdaq and Russell 2,000 indexes reached new highs. [Page D6.]
Unlike the 3-year and 10-year auctions, traders said that bids for the new bonds were tightly bunched.
The best gauge of demand among smaller investors is the amount of noncompetitive tender offers submitted, and at $937 million they were the second highest on record for a bond auction, according to William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
By submitting a noncompetitive bid, investors agree to pay the average price produced at the auction.
"Small investors stayed away from the 3-year and 10-year auctions and waited for the highest possible yield," Mr. Sullivan said. "And with the spread between yields on 10-year securities and 30-year bonds at what could be its widest margin, there was obviously a strong incentive to buy longer-term paper."
Even after the results were announced, demand for the new bonds remained strong, and by late in the day the 8 percent securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.89 percent.
The better-than-expected auction results helped push up prices in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds.
"We are celebrating the fact that the auctions are over," another trader said. "Happy days are here again. That is the headline."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the current benchmark issue, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021, were offered late yesterday at a price of 102 11/32, up 30/ 32, to yield 7.91 percent, compared with 7.99 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 101, up 9/32, to yield 6.63 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 3/4, up 1/32, to yield 5.59 percent.
The rally also pushed up the prices of the securities that were auctioned earlier in the week.
The 6 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.94 percent. And the 7.50 percent 10-year notes sold on Wednesday were offered in late when-issued trading at a price to yield 7.41 percent.
 
Bills Little Changed
 Rates on short-term Treasury bills were little changed yesterday, despite the Federal Reserve's rate cuts. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.61 percent, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at an offered rate of 4.67 percent.
New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a two-part, $350.5 million offering of securities backed by home equity loans by the the Fleet Financial Corporation.
The bulk of the issue consisted of $319 million of 6.70 percent securities with an average life of 2.18 years. They were priced at $99.781, to yield 6.895 percent, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
These securities are rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Services and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
American Brands offered $150 million worth of 30-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 8 5/8 percent securities, which mature Nov. 15, 2021, were priced at $97.105, to yield 8.903 percent, 1 percentage point over the yield on the new 8 percent 30-year Treasury bond.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-3 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a competitive bid from an investor group led by Kidder, Peabody & Company won an offering of $225 million worth of triple-A-rated securities issued by the Convention Center of Rhode Island.
The serial and term bonds are all insured by MBIA Inc. The securities were reoffered to investors at a maximum yield of 6.75 percent on term bonds maturing in 2020.
In another development, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended Oct. 28. M-1, the narrowest measure, rose by $1 billion.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Maxwell Executive Knows U.S. Unit Well

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
David Shaffer, the new chief operating officer of the Maxwell Communication Corporation, brings to the job a thorough knowledge of the company's key operation: its United States division. As president of Macmillan Inc. since March 1990, he has supervised the book publishing company and a subsidiary that publishes the Official Airlines Guide.
Having just returned from London last night, Mr. Shaffer said in a telephone interview that everyone was "terribly saddened by Bob's death, but he had structured the company in such a way that the company will not feel it at all." He added, "The day-to-day operating decision was already under my control." 
 Mr. Shaffer, who is 49 years old, was said to have grown close to Kevin F. H. Maxwell, who has emerged as the leader of the publishing empire established by his father, Robert Maxwell.
The executive joined Maxwell Communication when it bought Official Airlines Guide in 1988. He recalled that Mr. Maxwell had soon after named him executive vice president of the Maxwell Macmillan Group, which included all the information businesses of Maxwell Communication, both in the United States and overseas. "For a year and two months, I did run most of the international businesses," he recalled.
Maxwell Communications gets roughly 80 percent of its revenues and 90 percent of its profits, from its American operations, "The piece I have inherited," he said, referring to the foreign business," is only a minor part."
Maxwell Communication does not separate Macmillan's performance from its annual reports. But Mr. Shaffer said the company's joint venture on elementary high school publishing, for which data are simpler to analyze, has done very very well.
Kenneth Noble, who heads his own consulting firm in the media industry, said Macmillan's book operations had not been doing badly despite the recession.
Mr. Shaffer maintained yesterday that the company would not be under pressure to sell additional assets since the company is close to meeting its next debt repayment in October 1992 for $750 million. "The next payment is exactly two years later for $1.2 billion," he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Voters Rewrite Domestic Agenda

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THERE were seeming ideological contradictions in this week's election results. For instance, Pennsylvania voters handed a decisive Senate victory to the liberal Democrat, Harris Wofford, who stressed the need for national health care, over former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who upheld the conservative Bush Administration program, with heavy support from the President. But New Jersey voters appeared to have shifted sharply to the right, handing Democratic state legislators a crushing defeat for supporting Gov. Jim Florio's tax increase last year.
However, the common denominator in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey elections was money -- and the voters' anxiety, whether the worry was over how to pay medical bills or how to pay taxes. 
 President Bush quickly demonstrated that he had got the electoral message: He promised health-care and tax-cut initiatives, presumably going beyond his long-proposed cut in the capital-gains tax, which Democrats have labeled a "a tax break for the rich."
Mr. Bush has been supporting the cautious don't-worsen-the-deficit faction within the Administration, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, against the radical "pro-growth" faction, headed by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, an ardent champion of tax cuts, regardless of the immediate effect on the deficit. Is Mr. Bush ready to switch sides?
He has been blocking Democratic legislation, such as the bill to extend unemployment benefits, saying it would bust last December's budget agreement, which was supposed to cut the deficit by $500 billion over the next five years. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office projects the budgetdeficit for the current fiscal year will soar to a record $362 billion. How Mr. Bush means to get around the deficit issue while proposing tax cuts to stimulate the economy (and without causing an upsurge of interest rates) remains a mystery.
For the present, the job of insuring that economic stagnation does not cost the Republicans the White House next year is being handed to the Federal Reserve. Immediately after the election, the Fed cut the discount rate to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent and the Federal funds rate to 4 3/4 percent from 5 percent. The Fed said the move had nothing to do with the election. True, President Bush, Secretary Brady and other Administration figures have been loud in their urgings to the Fed to cut rates. And Democrats had joined in urging the Fed to ease further. Nevertheless, the Fed's move this week was filed at the central bank under the Funny Coincidence Department.
Worries about the economy have not squeezed all ideology out of the political contest. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, is calling for higher tax rates on the rich and lower taxes on the middle class and lower-income groups.
The 1992 campaign could still become a contest between the politics of envy and the politics of greed. But events this week stirred hopes that fear of the political consequences of a sick economy could cause politicians to veer away from their partisan deadlock and start the process of resolving dangerous social and economic problems.
Health care, for instance, is not an issue of rich versus poor or business versus labor. A survey by Dun & Bradstreet this week reported that the top five worries of the nation's small-business proprietors had become health-insurance costs, cash-flow squeeze, cost control, recession and finding qualified employees.
"I've tried for three years to get health-insurance costs under control," said Kathie M. Leonard, co-owner of Auburn Manufacturing Inc., a textile manufacturer in Mechanics Falls, Me., whose premiums have risen 27 percent since 1990. Despite her efforts, Ms. Leonard said, "This little company is going to pay 80 grand in premiums this year."
Similarly, the issue of education and training, which business calls "finding qualified employees," is one on which employers and employees can make common cause.
Anger over hard times and fear over competition for jobs have doubtless aggravated racial tensions, not only in Louisiana and New York but even in Dubuque, Iowa, which both parties need to address.
This week's election seems certain to quickly break the logjam between Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats over legislation to extend unemployment benefits.
Thus a new political agenda is emerging, as the overriding issue for all incumbents, especially President Bush, becomes how to solve the nation's economic and social problems. Much historical evidence shows that the incumbent in the White House is unlikely to be re-elected with the economy in the tank. The riddle is to how to get it out of the tank, when an orgy of public and private debt-creation, by undermining national savings, investment, productivity, trade and economic growth, has put it there.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up a Bit in New York After Declining in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was narrowly mixed against other currencies yesterday following a series of losses.
The dollar fell in European trading but recovered in New York dealings. Analysts said it drew some strength from a variety of factors. 
 Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said there was a feeling in the market that the dollar was reaching bottom after tumbling in recent weeks in response to declining interest rates.
With the Federal Reserve having lowered its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 4 1/2 percent, on Wednesday, traders also bought dollars in the belief that short-term rates were unlikely to fall much further, Mr. Logan said.
Stable interest rates are a positive sign for the dollar. Like all currencies, the dollar is supported by higher rates, which increase foreign demand for American investments.
 
A Lift From Bond Prices
 A surge in bond prices yesterday also spilled over to the dollar, Mr. Logan said. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up nearly a point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face value, by late afternoon.
The dollar was marginally lower against the Japanese yen in New York, falling to 129.87 yen from late Wednesday's 129.90. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.03 yen, to a closing 129.70 Japanese yen and in London it was quoted at 129.88 yen.
The British pound fell against the dollar, slipping to $1.7705 in New York, from $1.7750 late Wednesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.7800 from $1.7718.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6410 German marks, up from 1.6370; 1.4480 Swiss francs, up from 1.4475; 5.6055 French francs, up from 5.5970; 1,234.50 Italian lire, up from 1,227.25, and 1.12225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.12335.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.6305 German marks, down from 1.6395; 1.4390 Swiss francs, down from 1.4495; 5.5740 French francs, down from 5.6090; 1.8375 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8485; 1,224.50 Italian lire, down from 1,229.50, and 1.1210 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1238.

HEADLINE: Consumers Cut Borrowing For Fifth Straight Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit outstanding fell an additional 2.5 percent in September, the Government said today, as Americans continued paying off old bills faster than taking on new debt.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit fell by a seasonally adjusted $1.55 billion in September, the fifth straight decline and the eighth in nine months. All categories except revolving credit declined. 
 The trend "reflects the recession's impact on consumer spending," Michael P. Niemira, an economist, wrote in Mitsubishi Bank's Weekly Economic Indicator Report.
Consumer credit shrank a revised 1.4 percent in August, rather than the initial 2.1 percent estimate, and 1 percent in July. It has not risen since April.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. Overall consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Automobile credit continued to show the largest decline. It was down 9.9 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $2.3 billion, after dropping 8.6 percent a month earlier. Revolving credit, including credit cards, jumped 12.6 percent, or $2.4 billion, after a 6.6 percent advance in August.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Up Slightly In October

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Thanks to cold weather that swept most of the nation in the last week of October and widespread, generous price promotions, the nation's retailers saw a slight uptick in sales.
But most analysts and merchants took little encouragement yesterday from the numbers, which showed winners like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Gap Inc. continuing to gain market share at the expense of those selling more expensive merchandise. 
 "Looking at the short-term, they did a little better than expected, but taking the long-term perspective, the numbers are really quite disappointing," said Daniel D. Barry, a retail analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company. "For the vast majority of retailers, sales were below plan for the third consecutive month."
 
More Apparel Sales
 Mr. Barry said colder weather across most of the country spurred sales of apparel, while big-ticket items like home furnishings languished on store floors and catalogue goods sat on warehouse shelves.
Those buying patterns contributed to a 2.9 percent decline in overall sales at the J. C. Penney Company, based in Dallas. Sales at Penney's same stores, those open at least a year, fell 2.4 percent, while catalogue sales dropped by 8.2 percent.
Analysts consider sales at same, or comparable, stores a more accurate indication of a retailer's performance.
Stores emphasizing low prices showed the strongest gains. The Pic 'N' Save Corporation in Dominguez, Calif., which sells merchandise obtained from manufacturers' close-out sales, as well as overruns and discontinued lines, reported a 10.3 percent increase in same-store sales last month.
Analysts said most of the store chains that reported strong gains achieved them with heavy promotions that would cut into profits. Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, the flamboyant chain of men's apparel stores based in Maryland, for example, reported a 30 percent rise in its sales and a 9 percent same-store gain, but analysts said much of the rise came from cutting prices.
"You're seeing that situation in case after case, so I think we need to be careful about putting any faith in the notion that the consumer" is ready to buy, said Robert F. Buchanan of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.
The Merrill Lynch Retail Index of 23 leading retail chains showed a 2.3 percent increase in same-store sales for the month, compared with a 1 percent increase in September.
Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said even in comparison with the poor sales of October 1990, when the nation reacted to troops being sent to the Persian Gulf, last month's sales gains were disappointing. He said they reflected lingering consumer concerns about the economy, as well as "lackluster offerings from many retailers in the fashion area."
But Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, an industry publication, said the modest upswing in sales at merchants selling moderately priced goods indicated that shoppers were beginning to relinquish their grip on their wallets.
For example, the Best Buy Company, a consumer electronics and appliance retailer based in Bloomington, Minn., reported a 40 percent sales increase over all and a 17 percent rise among its comparable stores.
"Contrary to the nay-sayers and doctors of doom, I am very confident that consumers will continue to release pent-up demand," Mr. Barnard said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	By The Associated Press -- Following are the October sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported yesterday by some of the nation's largest retailers, compared with the previous year's results.

HEADLINE: Broad Gain Lifts Dow by 15.65, to 3,054.11

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Blue-chip issues posted moderate gains in active trading yesterday, drawing strength from I.B.M. and retailers, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.65, to 3,054.11. The broader market made solid advances, taking the Nasdaq and Russell 2,000 indexes to new highs.
A favorable outcome to yesterday's 30-year bond auction strengthened Treasury securities and lowered interest rates, helping stocks become that much more attractive to investors, some analysts said. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 206.9 million, up from 167.4 million on Wednesday. Gainers outpaced losers by a margin of 1,085 to 560.
 
All Indexes Are Up
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.75, to 393.72, while the Big Board composite rose 1.84, to 217.14, and the American Stock Exchange composite rose 1.61, to 388.26.
In active trading, the Nasdag composite rose 5.80, to 545.28, and the Russell 2,000 increased 1.44 to close at 185.80.
Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president and head of stock index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Brothers, said that after a battle between bulls and bears for weeks, it appeared the Dow was poised for a new high. "The question is," he said, "will the rest of the market be capable of doing the same?" The Dow's high is 3,077.15, reached on Oct. 18.
"One clue may be that in a recent four-day pullback by the market, the broad list of stocks did not come under selling pressure," he noted. "I see institutional portfolio managers continuing to pour money into secondary growth stocks, as evidenced by the Nasdaq and Russell indexes reaching new all-time highs. In fact the whole aggressive growth in the secondary markets has outperformed the blue chips by 50 percent this year and is still doing so."
I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, said yesterday that the earnings outlook was improving. I.B.M. rose 3 1/4 to close at 99 7/8.
 
Retailers Attract Investors
 Investors, encouraged by some better-than-expected October sales results at retailers, did a little shopping of their own. The Limited was up 2 3/4, to 44 3/8; Wal-Mart Stores 2, to 48 7/8; Dayton Hudson 3 3/4, to 62 1/2, and K Mart 2 3/8, to 44 3/8.
Bristol-Myers Squibb said it planned to begin introducing Pravachol, its recently approved drug to control elevated blood cholesterol levels. The company expects it will be available in the United States by prescription in the near future. The stock was as high as 85 1/2 yesterday and ended closing down 5/8, to 84 3/4.
Shaw Industries rose 1/2, to 30 5/8, after Josie Esquivel, an analyst with Shearson Lehman, upgraded the carpet maker's stock rating based on the weakness of the stock. She said that the fundamentals were there and that she expected the stock to appreciate about 25 percent in the next 12 months.
 
 
International Paper Off
 International Paper, trading near its high for the year, closed down 1/2, to 74 1/2, as John Chrysikopoulos, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, removed the company from the recommended list. International Paper said the analyst had left them with the impression that the adjustment was more a reflection of the industry.
After reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, Cisco Systems stock rose 3 1/2, to 52 1/4. Traders said that Cecilia Brancato, an Oppenheimer analyst, raised her earnings estimate by about 20 cents for the year for the computer-networking systems company.
Amax Gold, in a bid to buy Fairbanks Gold, slipped 1/4 to close at 11 1/8.

Ashland Oil Appoints Successor to President

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Ashland Oil Inc. said yesterday that it had selected Paul W. Chellgren, senior vice president and chief financial officer, to become president and chief operating officer at the end of January.
Mr. Chellgren, who is 48 years old, will succeed Charles J. Luellen, 62, who had previously announced his attention to retire in January. John R. Hall, 58, remains chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Chellgren was nominated to the board of Ashland Oil yesterday. He is currently chairman of Ashland Coal.
He joined Ashland in 1974. His father, W. E. Chellgren, retired as controller of Ashland Oil in 1980 after 33 years with the company. The younger Mr. Chellgren holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Kentucky, an M.B.A. from Harvard and a diploma in developmental economics from Oxford.
Mr. Chellgren becomes second in command at a difficult time for independent refiners like Ashland. Changing environmental rules have created a huge new demand for capital.
In a telephone interview yesterday, he said the Clean Air Act's requirements for reformulated gasoline and low-sulfur diesel fuel were "absorbing all our discretionary capital." This year, he said, Ashland would invest $504 million, of which $280 million would go into petroleum refining and marketing. "Four years ago, that business consumed $88 million," he said.
As a result, he said, some of the company's businesses "just don't have the capital to grow." Among these, he said, are the new Super America convenience stores and quick oil change outlets, as well as the chemical business.
In addition, the company has been hit by dozens of lawsuits from neighbors of its main refinery, and four plaintiffs won a $10.3 million decision in May 1990. Ashland appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which may rule by the end of this year.
Frederick P. Leuffer Jr., an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc. who follows Ashland, said the suit "on the surface looks pretty frivolous."
"But after Texaco-Pennzoil, in this industry we don't call anything frivolous," he added, referring to the Pennzoil Company's successful multibillion-dollar lawsuit challenging Texaco Inc.'s acquisition of the Getty Oil Company in the 1980's.
Still, Mr. Leuffer said, Ashland's stock price reflects investors' belief that Ashland had "a reasonable chance of coming out the victor."
He said Mr. Chellgren "knows the operations and the finances inside and out."
"He's a very very bright, capable man," Mr. Leuffer added.

Chief Operating Officer For Cincinnati Milacron

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Cincinnati Milacron Inc., a leading producer of machine tools, has named Raymond E. Ross president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Ross, who is 55, was previously executive vice president of operations for the company. 
 Milacron said Mr. Ross would essentially perform the same duties, because it previously did not have a chief operating officer. Daniel J. Meyer, chairman and chief executive, had been serving as president, but he relinquished that post with this week's appointment of Mr. Ross.
The Cincinnati-based company, like others in the machine-tool industry, has been suffering in the last year because of a downturn in orders from the automobile industry. But Milicron said that orders were now rebounding and that new orders were coming from a wide range of industries.
Despite those gains, the company lost $104 million on sales of $552 million in the first nine months of this year. That loss included $94 million in one-time charges. In the comparable period last year, the company earned $7.1 million on sales of $587 million.
Mr. Ross came to Milacron in 1968 as a manager in the plastics-forming division and he has held a number of managerial positions, mainly in product development and marketing.
In 1985, he was named general manager of plastics machinery, an area in which the company has looked for future growth. Mr. Ross oversaw the development of injection molding machinery, an important product line for the company.
Milacron has undergone a broad restructuring in recent years, reducing its size as demand from machine tool buyers declined. The company has redesigned products, closed unprofitable operations and reduces its work force.
Still, Mr. Ross said, Milacron "is always looking for ways to cut costs further."
"Our plan is to make money in this economy," he said, "and if it gets better, that will be a real plus. We have to get our costs down."
He added that he hoped to continue to improve the company's exports, which he said had increased in recent quarters.
Before coming to Milacron, Mr. Ross worked at Recto Molded Products Inc. for eight years.
Mr. Ross is a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, where he earned a degree in industrial management. He and his wife, Mary Ann, have three daughters and one son.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Finance Choices on Jobless Bill

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Senate Democrats today proposed legislation extending unemployment benefits that would give President Bush three choices on how to pay for it: declaring a budget emergency and increasing the Federal deficit, curbing foreign aid or raising estimated income tax payments.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, scoffed at the plan as "government by multiple choice." And Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk and the leading House sponsor of the measure, called it a "Chinese menu" approach. 
 The Democratic proposal, introduced by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, would cost $5.4 billion and would provide as many as 20 weeks of benefits for workers out of a job more than half a year.
"We're trying very hard to be accommodating," Mr. Mitchell said. He insisted that the Democrats still preferred that Mr. Bush declare an emergency and pay for the benefits, to about 3 million jobless people, as he refused to do in bills he killed in August and September.

HEADLINE: Jobs and Poverty Increase for Hispanic Americans

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
More Hispanic people are working, more are earning at least $50,000 a year and more are completing high school than eight years ago, but more are also living in poverty, the Federal Census Bureau said today in a new report.
Overall Hispanic buying power, bolstered by a 52 percent increase in the number of Hispanic households, rose 67 percent since 1982, the report said. 
 The figures, adjusted to reflect the effects of inflation, do not reflect the changes in income for Hispanic individuals or families over the same period.
The number of Hispanic families below the poverty line increased to 28.1 percent, up from 26.2 percent a year ago, and more than double the national poverty rate of 13.5 percent.
 
'A Mixed Bag'
 Hispanic Americans, who may be of any race, generally are defined as those who share a Spanish-language heritage and trace their roots to Spanish-speaking countries.
"This is a mixed bag," said Jesus Garcia, a Census Bureau demographer who was a co-author of the report. "It shows some good news and some disturbing news." He said Hispanic women were entering the work force in far greater numbers. About 3.8 million, or 51 percent of Hispanic women over the age of 16, are employed or looking for work. That compares with 2.6 million, or 47 percent of the same group eight years ago.
Estimated unemployment rates for Hispanic women have also gone down in the same period, to 9.2 percent from 16.3 percent, the report said.
But Hispanic men saw less improvement in their work situations. the total percentage of Hispanic men over 16 in the work force decreased slightly, to 78.2 percent from 78.7 percent, which Mr. Garcia described as statistically insignificant. Total unemployement in that fell to 10 percent from 16.6 percent.
Both the 1982 figures and the new 1990 updates, taken from an annual survey of about 150,000 households, reflect periods when the nation's economy was in recession.
"They're in the labor force," said Sonia Perez, an analyst with the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic rights lobbying group in Washington. "They're working. But if you look at the type of jobs, you'll see they are concentrated in low-wage jobs."
The figures reported by Mr. Garcia and his co-author, Patricia Montgomery, bear this out. Nearly 30 percent of all Hispanic men were working in assembly-line jobs or as laborers in industries like construction, while just 19 percent of men in the non-Hispanic population were working in those job categories. Another 17 percent of Hispanic Americans were in the service industry, a category that covers jobs from telephone operators to hotel maids. For non-Hispanics people, the figure was 10 percent.
Other findings of the report included these:
*One-third of Hispanics Americans are single, compared with about one-quarter of non-Hispanics Americans.
*Only about 7 percent of Hispanic Americans are divorced, about 1 percent fewer than the non-Hispanic population.
*The proportion of Hispanic households with incomes of $50,000 or more is now 13 percent, compared with 11 percent eight years ago.
According to the new figures, the educational attainment of Hispanic Americans who are at least 25 years old has increased. About 51.3 percent of them are high school graduates, as against 45.8 percent eight years ago.
But another indicator, the percentage of families headed by single women, is a matter of increasing concern. Nearly one in 4 Hispanic families are headed by single women, as compared with 1 in 6 families in the population as a whole.

HEADLINE: Southern California Agency Eases Stance on Air Quality

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Faced with growing complaints from businesses and politicians that pollution control rules are creating too much of an economic burden, Southern California's air quality authorities say they plan to soften their hard-line approach to enforcing the regulations.
Officials of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which sets air-quality rules for most of Southern California and is extremely influential in setting statewide and national policies, said they do not plan to roll back the strict emissions standards for businesses, automobiles and individuals they have set in recent years. 
 But they said on Wednesday that they would change their approach to putting the regulations in effect in a way that would reduce the costs of compliance for thousands of enterprises, from gasoline stations to oil refineries.
 
Being 'More Flexible'
 "There's been mounting criticism of the agency from the process viewpoint, and we felt that needed to be corrected," James M. Lents, the district's executive officer, said in an interview today. "There's added stress because of the recession. We feel its possible to meet all our cleanup goals but to do it in a more efficient and flexible way."
Environmental groups said they were concerned that the political pressure on the district to ease up on businesses might lead to a more substantive softening of the regulations and a slowing of the region's progress in cleaning up its air, the most polluted in the nation.
"Whether the new system lowers the amount of scrutiny on companies remains to be seen," said Joel Schwartz, a staff scientist with the Coalition for Clean Air, an environment group. "But if the A.Q.M.D. is going to back off, it could have grave consequences for pollution control in the basin."
The changes were developed after the air quality district came under growing pressure from the owners of large and small companies and from local and state politicians. Business owners have complained for the last several years that the air-quality regulators have been overly rigid in their enforcement of the rules but extremely slow in granting permits for businesses to expand their operations or open in new locations.
 
'District Feeling the Heat'
 Business owners and politicians said the result has been added impetus for many companies to join a wave of industry leaving California, taking jobs and economic growth along with them.
"The Air Quality Management District is feeling the heat from Sacramento and from individuals in the private and public sectors because we are being confronted with the adverse effects of the orders the district is issuing," said State Assemblyman Richard Polanco of Los Angeles.
Officials of the air quality district said their approach would be changed in several ways. First, they said, they would speed the process under which companies are granted permits to expand their operations or open new ones. For many small businesses that are minor polluters, the wait will be no more than seven days, the agency said, and for moderate polluters no more than 30 days. Waits for permits have been six months or longer for many small and medium-sized companies. Larger companies that emit more pollutants will still have to go through a lengthy process to get permits.
The officials said they would also shift their regulatory focus from the small and medium-sized businesses that use solvents, paints and other substances and processes that emit pollutants to the manufacturers and distributors of the pollution-causing substances. Rather than directly regulating an automobile body shop, for example, the agency will monitor the sale of auto paint by manufacturers and distributors to insure that the total amount of pollutants does not exceed the limits.

HEADLINE: Letelier Case at Critical Stage as Chile's Top Court Takes Over

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Three months after the Government of President Patricio Aylwin renewed charges that the head of Chile's secret police under Gen. Augusto Pinochet had masterminded the killing in 1976 of a former Chilean diplomat in Washington, the fate of the case rests with the Chilean Supreme Court.
Emotions here are divided and running high as a panel of five members of the court, all appointed by General Pinochet, will decide over the next two weeks whether the evidence against Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda and his deputy, Col. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, is sufficient to charge them with murder and to proceed to a criminal trial. 
 General Contreras, who headed General Pinochet's secret police, the DINA, in the mid-1970's, and Colonel Espinoza were placed under house arrest in September, becoming the most senior officials of the Pinochet Government to be charged with a crime involving human rights violations.
What many are debating here is whether 18 months after General Pinochet gave up power to a democratically elected Government the nation's Supreme Court can be considered independent. Of the 19 members on the court, only one, Adolfo Banados was appointed by President Aylwin. Justice Banados is investigating the case and will argue the Government's side before the five colleagues appointed to conduct the pretrial hearings.
"I think the public pressure and the thoroughness of Banados's investigation, plus his own integrity, will make it hard for them to throw out the case," said a senior aide to President Aylwin this week, reflecting the Government's positive mood.
 
'This Is the Test Case'
 But not everyone is convinced of the outcome.
"People have said that the transition to democracy in Chile is complete, but I am not so sure," said Sergio Baeza, an economist and representative for the International League for Human Rights. "I think this is the test case to see if there is real justice in Chile."
The current stage of the case is critical, many Government officials say, because if the Supreme Court accepts the evidence Justice Banados has accumulated as valid, it will be hard not to convict the two former police officials.
Since Mr. Letelier and a colleague, Ronni K. Moffitt, were killed by a remote-controlled bomb in the Thomas Circle area of Washington on Sept. 21, 1976, the case has played a critical role in relations between Chile and the United States.
A District of Columbia court quickly indicted eight people, including General Contreras and Colonel Espinoza. But attempts to extradite them were thwarted in 1978 by a Chilean military court that had jurisdiction in the case.
Mr. Letelier had been Foreign Minister, Defense Minister and Ambassador to the United States under the Socialist Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens. After Mr. Allende's overthrow, which the United States had secretly encouraged, Mr. Letelier was imprisoned for a year, exiled and stripped of his citizenship.
Michael Townley, an American who confessed to building the bomb that killed Mr. Letelier, has testified that he was working for DINA and has named General Contreras and Colonel Espinoza as the authors of the assassination.
But the Chilean military court did not allow Mr. Townley's testimony as evidence and the case languished until President Aylwin pushed through a change in Chilean law that gives jurisdiction to the civilian courts whenever a case affects Chile's relations with another country.
The two men have denied any involvement and have argued that the case really belongs to the military courts and should be transferred back. The military courts are considered highly favorable to General Pinochet, who continues as Commander in Chief of the army.
Human rights activists say the case represents a symbolic form of retribution for hundreds of families with relatives who disappeared during General Pinochet's rule. The reason is that there is very little chance that they will ever be able to prosecute those responsible for the torture and killing of their relatives, even though they know whom they are. Under a law imposed by General Pinochet as a condition for agreeing to democratic elections, amnesty from prosecution was granted anyone accused of human rights abuses from 1973 through 1978. Those were days of internal war, General Pinochet maintains, and abuses were to be expected.
The one exception was the Letelier killing.
"This case has tremendous symbolism for the U.S. and Chile," said a senior Western diplomat here. "If justice is brought in this case, it represents a kind of justice for all who suffered during those years."
Last March, the Commission on Truth and National Reconciliation issued a report detailing 2,000 cases of deaths and disappearances during the Pinochet years.
Though General Contreras and Colonel Espinoza have been confined to the military hospital in the fashionable Providencia section of Santiago, they are under less than severe conditions, according to lawyers close to the case, living in suites and under constant protection by personal bodyguards. The lawyers say General Pinochet talks to General Contreras by telephone almost every day.
If convicted, the two former police officials could get 15 years to life imprisonment. Mr. Baeza argues that General Contreras should also be stripped of his wealth, which is said to be considerable.

HEADLINE: Wilder Called Factor in G.O.P. Gains in Virginia

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAIRFAX CITY, Va., Nov. 7

 BODY:
When the Virginia General Assembly convenes next January, Republicans will be a major legislative force for the first time since Reconstruction, thanks to the anti-Democratic tide that swept across the state in Tuesday's elections.
But that tide did more than drown the political hopes of Democratic incumbents and challengers spread from suburbs here on the outskirts of Washington to rural mountain hollows in the state's western reaches. 
 As it swept Republicans close to even with Democrats in the Senate and to more modest but nevertheless significant gains in the House, it also inundated some of the hopes of Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and left him politically embarrassed. He was not a candidate for anything on Tuesday, but he is a candidate in next year's Presidential race.
 
Coattails in Question
 To a degree, Tuesday's results were a referendum on the Governor as a Democratic leader, raising questions about his political stature and the length of his political coattails. The results also left him with the prospect of dealing with a Legislature whose newly powerful Republican minority will go out of its way in a Presidential campaign year to make political mischief and strike troublesome deals with dissident Democrats.
Before Tuesday, the Virginia Senate was split 30 to 10 in favor of Democrats. Now it is split only 22 to 18 in favor of Democrats.
In the House, the split before Tuesday was 59 to 40 in favor of Democrats, with one independent. Now the Democrat edge has been reduced to 57 to 41, with one independent and one contest undecided. Further, Republicans contend their gains in the House were greater than the statstics indicate because their candidates had to run in a number of districts that had been stacked in favor of Democrats by recent redistricting.
Asked by reporters whether he had been a drag on the Democratic ticket, Mr. Wilder replied, "I haven't felt it, don't see it."
 
Some Acceptance of Blame
 He said some candidates had run poor campaigns and he accused President Bush of putting voters in an anti-incumbent mood. But in the end he did not totally duck culpability for the Republican gains.
"To the extent that I'm the party head and to the extent that the party suffered setbacks, I accept whatever fault that is in terms of blame," he said.
Mr. Wilder has been campaigning on his record as Virginia's Governor, asserting that, unlike at least half of the other governor's in the country, he balanced his state's budget this year by cutting programs, people and waste, not by imposing new taxes. He boasts that when Virginia, like the rest of the country, was challenged by hard economic times, he met the test with leadership, not deficits.
In the campaigning leading up to Tuesday's election, Republican candidates across the state questioned Mr. Wilder's boast of not raising taxes and concentrated on reminding voters how few services and dollars now flow down from Richmond.
"He was a real easy target," said Steve Haner, the director of the Republican caucus in the General Assembly. "Now we can't wait to have at him when we convene next year. This is going to be fun."
Some Democratic leaders and almost all Republican leaders and political pundits said Mr. Wilder was a definite factor, if only because he was the leading Virginia Democrat. They noted that his approval rating in public opinion polls has been hovering around 30 percent since he began spending roughly one of every three days out on the Presidential campaign trail, the lowest rating in modern times for any Virginia governor. They also pointed out that hardly any Democratic candidate asked his help in the campaign.
One of the bluntest commentaries on whether the Governor contributed to the Democratic defeats came from one of his closest political allies, State Senator Stanley C. Walker, a Norfolk Democrat who did not fall victim to the Republican onslaught.
"I think Wilder played some role in the defeats," he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "And it's been speculated that the party did not do as well as it could because he wasn't putting as much emphasis on state races as he should."

HEADLINE: Duke Expresses Shock at the Lineup Against Him

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Nov. 7

 BODY:
At a candidates' forum today, State Representative David Duke said he was shocked by the number and diversity of the endorsements received by his opponent in the Louisiana governor's race, former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards.
When Mr. Edwards took his turn at the podium, he replied, "David, I, too, have been shocked by some of the endorsements I've been given and I guarantee that if it wasn't for you I would never have gotten them." 
 On paper, Mr. Edwards appears to have amassed advantages that would make him the ready favorite in an ordinary campaign, but, as Mr. Edwards himself acknowledged today, the mere presence of Mr. Duke on the ballot assures that there is nothing ordinary about this race.
For example, a variety of business and political leaders who opposed Mr. Edwards in the past are now backing him. But they have openly expressed doubts about Mr. Edwards and have made it plain their prime motive was fear of what would happen to Louisiana with the election of Mr. Duke, a former grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and a one-time neo-Nazi.
 
Money Is One Advantage
 Mr. Edwards's most tangible advantage is monetary. Campaign finance reports made public today showed that from Sept. 30 to Oct. 27 Mr. Edwards raised more than $1.1 million while the Duke campaign gathered less than $550,000. At the end of the reporting period Mr. Edwards had $468,000 on hand while Mr. Duke had less than $262,000
As a result, Mr. Edwards has been broadcasting television advertisements for a week with no response from Mr. Duke, who has had to rely on two televised debates with Mr. Edwards and appearances on national talk shows to get his message across.
While Mr. Duke's money came mostly as small contributions from nearly 21,000 people, Mr. Edwards had about 1,500 contributors, including 302 who had given $5,000 each, the maximum permitted under Louisiana law.
With nine days remaining until the election, Mr. Edwards has developed a carefully structured campaign that is using many of the standard strategies and tools of contemporary American politics, like wide use of television and public opinion surveys. Mr.Duke, on the other hand, is exploiting the anti-incumbent fever and general hostility toward government that have produced surprises in many recent elections, including some of those earlier this week, but is vague on what programs he would promote and policies he would pursue.
Mr. Duke has made virtually no changes in his appeal to middle-class economic resentments and racial biases in this campaign. He focuses on national issues such as affirmative action programs and the tax burden on salaried workers rather than on matters of specific concern to voters in Louisiana.
 
Trying to Reach Out
 Mr. Edwards, however, has tried to reach out to new constituencies, a strategy that has required him to try to define his position on a variety of specific state policies.
Ever since he and Mr. Duke finished first and second in the Oct. 19 open primary, Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, has made a vigorous appeal to the supporters of the third-place finisher, Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Republican. He has offered to preserve Roemer programs in areas like government ethics, the environment and education and he has promised to rehire specific Roemer administration officials.
Rather than dwell on Mr. Duke's controversial past Mr. Edwards's television commercials attempt to portray a grim picture of what would happen to Louisiana if Mr. Duke should be elected. Against images of padlocks on factory gates and employees that vanish from their workplaces, one commercial states, "Unless Edwin Edwards is elected Governor, Louisiana's shaky economy could collapse."
Another ad proclaims, "This year's election is about unity." In another Mr. Edwards attempts to neutralize his image as a political insider by stating, "I may not be as good a friend to some people as I always was but I am going to be a better Governor than I ever was."
 
Appearance Before Power
 The contrast between the two candidates was clearly evident today when they appeared together before the annual meeting of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, an event that drew many of the most powerful men and women in the state.
Shedding much of the flamboyance and quick wit that used to mark his campaign appearances Mr. Edwards has tried to portray himself as an experienced and statesmanlike leader.
In his presentation to the business association, Mr. Edwards touched on subjects as diverse as vocational education and oil drilling permits as he offered a detailed review of his business and fiscal policies in his three terms in office, noting what things he would change.
On the critical issue of Louisiana's tax structure, which relies on the no-longer-abundant levies on the oil and gas industry, he said he would call a constitutional convention to review the entire subject.
 
Duke's Counterattack
 Mr. Duke, however, argued that that he would produce a better business climate as Governor by repeatedly hammering away at one generalization. "We need less government in Louisiana, not more government," he said. "That is what I am going to work for. That is the real issue."
And he repeatedly referred to Mr. Edwards's 12 years in the Governor's mansion between 1971 and 1987, painting his opponent as a virtual incumbent. "Edwin Edwards has already proved to us that he's against business," he said.
Returning to his favorite theme, he warned: "If we don't begin to solve the problems of the rising welfare underclass in our state, I can guarantee you that your taxes will go up. Your tort problems will increase, the insurance problems will increase and business will suffer."
Mr. Edwards has been endorsed by many top business executives in the tourism and convention industry, and today Mr. Duke's voice rose to an angry pitch as he lambasted those who would cancel meetings and sporting events should he be elected.
"Some liberals right now, people who are opposed to your interests, are trying to put pressure and intimidation on the people of Louisiana to vote against me," he said.
Earlier, Mr. Duke spoke out against what he perceived as another form of outside interference when he responded to harsh criticism from President Bush, who said Wednesday that Mr. Duke was unfit for public office because of past espousal of racist and Nazi beliefs.
"It is really improper and unfair for him to go in and support a very liberal Democrat who would devastate the Republican Party in Louisiana," said Mr. Duke, a registered Republican who has been disavowed by the state and national party organizations.
 
Wide Endorsement for Edwards
 Mr. Edwards has been endorsed by a wide array of business executives, leaders of professional groups, environmentalists and women's organizations that previously backed Mr. Roemer, but it is not an easy marriage. Many of these same people saw themselves as champions of reform against an unethical and outmoded regime when they helped Mr. Roemer unseat Mr. Edwards in 1987.
In his closing remarks Mr. Edwards spoke of "this unique opportunity to put together this coalition of people who heretofore never came together in a campaign."
Recognizing the doubts he has had to overcome he said, "I am here to tell you, I'm not going to blow it."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Away From It All, Bush Savors Rome

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 7

 BODY:
President Bush fairly bounded out of the double glass doors of the American Ambassador's palatial residence, Villa Taverna, today, extending his hand to Prime Minister John Major of Britain and crying, "Hello John!"
As the two posed for cameras, glancing upward and commenting on the clear blue Roman skies for lack of anything else to say in that peculiarly uncomfortable moment known as a photo op, Mr. Bush seemed visibly relieved. 
 After all, here he was in Rome, bonding with a fellow member of the club of world leaders, in which the President considers himself honorary chairman, and not back in Washington, where he had been hearing nothing but criticism of his domestic policies.
Instead of questions about unemployment lines, civil rights, abortion and the business dealings of former members of his staff, reporters here asked about subjects he likes: East-West relations and the future of Europe.
Of course, this is just the sort of jaunt overseas that has drawn Democratic political fire to the peripatetic Mr. Bush, as his opponents try to paint him as being focused on foreign affairs at the expense of American taxpayers.
Although Mr. Bush could hardly have canceled a meeting of the Atlantic alliance in response to domestic political pressure, as he did a visit to East Asia planned for this month, this is the first foreign trip during his Presidency in which the White House seems on the defensive.
It may even be the first time that a President, especially one so popular, has had such a political imbroglio over his constitutional duty to make and discharge foreign policy. Even President Richard M. Nixon managed to get a lift out of a visit to the Soviet Union on the eve of his resignation in 1974.
Mr. Bush's troubles wait for him at home. He is to return on Saturday to a series of fights with Congress and, undoubtedly, renewed criticism of his travels.
But for now at least, American officials said, the President is in good spirits. "He replied to the Democrats before he left, found something to be happy about in Tuesday's election results and now has a couple of days' break from the political hassles," one official said.
 
On the Defense at Dawn
 No wonder Mr. Bush was smiling all day. This trip has all the frills that he loves.
There were meetings to be held with presidents and prime ministers. There was a summit conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to attend. There were speeches on weighty matters to be delivered, and tonight there was a glittering affair of state at the Quirinale Palace at which President Francesco Cossiga was the host. Mr. Cossiga welcomed Mr. Bush with elaborate military honors, including mounted troops with brass helmets and breastplates.
This was a sharp contrast to Wednesday morning. The President had issued an extraordinary summons to reporters to go at dawn to the White House, and he stood in a chill autumn wind on the South Lawn and launched into an intensely defensive statement about his commitment to domestic issues.
His trip to Rome, he explained testily, is "a very important part of the responsibilities of the President working for peace around the world."
His talks with European leaders will "generate a lot of new business opportunities for American farmers particularly, but manufacturers and service industries as well."
The Asian trip that he canceled "does have some very important aspects, particularly the Japanese leg, because it affects jobs for America."
Suddenly, Mr. Bush sounded a lot less like a President with sky-high approval ratings who recently gave America its first big military victory in years and a lot more like a candidate trailing his opponent with only a few days before Election Day.
Indeed, at a meeting of his senior advisers before the news conference, John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, who an official said was the "architect" of Mr. Bush's decision not to go to Asia, wondered aloud how reporters would interpret that choice.
An official said Marlin Fitzwater, the press secretary, offered this analysis, "They'll spin it that we're running scared."
When Mr. Sununu expressed some surprise and asked how anyone could reach that conclusion, the official said Mr. Fitzwater replied, "Because the President of the United States called a news conference at 6:30 A.M., that's why."
 
Sununu in the Spotlight
 For Mr. Sununu, as well as Mr. Bush, this trip must have seemed a welcome break.
Just when he thought he was recovering from the political damage caused by his extensive use of military aircraft for personal travel, Mr. Sununu was rocked by the disclosure that his former personal aide, Edward M. Rogers Jr., had signed a $600,000 contract for the legal representation of Sheik Kamal Adham, a figure in the criminal investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
That left reporters scrutinizing Mr. Sununu again to see if he had any connection to the bank.
In Rome, the former New Hampshire Governor, who generally takes a back seat on foreign affairs, was right up front at the President's side. He was at every photo session with European leaders and took a prominent seat just behind the President's left elbow during the opening session of the NATO summit meeting.
Last year, when the alliance met in Rome in July, Mr. Sununu was nowhere to be seen. But that was before his political difficulties. "Ever since Sununu got in trouble, he's like Velcro at these meetings for photo ops," an American official said.
Still, Mr. Sununu seemed to have some difficulty getting into the diplomatic swing of things.
At one point while photographers recorded the opening session, Mr. Bush pulled a piece of paper out of a stack on the table before him, turned to his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and asked him a question.
Mr. Sununu, who was next to Mr. Scowcroft, tried to hitch his chair closer to join in the discussion. But Mr. Scowcroft by then had snared the document and began reviewing it without seeking Mr. Sununu's counsel.
 
Microphones That Bite
 Mr. Bush often professes his nonchalance about negative news coverage. But just as he avidly studies the public opinion polls that he says he never reads, the President pays close attention to what reporters write or broadcast about him.
Today, at a photo session with Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy before the NATO meeting began, Mr. Bush warned his colleague to beware the television microphones because they can pick up every word you say.
Gesturing at one, which was covered in a fuzzy material to filter stray noises, Mr. Bush told Mr. Andreotti: "These woolly animals give you a very hard time. They've bit me a time or two. I've been bitten by them once or twice."
He paused and added with a grin, "Not on purpose, I'm sure."
Mr. Andreotti looked baffled, leaving reporters watching this scene to wonder what sort of translation he was getting of Mr. Bush's comments.

HEADLINE: Weicker Drops State From Regional Clean-Air Effort

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Setting his state on a course independent of 11 other Northeastern states from Maine to Virginia, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said yesterday that Connecticut would not accept strict new standards on automobile emissions as part of a regional effort to control smog.
The other states have agreed among themselves to use a plan adopted by California that will eventually require cars that run on alternate fuels like natural gas, methanol and electricity. The plan phases in tighter controls on hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide, two chemical ingredients of smog, produced by cars powered by gasoline. 
 "Nobody knows what this technology is about," said Mr. Weicker when asked by reporters in Hartford yesterday morning. "Everybody is saying we want to do something, without knowing what it is they're going to go ahead and do. And it's very very expensive."
 
Support from Car Makers
 There is no legal requirement for the states to act jointly. The issue has been argued mostly among environmentalists and health advocates on one side, and auto and oil companies on the other, with little sign of interest from the general public.
With the rest of the Northeast moving rapidly to adopt the California program, some officials predicted yesterday that Connecticut would be swept along because auto makers would not bother to ship a different version of a car to an island with looser standards in the center of the Northeast market. Car dealers now swap unsold cars among themselves across state lines as they find customers for individual vehicles.
However, at General Motors, Alan R. Weverstad, the manager of emissions compliance, applauded Mr. Weicker's action and said his company would probably ship the cars demanded by the Connecticut market. "The residents of Connecticut will be afforded a better model mix and less cost," he said.
If Connecticut goes its own way, car buyers who want to register a vehicle in that state will have to buy it there. While states in the Northeast generally have not worked through the details, California forbids registration of a car that does not meet its emission standards if it has less than 7,500 miles on the odometer.
Most officials in neighboring states responded in measured terms to Mr. Weicker's decision, stressing that they hoped he would eventually change his mind. Still, they were not reticent about their disappointment, with some of the sharpest reaction coming from Thomas C. Jorling, New York's environment commissioner and a major force behind the multistate agreement.
 
Starting With 1996 Models
 He predicted that someday Connecticut would have to deal with its pollution problems by banning automobile use on some days, and putting controls on lawnmowers and barbecue grills, or making decisions on development that would curb economic growth.
In a telephone interview Mr. Jorling said, "they're willing to enjoy the benefits of increased reductions, but they're unwilling to participate in making reductions for their own citizens and the downwind states."
Even if Connecticut had decided to adopt the California standards for low-emission cars, it would not have made much difference in cutting pollution until well into the next century. The first cars with the equipment will not be available until the 1996 or 1997 model years, and it would take years after that before many of the cars on the road had the new equipment.
Mr. Weicker, who was a maverick Republican in the United States Senate before being elected Governor of Connecticut as an Independent, said he would keep an open mind and might reverse himself with new evidence, but said, "I am not convinced at this time as to the costs and the benefits."
In a statement explaining Connecticut's decision, Timothy R. E. Keeney, the commissioner of environmental protection, said the cost of the equipment would run $470 a car, and "economic models show that when you send that kind of money to Detroit, something has to give at home." The state's economy would contract if cars cost more, he said, and the result would be a loss of 1,300 to 8,000 jobs.
Car manufacturers have said the cost could run $1,000 a vehicle, while California experts say it would probably be under $200.
Connecticut has concluded that adopting California's program would remove pollutants at a cost that might be $15,000 per ton. The other states relied on a joint study that put the cost per ton of less than $3,400.
All pollutants drift across state lines with the wind, but smog -- or, more properly, ozone -- is a particular problem for downwind states. It takes hours for nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, baked by the sun, to produce ozone, which is how rural areas can develop dangerous ozone levels.
In Massachusetts, which is usually downwind, Daniel S. Greenbaum, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said the Massachusetts Governor, William F. Weld, had become a supporter of the program in part because of the pleadings of the Governor of Maine, John R. McKernan Jr. "We shouldn't be polluting Acadia State Park in Maine any more than Connecticut should be polluting Cape Cod," Mr. Greenbaum said.
Yesterday, as Governor Weicker explained his decision to reporters, Rhode Island decided to join the multistate agreement. New York has been leading the call for adoption of the California standards, an option that the states were given by the Federal Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts, the Legislature has voted to adopt the standards. Last week the Governor of Vermont, Howard Dean, endorsed the plan and said he would submit it to that state's legislature. The other two New England states, New Hampshire and Maine, have also agreed, as have New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.
Connecticut has said it will require cleaner gasoline, force gas stations to install equipment to recapture pollutant-laden fumes that are released in refueling, and make inspections stricter, among other steps. But Paul G. Billings, a lobbyist at the American Lung Association said, "they have not done anything more than announce what the law requires them to do."


GRAPHIC: Congress gave California the right to make its own rules to comply with Federal clean air standards. The other 49 states were told thaty they could folow the national program or adopt California's. New Jersey, New York, nine other states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia have agreed to the plan. Connecticut will not go along, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said yesterday.
 
"More and more cars will have to comply" shows percentage of new cars that will have to meet new emissions standards.
 
"Emissions will be sharply reduced" shows output of the chemicals that make smog will be cut in stages. By 1999, most new cars will have to meet new standards for low emissions for the first 50,000 miles. Over the next four years more and more new cars will have to meet stricter standards for ultra-low emissions and for no emissions.

HEADLINE: Maxwell's Gift to Campus in Doubt

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Much as he did at The Daily News, Robert Maxwell swept like a gallant knight last summer into another New York City institution, Polytechnic University.
Mr. Maxwell, a trustee at the university since 1986, was elected chairman in July, then promptly announced that he would donate $10 million to begin a fund-raising campaign. Exuding what the university president called "an aura of a very successful businessman," he gave the sometimes beleaguered campus a sense of renewed confidence. 
 His abrupt death has shaken that confidence, plunging the university into grief and creating considerable uncertainty about its financial future. While Mr. Maxwell had pledged the largest donation in the university's history, he had not yet sent the check.
At the main campus on Jay Street in downtown Brooklyn, stunned students said that in a short time, the flamboyant 68-year-old publisher had endeared himself to students and that his interest had raised morale and built pride in a school that has a relatively small endowment and that nearly closed during a financial crisis in the 1970's.
"With Maxwell, we saw Poly heading in a lot of different directions," said Joseph Mirabile, a senior majoring in electrical engineering. "When we heard about his death, all of these expectations started to disappear."
The university president, Dr. George Bugliarello, said the trustees were to discuss the impact of Mr. Maxwell's death and begin a search for his replacement on the board at their regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday, the same day Mr. Maxwell was to have turned over his $10 million donation to the school.
The gift would have nearly doubled the university's $13.3 million endowment, one of the smallest of any major technical institution in the country. A spokesman in London for Mr. Maxwell's media empire, which includes the Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C., said that the status of the pledge was uncertain and that his family had not made any decisions concerning his estate.
Mr. Maxwell's association with Polytechnic began in the mid-1970's when his publishing house, Pergamon Press, published Technology in Society, a scholarly journal edited by Dr. Bugliarello and a professor at the university, A. George Schillenger.
The university, founded in 1854 and known as Brooklyn Poly or just Poly, granted him an honorary degree in 1985, and a year later he joined the board of trustees. His involvement increased after his triumphant 11th-hour purchase of The Daily News in March.
"He told me he felt that after buying The Daily News, a great commercial enterprise of New York, he felt very strongly he should invest his time and money in making Polytechnic the great technological university for New York," said Joseph J. Jacobs, a university trustee and president of Jacobs Engineering Group in Pasadena, Calif.
Dr. Bugliarello said Mr. Maxwell, who never went to college, had a vision of international cooperation between the university and industry that he immediately put to practice. Though he presided over only the September board meeting, he reorganized the trustees, spearheaded a pay increase for professors and began to shape plans for a $200 million fund-raising drive.
 
'Spirit of Poly'
 After news of his disappearance, then death, spread through the university, a makeshift memorial to Mr. Maxwell -- an easel holding the front page of Wednesday's Daily News -- was set up in the lobby of Rogers Hall, the university's main building on Jay Street.
It was, students and professors said, a reflection of how deeply Mr. Maxwell's presence touched the university, which with 6,000 students lives in the shadow of larger, wealthier technical institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Michael Papa, an electrical engineering student, said part of Mr. Maxwell's appeal was "a scrappy attitude" perfectly in sync with a student body of first- and second-generation immigrants, often the first in their families to go to college.
"He seemed to embody the spirit of Poly," he said.
Shortly after he took over as chairman, Mr. Maxwell held a reception in Rogers Hall, greeting some 300 students who filed through a receiving line -- a gesture described as at once imperial and utterly down to earth.
At the reception, the student president, Manuel Vara, surprised Mr. Maxwell by asking him to sign "a compact" vowing to commit himself, as much as the students, to the university's future.
With his big smile, Mr. Maxwell replied, "And are you Mephisto?"

HEADLINE: For Dinkins's South Africa Trip, A Donor List From Who's Who

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
More than a third of the money that Mayor David N. Dinkins has raised to finance his trip to South Africa next week came in a $50,000 check from the Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie L. Brown, according to a list of contributors released yesterday.
The list is also sprinkled with prominent New Yorkers like Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation; Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the developer, and Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations executive. 
 "I think it is important for the Mayor to go to South Africa," said Mr. Rohatyn, explaining why he contributed. "I think emotionally for him, it's like the first time I went to Jerusalem."
Mr. Brown was in meetings yesterday and could not be reached for comment, but his spokesman, Michael Reese, said Mr. Brown often makes such private donations. Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Rubenstein could not be reached for comment.
City officials released the list as they outlined details of the trip for the first time. The Mayor is scheduled to meet with Nelson Mandela and other leaders of the African National Congress, the main black party in South Africa, but city officials said yesterday that it appears unlikely that the Mayor would meet, as hoped, with the South African President, F. W. de Klerk, or the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the major black party opposing the A.N.C.
 
Meeting Scuttled
 Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said President de Klerk plans to be out of the country during the Mayor's visit. And African National Congress officials scuttled a meeting with Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the leader of Inkatha and Mr. Mandela's main rival among black leaders in the country, Mr. Lynch said.
"Most of the itinerary was negotiated by the A.N.C. and not by us," Mr. Lynch said.
A total of $145,434 was raised for the trip, city officials said, much of it coming from city officials, civic leaders and news organizations that are paying their own travel expenses to accompany the Mayor. The figure is incomplete because many going wrote checks directly to a commercial airline. The organization collecting money for the trip is the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit entity that the Mayor used to raise money for the parade for Persian Gulf veterans.
City officials said the final cost for the trip had yet to be determined. The only money coming from taxpayers will be the cost for more than a dozen bodyguards for the Mayor.
 
Defraying Expenses
 Since most of the 33 city commissioners, clergy members and private citizens in the delegation have been asked to pay their own way, the contributions from Speaker Brown and others not going will, in effect, defray the expenses for about 10 support staff members, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch and the Mayor's wife, Joyce. The Mayor initially said he would not pay for his expenses but later reversed himself and donated $5,000.
The fund-raising became a focus of attention in September when the Mayor was forced to cancel his first plan to charter a plane and take a larger delegation. That trip fell through because Mr. Lynch, overburdened with the racial crisis in Crown Heights, failed to raise the $500,000 the trip would have cost.
The collapse of the trip stung the Mayor personally and was seen by many in the government as a sign of disorganization at the upper levels of his administration. In October, the Mayor announced a scaled-down version of the trip, with the delegation paying its way. He also delivered a stinging speech countering the critics, saying that he hoped his commissioners could lend technical expertise to the African National Congress and forge economic ties between New York and those he believes will run a post-apartheid Government.
None of the contributors do business with the city, Mr. Lynch said. He said the trip organizers had also rejected donations from several companies and corporations doing business in South Africa.

HEADLINE: Tax Cut for Middle Class Urged by Rostenkowski

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the most influential tax writer in Congress, today introduced a tax cut for working-class and middle-income families that would be offset by taxes on the wealthy.
The proposal was immediately endorsed by the House leadership, underscoring the Democratic strategy of promoting the interests of the middle class as the Presidential election season nears. 
 Mr. Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which initiates all Federal tax legislation. As such, he is the Congressional leader on taxes.
The proposal that he offered today, one of several tax-cutting measures that have been advanced by lawmakers in recent weeks, would create an income-tax credit equal to 20 percent of the Social Security and Medicare taxes that a worker paid. The maximum credit would be $200 for a single taxpayer and $400 for a working couple.
 
Would Last Two Years
 About 16 million workers with little or no tax liability would be eligible for smaller credits, but Mr. Rostenkowski's plan focuses on individuals and families with incomes of between $20,000 and $75,000 a year.
The tax cuts would last for two years. They would be paid for over five years by two provisions that Mr. Rostenkowski's legislation would make permanent: a 10 percent surcharge on taxable incomes above $1 million and a new, higher tax bracket, 35 percent, on incomes above $85,000 for individuals and $145,000 for couples.
"This will help middle-income taxpayers who have been neglected over the last decade," Mr. Rostenkowski said at a news conference today."Although it is not a big-money bill, it still does something for the economy."
Like other lawmakers, Mr. Rostenkowski said there was no chance of winning passage of a tax cut before Congress adjourns for the year later this month. Proponents of the various proposals are all aiming for Congressional action early next year.
 
Republicans Cool to Idea
 House Democrats promoted Mr. Rostenkowski's plan as a way of improving the fairness of the Federal tax system while leaving two things untouched: last year's White House-Congressional agreement intended to restrict budget deficits, and the Social Security reserves that will be needed when the baby-boom generation starts retiring early in the next century.
But Republicans gave the proposal a cool reception. Indeed, one Republican supporter of a rival plan, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Taxation, said the Rosentkowski bill had no chance of becoming law. "The President has said he would veto an increase in tax rates, and that veto would be sustained," he said.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, attended Mr. Rostenkowski's news conference and embraced the plan. "As the President grapples and gropes for a real response to a recession that has lasted over a year," Mr. Gephardt said, "Democrats led by the Ways and Means Committee chairman resume our historic role of hearing the problems of the middle class."
On Wednesday, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, proposed a $300 tax credit for each child up to 18 years old and full deductibility, for all wage earners, of up to $2,000 in contributions to individual retirement accounts.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
From Hoboken to Hollywood: A 1960's Idealist Finds a Home in 1990's Television.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
A little more than a year ago, Roger Lowenstein was sitting in his law office in Hoboken, blearily looking out at the Clam Broth House next door. It was 10 o'clock at night. He still had not eaten dinner. Everyone else had long since gone home and he still had loads of work to do. His marriage had disintegrated, in part because of the demands of his work. As courts grew clogged and the practice more complicated, his law work had turned from trying cases to pushing paper. Moreover, his partners grew increasingly rebellious, his clients unappreciative, and, it seemed to him, the profession more cynical.
In short, Mr. Lowenstein was experiencing yet another existential crisis in his 47-year-old lawyerly life, one that came to an end only when a friend, a Hollywood type, called to entice him out with tales of the good life. 
 One day, the story goes, Sherwood Anderson grew so fed up with making paint in Elyria that he packed his bags and began walking to Chicago, where he wrote "Winesburg, Ohio."
Similarly, with that phone call Mr. Lowenstein decided to suspend his practice and follow his muse to Los Angeles, where, through a series of flukes, he became a writer for the television series "L.A. Law."
Alas, Mr. Lowenstein's tenure was brief; after a mere 15 weeks, he and two other newly recruited lawyer-writers were axed. Recession has reached McKenzie Brackman as much as it has real law firms. But Mr. Lowenstein remains so enthralled by the experience that what was supposed to be a sabbatical from the law has become permanent exile.
The course of a career like Mr. Lowenstein's is a blueprint for a whole generation of lawyers. They went to college (in his case, the University of Michigan) and law school (Harvard) during the New Frontier and the Great Society. Infused with idealism, they took low-paying but psychically rewarding jobs in the public sector. (Mr. Lowenstein was New Jersey's first Federal public defender). A few years, children and mortgages later, these lawyers entered more mainstream, remunerative forms of practice.
Cut to that fateful night in June 1990, with Mr. Lowenstein, by now a miserable $200,000-a-year lawyer, peering out his office window. By September, he was on his way to California, half titillated, half terrified. As things turned out, he took to Tinseltown like Gauguin to Tahiti.
His first gig was as a $300-a-week technical adviser to the A.B.C. program "Equal Justice." Soon he was writing scripts for two other shows, "Law and Order" and "The Human Factor." Then, in the spring of 1991, he was one of three real-life lawyers hired to help write episodes of "L.A. Law," a show lawyers either love or love picking apart.
Mr. Lowenstein soon found himself at 20th Century Fox, toiling in the very cubbyholes where Faulkner, Fitzgerald and Pearl S. Buck once worked. He spent his days brainstorming with other writers, hobnobbing with Richard Dysart and other stars of the show, and fielding phone calls from envious lawyers.
In fact, his lawyer friends were far more impressed, he ventured, than if he had he been named to the United States Supreme Court. Some called begging for guest appearances. Once, his father called to complain about the status of Leland McKenzie, the fictitious firm's erstwhile pillar of rectitude, who had taken up with Rosalind Shays, the dragon lady running the place.
"I told him, look, the guy's been a stiff for five years; give him a break, give him a little sex," Mr. Lowenstein recalled. He reports that his father is now a happy man; Shays subsequently fell down an elevator shaft and Mr. Dysart, who portrays MacKenzie, sent him an autographed glossy.
But in August, the bubble burst. With production falling perilously behind schedule, the show cashiered its three lawyer-writers and brought in a senior producer. "I was stunned," Mr. Lowenstein recalled. "I felt like Mike Tyson had just punched me in the stomach." Now, he is back to writing scripts as a free-lancer.
Mr. Lowenstein left behind a pile of plots. Never, now, will Arnie Becker, the show's waspish lawyer, appear before a rabbinical court, or Bennie, its retarded messenger, visit the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library to learn more about Watergate. But far from feeling bitter, Mr. Lowenstein, who says he has earned $80,000 over the last 12 months, feels reborn, partly because he believes he is reaching more people now than he ever did in practice.
"Roger Lowenstein in 1968 would have poo-pooed writing for television because, unlike the law, it wasn't an adequate vehicle for making the world a better place," he said. "But given the growing cynicicm of lawyers and judges, I was simply wrong. Besides, this is fun -- and most lawyers don't have enough fun."

HEADLINE: School That Battles To Save Small Souls

SERIES: Life at the Bottom: Mott Haven, the Bronx -- Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
The main entrance to St. Luke's Elementary School is on East 139th Street. You can't get in that way, though. The doors are locked to guard against the open drug dealing on the block.
Instead, you enter the school from East 138th Street, walking past a litter-strewn lot and through a dim alley screened by razor wire. The passageway, speckled with graffiti, is a dreary exercise in urban blight. But just inside the back door, where a hall monitor in a St. Luke's tie is posted, all traces of the street wondrously disappear. 
 There are paper pumpkins and fish colored by childish hands. There are bake sales and curtains decorated with balloons and plays put on by kindergartners. There are, in short, all the trappings of a snug suburban school nestled in some of the meanest streets of Mott Haven, one of the meanest sections of the South Bronx.
In a neighborhood where most institutions are regarded with mistrust or worse, and where a sense of community is usually no match for the pervasive sense of powerlessness, St. Luke's is a rare place indeed, a small island of hopefulness amid the general despair.
But no school, no matter how fiercely it tries to keep the outside world at bay, can fully insulate its students from their surroundings. So at St. Luke's, education is regarded as a battle for small souls that must be waged anew each day.
Victory, says the Rev. Gerald Ryan of St. Luke's Roman Catholic Church, belongs to the vigilant. The school's mission, he said, "is sowing the seed and watching it, and taking care of it and not giving up on it."
So cheery is St. Luke's compared with the streets outside that on entering, one feels as if one had slipped, Alice in Wonderland-like, into some fictional space. But even the most casual conversation with a St. Luke's student demonstrates the fragility of the glue-and-construction-paper peace that exists inside the school walls.
Marcelina Maldonado is a chatty, outgoing fifth grader with fluffy bangs. Talking about herself, she begins innocently enough. She would like, she says, to be like Kelly, her favorite character in the television series "Beverly Hills 90210." "Kelly has a car," she explains gravely. But after a few minutes on this theme, she abruptly changes the topic.
"A teen-ager, he was my best friend, he passed away," she says. "He was stabbed."
"My mother," she continues, "is wanting to move to Florida, because she's sick and tired of it all. There be shootouts all the time, and so many drug dealers."
The violence and the drug dealing often press up right against St. Luke's gray exterior. Recently, drug dealers began doing business from the schoolyard, setting up lounge chairs underneath the basketball hoops. When St. Luke's principal, Sister Pat Howell, asked them to leave so the children could play outside during lunch, they agreed, then returned as soon as the lunch hour ended. Now there is a policeman stationed by the playground every day at noon.
By the standards of Mott Haven, a neighborhood whose history has been fragmented by successive waves of arson and abandonment, St. Luke's is an unusual example of stability. The school was founded in 1903 and has operated continuously since then.
As the resources of the community have contracted, St. Luke's has tried to make up some of the difference. Evenings, neighborhood teen-agers who do not attend St. Luke's use its gym for basketball. After they leave, the gym becomes an overnight shelter for a dozen homeless men.
But St. Luke's itself is hardly immune from the recessionary pressures that have shrunk funds for schools and social programs across New York City. Last year, the Archdiocese of New York, which oversees the school, cut St. Luke's subsidy in half. The school now has a shortfall of $106,000 out of a total operating budget of $550,000. To save money, it has begun to share some of its staff members, including its gym teacher, with other Catholic schools in the area. It has begun a fund-raising drive among alumni, and has raised its tuition by $10 a year.
Still, no one seems to be quite sure how the shortfall will be met. "To get that amount of money," said Anna Reese, whose daughter, Yaneira, is a fifth grader at St. Luke's, "you have to have a miracle."
Measured against the average family income in the neighborhood, roughly $7,600, St. Luke's tuition -- $900 a year for parishioners, $1,050 for nonparishioners -- is substantial. The fact that the school costs money to attend suggests that its students are more affluent than those who attend the nearby public schools, and their parents more highly motivated.
Yet St. Luke's students, kindergartners through eighth graders, are fairly representative of the neighborhood at large, and of its many troubles. Almost 60 percent of St. Luke's students come from households receiving some form of public assistance. Most come from families headed by single mothers.
Sister Pat, a lanky woman with the kindly unflappable air of someone who has seen, and learned to deal with, just about everything, has worked at the school since 1977. Over the years, she says, she has seen virtually all of the troubles that have afflicted Mott Haven show up in one form or another among students at St. Luke's.
"It's not that they're coming from single-parent homes," she said of the new breed of students, "it's that they're coming from their grandparents. And the younger kids are more violent; they have more learning disabilities."
The violence and drug dealing in the neighborhood have prompted many families to leave Mott Haven, Sister Pat continued, making the school population increasingly transient. "You used to have 95 percent of the kids go K through eight," she said. "Now 50 percent go all the way through."
 
Pent-Up Energy
 Because of the dangers of the neighborhood, many of the children are not allowed to leave their apartments except to come to school, and their pent-up energy is ferocious, Sister Pat said. "At lunchtime, you have to let them just run. For some of these kids, it's the only time they'll get out."
So pervasive is the violence in the neighborhood that students at St. Luke's seem almost to be inured to it; they discuss gruesome murders in the same tone they use to talk about their friends and the games they play.
"When I first moved here I was scared," said Michael Orta, a fifth grader. "I heard Uzi gunshots. They started going real fast, and the police found a magazine. But now I feel used to it. I know who's a drug dealer, and who's not."
Parents of St. Luke's students offer a variety of reasons for sending their children to parochial school, few directly related to the religious training the school provides. They point to the school's security, its discipline and its dress code -- blue plaid skirts for girls, dark pants and ties for boys -- which, they say, eliminates competition among the children for expensive clothes. Most frequently, they point to the generally poor condition of the local public schools.
"If you're poor, you have to get a decent education," Mrs. Reese said.
Based on their reading scores, the public schools in Mott Haven are among the worst in New York City. Public School 65, for example, which is three blocks north of St. Luke's on East 141st Street, ranked 616th out of the city's 633 elementary schools in reading scores. Only 48 percent of P.S. 65's students read above remedial level, while at St. Luke's the figure is 70 percent.
 
Most Finish High School
 Almost all of St. Luke's graduates finish high school, and many go on to college. The school, however, has had its share of tragedies. Three years ago, for example, one of its graduates was killed in a drug deal gone sour. Recently, St. Luke's teachers have spotted another graduate dealing drugs in the neighborhood.
Sonia Andujar is one of St. Luke's success stories, a graduate who went on to college and then returned to teach at the school herself, although she now lives in the safer precincts of the North Bronx, near Pelham Parkway. Ms. Andujar's classroom is a classic scene of kindergarten, with tiny chairs and fuzzy drawings and big block letters lining the walls.
But the stories she hears from her pupils are not the kind one expects to hear from 5-year-olds. "They say 'When I grow up, I don't want to be hanging out, I don't want to be drunk,' " she said. "They want to grow up to be somebody."
"Everybody," she said, "says ugh, the South Bronx. But I think that the people here are worth something. They're not all bad."

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
The lure of the bargain is the main attraction in the print market this fall. From the size of the crowds recently at both Sotheby's and Christie's in New York and the traffic at last weekend's Print Fair at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, it appeared that business was booming.
But while the market is showing definite signs of recovery from its spring slump, the enthusiasm may have been greater than the money spent. "People are still holding back," said Christopher Drake, who runs the print department of Agnew's in London. But David P. Tunick, a Manhattan dealer, reports renewed interest in prints. "Old clients are coming back to us saying, 'Tempt me,' " he said. "There's a pent-up yearning to buy." 
 But only if the price is right. As the recent New York auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's showed, sales depended largely on what bidders thought of the auction houses' estimates.
At Sotheby's two days of print auctions last Friday and Saturday, sales totaled $5,280,155. Seventy-one percent of the 788 lots found buyers. These figures are slightly better than May's sales but well below last November's $12.5 million total for a comparable two-day period. For the most part, prices last weekend hovered around the low estimates. "Last spring people just sat on their hands waiting to see if we've hit bottom," said Susan Pinsky, who heads Sotheby's print department. "It appears we have. Bidding was active because people have begun to realize this is a good time to buy."
Christie's auctions, held Monday and Tuesday, brought in less money than Sotheby's -- sales totaled $2,568,247 -- but Christie's offered fewer prints. Of the 356 lots on the block, 73 percent sold. A year ago, Christie's print sales totals were nearly three times as much, $6,833,640, for a comparable period. But these recent figures were slightly better than the $2,456,872 total in May, and the number of lots sold rose from May's 65.6 percent
Since the 15th century, when woodcuts of devotional images were sold, prints have always attracted a broad spectrum of collectors. Today rare prints can cost upward of $1 million, but they can also be found for as little as $50. In fact, for years prints have been to the art world what the Gap is to retailing -- accessible and stylish.
But when the art market went wild in the late 1980's, the Japanese began to buy prints with a fervor. Treating them as though they were works of fine art, Japanese buyers spent huge sums, especially on artists like Chagall, Miro and Dubuffet. Prices at auction set records. "The Japanese were the spark plug and we had the gas," recalled Brooke Alexander, whose SoHo gallery specializes in contemporary prints. "To stay in business we had to play the game."
The Japanese weren't the only force driving up the market. Mr. Tunick recalled that in the late 80's, when painting prices were going through the roof, many serious collectors began to buy prints and drawings instead of what they considered overpriced fine art. Mr. Tunick also saw museums buying prints then too, spending well into six figures.
But Richard Solomon, who heads the contemporary print department at Pace Prints, a Manhattan gallery, said the party ended in the spring. "Newton proved right. Gravity does exist. Both the Japanese and the auction houses had driven us to hysteria. When the whole art world felt the hot flash of demand, they stopped paying attention to reality. Now we're trying to get back on track to what was traditionally a smaller, sounder market." As business has slowed, prices have returned to what dealers say are 1986-87 levels, an exact mirror of the Impressionist, modern and contemporary markets.
Still, there appears to be a renewed enthusiasm. At the Print Fair's opening, a free invitation-only viewing, attendance was about 2,800, a record for an armory art opening. Moreover, this was the first Print Fair, which is sponsored by the International Fine Print Dealers Association. At the print auctions, both Sotheby's and Christie's had standing-room-only crowds. And last week alone, Mr. Tunick said, more than $2 million worth of prints were either bought or reserved at his Manhattan gallery.
Speaking of Sotheby's sale last week, Ms. Pinsky said, "When prints didn't sell, it was because the estimates were still too high." But at both the auctions and at the Print Fair, popular and rare prints commanded high prices.
For example, Agnew's sold a Matisse "Jazz" to a German museum for $350,000 at the Print Fair.
At Sotheby's, Edvard Munch's "Young Girls on the Bridge" was sold for $187,000 to Lionel Epstein, a Washington collector who was reportedly acting as an agent for another collector. The print had been estimated to sell for $100,000 to $150,000.
Also fetching top dollar at Sotheby's was David Hockney's "Image of Celia." The print was estimated to sell for $130,000 to $150,000 but the $110,000 it brought was considered a high price in the trade. So was the figure for Mary Cassatt's "Gathering Fruit," which fetched $104,500, just above Sotheby's estimate of $80,000 to $100,000.
Both auction houses were selling Manet's "Courses." Sotheby's version sold for $57,750, just below its low estimate of $60,000. That was a conservative figure compared with Christie's estimate of $180,000 to $220,000 for its print, which did not sell. "Ours was in considerably better condition," explained Elisabeth Hahn, who heads Christie's print department. "But I'm not sure even if we had put a lower estimate on it if it would have sold. Having the same print for sale at both auction houses is hard, even though it was a print that hadn't been on the market for 12 years."
Figuring out realistic estimates for prints can be tricky because the print market has several mini-markets, each with its own collectors and its own price levels. Old Masters, for example, have barely been affected by the market fluctuations. "That's because it takes courage to buy top Old Master prints," Mr. Tunick said. "They're not flashy enough to appeal to speculators."
Other print markets include American prints up to 1950, mid to late 19th- and 20th-century prints and contemporary prints. Right now American prints by such artists as Hopper, Whistler and Cassatt are all doing well. It is those artists who were purely driven by the Japanese bidders who have fared the worst.
Contemporary prints have also lost much of their value since prices soared three years ago. "When the market for paintings took a nose dive so did we," Mr. Alexander said. This was the part of the print market that saw the greatest inflation during the boom years. Now prints by artists like Jasper Johns are worth only about half what they were three years ago. For example: At Sotheby's last week, Mr. Johns's "Periscope I," estimated to bring $20,000 to $25,000, sold for $22,000. The same print sold for $53,000 exactly three years ago. "But our estimate then was only about $22,000, which shows we're back to a realistic, steady market again," Ms. Pinsky explained.
And back to an active contemporary-print market as well -- one that startled experts at both auction houses. The large number of dealers bidding in the recent print sales was a surprise, too. At Christie's, for example, 8 of the top 10 lots were bought by dealers.
Gem Hom, a Manhattan dealer who specializes in 19th- and 20th-century prints, said he and his colleagues were buying wherever they could find good material. "The time is right," he said. "It's really a buyers' market. And I'm sure next year prices won't be any cheaper."

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel

 BODY:

Sondheim at Carnegie Hall
Although there's no official announcement yet, the show everyone will want to see next spring (April 22, to be exact) won't be on Broadway, but at Carnegie Hall. A tribute to Stephen Sondheim is in the very early planning stages, with Ken Marsolais producing the gala as a benefit for the hall. 
 Mr. Marsolais says it would be premature to comment, but another executive involved in the production says that Scott Ellis and Susan Stroman (the director and choreographer, respectively, of "And the World Goes 'Round," the John Kander and Fred Ebb revue Off Broadway) will do the same for this show, and Paul Gemignani will conduct. Patti LuPone and Dorothy Loudon have both signed on, the executive says; Angela Lansbury has been asked to be mistress of ceremonies, and Victor Garber, Bernadette Peters, Mandy Patinkin and Madonna (remember "Dick Tracy"?) have also been asked to participate.
 
Carry a Big Tote Bag
 It's the height of shopping season on Broadway, and producers are looking for that special something: a theater for the spring. Two shows now making the rounds are "A Small Family Business," the American premiere of the Alan Ayckbourn comedy to be directed by Lynne Meadow for Manhattan Theater Club, and Mike Nichols's production of "Death and the Maiden."
Ms. Meadow is in the enviable position of searching for space, since "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" continues to thrive at City Center. Because the Ayckbourn play, about an honest man who takes over his family business, requires a two-level set, Ms. Meadow has looked at a variety of Shubert theaters. Although no contracts have been signed, Brian Murray will probably play the lead, she says. Ms. Meadow also says an Off Broadway theater is possible, which would lower production costs.
"Death and the Maiden," by the Chilean playwright Ariel Dorfman, is about a woman who has been tortured and plots her revenge. With the stars Mr. Nichols wants for the three-character play, he'll need a lot of seats. One executive involved in the negotiation says that the lead will probably go to Juliet Stevenson, the English actress currently playing the role in Lindsay Posner's production at the Royal Court Theater in London; that Gene Hackman plans to fly to London next week to see the show, and that Richard Dreyfuss has been approached for the third role.
 
End of 'The Good Times'
 "The Good Times Are Killing Me," the play by Lynda Barry about a young girl growing up in a racially mixed neighborhood in the early 1960's, will close at the Minetta Lane Theater on Nov. 24, and no one involved is exactly sure why.
When it opened in April at the Second Stage, the show received mostly positive reviews and extended its run there through June. It moved to the Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village for an Aug. 8 opening, with David Mirvish and the Second Stage producing. Business was strong until the Jewish holy days, a customary lull for most shows, says Robyn Goodman, the co-artistic director of the Second Stage. But it never bounced back.
"I wonder if it was because the show is about two girls," Ms. Goodman says. "Programmers have found with television that girls will cross over as an audience for stories about boys, but boys won't cross over if the story is about girls."
Maybe. But one executive close to the show who spoke on condition of anonymity questions its marketing strategy. "The producers and the advertising agency tried to go after too many audiences instead of focusing on one," the executive says. "The show could be sold to kids, baby boomers, blacks, or a downtown audience, since Lynda Barry's cartoons in The Village Voice have such a big following. But instead of focusing on one group, they tried all of them and never got enough of any."
Ms. Goodman replies: "Marketing is such an easy thing to throw a potshot at. We definitely went after family audiences, but at some point you just have to let a show get its own legs."
Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which is an investor in "Good Times," says the real reason for its early demise is a combination of the recession and a change in theatergoing patterns. "It seems that unless a play has some twist to get people out of the house, like 'M. Butterfly,' they're not going anymore. We're losing the people who go to the theater as part of their regular routine. When money is tight, a ticket to a play is the first leisure item to go."
Ms. Goodman says a national tour of "Good Times" is planned.
 
Congratulating a Playwright
 So far, there hasn't been terribly much to celebrate in the theater this season, so the talk of the week is the lavish fete given Tuesday night for the playwright Harry Kondoleon on the publication of "Self Torture and Strenuous Exercise: The Selected Plays of Harry Kondoleon" by Theater Communications Group. Stephen Graham, chairman of the board of the New York Theater Workshop, gave the party with his wife, Cathy, in their town house, and it outshone many a Broadway opening night.
The guest list was a theatrical who's who: the playwrights Wendy Wasserstein, Paul Rudnick, David Henry Hwang, Jay Presson Allen and Charles Busch; the composer William Finn; Robyn Goodman and Carole Rothman, co-artistic directors of Second Stage; Lynne Meadow, artistic director of Manhattan Theater Club, and Andre Bishop, artistic director of Playwrights Horizons.
A reading of Mr. Kondoleon's new play, "Half Off," will be held for an invited audience on Nov. 18 at Playwrights Horizons. It is about a husband and wife who are killed in a car crash, and what happens when their respective sisters must decide the future of the couple's children. (Mr. Kondoleon calls the play a comedy.) Elizabeth Wilson, Jane Cronin and Mitchell Lichtenstein will be in the cast.
 
A Hirschfeld Book-Signing
 He's older than Methuselah and younger than springtime, and if your name is Nina, he's your kind of guy. Al Hirschfeld's new book, "Hirschfeld: Art and Recollections From Eight Decades," is just out from Charles Scribner's Sons, and the artist will sign copies at the Margo Feiden Galleries, 699 Madison Avenue, at 62d Street, Manhattan, today through Monday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. The theater drawings range from Mr. Hirschfeld's first, of the French playwright and actor Sacha Guitry, which appeared in The New York Herald Tribune in 1926, to "Miss Saigon," which ran in The New York Times last spring.

HEADLINE: HEEDING ELECTIONS, LAWMAKERS OFFER HEALTH-CARE IDEAS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Congress reacted quickly today to Tuesday's election results, with Senate Republicans contending that the White House was moving too slowly to develop a health-care program and Democrats and Republicans alike objecting to a plan to divert $1 billion from the Pentagon budget to aid the Soviet Union.
Nineteen Republicans, including Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, offered comprehensive legislation to provide basic medical care to most of the 34 million Americans who lack health insurance. As for the Soviet aid plan, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said that the $1 billion would be better spent helping poor people in the United States than providing food, medicine and other "humanitarian assistance" to the Soviet Union. 
 "Several months ago, I predicted that health care would be the No. 1 issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign," Mr. Dole said, "and judging by the intensifying focus on health care, it looks like my prediction is coming true."
 
Who Would Pay?
 Both Republicans and Democrats would try to create incentives for people to buy private insurance. But one Democratic idea would go so far as to virtually eliminate the private health insurance industry, supplanting it with public insurance.
The Republicans estimated the cost of their proposal at $150 billion over five years but did not say how they would pay for it -- a significant omission that was all the more striking because many of the sponsors consider themselves fiscal conservatives.
The Republicans emphasized that they had been working on their health-care proposal since July 1990, but they cited the stunning upset in the Senate election in Pennsylvania as evidence that voters wanted action. Senator Harris Wofford, the Democratic candidate who called for expanding health-care coverage, trounced former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who once was Governor of Pennsylvania, by a 55-to-45 ratio.
 
'Significant Action' Predicted
 "The Pennsylvania elections indicated clearly that the American people want the health-care issues addressed," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He predicted that Congress would take "significant action" before adjourning next year.
Mr. Bush acknowledged the potency of such political concerns earlier this week, when he called off plans for a two-week tour of the Far East, under growing pressure to combat the recession and pay more attention to domestic problems. Mr. Bush said the White House was working on health-care proposals, but there was no sign of urgency about the issue among his aides before Mr. Bush departed Wednesday morning for a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Rome.
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, chief sponsor of the Republican bill, said he and his Senate colleagues were not waiting for the White House. "I don't know who gives marching orders or who marches to the orders, because clearly we don't," he said.
Mr. Chafee said the Republican plan would help control health costs while offering some health insurance to "nearly everybody" who now lacks it.
 
Tax Credits Proposed
 The Republican bill would create new tax credits and tax deductions to help individuals, families and small businesses buy health insurance and pay medical expenses, especially for preventive care. It would more than double Federal spending for community health centers, to $1.3 billion a year in 1996. It would limit damages for "pain and suffering" in medical malpractice lawsuits, a step some say would lower overall medical costs, and it would establish a new public program to finance health care for low-income people ineligible for Medicaid.
Under the bill, the Federal Government would, for the first time, regulate private insurance premiums to make sure that coverage is affordable and available to small businesses, many of which are now priced out of the market. This proposal is anathema to many insurance companies but appears to have an excellent chance of becoming law because it is favored by two powerful Democrats, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
The Republican bill would also encourage use of health-maintenance organizations and other "managed care," in which people get a discount for using certain doctors and hospitals.
More than 60 House Democrats support a bill calling for a Canadian-style system offering universal access to health care through a single publicly administered program. Many Senate Democrats would require employers either to provide health insurance for their workers or to pay a special tax to finance a new public health-care program for the uninsured.
 
Second Look at Aid
 A bipartisan storm of criticism erupted in Congress today over the proposal to shift $1 billion from the Pentagon budget to provide economic and humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union. The proposal had already been approved by House and Senate negotiators, but lawmakers said today that if the Pentagon could spare the money, it should be spent on domestic problems.
"At a time when our own country is feeling the worst economic times in decades, and where one out of 10 people is on food stamps, it's going to be extremely difficult to suggest to the American people that we have resources available to provide $1 billion to the Soviet Union," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
Conservative Republicans said they would rather spend the money on poor people in America than on poor people in the Soviet Union.
 
Alternative to Canada
 Senate Republicans portrayed their health-care package as an alternative to Democratic demands for a publicly financed program of national health insurance modeled after Canada's.
Republicans said their bill differed from the leading Democratic proposals in several ways: It seeks to create incentives for more people to buy private health insurance, but it would not impose new Federal mandates on employers, nor would it establish a nationwide publicly financed program of health insurance.
Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, a co-sponsor of the Republican bill, said the liberal Democrats' proposals were "a health-care fantasyland run by a bigger and bigger Government."
Administration officials, especially John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, have indicated that President Bush would prefer to put off legislative action on health care till after the 1992 elections. But Senator Bond said Mr. Sununu "is not driving our bus."
Senator Chafee said that 34 of the 43 Republican Senators had been serving on a panel that investigated the costs of health care and the problems of the uninsured.
 
'This Is Serious Business'
 Asked if the Pennsylvania election results were a warning to politicians, Mr. Chafee said: "We didn't need any warning shot. We've been preaching this for a long time, that this is serious business. And Republicans better get with it."
In a response typical of Democrats today, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said, "Our Republican colleagues in the Senate have placed themselves miles ahead of the Bush White House, but they are still light-years behind the American people."
John M. Gibbons, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, welcomed the Republican senators' proposal without endorsing its details. "It's a serious effort, and we commend Senator Chafee," he said.
Mr. Gibbons said the Administration supports efforts to make health insurance more available to small businesses, to encourage health maintenance organizations and to curb excessive awards in malpractice suits.
Eddie Mahe, a political consultant who has advised dozens of Republican candidates, said the Pennsylvania results meant that "President Bush must now put forth some kind of health-care initiative next year."
"This Democratic Congress fully intends to move such legislation, assuming the Democrats can reach enough consensus in their own ranks to do so," Mr. Mahe said. "If the President is once again in a reactive position, that would not serve him well."
In the 1988 campaign, the Democratic candidate for President, Michael S. Dukakis, supported a proposal that would have required employers to provide health insurance for their employees or to finance such coverage through a surcharge on payroll taxes.
The co-sponsors of Senator Chafee's bill, besides Mr. Bond, Mr. Dole and Mr. McCain, were Senators William S. Cohen of Maine, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, John C. Danforth of Missouri, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, Slade Gorton of Washington, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, Connie Mack of Florida, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and John W. Warner of Virginia.
The proposal to aid the Soviet Union was devised by the chairmen of the Armed Services Committees, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, both Democrats. It is intended to increase American security by reducing the chance of turmoil in the Soviet Union.
Under the proposal, President Bush could use up to $1 billion of Pentagon money to transport and distribute surplus food, medicine and other "emergency humanitarian aid" to the Soviet Union.
Senate and House supporters of the proposal predicted last week that it would win quick approval. But today it encountered criticism on both political and procedural grounds. Some lawmakers said it violated the 1990 budget agreement and infringed on the prerogatives of the Congressional committees normally responsible for foreign aid.
Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said the use of Pentagon money for Soviet aid would set "a dangerous precedent opening the door to using defense accounts" for nonmilitary purposes.

The Land of the Fee? Not Yet, Fans

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
A plan to televise the Nov. 16 Notre Dame-Penn State game on a pay-per-view basis was scuttled yesterday when ABC Sports, the College Football Association and SET Pay-Per-View agreed that one week was inadequate time to market the contest to potential buyers.
"It's not going to get done," said Mark Mandel, a spokesman for ABC Sports. An executive of SET, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said: "It was a wise decision not to pursue it until we can do it right. We were getting real tight on the time frame." 
 SET has produced pay-per-view events on short notice before, but the Notre Dame-Penn State game would have set a standard for quick turnarounds. Most pay-per-view offerings require more than a month to create promotion geared to raise consumer awareness and provide marketing support to cable-system operators, who sell such events directly to their subscribers.
"It was a quick time frame that proved impossible to do," said Richard Rosenthal, the Notre Dame athletic director.
Said Mandel: "We were considering it an experiment. We were hoping that it would come through."
The prospect of Notre Dame-Penn State on pay-per-view was raised a week ago in talks between ABC and SET because it is one of three regional games on ABC that day, available to only half the country, including New York.
The remaining homes denied the game on their ABC stations would have been eligible to receive the pay-per-view feed for about $10, provided they have access to pay-per-view. Earlier that day, ABC's nationally broadcast game will be Miami at Florida State, which could determine the country's No. 1 team.
Before the breakdown of the proposal, Scott Kurnit, the president of SET, said he saw great potential in major college games on pay-per-view. "We're talking a terrific new programmer in ABC and the C.F.A.," he said.
The Fiesta Bowl's decision on Wednesday to raise its payout to teams to $3 million apiece if the top-ranked team goes to the game increases its allure to two potential No. 1 teams: Florida State and Miami. One or the other may be asked to settle the national championship in Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. Either team's likely opponent would be Notre Dame.
The Fiesta payout, enhanced by about $1 million, is likely to be raised with private funds, sponsorships and higher advertising rates for commercial spots that the Fiesta Bowl can sell on its own. "But it's not NBC money," said Kenneth Schanzer, executive vice president of NBC Sports.
The Fiesta will compete directly with ABC's Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Although the Fiesta's 4:30 P.M. starting time on Jan. 1 is a high-viewing time on the holiday, the competition from Pasadena could blunt the ratings for the Fiesta confrontation.
Would NBC shift the game to prime time on another night, as it did with the 1987 Penn State-Miami game, which earned a whopping 25.1 rating? Not likely. "It'll get its audience on New Year's Day," said Schanzer.
NBC doesn't have many options. It airs the Orange Bowl at 8 P.M. on Jan. 1. And NBC would not want to preempt its strong Thursday prime-time programming the next night. Although the best prime-time slot might be that Friday, N.C.A.A. rules prohibit shifting a bowl game beyond Jan. 2.
Another round of musical bowl chairs could take place if the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami wins a long-shot bid by snaring Florida State or Miami. Could the Blockbuster, which paired Florida State and Penn State in 1990, lure the Seminoles back? Would Notre Dame follow? Would CBS shift it from Dec. 28 to a prime-time slot -- one as prime as Jan. 2 against NBC's powerful Thursday night lineup?
"We believe Florida State or Miami would come if the money was significant," said Ken Haines, executive vice president of Raycom Sports, which owns the Blockbuster Bowl, whose payout would be $3 million per team for a national championship game. Would Wayne Huizenga, the chairman of Blockbuster Entertainment, sugar daddy of the bowl and owner of the new Florida Marlins baseball team, sweeten the payout pot? Said Haines: "He could, but I don't know if he would."
After tomorrow's Tennessee-Notre Dame game on NBC comes "Jockspots" at 5 P.M., which explores the longtime lucrative bond between athletes and Madison Avenue. The show reprises old commercials, from Casey Stengel hawking Tabby Cat Food to Mean Joe Greene's classic Coca-Cola spot and examines how companies like Nike, Nuprin, Coca-Cola, Hanes and Upper Deck currently use athletes in their advertising.
If you experience any difficulty separating the program from the commercials, the effect is intentional. The advertisers include Hanes, Nuprin, Upper Deck and Coca-Cola, making "Jockspots" a perfect vehicle for the troubled network economy: cheap to produce and irresistible to sponsors.
The show was spearheaded by Jon Miller, NBC Sports' vice president of programming, and a former salesman for the division. Miller is in charge of NBC's efforts to create inexpensive sports programs that require no rights fees. No cash was paid to acquire the rights to the ads in the show or to the athletes on view.

How to Succeed in Hipness by Really Trying

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
"Strictly Business" is an utterly joyless romantic comedy about young upwardly mobile blacks who make it big by adapting themselves to the worst values of the white establishment.
Specifically, it's about Waymon Tisdale 3d (Joseph C. Phillips), a Sidney Poitier look-alike and a hotshot member of a big midtown Manhattan real estate brokerage. Waymon wears Brooks Brothers suits and is engaged to the beautiful, equally ambitious Diedre (Anne Marie Johnson) who, though black, affects the speech of the lockjawed white upper-middle class. 
 Waymon's life and career threaten to go out the window when he falls in love with Natalie (Halle Berry), a pretty black promoter of fashionable downtown discos. She finds Waymon hilariously square until he enlists the aid of Bobby (Tommy Davidson), a young man in the mail room. Bobby offers to teach Waymon how to be black and hip if Waymon recommends him for the office trainee program.
"Strictly Business," directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Pam Gibson and Nelson George, is a junk bond of a movie that plays as if it had been made during the economic delirium of the Reagan era. Bobby's way of helping Waymon to find his black roots is to supervise his purchase of a flashy new wardrobe. Nothing else.
This is conciousness-raising of a sort that Armani and even Brooks Brothers might applaud. The film has the satiric edge of a damp croissant. Its characters simply want their share of a boom that no longer exists. Instead of being funny, the movie is seriously depressing.
"Strictly Business" is noteworthy only for what its cast members have done elsewhere. Ms. Berry will be remembered as the foul-mouthed junkie in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever." Mr. Davidson is a recruit from television's "In Living Color" and Mr. Phillips comes to the big screen from "The Cosby Show."
Sam Jackson, who plays a small role as the head of the office mail room, won a special award at the Cannes International Film Festival this year for his brutally fine performance as Wesley Snipes's crack-addicted brother in "Jungle Fever."
"Strictly Business," which has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned), has vulgar language and scenes of simulated sex.

HEADLINE: Ringing: The Health Care Alarm

 BODY:
Harris Wofford's striking upset victory over Dick Thornburgh in Pennsylvania's Senate race makes health care reform Topic A on the domestic agenda. Mr. Wofford's rousing declaration that "working people should have the right to a doctor when they are sick" contributed mightily to his triumph.
That said, his call for national health insurance doesn't advance debate very far. Everyone in Congress agrees there should be universal, affordable coverage for medical catastrophe. The practical question is how. 
 Many in Congress advocate Canada's "single-payer" plan. Under this system, Americans would continue to pick their doctor, but the Government would set fees and pay the bills. The vaunted Canadian system, however, isn't working as well as proponents claim. Costs are off the charts compared with Western Europe and have risen only a fraction less than in the U.S.
Indeed, much of Canada's cost advantage over the U.S. is due to differences in demographics, not health care delivery. Critics of the Canadian system charge that it freeloads off U.S. technological innovation and that the rationing it imposes means that, for instance, women must wait months for a simple pap smear.
Another popular proposal in Congress is unfettered competition. Individuals would buy coverage from private insurers, with the help of tax credits. The idea is to control costs by forcing medical providers to compete. But most individuals buy medical care out of ignorance and under duress; operating on their own, patients put ineffective brakes on providers.
The best answer is managed competition. Individuals would be assigned to large groups, probably at work. Unemployed or otherwise uninsured individuals would be assigned to public groups.
Members of each group would be represented by a sponsor who would negotiate coverage with medical providers. The system would be competitive, inducing providers to offer quality care at attractive costs. Yet the system would also be managed, because sponsors would have the leverage, for example, to prevent insurers from discriminating against the chronically ill. That way workers would no longer be afraid to change jobs for fear of losing their insurance.
The chief objection to managed competition is that it denies members a free choice of doctors. That's true, but there is no imaginable way to have everything: free choice of doctor, unrationed access and affordable prices. Mr. Wofford is right to call for national health insurance; his election shows how much the public cares. But now, Congress must decide which kind. Managed care isn't perfect, but it's the best answer proposed so far.

HEADLINE: Get Pentagon Out of Civilian Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a computer scientist, I find "Pentagon Wizards of Technology Eye Wider Civilian Role" (Science Times, Oct. 22) disturbing. You distort the content of a longstanding debate in the scientific community, discussed in a 1987 book of which I was co-editor, "Computers in Battle: Will They Work?" 
 Some 70 percent of all academic research in computer science is financed by Department of Defense agencies, one of the highest percentages in the sciences. But this research investment is of dubious commercial benefit. The bulk of military research financing goes toward narrowly defined topics, which result in limited production, despite some support of basic research.
Moreover, the military deliberately restricts the free flow of scientific information, through security classifications and publication restrictions. Billions of dollars of "black" weapons programs are completely concealed from the public.
Most misleading, you take the statements of former and present leaders of Defense Department-financed institutions at face value, when they claim significant benefits to the civilian economy as spinoffs of military directed research.
A strong argument can be made that civilian funded and directed efforts, such as those of the National Science Foundation, if evaluated in spinoffs per dollar invested, are a better investment. In fact, military technology has benefited much more from developments in the commercial sector than the reverse. This is particularly true in microelectronics.
Congress will shortly be debating proposals for a National Public Network facility, and is just starting to fund the National Research and Education Network. It is important to remove the Defense Department as sponsoring agency.

HEADLINE: Exports Would Help New York Area

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "New York City's First Hurdle: Defeatism" (editorial, Oct. 13), you are too pessimistic about the economic growth possibilities for the three-state New York, New Jersey, Connecticut region. 
 Two promising areas for stimulating regional economic growth are export expansion and foreign tourism. An unusual opportunity exists for strong leadership and regional cooperation because most foreign countries are not in recession, and the dollar is still "cheap" against other major currencies.
The United States has become a low cost manufacturer, and although our exports have been expanding, too few American companies are taking advantage of attractive export opportunities. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, two-thirds of its 13,500 members have neither exported nor manufactured abroad.
A principal reason for this export myopia as well as for the failure to develop the kind of export orientation that is second nature in virtually all other countries is that the huge United States domestic market has enabled companies to become successful without a need to export.
It is encouraging that officials from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York City have taken steps to cooperate in attracting new industries to the region. A similar cooperative and expanded effort to stimulate exports could be even more promising. The big advantage of export promotion is that the companies to be assisted are already in the region.
In 1990, exports through the New York Customs District totaled $51 billion. A modest 5 percent annual increase in exports would result in $2.5 billion in export revenue and create, it is estimated, 50,000 new jobs. The implications of even such a small increase for state and local finances, including tax revenues, decreased welfare and unemployment payments, are tremendous.
As for foreign tourism, it may be enough to suggest that bringing together government officials and representatives of companies that benefit from tourism could result in identifying promising action programs.
The region has opportunities for expanded exports and increased foreign tourism. The question is whether or not the government officials of the region can rise to the leadership challenge.

Murder, Rape, Mayhem: It Must Be Sweeps Time

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Last Sunday, made-for-television movies featured a doctor who finds on her operating table the man who had raped her weeks earlier (CBS's "Rape of Dr. Willis") and a woman being imprisoned for a crime she did not commit and then being raped by a gang of female inmates (ABC's "False Arrest"). This Sunday at 9 P.M. -- are you ready? -- you can have a mother who fails to stop one bullying son from driving her other son to murder (CBS's "My Son Johnny") or one whale of a woman whose credentials are ticked off in the title (ABC's "Wife, Mother, Murderer").
 Obviously, gentle reader, we are in another television sweeps period, during which ratings are crucial in the pricing of network commercials for an entire business quarter. Industry researchers, those indefatigable souls who are generally proved wrong some 90 percent of the time, have evidently determined that women like to watch other women get into trouble and then, even if putting a considerable strain on credulity, get out. And so another dumb formula is born, usually carrying the fuzzy label of "inspired by an actual event." 
Why is this Jeopardy Jamboree so prevalent in these particular times? Some analysts might trace the fascination with violence to recession anxieties. But escapism in the Great Depression took the form of sophisticated movies with glamorous stars like Carole Lombard and Irene Dunne, not to mention Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The unsettling truth these days is that popular entertainment is barreling toward creative bankruptcy.
 Looking on as positive a side as possible, television movies, unlike their theatrical counterparts, do create badly needed employment opportunities for actresses over the age of 30. And students of cultural and social pathologies can have a field day cataloging just what types of aberrant behavior television executives think will sell best across the nation. The electronic landscape is littered with unsettling reflections of ourselves.
 The dysfunctional family in "My Son Johnny" consists of Marianne Cortino (Michele Lee), a Baltimore widow; her older son, Johnny (Rick Schroder), and her other son, Anthony (Corin Nemec). Johnny is a smooth-talking bum, dedicated to drugs and tormenting his brother. He is also mama's pet. She insists on seeing his constant harassment of Anthony as little more than "boys will be boys" horseplay. Murder finally forces her, very reluctantly, to face the truth. Strong performances all around do wonders for a tediously repetitive script.
 In "Wife, Mother, Murderer," Marie Hilley (Judith Light) is discovered in Alabama poisoning her husband and trying to kill her daughter. It seems the insurance money would help Marie realize some of her social-climbing fantasies, most of them puny. Fleeing to Florida under a false identity, she meets a gentle soul who marries her and gives her a home in New Hampshire. Rarely at a loss for a quick con game, Marie eventually ends up in prison but manages to sweet-talk her way into a three-day furlough, during which her story is finally resolved. For a tale so chock full of incident, "Wife, Mother, Murderer" is numbingly predictable. Even an accomplished actor like David Dukes ends up standing around looking helpless.
 And the lineup gets more crowded. This Monday, NBC's "Deadly Medicine" is about a pediatrician (Veronica Hamel) accused of killing children who were her patients. She didn't do it; her creepy nurse (Susan Ruttan) did. And then there's . . . but no need to burden you with too many dreary details. The networks will do that for you without even being asked.
 
'The Kathy and Mo Show' 'Parallel Lives'

 HBO Tomorrow at 10:30 P.M.
 Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney, taped onstage in San Francisco, bring their award-winning collection of offbeat characters to cable television in the form of an "HBO Comedy Hour." Together or separately, the women are hilarious and, not so incidentally, wicked gender benders as they flit in and out of male impersonations. Best bit: Two middle-aged girlfriends enrolled in women's studies at a community college going on a field trip to see a feminist performance called Sister Womyn Sister.
 
'Living With the

 Living Theater' Channel 13 Sunday at midnight
 The video artist Nam June Paik offers, with Betsy Connors and Paul Garrin, a fond and touching tribute to Julian Beck and Judith Malina and their Living Theater, which became an internationally renowned center of experimental theater in the 1960's. There are interviews with the married couple; clips from performances and from their 1984 trip to Switzerland to visit the grave of the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin; scenes from Beck's funeral, and interviews with the four Beck children. Underlying everything is, in the words of Ms. Malina, "one's vision of revolutionary possibilities." Anyone gorged on network foolishness these days will find the shrewd Mr. Paik's alternative invigorating.

Last-Ditch Credit

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
For those with damaged credit or no credit history at all, a secured bank credit card may be a good idea. Consumers who may not qualify for an ordinary card -- those hurt by the recession, divorce, bankruptcy or layoffs -- can often get a secured Visa or Mastercard issued by a reputable bank. But the secured cards require a money deposit as collateral. The higher the deposit, the higher the credit limit. A secured credit card offers a chance to repair a credit history, or start one, since card behavior is reported to the major credit bureaus. For a list of issuers of secured credit cards, send $4 to Bankcard Holders of America, 560 Parkway, Herndon, Pa. 22070; telephone (703) 481-1110. Here are some pointers on secured cards.
 
Minimum deposit: From $250 to $500, usually earning 4 percent to 5.25 percent interest. The deposit cannot be withdrawn while the card is held, and the money is kept on deposit for at least 45 days after the account is closed to allow all charges to clear.

 Finance charge: Depending on the bank, the rate will range from 19 percent to 22 percent.

 Annual fee: $25 to $35

 Restrictions: Some banks require applicants to have a checking or savings account, with store and other accounts not seriously overdue, and bankruptcy disputes settled.

Armco Outlay Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Armco Inc., the Parsippany, N.J., steelmaker, said it would cut capital spending by 42 percent this year to a total of $40 million. At the beginning of the year, it had budgeted $70 million for capital projects. According to a 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company deferred the spending because of the recession. Last year, Armco reported $85 million in capital spending. Robert Kent, an Armco corporate vice president, said a plan to acquire Cyclops Industries might be partly responsible for the spending cut.

HEADLINE: Fighting to Get on the Perfume Shelf

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Even by French standards it was an affair to remember. The 17th-century Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte glowed with the light of candles and fireworks. There was Champagne and sumptuous food galore. Barefoot Tahitian dancers and Mexican musicians added exotica, and a handful of film and fashion celebrities provided glamour.
All this to introduce Dune, the 13th perfume created by the House of Dior since 1947, and the first Dior fragrance for women since the big success of Poison in 1985. The recent party made it clear that despite declining sales and the proliferation of new perfumes worldwide, Dior was not about to let three years of research and a $37 million investment go unnoticed. 
 Judging by early sales, the investment seems to be paying off. Figures have not yet been disclosed, but Maurice Roger, president of Christian Dior Perfumes, said sales of Dune in Europe had been exceptional.
Danielle Bizot, a spokeswoman for the French department store Printemps, said that so far Dune ranks fourth in sales among fragrances this season.
Mr. Roger said: "Two-thirds of the initial success of a perfume lies in its name, its design and promotion. Only one-third is its actual fragrance."
Dune, which sells for $180 an ounce, is clearly a gamble by its owner, LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, the world's leading luxury-goods company. The company also owns the fragrance licenses for Givenchy and Christian Lacroix perfumes. Earlier this year it introduced Givenchy's Amarige in Europe.
"It's an extremely bold move given that the market is so bad and that they only recently launched Christian Lacroix's C'est la Vie, whose losses last year were pretty high," said Michael Diehl, an analyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities.
In the last two years, the annual growth rate of the $11 billion world perfume industry has declined by 5 to 10 percentage points. Sales have been hard hit by the American recession; the decline in travel because of the Persian Gulf war, which led to a 35 percent decrease in purchases of duty-free perfume at airport shops, and the drop in value of the dollar and the Japanese yen.
"Our decision to launch at this time is simple," Mr. Roger said. "We are coming out of a crisis, and people need optimism. We have more flexibility and a better chance of success with a market that is so fragmented."
Sales of Dune started in Europe and the Middle East in mid-September. They will begin in Asia in the spring, and in the United States next fall.
Promoted as "the perfume of serenity," Dune is aimed at "the natural woman who is dynamic, generous and now also deeply modest," the ad copy reads. Bottled in winged transparent glass and boxed in tangerine peach, its floral scent is meant to evoke "the seaside on a beautiful sunny day, between dune and countryside."
Christian Dior needs a fresh fragrance to reassert itself in an increasingly saturated market, analysts said.
 
Fighting for Space
 In the United States alone, 25 to 30 new perfumes come out each year, all vying for counter space in department stores, where most sales are made.
"Maurice needs this one," said Allan Mottus, a cosmetic industry consultant based in New York. "He's had a dry spell since Poison. The designer house's percentage of the market has declined because they're not introducing as frequently as the other names in the business."
"I think that they have a chance with Dune," Mr. Mottus said. "They are selling a kindler and gentler female psyche, which women of the 90's, who are going to have a tougher time than ever, may just buy out of wish fulfillment."
Not only are more perfumes being introduced, they are being done so more expensively. White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor, Escape by Calvin Klein and Spellbound by Estee Lauder all went on sale this year with campaigns costing an average of $25 million each.
As a result, "we are seeing bigger and bigger companies in the business," said Deepak Raj, an analyst for Merrill Lynch Research. "Only companies like Unilever, which owns both the Elizabeth Taylor and Calvin Klein brands, can afford the investment needed for these mega-launches."
Many new perfumes that do not have the leverage of a big company behind them have resorted to gimmicks and incentives, like a gift with each purchase, to retain counter space and sustain sales.
"We are seeing perfume being treated more and more like a gadget," Mr. Roger said. "Americans are buying it as if it was a cheap T-shirt. They're getting a free umbrella, or a free gift in the bargain, and as a result they have more unused perfume sitting in their medicine cabinets than they do medicine."
Though Christian Dior has not announced the projected forecasts for sales of Dune, the company is hoping to equal, if not surpass, the success of Poison, which in its first three months sold $25 million.
"If we are not very active on a day-to-day basis, we'll lose our central location and find ourselves selling under the escalator," Mr. Roger said.
Still, not everyone is impressed.
"It's a little too green for me," said Margaret Aflalo, who was testing samples of perfume in the Galeries Lafayette store in Paris. "But it's very different from the rest of Dior's perfumes, much more natural."
It generally takes six to eight months before a perfume can be judged successful, after shoppers have had a chance to make repeat purchases.
 
A Crucial Market
 Even if Dune fares well in Europe, its success in the United States, which represents 35 percent of the worldwide market, is not guaranteed.
"Americans are much more oriented toward celebrity perfumes, whether it's Elizabeth Taylor or some tennis player," said Mr. Diehl, the Kleinwort Benson analyst. "If it's Liz Taylor, who has a certain timelessness, the fragance has a chance of lasting, but if it's a tennis player the fragrance is just as likely as him to come and go."
What makes a perfume a classic, putting it in the ranks of a Chanel No. 5 or Guerlain's Shalimar is, according to Mr. Roger, an avant-garde, innovative quality and a design and fragrance that have a global appeal.
"The perfume industry is a massive gamble," Mr. Diehl said. "But once you get a brand established, then you've got a license to print money."

HEADLINE: Your Money;
A Tax Wrinkle For the Year-End

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
Investors face a new wrinkle in year-end tax planning. This year, for the first time, people who borrow to invest in the market can deduct the interest on those loans only to the extent they can match it with income from investments.
Either dividends and interest or capital gains on securities count as investment income and can offset what tax law calls investment interest expense. But margin traders who wind up losing money cannot deduct investment interest costs against wages, salaries and other ordinary income. 
 Eli J. Warach, a tax lawyer and author of the Maxwell Macmillan 1992 Federal Tax Handbook, says this rule can open opportunities before Dec. 31. "The trick is to arrange your transactions so that you use up otherwise nondeductible interest to wipe out taxable gains," he said.
For example, Mr. Warach said, an investor who has realized $10,000 of investment income and paid $13,000 of investment interest this year can deduct only $10,000 of the interest; the rest can be carried forward to a future year. But if he has $3,000 worth of long-term gains in his portfolio, he could take them now and deduct all the interest expense.
If he likes the holding, he can buy it back, establishing a higher cost basis, although he will incur transaction costs. The "wash sales" rules apply only to losses, not gains.
What's more, Mr. Warach said, if the investor is in the 31 percent Federal bracket, the deduction is worth 31 percent on Schedule A, whereas long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum of 28 percent on Schedule D.
He gave another example. An investor who has realized $2,000 worth of long-term gains and has no paper losses owes $3,000 in interest on outstanding margin loans. If she pays $2,000 of the interest this year, he said, she will be able to deduct it because of the gain. If she pays all $3,000, she will have to carry $1,000 of it forward to a future year.
There is one caveat. Only interest payments on loans used to pay for investments are deductible under these rules. If an investor took out a margin loan to buy a car, the interest would not be deductible. But he could sell a holding, use the proceeds to buy the car and replace the security in the portfolio with a comparable issue purchased on margin.
Hal Cohen of Deloitte & Touche in Parsippany, N.J., noted that many investors were asking whether to delay taking capital gains in case President Bush wins a cut in the capital gains tax rate next year. He recommended basing the decision on economics first, but added, "It may not be a bad idea to defer the gain until next year."
If investors wind up in a net capital loss position this year, up to $3,000 can be taken against earned income. Anything over that would be carried forward to future years.
 
Adjusting Withholding

For taxpayers who wind up with sizable net gains, dividends, interest or other income not subject to withholding -- consulting or freelance work, for example -- the tax question is whether they are going to be liable for penalties and interest.
Taxpayers are required to pay as they earn, either an amount equal to 100 percent of the tax they owed the previous year or 90 percent of this year's tax liability, through either payroll withholding, payments of quarterly estimated taxes or a combination of the two.
The year-earlier test is easier to calculate; taxpayers merely need to add up their withholding and estimated tax payments for 1991, projecting through the end of the year, and compare the results with last year's tax. But for people who will owe less tax this year than last, meeting that test would amount to giving the I.R.S. a free loan until they file their returns and get refunds.
To use the 90 percent test, taxpayers need to project their income and deductions and calculate what the tax will be fairly accurately -- a task made far easier with one of the popular computer tax programs, like Taxcut, Turbotax, Macintax or J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax.
Charles H. Gaylord, Jr., president and chief executive of Chipsoft, Inc., which makes Turbotax for I.B.M. and compatible personal computers, said last week that he had used his own product, which even a novice can install in 5 or 10 minutes, and discovered that because of a profitable stock sale in June, as things stood, he would be liable for the underpayment penalty.
So, he gave his company's payroll department a new Form W-4 to increase withholding, and will turn in a revised W-4 in January. The reason is that withholding is deemed to have occurred evenly through the year, even if a big chunk comes in November and December. Estimated payments are not; had he made an estimated payment now to cover the capital gains tax, he would still have been liable for some penalty and interest, although less than had he waited until April.
Conversely, people who discover they are headed for a big refund, could turn in a new W-4 to decrease their withholding. The programs can also help weigh the tax consequences of securities sales, charitable gifts and other year-end choices.

HEADLINE: Pension Agency's Accounting Systems Criticized

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Federal agency that insures most private employee pension plans, already running a multibillion-dollar deficit, is unable to audit its books, a Congressional study has found.
The disarray in accounting systems at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ranges from a two-year breakdown in a premium-processing computer system, corrected in 1990, to its inability now to identify unpaid, overpaid or underpaid insurance premiums, the oversight subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee said in a report issued Thursday. 
 Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Government insures most private pension plans, through premiums paid by employers to the pension corporation, a unit of the Labor Department. Premium rates have risen steeply since 1974, with the increase especially sharp in the last several years. About 40 million people are covered by the Federal insurance program.
Last month James B. Lockhart 3d, the executive director of the agency, told Congress that the corporation's deficit was "well over $2 billion" for the year ended Sept. 30, an increase over last year's deficit of $1.8 billion.
Some of the subcommittee's findings were based on reports in January by the agency's inspector general and the General Accounting Office, an investigatory arm of Congress.
A spokesman for the pension agency read a statement saying that under Mr. Lockhart, who took office last year, the agency requested a G.A.O. audit more than a year ago and has "already taken steps to address G.A.O.'s concerns."
The statement also said that the automated computer system used to process premiums was restored last year with "no significant effect on the financial condition of the corporation."
The corporation has said it will be able to pay liabilities through the end of the decade because it has ample cash flow, and the private pension plans it backs are well funded with $800 billion in liabilities backed by $1 trillion in assets.
 
Danger in Some Industries

But financial problems in certain industries, including steel and airlines, could increase the agency's deficit to $11.4 billion by the year 2000. In addition, a recent Federal court ruling involving the LTV Corporation's unfunded pension liability of $1.6 billion went against the agency, which is appealing the decision.
The pension corporation is one of several Federal insurance programs in which the financial exposure and condition worry private and Government economists.
A Federal fund that insured deposits at savings and loan associations went bankrupt after owners of the savings units could not generate enough premium income, and the cleanup will now cost taxpayers more than $200 billion. In addition, the fund that insures deposits at commercial banks, despite recent increases in premiums paid by banks, faces insolvency and is seeking Congressional authority to borrow up to $70 billion from the Treasury.
Among the pension agency's financial and accounting problems cited in the subcommittee report were these: financial statements that could not be audited, inability to control premium payments forwarded to the Washington office effectively, lack of a compliance program to indentify fully and collect premium payments, and a two-year breakdown in the operation of the premium-processing's computer functions.
Judith Bekelman, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the agency was "on track to have auditable financial statements in 1992," that its system to control premiums was up and running and that a more advanced computer system for the agency will be in place next year.

HEADLINE: S.& P. Cuts Ratings on G.M. and Revises Outlook on Ford

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Large and continuing losses at the nation's two largest auto makers prompted the Standard & Poor's Corporation today to lower the ratings on the preference and preferred shares of General Motors and revise its ratings outlook to "negative" from "stable" for the bonds and preference shares of Ford.
S.& P. said it had lowered the G.M. ratings by one notch. It also warned that it might reduce the ratings on $90 billion of the company's debt, the ratings of which were last lowered in February. The rating on $110 billion worth of Ford debt was affirmed. 
 The General Motors Corporation was singled out by the ratings agency for "unprecedented" losses in its North American operations. Analysts have estimated that G.M. is losing from $500 million to $600 million a month in North America, an amount that is partly offset by overseas profits and earnings from G.M.'s GM Hughes Electronics and Electronic Data Systems subsidiaries.
G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, has experienced "disappointing" progress in improving its operating efficiency, S.& P. said. One reason might be that G.M.'s market share in North America has been stuck at about 35 percent while the company's factory capacity is appropriate for a 40 percent share.
G.M.'s European operations, while profitable, may be vulnerable because consumer demand has softened in the German market.
Wall Street was not surprised by the action, which reflects the effects of a weak economy as well as soft prices and brutal competition with Japanese auto makers. G.M.'s common shares fell 75 cents today, to $34, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Cost-cutting will be more difficult for G.M. because of its future retiree medical costs, which S.& P. said were greater than those of its competitors. Separately, G.M. said its estimate of such expenses over the next 20 years, under new accounting guidelines that will soon take effect, was in a range of $16 billion to $24 billion.
Scott Sprinzen, a spokesman for S.& P., said the agency probably would not act on G.M.'s debt ratings until February, when it will have a chance to review the auto maker's fourth-quarter financial results.
A G.M. spokesman said, "We feel the action taken by Standard & Poor's is largely a reflection of the persistent recession that has gripped the nation and impacted the entire domestic auto industy." G.M. said the action should also send a signal to Washington that the industry "needs support" in light of Government regulation "that continues to impair U.S. competitiveness."
In the case of the Ford Motor Company, S.& P. noted that earnings had been poor but that Ford's operating efficiency in North America was much better than G.M.'s The ratings agency predicted that Ford, because of aggressive cost-cutting, could become profitable within two years even if the economic recovery was gradual.
S.& P. said Ford had demonstrated "a greater commitment" than G.M. to keeping its balance sheet strong, as evidenced by a $750 million issue of convertible preferred stock. A Ford spokesman said the company was pleased that its ratings were affirmed.
Ford's shares closed today at $26.125, down 25 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Chrysler Corporation, the No. 3 auto maker, has also been losing money, although it reported a smaller third-quarter loss than analysts had forecast. Chrysler's ratings were last downgraded in June.

HEADLINE: Whither Hemlines? In Short, Even Retailers Aren't Sure

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The European and American designers' spring previews have left retailers with no clear direction about where hemlines are supposed to fall.
Many store executives seem irritated by the confusion on the modeling runways -- and all the talk in fashion stories -- of short and long styles. But merchants also seem somewhat relieved that they can avoid the financial risk of trying to market a sudden shift in fashion. As a result, most are stocking short skirts, long dresses and a healthy inventory of pants, which have become the only sure-fire option when hemlines are in flux. 
 "Personally, I think that the length of a hemline is not relevant to women today," said Eugenia Ulasewicz, president of Galeries Lafayette U.S.A. "I think a woman nowadays has both long and short in her closet and a very independent sense of style."
 
Hemming and Hawing
 As the fashion shows wind down in New York, Louis Dell'Olio of Anne Klein has voted up, sticking with the prevailing trend. Calvin Klein voted down, in word if not entirely in fact. And Claude Montana, in perhaps the best imitation of Mario Cuomo, tried to have it both ways: he showed skirts that grazed the thighs in front and tickled the calves in back.
"There certainly are some long looks here, and that's what has grabbed the headlines," said LaVelle Olexa, senior vice president of Lord & Taylor. "But there are also some very, very good short skirts and dresses. Long is out here. However, it really is just another option."
She said that Lord & Taylor would feature some skirts and dresses with longer hemlines, but that garments hemmed above the knees would still have a strong presence in the company's 49 stores.
The idea of women buying both short and long dresses and skirts might seem like good news to the Sakses, Bloomingdale's and Macy's of the world. Not so. With no fresh reasons to come into department stores and boutiques, women may just wear their old clothes until the fashion mavens settle the debate. That does not help an industry hurting badly in the recession.
Designers, too, have a simple economic reason for changing hemlines: sales. New looks used to stimulate sales, as women rushed out to replace the stale styles hanging in their closets. But few retailers or manufacturers now say that a shift to longer hems would bring customers rushing in.
Some experts say the hemline's role as the demarcation that has separated the chic from the gauche since early in this century is falling victim to shoppers less willing to be dictated to, and to merchants far less willing to sacrifice dwindling profits for a fashionable reputation.
"For the majority of middle America, which is at least 50 percent of the buying public, the hemline is irrelevant," said Irwin Cohen of the Cohen Brothers Dress Company, makers of moderately priced women's apparel. "I don't think the American consumer is in any financial position to disregard her current wardrobe just to be in vogue."
Facing that reality, many Seventh Avenue manufacturers, who have usually taken most of their cues from the European shows, turned up their noses this time.
"Today's woman is not intimidated by what's on the runway in Paris," said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller.
To some in the industry, the hemline hoopla is a painful reminder of the miscalculations they made in 1987 when they filled store racks with short skirts, a radical departure from the accepted style. Even now, some women of a certain age, in some professions and in many parts of the country remain shy about baring their knees.
Most women rejected shorter skirts. Stores were left to mark down their shorter merchandise drastically, a task they do not wish to repeat.
Retailers "thought they had more influence, and that women wouldn't dare reject their suggestions on fashion," said Cynthia Cohen Turk, president of Marketplace 2000, a consulting firm.
So now, merchants and mainstream apparel manufacturers are practicing prudence and ignoring the range of edicts handed down from the runways in Paris and Milan.
 
The Knees Still Have It

 Laurence Cioaba, divisional merchandise manager for women's designer clothing for Barneys New York, said longer, lean looks like those shown by Karl Lagerfeld and Azzedine Alaia seemed fresh and modern. "A shorter skirt still retains a major commercial value," she said, referring to lengths just above the knee. "But the miniskirt definitely looks a little passe."
Alfred Schatzberg, president of After Five, a New York maker of party dresses and gowns, said about 10 percent of the company's spring collection would be longer. But he said the longer lengths were chiefly a result of fabrics his designer, Julie Duroche, chose, rather than any signals from Europe.
"Most American manufacturers are still going above the knee," Mr. Schatzberg said. "The few longer dresses you'll see are almost a test so no one gets hurt -- not the retailer and not the manufacturer."
The discussion about hemlines has also coaxed one of Seventh Avenue's little secrets out of the closet. As many people suspected, those who make the clothes that are staples in women's wardrobes never really hiked their hems across the board.
"Through all the hoopla about the short, short skirts, longer lengths have sold consistently well," said Larry Lefkowitz, president of Maggy London International, which sells $65 million worth of apparel aimed at career women.
Many fashion experts recall that in 1974, Yves St. Laurent introduced the "midi" to women who had worn the "mini" since the 1960's. Fashion writers deplored the longer look, but within a year shoppers were snapping up the new style.
Garment makers say the difference between now and then is that women have not yet tired of short skirts.
"There's an evolution going on right now," explained Mr. Konheim of Nicole Miller. "Evolutions are financial successes. Revolutions, like what we saw in 1987, only cause people to stop and stare at whoever's throwing the Molotov cocktail."

HEADLINE: Fed's Policy Makers Supported Lower Rates, if Necessary

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers voted early last month to authorize lower short-term interest rates if the economic recovery appeared to need further stimulus, according to minutes of their meeting released today.
But members of the Federal Open Market Committee generally felt at their meeting on Oct. 1 that policy was on the correct course and they said they would accept only a "slight bias" toward easing interest rates. But the Fed has cut interest rates on two separate occasions since, to encourage borrowing and thus stimulate economic activity. In a speech last week, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, suggested that the economic recovery might be faltering. 
 Today's release of the minutes came two days after the Fed lowered the discount rate to 4 1/2 percent, from 5 percent, and also allowed the Federal funds rate to fall one-quarter of a percentage point, to 4 3/4 percent. The discount rate is what the Fed charges banks for loans; the Federal funds rate is what banks charge one another for loans.
Some large banks responded to the lower rates by reducing their prime lending rate to 7 1/2 percent, from 8 percent.
Earlier, on Oct. 30, the Fed had let the funds rate fall to 5 percent, from 5 1/4 percent.
A Panel of 12
The target for the funds rate is set by the Open Market Committee, which consists of the 7 Federal Reserve board governors and the presidents of 5 of the Fed's 12 regional banks. The discount rate is controlled by the board itself.
The committee meets behind closed doors eight times a year, with the most recent meeting taking place on Tuesday. Minutes of the meetings are released about six weeks later.
The minutes of the Oct. 1 meeting expressed an optimism that was absent from Mr. Greenspan's speech on Oct. 28. In recent weeks, he said, the recovery has "turned demonstrably sluggish." But at the Oct. 1 meeting, the Fed officials "generally concluded that on balance the evidence was consistent with a continuing though still sluggish recovery in economic activity and that the prospects remained favorable for a sustained expansion at a moderate pace over the next several quarters."
Thus, the minutes continued, the committee favored maintaining current policy, but said it could accept a "slight bias" toward easing if needed. That language contrasted with the minutes of the Aug. 20 meeting, which said the committee policy "provided for giving special weight" to developments that might require easing.
The vote at the Oct. 1 meeting was 10 to 0. There are two vacancies on the Fed's board of governors.

HEADLINE: Title Insurers' Low Reserves Stir Worry

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
The nation's title insurance industry, which provides protection to millions of American property owners, may not have enough money in reserve to meet a recent surge in claims. As a result, some industry executives and experts predict that many title insurers will be weakened in coming years, and they fear what would happen if one of the big ones had serious problems or even failed.
In an industry so concentrated that six insurers handle three-fourths of the nation's properties, the fallout could be substantial. 
 If confidence in the title insurance business was shaken, home lenders could become more stingy about issuing mortgages. At a minimum, they would demand higher interest rates to compensate for possibly defective title insurance on properties securing the loans. Presumably premiums could increase to reflect what industry executives see as the new and higher risks.
If a title company failed, millions of homeowners and lenders would be in jeopardy until they got another title insurer, and if a claim were then to arise they would not be able to secure new coverage.
Although no giant title insurer has failed, smaller companies have. And the insolvency of a midsize title company, the Title USA Corporation, which collapsed in October 1989 after issuing nearly a million policies, provides a glimpse of the hardship that could follow were a giant insurer to fail.
A number of years back, the National Bank of Albuquerque issued a $500,000 mortgage to an Albuquerque, N.M., man seeking to build a home, only to find out that the land on which the home was to be built had been seized by the suburb of Las Ranchos. That village maintained that the land in question had always been public property. When the bank filed a claim with Title USA, it got back a letter instead from the Texas Insurance Department saying that Title USA was out of business. To this day, the bank is trying to recover its $500,000.
"Not being a big bank, we would consider that a very big loss," said Leonard DeLayo, the bank's general counsel. "And we don't expect to recover a penny of that from the title company."
Title insurance has always been a profitable backwater of the insurance market. It is little studied; it is virtually unregulated at the Federal and state levels; ratings agencies do not assess the financial strength of title insurers; the leading companies have no cachet, and consumers do not shop around.
Yet, title insurance is the lubricant of the real estate market, an essential element if properties are to change hands smoothly. Home buyers use it to protect against the risk that the seller does not actually own the house they are buying or has failed to pay taxes or other bills. Lenders rely on title insurance against the possibility that some other creditor will appear and demand title to a troubled property before the lender can repossess it.
 
Some Obviously Losing Money

Virtually everyone in title insurance agrees these days that the rate of claims has risen sharply, to about 12 to 15 cents of every dollar taken in through premiums, from about 3 cents in the mid-1970's. The great bulk of premiums -- up to 90 to 95 cents on the dollar -- goes to pay agents and researchers and to cover home office expenses. So, some insurers are obviously losing money.
And as claims rates have soared, most insurers have failed to place enough money in reserve to pay the higher claims, many industry experts say. While no one expects reserves to be at 15 percent of premiums, most title experts say that a figure of 10 percent is reasonable.
"Frankly, many title insurers just have not reflected the true cost of doing business," said Robert Scherer, the chief financial officer of the Chicago Trust and Title Company, the nation's largest title insurer.
Some states have laws that require title insurers to set aside funds. But experts say that these laws were adopted years ago, that the levels they require are too low and that in any case, the laws differ widely by state, creating a crazy quilt of regulations.
 
Reasons for Higher Claims

The current, higher rate of claims reflects several trends. One is the generally depressed market for real estate, in which many builders have left unfinished homes and office buildings, which are subject to claims by construction workers.
A second reason is that the title insurers now employ more freelance title researchers, who make mistakes. And a third reason is that the discovery of hazardous waste under homes and factories, which can make it difficult to transfer the title on a property, has led to a number of claims against insurers.
 
Reluctant to Increase Reserves

Yet, most title insurers have been reluctant to increase their reserves, largely, the experts say, because they do not want to report to stockholders the lower profits that would result.
"You have an important part of our economy that is not what it appears to be," said Aldo C. Zucaro, president of the Old Republic Title Insurance Group Inc. of Chicago, the sixth-largest title insurer in the country. "In a few years, when all of us are ready to sell our homes and retire to Arizona, we will all be up the creek if we find out that we do not have clear title to our homes and that the title insurance company is not there to bail us out."
And given the imbalance between reserves and claims in the industry, the chances of a big title insurer failing are no longer remote, he added.
Concerned policyholders always have the option of replacing one policy with another. But it can be expensive; typically, the one-time premium on a $150,000 home is at least $500. Insurance experts suggest that consumers considering this option discuss their concerns with the lender who provided the mortgage and request that the lender share in the cost.
Recently, Old Republic released a study that all but predicted that title insurers would be the next financial institutions to go broke if the companies were not forced to recognize their obligations. The study, "Title Insurance: a Time to Address Financial Stability Issues," was greeted with some skepticism. Some industry executives said the report was self-serving, because Old Republic is one of the few large title insurers to have increased reserves seriously in recent years.
 
Others Worried, Too

But Old Republic is not the only party to suspect that title insurers may be headed for rough waters. For the last four months, the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, has been studying the claims-paying ability of title insurers that cover its mortgage-backed securities. And Wall Street analysts who follow title-insurance stocks have also begun to raise questions about title insurers' financial strength.
"There are definitely one or two big title insurers that could suffer serious problems" as a result of their underreserving, said Charles Ronson, an analyst at Baird, Patrick & Company, a Wall Street firm.
For years, title insurance was a conservative, low-risk business. Title insurers would invest premium revenue, while their employees would review real estate transfer records to make sure a property was free of tax liens, unpaid contractor bills or other encumbrances. Claims were rare and usually resulted from a clerk making a mistake in reading a record.
"Title insurance was considered a wonderful vehicle for acquiring cheap funds for investment," Mr. Ronson said.
 
A Low-Profile Business

And it attracted little attention.
Joseph Belth, a consumer advocate who teaches insurance at Indiana University, said: "I don't even incorporate title insurance into my survey course. Maybe I should."
And Stephen Brobeck, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington lobbying group, said, "We've just always looked at the business as posing extremely low risk."
In recent years, title insurance has come to be dominated by a handful of large, national companies: Chicago Trust and Title, owned by Alleghany; First American Title Insurance in Santa Ana, Calif., owned by First American Financial; Commonwealth Title Insurance in San Francisco, owned by Reliance Group Holdings; Lawyers Title Insurance in Richmond; Stewart Title Guaranty in Houston, owned by Stewart Information Services, and the main title insurance subsidiary of Old Republic International, the Title Insurance Company of Minnesota.
As their control over the market grew, the companies increasingly relied on freelance researchers whose work often produced higher-than-normal error rates. As a result, claims have soared.
 
Effect of Real Estate Slump

Claims have also risen because of the real estate slump. As property values have softened nationwide, many developers have abandoned projects in midstream, halting wage payments to carpenters, electricians and other construction workers. Because many state laws give construction workers first rights to a bankrupt property -- even if it has been mortgaged -- many banks have found they do not hold the first lien they thought they had. Their position compromised, many banks have filed claims with their title insurers.
Banks have also increasingly been filing claims with title insurers in connection with discovery of hazardous wastes. Essentially, the banks contend that discovery of chemicals or other dangerous materials under a mortgaged property makes the title to the property invalid since the property in many cases can no longer be sold.
The insurers argue that while property near hazardous wastes may be unmarketable, the title is still technically good. But having to defend against these claims is costing the title insurers millions of dollars.
 
Some Problems Documented

Publicly available data from individual title insurers document some of the problems. As of Dec. 31, 1990, for instance, the First American Title Insurance Company was reporting a reserve ratio of about 3 percent. The ratio is based on year-end reserves and the sum of the last five years' premiums.
Lawyers Title Insurance had a reserve ratio of 7 percent; Stewart Title Guaranty had a ratio of 6.8 percent. Only Old Republic's title insurance group had a reserve ratio in double digits, at 11.1 percent. The current reality could force all but Old Republic to raise those figures.

HEADLINE: Bush Returns the Democrats' Fire, Pointing to Success Against Iraqis

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 8

 BODY:
President Bush paused between a summit session of the Atlantic alliance and economic talks in the Netherlands to renew his increasingly defensive battle with Congress today. He charged that if it had been left up to the Democrats, America would be sitting "fat, dumb and happy with Saddam Hussein maybe in Saudi Arabia."
Mr. Bush began a news conference among the meticulously trimmed hedgerows of Villa Taverna, the American Ambassador's residence here, seeming determined to focus on his role as a head of state who holds a predominant position in Western military and political councils. 
 He tried to keep the focus on an optimistic assessment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he had just concluded. But in a reflection of the political realities that face Mr. Bush when he returns from the Hague on Saturday evening, the questioning quickly turned to the domestic issues that have come to dominate the electoral debate in the United States, to Mr. Bush's clear frustration.
The President found himself answering queries about abortion counseling, taxes, AIDS, national health care, interest rates and other issues. Even when the subject was foreign affairs, Mr. Bush was trying to explain why Americans suffering from economic recession should care about whether the United States retains a leadership role in NATO or its continental allies develop their own "security identity."
At times, Mr. Bush seemed to have shaken off some of the hesitancy and defensiveness that has characterized his responses to Democratic assaults on domestic issues in recent weeks.
He crisply denied that the country was in a recession, while conceding that the economy was not as "robust" as he might have hoped. He accused the Democratic-controlled Congress of blocking legislation on taxes, transportation and other proposals that he has made in an avowed attempt to stimulate economic growth.
But at other times, Mr. Bush offered confused, rambling answers. "I'm not interested in higher tax cuts," he said at one point, prompting his Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, who was sitting nearby, to shake his head and mutter, "He means higher taxes."
At another point, asked if he would curtail his travels next year because of Democratic criticism and polls showing that Americans think he spends too much time on foreign policy, Mr. Bush wanted to say that he would pay no attention to the "carping," as he called it. But he tripped over his words.
"No, you're not going to see me stay put," he said, adding: "I am not going to forsake my responsibilities. You may not see me put as much -- I mean, un-put as much."
When pressed hard about his contest with the Democrats, Mr. Bush turned to a theme he has used before and is certain to raise again when pressure builds on domestic issues: his success in the Persian Gulf war this year.
"If I had had to listen to advice from the United States Senate leadership, the Democrats -- or from the House, the leadership over there -- to do something about the Persian Gulf, we'd have still been sitting there in the United States, fat, dumb and happy, with Saddam Hussein maybe in Saudi Arabia," Mr. Bush said.
The President said he recognized that he must do more to convey a sense of concern about domestic issues to Americans. He said he wanted to come up with a national health-care proposal before the elections and acknowledged that he had not done as much as he might to promote awareness of AIDS.
But he said that any failure to improve the economy was not his fault, but that of Congress, which is controlled by the Democrats.
"I am going to do as better job as I possibly can on showing the concerns I feel, and hopefully, in spite of the opposition of Congress, try to find answers to some of the problems that are plaguing the American people," he said, adding: "People are hurting there and they need help. But they don't need the President to forswear his obligations for national security and foreign affairs."
Mr. Bush said he had still not made up his mind about various proposals for tax cuts that are floating on Capitol Hill, including one by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, that would give 80 percent of American taxpayers a credit of $200 to $400 and pay the $46 billion cost by creating a new 35 percent tax bracket and a 10 percent surcharge on millionaires.
Mr. Bush, who has strongly opposed fully legalized abortions, said he would veto newly approved legislation that lifts a Federal ban on abortion counseling in clinics receiving Federal money. The Senate vote was sufficient to override a veto, but the House fell 14 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the veto.

HEADLINE: Blacks See Old Hate Behind Duke's New Strength

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAHNVILLE, La.

 BODY:
State Representative David Duke stared directly into the camera and asked the voters of Louisiana to give him a chance. Albert Joseph, one of those voters watching the smooth performance on a grainy television set here, shook his head no.
"Six thousand white people from around here voted for Duke," said Mr. Joseph, a 61-year-old black businessman who has lived most of his life in this small, semi-rural town about 25 miles from New Orleans. "I'm not just worried about David Duke. I know where he's coming from. 
 "I'm worried about the local Dukes, the smiling-in-your-face Dukes, the Dukes in the plant, the Dukes in the courthouse, the Dukes holding a dagger, waiting for you to turn your back.
"David Duke is only one man. He didn't get this far by himself."
 
Sign of Deeper Problems?
 For Mr. Joseph and his neighbors, Mr. Duke, the Republican candidate for governor who is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, is a sign of deeper racial and economic problems that threaten black progress. They believe that Mr. Duke has pulled away the sheet hiding the feelings of too many of their white neighbors.
The suggestion that Mr. Duke simply symbolizes a protest vote against politics as usual is as hollow as a soap commercial to Mr. Joseph's neighbor, Kamau Odinga.
"It is easy for white people to forgive David Duke for being in the Ku Klux Klan," he said. "They were never the victims of the Klan; they were never hung from trees. We cannot forget or forgive that. But it's not just blacks who will suffer. Remember, he was a Nazi."
To experts on Louisiana history and race relations, Mr. Duke's campaign has driven a wedge between blacks and whites, even though Mr. Duke has made no direct appeals to race.
"Racial prejudices and fears have been inflamed," said Lawrence Powell, who teaches history at Tulane University in New Orleans. "I think that's what Duke wanted. Just beneath the surface, there is a racial hair trigger."
Wayne Parent, a Louisiana State University political scientist, said Mr. Duke is riding a wave of racial intolerance and antagonisms that began slowly emerging in the South 10 years ago.
"Pollsters found out it's one way to win elections," he said. "The emergence of David Duke really heightened the distrust many blacks are feeling toward whites."
But it is more than distrust. It is also a feeling of betrayal and disbelief that a man who is both a former Klansman and a former neo-Nazi, who celebrated Hitler's birthday well into the 1980's, could be so close to so much power.
In a recent voter survey commissioned by The Shreveport Times, Mr. Duke, who is from the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, and Edwin W. Edwards, a former three-term Governor who is his Democratic opponent in the Nov. 16 run-off, were separated by only a few percentage points, with Mr. Edwards slightly ahead.
Blacks make up 31 percent of the state's population and 28 percent of the registered voters. For Mr. Edwards to win, there must be a huge black turnout, experts say.
Mr. Odinga says that for the first time in a long time, it will be easy to get his black neighbors -- some old enough to remember when blacks couldn't vote -- to the polls. "Even if they have to walk for miles in the cold and rain, they will turn out in droves," said Mr. Odinga, a chemical engineer and political organizer.
"Duke has caused black people to organize like nothing else I've ever seen here. This is a moral issue."
 
The Tensions of Recession
 Even before Mr. Duke's campaign, tensions were high in a state struggling through a recession that began in the early 1980's with the drop in oil prices.
The picture has been especially bleak for black people. In an article last May in the Tulane University's alumnni magazine, two members of the sociology department wrote that half of the state's black families live beneath the Federal poverty line, as against 10 percent of its white families.
Louisiana has the third-highest rate of poverty among children, the professors wrote, and New Orleans, the state's glistening jewel, is the country's third-poorest city. More than 60 percent of the city is black.
The closeness of the race has shocked many blacks like Giselle Boutte, a 32-year-old social worker in New Orleans. "I'm scared to death he might win," she said. "I'm scared for the future of my daughter. If he's elected, I'm moving out of the state."
Some who say they are afraid also say they are not surprised at Mr. Duke's political success. They say there is a deep vein of racism waiting to be tapped.
Shirley Randall of Hahnville says Mr. Duke isn't fooling anyone: "A tiger can wallow in the mud and cover up his spots. He's still a tiger."
In the last few weeks, Mr. Duke has clearly become a lightning rod, drawing increasingly intense opposition, not just from blacks, but from a cross section of Louisiana life. Disgust at Mr. Duke's past and the impact his election would have on the ecomony, especially tourism, were the most common reasons given by non-blacks for opposing Mr. Duke.
 
Memories That Still Sear
 But for many blacks, especially older people, Mr. Duke is a symbol of painful, soul-numbing images and memories: "white" and "colored" drinking fountains, segregated housing and schools, masked riders in the night.
"He and his kind want to turn back the clock 100 years," said Ron Chisom, a neighborhood organizer in New Orleans who is 50.
Mr. Duke, 41, has tried to disown his past. Today, he calls himself a "conservative Republican" and on the stump he sounds like one, attacking busing, affirmative action, high taxes, soft-on-crime liberals.
Many blacks and others in Louisiana say that Mr. Duke's repeated attacks on welfare programs are thinly disguised attacks on blacks. Blacks, along with other minority groups, account for 74 percent of the state's welfare recipients. Nationwide, about 45 percent of welfare recipients are black.
To applause from his largely white audiences, Mr. Duke says that welfare is dragging the state to its knees. In fact, welfare accounts for about 2 percent of the state's budget, and grants under Louisiana's public aid program to families with children are the third lowest in the nation.
Some blacks say they agree with Mr. Duke's message but cannot bring themselves to vote for a former Klansman.
Shaking her head as she stood on a street in New Orleans, LeShawn Porter, 24, said she knows of at least five black people who plan to vote for Mr. Duke because they believe he has changed. "They're crazy," she said. "Absolutely crazy."
 
Not Courting Black Vote
 Mr. Duke came in second in the state's open primary last month, beating out Gov. Buddy Roemer. In The Shreveport Times survey, 58 percent of the white voters said they would support Mr. Duke, and 28 percent said they would back Mr. Edwards, who is seeking a comeback after surviving two trials on corruption charges. The survey of 817 voters was done Oct. 24-26 by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research of Columbia, Md. It had a margin of error of plus or minus three and a half percentage points.
Mr. Duke has spent little, if any, time campaigning in black neighborhoods. "I haven't been invited," he said recently in Baton Rouge. "I've always been willing to go into that community. Black liberals are concerned about me. Black conservatives aren't."
Mr. Duke's campaign has spurred blacks into action up and down Louisiana. In Ruston, in the northern part of the state, 1,200 students at the predominantly black Grambling State University registered to vote in two days following Mr. Duke's second-place showing in the primary.
"I had students who stood in line for three or four hours waiting to register," said Bill Richey, a political science instructor at the school.
And on a weathered block of North Robertson Street in the Treme section of New Orleans, 78-year-old Augustine Alexander, a retired domestic worker, vowed to crawl to the election booth if she has to. "If God hears my prayer, Duke won't get any closer to the governor's mansion than here," she said.
All told, 32,243 new black voters registered after the primary. And many blacks said last week that they were confident Mr. Duke would be defeated because of the new numbers and unified spirit.
But during that same two-day registration period, 35,054 new white voters also signed up. John Maginnis, publisher of The Louisiana Political Review, said new white voters were expected to support Mr. Duke by at least a 2-to-1 ratio.
Back in Hahnville, Mr. Joseph was sitting in his bar, the But Cut. He also operates a restaurant and a beauty shop.
Mr. Joseph said he loves this town. One of the few times he left was to go "fight for my country" in the hills of Korea. He received a Purple Heart.
"We'll be out in force to vote," he said. "I'm just afraid after we beat him that he'll come back again or somebody else like him will. It seems like we have to keep fighting all the time."

HEADLINE: Times Square Redevelopers Seek Delay in Project

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Bereft of tenants and facing a glutted market, the developers of the huge Times Square Center office complex have raised the possibility of postponing the already long-delayed project.
In response, New York State officials strongly suggested that the answer lies right under the nose of one developer -- the Prudential Insurance Company of America -- whose Manhattan-based Prudential Securities subsidiary is shopping around for a great deal of space. 
 The Times Square Center project, which has crawled along since 1981 (always accompanied by official assurances that it was just about to begin), may now be moving too quickly to suit Prudential and its development partner, George Klein of Park Tower Realty.
It would appear that the real-estate market will not have recovered in the next few years, when the first of the 42d Street buildings might be nearing completion under a timetable set by the developers' agreement with the state and city.
Although neither developer would say exactly what modifications they are seeking, people close to the negotiations said that the question of timing is high on their agenda. The possibility that the developers would seek a delay was first reported in The New York Observer.
The scope of the project, however, remains unchanged so far: four office buildings at the crossroads of 42d Street, Seventh Avenue and Broadway, ranging from 29 to 56 stories and containing a total of 4.2 million square feet of space.
And no one is saying that Prudential or Park Tower is about to walk away from the endeavor. Harold Holzer, executive vice president for public affairs for the New York State Urban Development Corporation, noted that the developers had already committed a huge sum to buy land.
"These folks have $186 million in the project," he said. "Their feet may not be hot but they can't be cold, because they have so much money in it."
"We are not conceding in the least that in a soft real-estate market the project has to be abridged or slowed," Mr. Holzer added.
 
'Reshaping of Some Things'
 But some kind of change would seem to be in the works.
Refusing to be more explicit, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the deputy mayor for finance and economic development, said, "It may require the reshaping of some things, but if that can be done around a tenant, it makes more sense for everybody."
The city is eager to receive $90 million from the developers that would be used to renovate the Times Square subway station, as well as the tax revenues from a successful office project.
Prudential and Park Tower would have to begin building the first tower within a year of the state's delivering two sites, on the northeast and southwest corners of Broadway and 42d Street, in "vacant possession," meaning that the last tenants had departed. The developers would also be required to post a letter of credit to secure the renovation of the subway station.
There are three tenants on those sites who are not yet subject to a vacate order or who have not yet settled with the Urban Development Corporation. Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, said she believed the sites might be vacant by January.
Were the developers to begin construction in early 1993, they would probably be building into a market that still had tens of millions of square feet of vacant space and little appetite for more. That is particularly true around Times Square, where there are already a number of largely empty office towers.
The partners have been unable to secure a single tenant, having lost earlier commitments from Chemical Bank and the law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood.
At the same time, however, Prudential Securities, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Prudential Insurance Company, has been searching for new space as it nears the end of its leases in lower Manhattan.
"Prudential Securities is looking for a location," said Mr. Holzer. "And we have a project with large office buildings. It seems to us that this is a match made in heaven."
 
Hoping for 'Grand Slam'
 Ms. Hernandez-Pinero would not confirm that the city was pursuing a link between Prudential Securities and Times Square Center, but she observed generally, "It's pretty obvious that to the extent you have a major space user, if you could secure their commitment to stay in the city and have them as an anchor tenant at Times Square, that's a grand slam."
Prudential Securities, known until last year as Prudential Bache, has some 5,000 employees in Manhattan and three major offices: 199 Water Street at Fulton Street; 100 Gold Street at Frankfort Street, and 127 John Street at Water Street. Most of these leases expire at the end of 1994.
A spokeswoman for Park Tower referred inquiries to Richard W. Matthews, director of public relations for Prudential Insurance in Newark, who said the company would not comment on "any aspect of our discussions with the city and state."

HEADLINE: Dole Calls Democratic Ideas On Jobless Aid Demagoguery

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, today accused Senate Democrats of "partisan demagoguery" in proposing legislation to extend unemployment benefits that would give President Bush three choices on how to pay for it: declaring a budget emergency and increasing the Federal deficit, curbing foreign aid or raising estimated income tax payments.
Mr. Dole said all three choices were flawed. But he scoffed at the overall plan as "government by multiple choice."

HEADLINE: Gephardt Assails Bush's Foreign Policy as Weak

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to broaden the 1992 campaign debate, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said today that President Bush's foreign policy amounted to little more than defending the status quo and failed to protect American economic interests.
Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told reporters today that his party's Presidential hopefuls should not be fooled by Mr. Bush's reputation for foreign policy success and should attack him for failing to "do more than tidy up after the cold war." 
 "Democrats should not cede this area to the President," he said.
Mr. Gephardt's effort to refocus the dialogue in a campaign that he decided in July not to enter himself was made tonight in a speech at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and in a meeting with reporters in his office here this morning. The Northwestern speech was one of the Leopold lectures in economics.
Mr. Gephardt said it would be a mistake for Democratic candidates to accept the "false Republican dichotomy between foreign and domestic affairs." Indeed, he focused heavily on the need to strengthen the domestic economy. But he argued that if the economy remained weak the American people would turn inward and provide diminishing support even for wise foreign policies.
"Without economic growth," he said, the American people "will rationally demand that we simply turn inward. Public support will evaporate for international commitments at precisely the time President Bush is trying to expand them."
Some of Mr. Gephardt's prescriptions for an improved economy were familiar. He called for extended unemployment insurance benefits, a tax cut to benefit the middle class, and a solution to the health insurance problem. He said last year's budget agreement should be revised, cutting military spending to pay for greater efforts in "areas critical to economic strength -- education, training, research and development."
Mr. Gephardt said that the Government had to show more energy in protecting American trading interests abroad and that President Bush had "canceled the wrong trip," attending a "perfunctory" meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and calling off a visit to Asia when he should have "made the blue-collar worker's case" directly to Japan.
 
'Rolodex Relationships'
 Mr. Gephardt said the President ought to be able to say to American workers, "My personal relationship with the Japanese Prime Minister permits me to fight for fair trade, and the success of that fight will mean higher wages and greater opportunity for you and your family." Instead, he said, Mr. Bush was content to maintain amiable "Rolodex relationships with foreign leaders who don't share our interests."
Democrats, he said, must tell America that national security was achieved not just through military means, when necessary, "but also in other theaters where the battles of the 21st century are going to take place: in the clean rooms of high-tech laboratories, in the trading pits of the Bourses and foreign exchanges, on the docks of Yokohama and New York harbor, and in the classrooms wherever our students yearn to reach for the stars."

HEADLINE: NATO Summit Meeting Ends With Warning to Soviet Republics Over Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Western alliance ended a two-day summit meeting here today with a warning to the Soviet Union and its restive republics to bring their nuclear arsenals under central control, observe international disarmament agreements and curb the spread of conventional forces.
The warning reflected what Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany described as a sense that the Soviet Union's disintegration created an "explosive situation" as conventional and nuclear weapons slipped outside of Moscow's control. 
 For the last two days, the 16 leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been meeting in a hotel on Rome's outskirts to try to redefine the alliance's role in a rapidly changing Europe from which its onetime adversary, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, has disappeared.
 
Divergences Illuminated
 The meeting has produced some of the commitments demanded on Thursday by President Bush to a continued American military presence in Europe. And it has yielded a new military doctrine, supported by all 16 leaders, envisioning leaner and more mobile NATO forces supported by smaller nuclear arsenals.
But it has also illuminated marked divergences both on attitudes to the Soviet Union and on European plans to create a European army.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, for instance, refused to subscribe to today's warning to the Soviet Union because, a member of his delegation said, he felt its tone resembled that of a "preaching friar."
Mr. Mitterrand himself, a close supporter of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, told reporters that NATO should not "try to enter the internal affairs of countries or dictate policies."
"For countries outside the alliance, we are not their rulers," he said. "We do not have an evangelical mission."
What prompted his annoyance was an official NATO document, issued today and titled "Developments in the Soviet Union," that sought to address concerns about independent-minded Soviet republics, notably the Ukraine, where many nuclear weapons are stationed and which plans to create its own army, raising the prospect of an unpredictable nuclear force on the borders of Eastern Europe's uncertain new democracies.
 
Respect for Accords
 "It is critical that the Soviet Union and the republics take all necessary actions to ensure that all international agreements signed by the U.S.S.R. are respected, ratified and implemented," the document said, referring specifically to treaties on nuclear, biological and conventional arms controls.
"We call upon all authorities to refrain from any steps that could lead to proliferation of nuclear weapons or other means of mass destruction," it said.
"We urge restraint in the development of conventional military forces that by their size and character could exacerbate political tensions," the statement declared, asking that the Soviet republics define their relationships with one another without "threats, intimidation, coercion or violence."
Prime Minister John Major of Britain said that with winter coming and food shortages looming, the Soviet Union should "stop wasting its resources with vast military programs." He hinted that European food aid could be jeopardized by military buildups in the Soviet republics. "It makes no sense economically and no sense politically for the republics to build up their own forces," he said.
 
Issue of European Army
 Mr. Bush told reporters in the gardens of the American Ambassador's residence here today that there had been differences over how a proposed European army should relate to NATO's American-led command.
He was referring to a debate that centers on a proposal by France and Germany to create a European army ultimately answerable to the European Community, rather than to NATO.
But Mr. Major, who has advanced a counterproposal in conjunction with Italy, said Britain did not see a European army as "being subordinate to the European Council and taking orders from the European Council, or having its policies agreed collectively within the European Council."
"Britain will not accept that," he said. "No one has argued for that over the past few days."
Rather, he said, Britain foresaw a European force as "strengthening the European pillar of the alliance" without duplicating NATO's command.
NATO officials said the European allies seemed to have postponed a decision on the nature of the proposed new force, still in an embryonic stage, until a European Community summit conference in Maastricht, the Netherlands, next month that is supposed to advance the process of European political and and monetary union.
 
Distinctions Glossed Over
 For their part, Mr. Mitterrand said there was "never a question" of a European army seeking to challenge NATO, while Mr. Kohl said there was broad support for the French and German ideas at the summit meeting.
In its final document, the summit conference glossed over those distinctions, saying the proposal for a new force under the aegis of a previously dormant organization called the Western European Union should be welcomed "both as the defense component of the process of European unification and as a means of strengthening the European pillar of the alliance."
From the American standpoint, though, the declaration seemed to satisfy Mr. Bush's demand on Thursday for a statement of European commitment to an American presence in Europe, speaking of "the essential trans-Atlantic link as demonstrated by the significant presence of North American forces in Europe."
As almost an aside that could nonetheless have far-reaching consequences for the spread of advanced military technology to third-world countries, the declaration urged the Soviet Union to insure that its chaos did not facilitate "the export of nuclear or other potentially destabilizing military technologies."

HEADLINE: South Korea to Keep Out All Atom Arms

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea declared for the first time today that his country would no longer possess or store American or any other nuclear weapons on its soil, and called on North Korea to abandon any plans it might have to build a nuclear bomb.
Mr. Roh's comment, in a speech in Seoul, came after the disclosure in Washington last month that the United States would withdraw all nuclear weapons from South Korea as part of President Bush's ban on tactical nuclear weapons throughout the world. 
 Until today, both American and Korean officials had not confirmed the new policy for Korea explicitly.
American and Korean officials did not disclose any timetable for withdrawal or any other details about what nuclear weapons are now on Korean soil. In renouncing the storage of nuclear weapons, Mr. Roh made no specific reference to the United States. This was in keeping with the longstanding American policy of refusing to confirm or deny their presence.
 
Estimates by Expert
 One expert, Robert Norris, an analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, has estimated that the United States has 40 nuclear-tipped artillery shells in Korea, which would have been eliminated by Mr. Bush's global proposal, and 60 nuclear bombs at an air base near Seoul.
The United States is also reducing its troops in South Korea from 43,000 last year to 36,000 next year. Despite such changes and despite the shift in doctrine represented by Mr. Roh's speech, few experts consider it likely that North Korea will be persuaded to abandon its nuclear weapons plans.
The North Korean Government of Kim Il Sung is widely seen as increasingly weakened by a poor economy and pursuing a nuclear program to shore up its legitimacy.
But Mr. Roh's speech was expected to strengthen the Seoul's demands in the arena of world opinion. There was no immediate word on reaction from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
In the speech, Mr. Roh borrowed the phrasing of North Korea, endorsing its long-stated goal of a "non-nuclear Korean peninsula" and adding that South Korea "will use nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes and will not manufacture, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons."
But Korean officials also said South Korea would continue to be protected by the American nuclear umbrella, in the form of nuclear bombs not on Korean soil or nuclear-tipped submarine-launched missiles. Moreover, they said nuclear-armed submarines would be allowed in Korean waters.
Only a few weeks ago, North Korea added a series of new barriers to inspections of its nuclear weapons plants, demanding that South Korea renounce the protection of any nuclear weapons before it would agree to inspections of its own nuclear installations.
Earlier, North Korea had demanded simply that South Korea remove American nuclear weapons from its territory, and it did not add the new conditions until disclosures that this demand would be met.
Mr. Roh's speech was the latest step in a renewed effort by governments around the world to put pressure on North Korea to accept international inspections of its nuclear installations, particularly the site at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang.
The South Korean President said North Korea "continues to evade its international duties on account of groundless charges and excuses."
Analysts differ over how close North Korea is to making a nuclear bomb, with some Americans and Japanese saying it could be five or six years and some South Koreans saying it could be a year or two.
The two Koreas remain technically at war nearly four decades after the end of the Korean War. They have nearly 1.7 million troops facing each other, making the peninsula one of the most heavily armed parts of the world.
Western concerns have focused in recent weeks on North Korea's nuclear bombs, but there are also concerns that the threat of a nuclear North Korea might persuade South Korea to abandon its pledge not to build a nuclear bomb. Mr. Roh's pledge was thus regarded as significant.

HEADLINE: No Smooth Road Ahead for Tax-Cut Bandwagon

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Despite the enormous pressure of a stalled economy and the message from voters this week that they want tax relief, Democratic and Republican lawmakers say the tax-cut bandwagon is going nowhere in Congress this year.
There has been something of a tax-cut frenzy in recent weeks, with dozens of lawmakers advancing an assortment of proposals that their authors vow would revive the economy. The latest entry comes from Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the most influential tax writer in Congress, who had been said to be resisting moves for a tax cut but who proposed one himself on Thursday. 
 Most lawmakers in both parties say there is only a remote possibility that any tax cut plan would be approved by Congress before it goes into recess before the end of the year.
 
'Get the Debate Started'
 Speaking of his own tax-cut plan, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, said: "It would be very difficult to get it passed this year. But I think it's important to get the debate started. Any time you get on a tax bill you've got yourself an extended debate that takes some time."
Even if a plan wends its way through Congress in early 1992, formidable obstacles remain.
President Bush restated his opposition to the idea again today, saying it would be impossible under the constraints of the budget agreement hammered out by the White House and Congress last year.
"I'd love to be in a position to pledge every American, whatever, a tax cut," Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Rome. "But I don't want to do that when I can't see how I can do that and keep it inside the budget agreement."
Some lawmakers, too, are warning their colleagues to resist the pressures for cutting taxes.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said in an interview: "The greatest risk here is turning these kind of limited tax proposals into a wholesale bidding war that then winds up including everything from I.R.A.'s to capital gains to extension of tax credits to investment tax credits and a host of other members' favorites. So the big question that confronts both the President and the Congress is: Can you control the process so that it doesn't turn into chaos?"
But proponents of tax cuts in both parties are undaunted. Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, told reporters of the White House's resistance, "Up until a week and a half ago we weren't even in a recession if you listen to them down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, conceded that passage of a tax cut might not be imminent, but such proposals "send a very positive message to the American people."
"A lot of what's happening now is psychological," he said. "People need their confidence rebuilt."
Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat who came up with a tax cut proposal in May, today framed the debate as guided by practical politics, saying, "The politics of the moment is how do you help middle-income taxpayers?"
Democrats contend that tax policy has favored the rich for the last decade and see tax cuts for the middle class as an appealing political issue. Republicans, meanwhile, are struggling to add provisions to their capital gains tax cut proposals that would benefit the middle class.
"Two or three months ago I would have said we would do nothing on taxes before the next election," said Jane G. Gravelle, a senior specialist in economic policy for the Congressional Research Service. "Now it looks more likely that we will."
But there is significant disagreement between Republicans and Democrats and in the parties themselves over how the tax cuts should be accomplished and whom they should benefit.
 
Gramm Offers a Plan
 The leading Republicans in favor of cutting taxes are Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. Their proposal would cut the rate of the tax of capital gains, expand benefits for Individual Retirement Accounts and offer a tax credit to first-time home buyers.
Mr. Rostenkowski's bill has already drawn the support of the House leadership. Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington vowed that "we are going to move forward with it" and that "it has a very high degree of probability of being passed by the House."
Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal calls for a tax cut for working-class and middle-income families that would be offset by higher income taxes on the wealthy. It would create an income-tax credit equal to 20 percent of the Social Security and Medicare taxes that a worker paid.
 
Downey Opened the Drive
 Other leading proposals are more narrow than the Rostenkowski plan, geared more to such provisions as helping families with children.
The opening move in the latest drive to cut taxes came in May from Representative Downey and Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat, who proposed replacing the personal exemption for children with an $800 refundable credit. It would also raise the top tax rates.
"Our proposal would primarily benefit middle-income taxpayers with children," Mr. Downey said in an interview. "And the Rostenkowski proposal would benefit everyone who pays Social Security taxes. In terms of the base of who's covered, his is much larger. But our credit is far richer for middle-income taxpayers."
In another effort to help middle-class families, Senator Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, proposed a $300 tax credit for each child up to the age of 18 and a liberalization of incentives for I.R.A.'s. But critics dismiss Mr. Bentsen's plan as not realistic because it would be financed through cuts in the military budget, which would violate the budget agreement that passed last year.
Under the agreement, lawmakers are forbidden from using cuts in discretionary programs, like the military, to offset a tax cut. Instead, the cuts must be paid for by some other tax increase or a cut in mandatory spending, like Medicare or food stamps.
Lost in the political discussion of tax cuts is whether they would give the economy the jolt that it needs, particularly if they do not take effect until well into next year.
"The curious proposals are the ones for I.R.A.'s and capital gains," Ms. Gravelle said. "If they did increase the savings rate, they would be unlikely to stimulate the economy."
Echoing such concerns, Mr. Panetta warned against "quick-fix" solutions. "Obviously the election results from last Tuesday added additional fuel to the fire in trying to do something to address the concerns of the American people," he said.
"But my view is that the President and the Congress should develop a comprehensive package that looks not only at tax relief but includes the unemployment compensation piece as well as some targeted investments," he said. "But from a political point of view, it may be that the best you can hope for is a very limited tax relief bill."

HEADLINE: David Novick, Analyst On Racing, Dies at 85

 BODY:
David Novick, an economist who was an outspoken analyst on the horse-racing industry, died Tuesday at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pa. He was 85 years old and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.
He died of complications after a stroke, said his nephew, Roger Levin of Bethlehem, with whom he had been staying. 
 Mr. Novick headed the cost-analysis department of the Rand Corporation, a research institution in Santa Monica, from 1950 to 1970.
His work in the horse racing field was independent from Rand. Besides breeding and raising thoroughbred horses, he carried out studies for industry and Government organizations involved in horse-racing and other sports, testified before racing commissions and wrote a book-length essay on his specialty, "Economic Study of Harness Horse Racing."
In the 1960's and 1970's he also wrote economic analyses that appeared in The Blood-Horse, a magazine about thoroughbred horse racing and breeding.
One occasion in which Mr. Novick contended that the sport was overgrown was a speech to leaders of the Thoroughbred Racing Association in 1976. "Instead of filling the tub to overflowing, it would be better to open the drain a little, and have less quantity and more quality," he declared.
Mr. Novick was born in Easton, Pa., and studied at Lafayette College and Brown and New York Universities. He is survived by his wife, Mary Bateman Novick, and a sister, Dora N. Levin of Houston.

HEADLINE: In Voters' Wake, Reading the Message

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
A few miles north of Representative Robert E. Andrews's district, jubilant New Jersey Republicans are still celebrating the landslide in which they captured both houses of the State Legislature for the first time in 20 years.
A few miles west, across the Delaware River, Democrats are toasting Harris Wofford, a one-time college administrator with an anti-Bush message, who trounced former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, a confidant of the President, to become the first Pennsylvania Democrat to win a Senate seat in 23 years. 
 Surveying the results from his camp between the two political storms, the freshman Democrat says that what seems to be anti-establishment fury is actually a mosaic of contradictory trends.
 
Combining Messages
 The Pennsylvania outcome shows the political power of the economic malaise and pent-up demand for services like health care, Mr. Andrews says. But the New Jersey vote, essentially a rejection of the $2.8 billion in tax increases won by Gov. Jim Florio, showed that anti-tax fervor remains a potent force.
"When you combine New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the message is loud and clear: people want our economic crisis addressed and addressed without raising taxes," said Mr. Edwards, who succeeded Mr. Florio when the veteran Congressman ran for Governor. "Pennsylvania voters told Republicans 'You're not giving us prosperity, but even worse, you don't care.' New Jersey said 'If you confuse more taxes with prosperity, you're going to have a very short career.' "
Just days after the 1991 elections, members of the New York metropolitan region's Congressional delegation are already looking warily toward 1992, keenly aware that the voters' apparently conflicting messages -- rising demands for expensive services and continued pressure for major tax relief -- confront them with a potentially explosive shock wave.
"You can't have more without somebody having to pay more," Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, a Hartford Democrat and the chief deputy majority whip, said in noting that Senator Wofford's rise from a 44-percentage-point deficit in the polls was fueled by calls for national health insurance.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican who must face re-election next year, noted that the simultaneous demands for services and tax relief "creates some problems."
"Wherever people are perceived as indifferent to the plight of middle-class working families, they're in trouble," he said.
After years in which Republicans seemed better placed to take advantage of voters' anti-tax fury, the legislators said the political playing field appears to have leveled. Both the Democratic and Republican Parties, the lawmakers noted, suffered startling setbacks and enjoyed unexpected successes. Both parties, the politicians added, now confront political opportunities and mine fields.
"It rings an alarm for us all," Mr. D'Amato said.
"While voters get angry and disenfranchised, they take a close look in specific races," added Representative Samuel Gejendson, a Democrat from Connecticut.
"Voters want better choices," said Representative Robert J. Mrazek, a Long Island Democrat who is seeking his party's nomination to challenge Mr. D'Amato. "People are fed up with going to the hospital and bleeding on the floor and before they get treatment being asked who is going to pay for this. They don't like spending $6 billion a year in Korea when we can't spend half that much to send their kids to college. More and more people are saying 'I want the choices made for our kids.' "
 
Matter of Incumbency
 Several legislators noted that Washington State voters rejected an initiative to set term limits. That was good news for incumbents. Still they fared poorly in many races across the region.
In Suffolk County, a little-known Republican Assemblyman, Robert J. Gaffney, upset the incumbent, Patrick G. Halpin, who surprised even many of his Democratic colleagues four years ago when he ended 16 years of Republican control. And in neighboring Nassau County, a Republican stronghold for decades, Democrats made significant and unexpected gains. They now have enough votes on the Board of Supervisors to block even routine measures.
But incumbency did not necessarily spell defeat, even in Connecticut, where adoption of the first state income tax in history has superheated anti-tax fervor.
Mr. Andrews noted that in local races around his district, Democrats ran on pledges to freeze spending and did well, beating all three Republican incumbents running for re-election to the Camden County Board of Freeholders. That gave Democrats a 4-to-3 majority.
The New Jersey races, combined with the results in Pennsylvania, "give you one very clear picture and two very clear messages," Mr. Andrews said. "It tells Republicans that 'You better start paying attention to the economy and job creation and you better not think that a victory parade for the Persian Gulf war makes us all happy.' And for Democrats, 'If you think some harebrained tax scheme is going to put us back to work, think again.' "

HEADLINE: It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Dec. 26

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
It's never too early to go holiday shopping, and there is an especially good reason not to wait this year. Many department stores around the country have already posted Christmas sale prices on all kinds of merchandise, including clothing, housewares and home furnishings.
And for people who hope to find lower prices after Christmas on things that they need for themselves, rather than for gifts, the experts say the bargains may not be any better then. 
 Lingering consumer concern about the economy has led to extensive price promotions, especially in the Northeast and Southern California.
"Retailers are stimulating sales by putting things out at attractive prices," said James Posner, a New York retail consultant.
To be sure, shoppers are still buying products at regular prices, particularly new merchandise in desirable styles or colors. But a combination of early sales, clearances and special purchases from manufacturers has created a discount atmosphere in many department and specialty stores where Christmas bargains are rarely found before Dec. 26.
 
'No Reason to Wait'
 "There's no reason to wait until after Christmas to buy the kind of things you want to buy," said Philip Johnson, the president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a consumer research concern in Chicago. "Things are worse this year than last year in terms of willingness to spend."
"You'll see more promotional activity this year than last," said Lee Abraham, the chairman of the Associated Merchandising Corporation, the largest independent retail cooperative organization. "The consumer wants to be able to buy at the lowest possible price, and I don't think anything is sacred these days, with the exception of cosmetics and very few of the branded lines."
For several years, some retailers, particularly big department stores, have begun seasonal markdowns far ahead the actual holiday. This year, there is more of the same.
"Department store numbers have been pretty dismal," said Rosalind Wells, an economist for the NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, L.I. She was referring to sales figures for September and early October. "In general, discount stores are doing better than department stores."
A survey last month of 450 people by the Shapiro firm -- a sample representing the 93 million households in the United States -- showed that only 24 percent of the respondents planned to spend more on gifts this Christmas than last, compared with 28 percent at the same time in 1990. That is the lowest October percentage since the recession of 1981-'82. Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they intended to spend less, as against 44 percent last year.
And in the last week of October, the Conference Board, a business research group, reported that consumer confidence had dropped sharply in October -- a negative sign for Christmas spending. And because the selling season between Thanksgiving and Christmas is six days shorter in 1991 than it was last year, merchants are under pressure to attract more customers before Thanksgiving.
"Ten years ago, the philosophy used to be to run a sale during a slow period to get more business," said John J. Schultz, the executive director of the National Retail Federation, a trade association. "Now retailers have to do it during a peak period."
That means that some of the best Christmas values will be available this month. Since as much as 50 percent of the year's profits come in November and December, many stores are pricing as competitively as possible to insure that their sales will exceed those of the same period in 1990.
"It's hard to be patient in this world we're in, because it's such a precious time in terms of the bottom line for all retailers," said Gerald Mathews, an executive vice president of Saks Fifth Avenue. "Consumers who want some sense of specialness will find that higher quality products are not going to be available late."
"The longer you wait, the less likely you are to find a range of things to choose from," said Richard Feinberg, director of the Purdue University Retail Institute. "We already see Christmas sales occurring now, particularly in the Midwest."
Apparently, shoppers already know about this. In a study last month by Bruskin/Goldring Research of Edison, N.J., 38 percent of about 1,000 Americans surveyed said they would do most of their Christmas shopping in November, when the broadest assortment of goods will be available. What's more, adults plan to spend an average of $755 for Christmas gifts in 1991, down 12 percent from last year.
"Retailers are in for a pretty bleak Christmas unless they do something unusual," said Jeffrey N. Harris, vice president of marketing for Bruskin/ Goldring. "Whatever they did last year is not going to help this year."
One thing that more and more merchants are doing is emphasizing items that they have bought especially to put on sale now at lower prices. "Retailers have made special purchases that they plan to promote pre-Christmas," said Mr. Schultz of the retail federation. "Retailers want to sell now."
Also new this year is the wide variety of spring merchandise in the stores before Christmas, said Robert E. Salerno, a partner in New York of Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting and consulting firm. "This is the only way they've got to really drive people into the stores," he said.
What it all boils down to is that shoppers looking for price-cutting in the weeks ahead are almost certain to find it in many general merchandise categories. As Mr. Posner, the New York retail consultant, said: "There have been sales continuously: summer sales, back-to-school sales, Columbus Day sales, Election Day sales and now Christmas sales. It's just a renaming of sales."

HEADLINE: Finns Haven't Decided To Join Europe Yet

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Europeans in Accord to Create Vastly Expanded Trading Bloc' (front page, Oct. 23), describing formation of the European Economic Area, misinterprets Finland's policy on full membership in the European Community. Finland has not applied for community membership, nor has it decided to apply next spring. Rather, the Finnish Government has simply stated that next spring it will make a decision. A positive one is by no means inevitable. 
 While pro-European Community voices are heard in all the country's major political parties, no party has yet formally supported membership. Even if the governing coalition decided to join the community, it would need the President's approval, since the Finnish Constitution makes the President responsible for foreign policy. His official position, and thus Finland's, is to give the European Economic Area a trial run to see how it serves the country's interests and to watch the development of the E.C., especially its security policy.
There are other reasons that Finland might not join the E.C. next spring. Widespread public opposition to membership might increase as the economic area treaty is debated in Parliament and then implemented. The Prime Minister's Center Party represents agriculture, the sector of the Finnish economy that will suffer most from the agreement. Protected industries will be subject to freemarket competition.
A highly homogenous and xenophobic populace will encounter more people from other parts of Europe, a continent about which the Finns speak as if it were on the other side of the world.

HEADLINE: Can Machines Think? Humans Match Wits

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
A group of human judges chosen to represent the Boston man-in-the-street engaged in a three-hour battle of wits with a handful of computer programs today. The idea was to answer what many scientists and philosophers believe will become the central question of the information age: Can machines think?
It was hard to tell -- harder than one might have, pardon the expression, thought. 
 The judges typed questions into computer terminals and tried to decide from the responses whether they were communicating with a man or a machine. One program proved convincing enough to fool 5 of the 10 judges. Two other programs fooled some of the people for some of the time. But the humans had, uh, second thoughts and realized that what they had thought were human thoughts were actually coming from diskettes, hard drives, monitors and electricity.
 
Cutting Through a Debate
 The tournament was the first attempt to run a Turing Test, the experiment first proposed by the Britishmathematician Alan M. Turing 41 years ago as a simple way of cutting through the philosophical debate about whether a machine could ever be built to mimic the human mind. If a person communicating with such a machine could not tell whether it was a computer or human, Mr. Turing reasoned, the question would be resolved.
Throughout the afternoon, while the typed conversations between programs and judges flickered on large screens in an auditorium at the Boston Computer Museum, a group of scientists and philosophers grappled with the meaning of the event.
"If a computer were to pass an unrestricted Turing Test," said Daniel Dennett, a professor of cognitive studies at Tufts University, "it will raise a number of deep civil rights questions. For example, it would be a crime to unplug such a machine because it would be a person in a legal sense. Turing should be thought of as a pioneer in machine rights."
First prize went to a commercial software program called PC Therapist III, which was designed to engage its questioner in a whimsical conversation. The program was written by Joseph Weintraub, the president of Thinking Software Inc., a small artificial intelligence software company in Woodside, Queens.
At one point, another program suggested to a judge: "Perhaps you're not getting enough affection from your partner in the relationship."
"What are the key elements that are important in relationships in order toprevent conflict or problems?" the judge responded.
 
Thinks It Doesn't Think. . .
 "I think you don't think I think," answered the terminal.
"What kind of a response to a question is that?" asked the judge. "Nextquestion: Do you think romantic relationships are unrealistic, doomed from the start?"
"I do tend to walk around with my head in the clouds," the terminal said.
"Are you a romantic?" the judge queried.
"I take in whatever you ask," came the reply.
"Have you experienced problems in romantic relationships?"
"I try to be agreeable," responded the terminal.
Many of the watching experts, including scientists, philosophers and psychologists who assembled here, said they were surprised by the outcome. Computer experts said they could easily tell the human from the computer respondents. Unlike the untrained observers, the experts spotted the "common sense" mistakes that were an immediate giveaway, as when the computer would respond to a question other than the one asked.
There were several other confusing results. One of the human confederates, Cynthia Clay, who was judged "most human of all contestants," was nevertheless judged to be a computer by two judges.
But the deeper question of whether computers will ever be able to convincingly mimic human beings and what it will mean for the human spirit if they can, remained tantalizingly distant.
"These were real judges," said Oliver Strimpel, executive director of the Boston Computer Museum, one of the sponsors. "Maybe the Turing Test isn't as difficult as we first thought."
 
Hard to Tell Difference
 Mr. Turing believed that by the end of the century it would be possible to program computers to play an "imitation game" well enough so that an average human judge would not be able to determine if a conversation typed at a computer terminal was with a human "confederate" or a computer.
That assumption has become the subject of a bitter debate between scientists and philosophers who have taken sides on the question over whether the human mind will ever be reduced to a set of computer programs.
The first modern version of the Turing Test, made possible by the establishment of a $100,000 prize by the philanthropist Hugh Loebner and with the support of the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloane Foundation, was not the true test that Mr. Turing envisioned. Because of limitations in the programs' abilities, each was confined to discussing a narrow topic, such as women's clothing, romantic relationships or Burgundy wine. For winning the first contest, Mr. Weintraub was awarded $1,500.
"We're witnessing history today," said Keay Dewdney, a computer scientist at the University of Western Ontario and author of the Computer Recreations section in Scientific American.
 
At the Start: Oops!
 Still, like many of the mythical confrontations between human and computer in science fiction literature and cinema, the first interim Turing test involved a technical glitch.
The start of the contest was delayed almost 45 minutes while techniciansscrambled to sort out a problem that kept telephone lines connecting two of the human confederates to the contest busy. When it did start, the number of terminals and screens was reduced from the original 10 to eight.
Several members of the Loebner Prize committee said they thought that the glitch made judging harder.
Joseph Weizenbaum, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist, said that he was struck by how similar PC Therapist was to a program that he had written several decades ago called Eliza. Eliza became widely popular for engaging questioners in a simple nonsensical conversation. He said that such programs were very difficult to trick because it was difficult for humans to assess the nonsensical replies from the program.
After the contest, Mr. Dewdney said that he had quickly decided that there were six programs and two humans behind the terminals. But he was surprised when he heard that people were changing their minds about several programs late in the contest.
 
A Shakespeare Curve
 In particular, at a terminal which was discussing Shakespeare's plays, a great deal of confusion was inspired because the terminal kept changing its answer to the question, "What is your favorite play?"
One of the human judges, Lou-Anne Kroutil, a student and part-time auto mechanic, said she had been fooled by PC Therapist when it responsed with a nonsense answer.
"It typed something that I thought was trite, and when I responded it interacted with me in a very convincing fashion," she said.
Mr. Weintraub's program held a number of the audience spellbound. One conversation went as follows:
Terminal: A whim is a sudden capricious and often peculiar behavior. A bit of sunlight in a grim grey world!
Judge: Something like a hunch?
Terminal: Everybody sets out to do something and everybody does something, but no one does what he sets out to do.
Judge: Well anyway I would imagine whimsical converation is like a series of knight's moves in chess -- sort of zig-zag rather than following any particularline.
Terminal: A whimsical person is subject to erratic behavior and unpredictable thoughts. . . .how nice to be unpredicttable!
Judge: Are you kidding? Sure total predictablicity would make the world a dull place, but unpredictability is hardly a virtue!
After the contest was over Dr. Loebner pronounced himself satisified with the results and said that he felt that the Turing Test would now have a life of its own. Dr. Loebner is president of Crowne Industries, an equipment supply firm in Orange, N.J.
He said that he had thought of sponsoring a Turing Test seven years ago to stir interest in designing artificially intelligent programs.
Calling himself a "dyed-in-the-wool," utopian, he said that in bothliterature and science there has been a noble tradition by those whohave tried to build machines with human qualities.
The New York City philanthropist also revealed another, possibly more personal motivation in sponsoring the contest: "I'm in favor of 100 percent unemployment. I've always wanted computers to do all the work."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 18, 1991, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday about a contest in which computer programs tried to mimic human conversation referred incorrectly in some copies to a program that carried on a dialogue with human judges about romantic relationships. It was Turing, developed by Dr. Kenneth Colby and his son, Peter, both of Malibu Artifactual Intelligence Works of Malibu, Calif. An article about a winner in the contest appears today on page 21.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Selects Panel to Review City's Hospitals

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday named the members of a commission charged with conducting a "head to toe" review of the city hospitals. The panel includes prominent doctors and lawyers but no one from the front lines of the hospitals themselves.
Union leaders representing doctors and hospital workers questioned whether the 18-member commission could impartially scrutinize contracts between medical schools and the municipal hospitals, known as "affiliate agreements," which some critics say are at the heart of the hospitals' problems. Some of the new commissioners have ties to medical schools that have multimillion-dollar contracts with the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. 
 "This is an establishment board," said Dr. Donald C. Meyer, executive director of the Doctors Council, a physicians union. "It's stacked heavily with people I would consider pro-affiliation. We have no faith in what this commission can come up with."
 
Appointments Defended
 But the head of the panel, Dr. Jeremiah Barondess, president of the New York City Academy of Physicians, defended the appointment of doctors who are associated with the affiliated medical schools, saying they know the details of the arrangements between the hospitals and medical schools.
"It's hard for me to imagine how to approach the affiliation issue with all of its sensitivities and complexities in an intelligent way at arms length," he said. "I really do think we need to have people with current expertise."
Mayor Dinkins asked Dr. Barondess to form the commission last month after a series of deaths in the city hospital system stirred a firestorm of complaints about the quality of care at municipal hospitals, which have been hit hard by budget cuts. Dr. Barondess said the panel would interview workers, patients, doctors and administrators and hoped to issue a final report in six to eight months.
Among the commissioners are two physicians on the faculty at Columbia University's medical school, which is affiliated with Harlem Hospital, the site of two deaths investigated in recent months. They are Dr. Gerald E. Thomson, an associate medical school dean, and Dr. Sterling B. Williams Jr., a gynecology professor.
These are the other members:
Carol Bellamy, ex-City Council President.
Richard A. Berman, former New York University Medical School official who is now on the New York State Health Care Financing Commission.
June Christmas, former mental health commissioner, mayoral adviser and psychiatry professor at Columbia.
Robert A. Derzon, former deputy commissioner of New York City hospitals.
Eli Ginzberg, Columbia economics professor.
Dr. Paul P. Griner, director of medicine at the Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester.
Dr. Robert M. Heyssel, president of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
Peter Johnson, lawyer and adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Bogart R. Leashore, the dean at Hunter College School of Social Work.
Stanley H. Lowell, a former Deputy Mayor.
Dr. Eric Munoz, director of the University of Medicine and Dentistry at New Jersey's University Hospital.
Ildaura Murillo-Rohde, former professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College.
Diana T. Murray, former vice president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Howard Newman, dean of Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University.
Dr. Samuel O. Thier, former chairman of the Yale University Department of Medicine.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS: German Official's Remarks Help Dollar to Move Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved upward yesterday, once again influenced by apparent interest rate trends.
 Gold prices were mixed. 
Analysts said the dollar drew support from comments by Helmut Schlesinger, the president of Germany's central bank, who said he was not sure another increase in German interest rates was necessary.
 Mr. Schlesinger's statement depressed the mark, which, like all currencies, gains strength from higher interest rates. The prospect that German rates would not be rising would make interest rates in the United States more competitive, and the remarks helped the dollar yesterday.
 The dollar rose to 1.6485 marks in New York, from 1.6410 late Thursday. In earlier European trading, the dollar advanced to 1.6415 German marks from 1.6305.
 The dollar was also helped by the belief that United States rates are unlikely to fall much further after the Federal Reserve's move this week to drop the discount rate. The Fed lowered the interest it charges commercial banks to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent.
 Mike Faust, a currency market analyst with MMS International, said the dollar had reached the high end of a broad trading range and could move higher if it was able to break through 1.6500 marks.
 He described the market as quiet, with traders waiting for inflation figures to be released by the Government next week.
 The British pound lost ground against the dollar, falling to $1.7630 in New York from $1.7705. Sterling also fell in London, closing at $1.7680, compared with $1.7800 late Thursday.
 The dollar gained against the Japanese yen, rising to 130.43 from 129.865 in New York. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 130.23 yen, from 129.93 Thursday, and in London it rose to 130.25 yen.
 Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.4550 Swiss francs, up from 1.4480; 5.6345 French francs, up from 5.6055; 1,240.00 Italian lire, up from 1,234.50, and 1.13125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.12225.

Is Ski Business Healthy? Check the Snowfall

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
By last spring, the ski industry looked like a recreational version of the savings and loan industry. The number of people skiing was down, there had been poor-to-terrible snowfalls on the East and West coasts and the recession had hit everywhere. Rumors spread that ski areas were closing and dismantling lifts.
All of the above is true, but over the summer, managers at many ski areas appeared to ignore these problems and plunged ahead with new projects. Whitetail, a new ski area in Pennsylvania, was completed and is scheduled to open in December. Seventeen areas across the country built 24 new lifts, major snowmaking projects were installed at 20 resorts. A number of areas, including Sunday River, Me., Okemo, Vt., and Keystone and Beaver Creek, Colo., expanded skiing terrain to adjacent mountains. 
 By this fall, as early snowfalls came to the Rockies and temperatures in the East dropped to snowmaking levels, the bad news seemed like a bad dream. Some ski areas in New England and Colorado opened earlier than they had in many years.
"There's a great deal of strength in the ski market in terms of the demand side," said Marvin Kottke, a research economist in Storrs, Conn. Kottke traces skier participation, an industry term for the number of people skiing at ski areas measured by the number of lift tickets sold. "The last two years are an exception in snowfalls and that was the major reason there was less participation. When there is good snow, skiers ski."
 
'You Become Addicted'
 Kottke speculates that if snowfall figures were charted alongside skier participation, the two indicators would probably be parallel. (Kottke said that no one, to his knowledge, has ever plotted skier participation figures and average snowfall in this way, but that it would be a valuable index for the ski industry.) Last season, skier participation across the country dropped by 6.6 percent; in the Northeast it was down 16 percent and in the Pacific West 13 percent. But in the Rocky Mountains it was up 4.1 percent because they had a good snow year.
The recession also had an impact on the industry, and it could be even worse this season, particularly in the East. But John Lay prefers to look on the positive side. As president of Colorado Ski Country, a ski area trade association, he maintains that skiers' loyalty makes the sport relatively recession-proof. "The cruise industry is down and Hawaiian travel is down and theme parks are down," he said. "The issue is what people do with their disposable income. Once you ski, you become addicted and you continue to ski."
That indicates there could be a return to the slopes by many temporary dropouts, according to Lay. He sees growth as families return with their children, as women show more interest in improving skills and as foreign tourists -- possibly the fastest growing segment of the industry -- come to ski in the United States.
Ted Farwell, an economist in Boulder, Colo., who studies the ski industry, projects a one to two percent annual growth in the number of skiers over the next decade. This is not great but, as Farwell points out, it's not stagnant either.
Vermont ski areas had a steady growth in the number of skiers until last season when participation dropped from 4.6 million in 1989-90 to 4.1 million visits. "When you consider the Persion Gulf War, a week of rain at Christmas, which is normally the busiest period, and a bad economy, those figures aren't so bad," said Candy Moot, associate director of Vermont Ski Areas Association.
But ski areas in Vermont have also experienced more than the normal number of failures in recent years, and Magic Mountain, Ascutney, Haystack and Burke are in trouble. This season, Haystack will be operated by Mt. Snow and Burke will reopen under new ownership. Both Moot and Lay say the failure of smaller areas like these that do not have specific market niches is inevitable.
"In the ski industry, the economies of scale indicate that you have to be bigger to compete and provide the facilities that skiers want and demand," said Moot.
In both the East and West, there is a trend toward consolidation as larger areas take over smaller areas. "Actually more ski areas are changing hands rather than failing," said Farwell. "The big ones don't fail, but with mergers, successful areas bring weak areas into their companies."
Farwell said that out of about 600 ski areas in the United States, 31 are in some sort of trouble.
Unlike the ski-area side of the industry, ski equipment and clothing have taken a bigger hit in terms of dollars spent. At the end of last season, there were larger-than-usual inventories left in shops and warehouses. And, this season the pre-season orders of ski shops were down 35 to 40 percent, according to Bill Lawless, who heads Sports Research, Inc., a market research firm in Princeton, N.J., that tracks ski-shop business.
"Buying new equipment and ski clothing is more discretionary than going skiing," said Lawless. "So the ski retailer gets yo-yoed more than ski areas. I think there's a lot of pent-up demand. If we get good snow, the shops could run out of ski equipment and merchandise."

HEADLINE: NOTED WITH PLEASURE

 BODY:

Thinking Like a Mountain
 
Scott Russell Sanders, while tracing the history and uses of limestone, reflects on the peculiar solace a contemplation of stone offers. This is from "In Limestone Country" (Beacon, paper).  
 There is nothing like geology to take the urgency out of the morning's news. If we could watch events from the rock's point of view, all of human history, from the stalking of wooly mammoths to the launching of space shuttles, would appear like a blinding flash. Our longest running shows, such as Egypt or China, would be mere buzzings in the ears of stones. . . . Rocks won't keep much record of our brief transit. For all our drilling and blasting, we have barely scratched this stony planet.
If you find comfort in that, if the rush and sizzle of life make you hunger for durable goods, if your blood pressure goes up and down with the stock market or baseball scores or political polls, if you fret about pulling off the monthly balancing act in your checkbook, if the world has spun you dizzy -- you would do well to spend some time in stony country.
 
Learning to See the Patterns

 
 In contrast to the world view of traditional cultures, the Western obsession with specialization leaves us with a fragmented, misleading portrait of life, according to Helena Norberg-Hodge, who bases her argument on her study of the Ladakh region of the Himalayas. This is from "Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh" (Sierra Club).
We need to return to a more empathetic relationship with the living world and learn to see broader patterns, process, and change. Nowadays, one biologist does not speak the same language as another, unless they are both studying the same kind of fruit fly. How can we understand life by breaking it into fragments and freezing it in time? Our static and mechanistic world view has reached its limits, and some scientists -- particularly quantum physicists -- now speak of a paradigm shift away from the old "building block" view of reality to a more organic one. In direct opposition to the trend in mainstream culture toward greater specialization, we need to actively promote the generalist -- the one who sees connections and makes links across different disciplines.
 
The Universal Dinner

 
 One unintentional effect of the European discovery of America, Raymond Sokolov notes, was the creation for the first time of a truly international cuisine. This is from "Why We Eat What We Eat: How the Encounter Between the New World and the Old Changed the Way Everyone on the Planet Eats" (Summit).
From a biological point of view, the history of human gastronomy since 1492 exhibits a rich proliferation of new genera branching from common ancestors. Their evolution has proceeded in two spurts (the two periods of rapid change: after Columbus and today), bringing with them some extinction of species (individual dishes), but even these, in great part, can be resuscitated because their raw materials still survive and their genetic information has been preserved in recipes from the past. . . . From a social perspective the history of eating over the last five hundred years can be described as an international process in which the products and customs of all the different places and cultures in the world have become increasingly available to all people at all times. In principle the culinary life we owe Columbus is a progressive dinner in which the whole human race takes part but no one need leave home to sample all the courses.
 
Tongues of Men and Angels

 
 Memory, the educator Clara Claiborne Park reminds us, is at the heart of our ability to create. This is from "Rejoining the Common Reader: Essays, 1962-1990" (Northwestern University).
Creative thinking of any kind requires more than just knowing where to look things up; you have to know that they're there before you know you need them. The mind is the greatest of computers, and it works its marvels best when well stored -- with facts: names, dates, places, events, sequences -- and also with language: words, phrases, sentences, the tongues of men and of angels. Perhaps language is the most important of all. We all notice the contraction in the range of reference of the young. But facts can be looked up. . . . What's harder to acquire -- in adulthood hard indeed -- is that intimacy with language, that sense for different ways of using it, which grows naturally when we carry Shakespeare and the Bible, Jefferson and Lincoln, Eliot and Yeats, Edward Lear and P. G. Wodehouse in our heads. In our heads or, better, in another part of the body, where we "learn by heart" -- in the unconscious, where . . . all the richness of what we know and value can come together in unexpected, unheard-of combinations.
 
Finding Our Common Destiny

 
 The sociologist Robert Wuthnow probes the causes of compassionate action in this excerpt from "Acts of Compassion: Caring for Others and Helping Ourselves" (Princeton University).
The life of compassion. . . . provides a way of expressing our concerns about materialism and its corrosive effects on human life. In this sense, compassion stands for something larger even than itself. It reminds us of our humanity and therefore of the deeper qualities that are essential to our common human existence. . . . In thinking about compassion, we remember that not all of life depends on efficient, large-scale organization and a productive economy. If only by negative example, we create a space in which to think about our dependence on one another, the needs that can never be fulfilled by bureaucracies and material goods, and the joys that come from attending to those needs. Above all, compassion gives us hope -- both that the good society we envision is possible and that the very act of helping each other gives us strength and a common destiny.

 One autumn morning 11-year-old Clay Garrity wakes up in a welfare hotel in Manhattan and discovers that his mother has left him. Clay's father, who has also disappeared, is an unemployed magazine art director. His mother, until recently, had a job working with computers. Clay is white, he has been to good schools (he can read "Robinson Crusoe") -- an atypical homeless child. He is the hero of "Monkey Island," Paula Fox's delicate and moving novel, one of the first describing middle-class homelessness for young readers.
The sight of homeless people pushing shopping carts down the street or sleeping on benches in local parks has become a fact of life, and for children they are the ultimate representation of a terrifying fantasy -- of parents leaving, of loss and displacement. How does a writer make the unbearable bearable without violating the basic truth of the situation?
Ms. Fox, who has won an American Book Award for children's fiction for her novel "A Place Apart," the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for her collected children's work and a Newbery Medal for the young adult novel "The Slave Dancer," has written a relentless story that succeeds in conveying the bitter facts.
She depicts life in a welfare hotel precisely: the way Clay's pregnant mother needs the sound of a portable radio all the time to drown out her increasing despair; the way the woman next door cares -- alone and lovingly -- for her retarded son who sits all day watching television, "his feet turned out like a duck's feet." The elevator is a "a poison box," the halls are littered with trails of coffee grounds from leaking garbage bags. A trip to the bathroom can be a dangerous journey.
Eventually, Clay makes his way to a city park -- called "Monkey Island" by thugs who prey on homeless people there. Like most of the newly homeless, Clay has trouble sleeping. The recent arrivals "were in a panic for days," one character observes. "They were also the angriest if someone or something woke them up in the middle of the night." Life is a constant, primal search. A portable toilet at a construction site is a gift, a broken water fountain means no way to wash that day. For an old woman, counting her few possessions over and over again is "a kind of housekeeping."
Although the focus of Ms. Fox's story is a middle-class family, she never lets us forget the way race and class affect destiny. When Clay catches pneumonia, his black friend, Buddy, wants to take him to a hospital but knows a taxi probably will not stop for him. "Nigger is the longest word I know," says Buddy.
Eventually, Clay is placed in a foster home where people are kind. But, one wonders, how will Ms. Fox ever resolve Clay's abandonment? Will she stage a scene of false forgiveness? When Clay and his mother are finally reunited, his mother doesn't ask Clay to forgive her. "Sorry can't erase all that," his mother says. She can only hope that one day she and Clay will find a way "to go on caring for each other that's . . . beyond sorry."
 "Fly Away Home" is about a homeless boy, Andrew, about 6 years old, who is living in an airport with his father. But the author, Eve Bunting, makes homelessness seem almost like fun. The airport is clean, and there seems to be enough to eat -- a lot of it sugar. Andrew says he doesn't mind having to walk all the time. Judging from Ronald Himler's watercolor illustrations, Andrew and his father even have reasonably nice clothes.
Although we're told -- sketchily -- that Andrew's mother has died and his father has only a part-time job, that's not enough explanation. There's needless stereotyping: Andrew's father says school is "important. We'll work it out," while Mrs. Medina, the mother of Andrew's Hispanic friend, says her son "can wait for a while" to go to school. There is something lazy about this story book, which is intended for 5- to 9-year-olds.
"Mr. Bow Tie" is a picture book about homelessness for even younger children, in this case 4- to 8-year-olds. Mr. Bow Tie is a homeless man who always wears a bow tie somewhere on his person -- young readers will enjoy finding it in each picture. But with his wonderful, brightly-colored clothes, he doesn't bear much resemblance to any homeless people they've known. He is luckily befriended by a family who let him take a bath. Although he never says a word, the family is miraculously able to find out who he is simply by taking him "downtown to a big office." To make things all the more palatable, it turns out Mr. Bow Tie may be an aristocrat too -- Elliot Lyman Bristow, with parents willing to take care of him, insane though he is.
The author and illustrator, Karen Barbour, has turned homelessness into a fantasy of color and reunion that is nice to look at, but the Matisse-like drawings with their flattened perspective give little information and provide no understanding. Both of these books for younger children are essentially fairy tales, and condescending ones. Even a 4-year-old can recognize loss and dishevelment on the street. Young readers need -- and deserve -- to understand homelessness. Only "Monkey Island" attempts an accurate picture and succeeds in moving us. And Clay Garrity understands just how different his fate is from that of so many other homeless children. Not everyone is reunited with a loving parent and ends up in a nice apartment that smells all "soapy," "fresh" and "new."

HEADLINE: The House We Lived In

BYLINE: By Katie Hafner; Katie Hafner is the author, with John Markoff, of "Cyberpunk," published this year, and is working on a book about German reunification.

 BODY:
IT WAS APRIL OF 1990, JUST A FEW MONTHS after the toppling of the Berlin wall, when Paul and Christine Wallich first visited the family home they had never known. They anticipated the worst. From the reports they had received in the United States, they imagined the house fit only to be razed.
The house stood in Potsdam, just across the Havel River from Berlin's western edge. The eerie silence of this spot a few dozen yards from the Glienicke Bridge, once a heavily guarded border zone and famous as the point for East-West spy exchanges during the cold war, had already been replaced by the clamor of a city busy making up for lost time. Tourists stood on the river's shore, snapping photos of the palaces and grand houses across the water. A construction crew was removing the remains of the wall and barbed wire separating Potsdam from West Berlin. 
 As the two siblings approached the house, its crumbling facade seemed to confirm their fears. It was so derelict it might have been abandoned. However, a tall second-story window decorated with colorful bumblebees and flowers suggested not just a presence but the presence of children.
The Wallichs were greeted at the door by a middle-aged woman who spoke German in an accent that suggested origins in the heart of eastern Germany. They introduced themselves as the grandchildren of Paul and Hildegard Wallich, the former owners. Helga Neumann was polite but guarded. She explained that for the past 40 years the house had been a Kinderwochenheim, a uniquely East German child-care arrangement that mixes day-care center with boarding school.
Once inside, they were surprised to find the house in reasonably good repair. The original oak floors were preserved beneath a yellow-orange linoleum. Only a few functional concessions had been made; one former bedroom had been given over to a dozen miniature sinks and toilets. The dumbwaiter had been plastered over because it was too dangerous for the children. The marble fireplace in the formal living room had been transformed into a puppet theater.
Paul and Christine Wallich, descendants of a prominent Berlin banker, have staked two claims: on the Potsdam house and on a once-elegant family farm in the tiny village of Jerchel, 50 miles west of Berlin. Theirs is an example of a peculiar and difficult process that is taking place at an equally peculiar point in history. It illustrates both the good and the bad consequences of returning property to its original owners, and it demonstrates that the transition from socialism to capitalism has produced unexpected victims.
In 1990, in a decision to right the wrongs committed first by the Nazis and then by the Communists, the two Germanys agreed to the return of any property that had been confiscated after 1933, with the exception of property seized between 1945 and 1949, during the Soviet occupation. (The Soviets agreed to German unification only if those expropriations were exempted.) If property cannot be given back, its owners are to be compensated.
More than anything, perhaps, Germany's decision to return property is a decision to confront its own history in some unexpected ways. "Germany's past is being brought home to everyone in a very individual, personal way," says Robert Gerald Livingston, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington. At the same time, it is a decision in keeping with the aspect of unity that resembles a takeover more than a reunification. Since the decision was made, nearly 1.3 million claims have been placed on property throughout the former East Germany.
The right to private property holds a hallowed place in the Constitution of the German Federal Republic. But now the Constitution is at odds with German reunification. The issue of who is entitled to what has created a bottleneck in the privatizing of East German businesses and has opened old wounds and added to existing tensions between western and eastern Germans. "Believe me, this is not just a legal question," says Richard M. Buxbaum, director of the Center for German and European Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. "It's a straight gut-reaction question."
WALLICH IS A NAME STILL RECOGNIZED IN German banking circles. Hermann Wallich, born in 1833, was the son of a Jewish merchant; he became a banker and played an integral role in the establishment of the Deutsche Bank in 1870. Together with Georg von Siemens, Wallich laid the foundation for the global reach the bank eventually attained. He remained active in the bank until shortly before his death in 1928.
Hermann was a sober and practical man. Concerned about growing anti-Semitism in Germany, he arranged to have both his children, Paul and Ilse, baptized at birth and raised them as Christians. Paul also pursued a banking career, and Paul's son Henry became one of the United States's leading authorities on international finance and a longtime member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board. The tradition has carried into a fourth generation with Christine, now in her 30's, who is a principal economist at the World Bank in Washington. (Christine's brother, Paul, with whom she visited the house, is a journalist, and her sister, Anna, is a clinical social worker.)
The common history of the Wallich family and the house at the Glienicke Bridge began in 1878, when Hermann's wife, Anna, inherited the house from her father. Built 33 years earlier by a courtier to the royal Hohenzollern family, the house was a masterpiece of classic Italianate architecture. It became an integral part of an esthetic whole, rounding out a constellation of castles and mansions along the river, prized by German architecture critics.
But it was a summer house, too cold and drafty for Anna, and when the weather turned the Wallichs returned to their Berlin apartment. Still, their son, Paul, had a special attachment to the house, and when his father turned it over to him in 1910, he installed his family there and later built an extra wing.
In 1931, Paul transferred title of the house to his wife, Hildegard, a Gentile. But despite his friends' urgings, Paul Wallich didn't leave Nazi Germany. On Nov. 9, 1938, the day of Kristallnacht, the window-shattering riot against Jews and their property, Hildegard called Paul at work and told him not to come home, because the Gestapo was waiting outside the house. Paul fled to Cologne. Two days later, he put stones in his pockets and drowned himself in the Rhine.
A year after her husband's death, Hildegard went to the United States for a brief, recuperative visit with relatives, including her son Henry, who had moved to New York in 1935. (Her other son, Walter, had left Germany for England in the early 1930's.) While she was there, war broke out. Hildegard started a new life in America.
Throughout the war, the chauffeur and the cook lived in the house and stood guard over it, including during periods of occasional occupation by German and Russian officers. After the war, Hildegard's son Walter returned from England, as part of the British forces occupying Berlin, and found everything remarkably intact. Hardly a piece of crystal had been disturbed. Walter packed up all the household items and sent them to family members who had fanned out to New York, Buenos Aires and London.
The house has since stood as silent witness to the events of recent decades. It went untouched by the bombs that fell on Potsdam during the war. In 1950, the East German Government decided the house should be used for child care. Parents working night shifts, or overburdened single parents, could leave their children for the week and take them for the weekend. Inexplicably, bulldozers spared the house in 1961, as the Berlin wall cut a swath 50 feet from the front door.
The American Wallichs maintained strong ties to Germany, spending summers and sabbaticals near Frankfurt. In the presence of their strong-willed grandmother, Hildegard, Henry's children spoke German. And the Potsdam house has remained part of the family's collective memory.
In the Wallich house in New Haven, where Henry taught economics at Yale, watercolors of the house as it appeared at the beginning of the century served as a reminder of what had been left behind. "People would walk into our entrance hall and see the pictures and sigh and ask about it and we'd say, 'That's the house we didn't grow up in,' " says Henry's daughter Christine.
"Heimat" is a German word that defies precise translation and for which there is no English equivalent. It means home and it means place of birth. Heimat is also a state of mind and means the place where one feels at home. Henry, who had a strong emotional tie to the house where he grew up, started trying to go back to see it as early as 1952.
It wasn't until 1979 that Henry was finally granted a visa to East Germany. But he could barely see it, even from the Potsdam side, because the house stood inside a restricted border zone. Henry died in 1988, at the age of 74. His children also made several pilgrimages to Berlin. From the opposite bank of the Havel River, which separates Berlin from Potsdam, they could just see the house's cupola peeking above the wall.
THE FORMER EAST Germany is well ahead of most other Eastern European countries in the process of restitution for property. Of all the other countries in Eastern Europe where democracy is taking root, only Czechoslovakia and Hungary have taken significant measures to return property or compensate former owners.
Czechoslovakia has passed two major laws. According to one, property that was confiscated between 1948 and 1989 is to be returned. To qualify, one must be both a Czech citizen and a resident. According to the other, property seized after 1955 is to be returned, but only if no compensation has already been paid.
The Hungarian Parliament decided against the outright return of property and recently adopted a bill that will provide compensation bonds for property lost. "We can only decide which is more unjust," says Zoltan Banyasz, vice consul at the Hungarian Consulate in New York. "It's unjust to the former owner if you don't give property back, and it's unjust to the current occupant if you do."
But those who have lobbied for the return of property in Germany see it as an issue that must be viewed through the prism of German history. "The return of property is one of the few ways of making good on past wrongs," says Jost von Trott zu Solz, a prominent Berlin lawyer who, like many other lawyers in Berlin, now works almost exclusively with property claims. "If someone tried to flee over the wall and was caught and spent years in jail and his property was taken away from him, you can't just say, 'Oh, we're so sorry.' The confiscation was wrong. His property should be given back."
But the decision has exacted its price. As soon as the decision was made, claims started arriving by the tens of thousands. Letters came from Israel and New York and Mozambique. Many were accompanied by documents supporting the claim, like a deed or a page from a will.
Many other letters arrived with nothing but a vague memory of property owned somewhere. "A lot of these claims start with a postcard from Miami saying: 'My Uncle Max had a shoe factory somewhere in Dresden. I don't know what it was called. Do you think we can get it back?' " says von Trott zu Solz. The claims offices are obligated to address even such vague claims.
For several months, clerks did nothing but empty mailbags and sort letters. Each claim was assigned a number. Then began the painstaking task of entering them into computers, a process that is still going on. Arno Wegener, the director of the property claims office for all of Berlin, where some 120,000 claims are pending, estimates that at the rate things are going, it will take another 40 years before all are settled. "Many of these aren't going to get settled until they're settled in court," he says. "And that means years and years."
IN SOME RESPECTS, THE Wallich case is less than typical. For many claimants, there is no sentimental attachment; they see it as a way to become instant millionaires. The Wallich family's stake in the property is more emotional than financial. And unlike most of the claims to former family homes, the claim to the Potsdam villa means comparatively little for the future of the current residents; the kindergarten's days may be numbered anyway. Not only are public funds for child care dwindling throughout eastern Germany, but weekly kindergartens like this one might be phased out altogether. And the Wallichs have been spared the added frustration of seeing their claim compete with others on the same piece of property.
The most complex cases are those where two, three or even four claims have been made to one piece of property. Such is often the case where a "forced sale" was involved, in which Jewish owners were required to sell their homes or businesses at a price well below market value to an "Aryan." The "Aryan" to whom they sold it might then have subsequently fled East Germany and sold it to someone else, from whom it might then have been confiscated by the state. According to the new claims law, the heirs of the original Jewish owner are entitled to the property.
The most important source of proof is the Grundbuch, or title registry, where German officials keep a careful log of each piece of property and its ownership. As property was gradually turned into Volk seigentum, or people's property, in East Germany, such records were no longer necessary. The books were closed and placed in a haphazard kind of storage. Many of the old registry books are now simply missing. In those that do still exist, particularly in the case of property with a history of Jewish ownership, many of the entries have been blacked out in crucial places. When western officials went to inspect registry offices in Berlin last year, they found pigeons nesting among the books.
When a registry entry cannot be found, officials rely on other sources of confirmation, like tax records or even old telephone books. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, an organization established to seek reparations and compensation on behalf of Holocaust survivors, is now pressing property claims on behalf of all Jews without heirs or on unclaimed Jewish property. The property would be turned over to the conference and be used for social programs benefiting Holocaust survivors. The claims conference relies heavily on a so-called C-List, which lists property with Jewish ownership. The list was apparently compiled by the East German Government in an effort to compensate those whose property had been confiscated by the Nazis.
If land is being used in a way that prevents its return -- for example, the huge television tower placed on Alexanderplatz, where a bakery once stood -- then the previous owner is to receive financial compensation. But it is unclear what the extent of compensation will be and on what it will be based. It is estimated that the Bonn Government will have to pump more than $1 trillion into the rebuilding of eastern Germany in the next decade, and full compensation at today's market values could push the country to financial ruin. Moreover, over the past 40 years the Federal Republic has already paid some $4 billion to West German citizens for property and assets they left behind in East Germany. One idea in Bonn Government circles is to pay 30 percent over the property's appraised worth in 1935. Any compensation the owner has already received would probably be deducted.
MANY WHO LEFT EAST Germany, or whose parents or grandparents left, have made sentimental journeys to their Heimat. A few found things just as they had left them. Others found not the house they remembered but a structure standing in utter disrepair. Still others discovered that their houses had long since been torn down.
Shortly after the wall fell, Sonja and Carl-Heinz Wilhelmi traveled from their home near Frankfurt to Gotha, a city southwest of Berlin, to see Sonja's family house. They arrived at a ruin. A lack of funds, materials and motivation through the years had conspired to turn the house into a dilapidated eyesore. To make matters worse, in the final days of the Communist regime, the East German Government, claiming emiment domain, had seized land directly adjacent to the house and built a large gymnasium, whose presence would intrude on anyone living on the property. The house has now been returned, and they would like to have it torn down.
The Wilhelmis also applied to reclaim a family printing plant in Gotha, which has long since become part of an amalgamation of small presses throughout eastern Germany. The land has been returned to them, but the Wilhelmis, now in their 60's, have no plans to run the plant. Instead, they have applied for compensation.
Those who haven't made the trip back have little way of knowing what became of their property in the 40 years of socialism. The first piece of news the Wallichs received from their Berlin lawyer was that though the house was still standing, it was such a ruin that it should be torn down. A gas station, the lawyer suggested, might be the best solution for such a well-traveled spot.
East Germans have begun to live in dread of seeing a car with western license plates parked near their homes and strangers stalking the grounds with a camera in hand, since they assume the visitors are former owners on a surveying mission. When Barbara Howard, an American radio journalist living in Berlin, went to pay a visit last spring to a family in eastern Berlin, the family panicked at the sight of her Mercedes coming up the drive, mistaking her for the house's former owner.
Rainer Hanke, a 34-year-old engineer, spent four years building a house in Klein Machnow, a small tree-lined Berlin suburb where many Berliners used to have weekend homes and that later became a favorite retreat for party officials. Eighty-five percent of all the property in Klein Machnow now has a claim pending. One day earlier this year, the Hanke family received a letter from a western German claiming that the property was his and demanding rent for use of the land. He showed up a few weeks later with his camera and told the Hanke family to prepare to move. He also told them that the house was not done to his taste and he would probably have it torn down. The Hankes plan to dispute his claim.
"This house is our life's work, and now we're being driven out by our own people," says Rainer Hanke. "There's been lots of injustice but we shouldn't be punished for it."
There are some stories that could end happily for both sides. Tania Kroy-Wisbar and her sister, Maria Hansen, the daughters of the late film maker Frank Wisbar, are in the process of reclaiming a family shoe factory, the object of a forced sale, in the town of Burg, southwest of Berlin. Last month, they were recognized as the rightful owners. They have now presented a business plan to the Treuhandanstalt, the organization charged with reprivatizing East German businesses. Though now in their 50's, they are considering moving from their current homes in Southern California to run the business themselves.
The sisters' success hinged on their ability to prove they were the rightful owners. It was an arduous process of sifting through archives and telephone books, even trying to remove the black ink that obscured their entry in the title registry.
The Wallichs have had an easier time. After their initial visit with Helga Neumann at the kindergarten in early 1990, Christine and Paul Wallich went to the title registry office in downtown Potsdam, where they found that their grandmother Hildegard was still entered in the registry as the most recent private owner. In fact, she was registered as the rightful owner until 1983, when the East German Government, in a curious but not unusual case of confiscatory taxation, took over the property and turned it into "people's property." Christine returned with her mother last fall and visited the house again. The family's Berlin lawyer then filed a formal claim.
The Wallich claim is one of 6,000 in Potsdam. Some 85 percent of the property in the city's downtown area is the object of claims. Someone has even filed a claim on the building in which the claims office sits. To date, just under 100 pieces of property have been returned.
West German-born Monika Hagen, 30, one of several lawyer-administrators in the Potsdam office, is in charge of deciding the Wallich case. At the end of October, she indicated she would find that the house should indeed revert to the Wallichs. Technically, she says, theirs is not a Jewish claim. The house was already in Hildegard's name in 1931, and the law covers only property that was in Jewish hands after 1933, when Hitler came to power.
So the Wallich claim will be decided strictly on whether the Wallichs can be established as the most recent private owner. On this point, there appears to be no doubt. The only snag that could come is if the city agency in charge of the kindergarten decides to challenge it.
The house stands under landmark protection and cannot be torn down. Richard Rohrbein, the director of city development in Potsdam, would like to see it restored to its original condition and turned into a museum. "It's important not just because of its relationship to the rest of the palaces along the river," he says, "but because it's literally the first building you see when you drive over the bridge."
The family's lawyer is already receiving inquiries from real-estate developers, who presumably are interested not only in the house but in its acreage. At least once a week, someone inquires if the house is for sale. Since the wall fell, property values in Berlin and its surrounding area have soared, and the decision in June to move the German capital from Bonn to Berlin means that Potsdam is likely once again to become the exclusive residential community it was in the days of Paul and Hildegard Wallich.
Monika Hagen's preliminary decision is expected this month. Of the 12 legal heirs, only Christine has considered living there.
IF THE POTSDAM HOUSE IS A symbol, the one-time Wallich farm in Jerchel is a symptom. Jerchel epitomizes the beleaguered condition of the former East Germany in general, and farms in particular. Of the 350 people who live there, more than half are unemployed.
When they weren't in the house in Potsdam or their apartment in Berlin, Hermann and Anna Wallich were on the farm. Their property spread over some 1,500 acres and accounted for about a third of the entire village. Its centerpiece was a splendid old farmhouse. It was a patrician farm, to be sure, but a working one, the family is quick to point out, with crops and animals and a full vegetable garden.
Paul and Ilse Wallich inherited the farm from their parents, and in 1936, to protect themselves and the property from the Nazis, they transferred title to their spouses, Hildegard Wallich and Oskar Mulert.
Shortly after the war, in 1946, Oskar and Ilse were stripped of the property in the first wave of Soviet land reform. They were promised title to 23 acres, but never received the actual deed and moved back to Berlin. In 1958, in the process of forced collectivization, 20 farmers in the area put all they had into the formation of one large farm collective, with the Wallich property at its hub. In the Stalin era, the East German Government ordered that the Wallich house, an unwelcome reminder of Jerchel's aristocratic past, be torn down, but the commmunity protested.
There are few remaining signs of the idyll enjoyed by the Wallich family. The tennis court has long since disappeared beneath the brush, and the swimming hole is now an indentation in a field of weeds and wildflowers. A dozen or so underfed cows are all that's left of the collectivized farm that, like thousands of others in eastern Germany, is headed for bankruptcy.
Christine and Paul visited Jerchel during their trip in early 1990. When they introduced themselves to Karl Granzow, who now runs the farm, he gave them a baffled look. But when an elderly worker pointed to the "AW" above the front door, his face lit up. "It was very touching," says Christine. "He very nearly said, 'Welcome home.' "
Jerchel is less of a preoccupation with the Wallichs than the Potsdam house, perhaps because the chances of getting it all back are far slimmer. Last April, in a move to speed up the privatization of state businesses, Germany's highest court upheld the agreement between the two Germanys and ruled that no property would be returned that was seized during the Soviet occupation. The court's decision affects about eight million acres, or nearly a third of eastern Germany's total land area, including the Wallich property in Jerchel. At most, the family will probably receive just the 23 acres, and may eventually receive compensation for the remainder.
The farm, meanwhile, limps along. It will probably close down soon. Karl Granzow's frustration is growing as he continues to reduce what is already a skeletal staff, worries about his own future and watches the farm deterioriate. "It's really our responsibility to keep it in good shape," he says. "But we've never had enough money and we've never had the materials. And now it's worse than ever." He sees the family's return not as a threat but as a hopeful sign. He hopes they will invest in the farm somehow.
In Potsdam, the women at the kindergarten are bearing up. Visitors there immediately feel as if they have just walked into the large and happy, if somewhat chaotic, home of someone who happens to have 36 children. When members of the Wallich family arrive, the teachers are gracious tour guides. But each visit infuses them with unease.
East Germans may have chosen a reunified Germany, but they did not choose some of its consequences. If the teachers had their way, the kindergarten would continue to function as it has for the last 40 years. Several of their husbands are now unemployed or facing unemployment. Some of the parents, also unemployed, have stopped bringing their children to the kindergarten. And now the teachers fear for their jobs as well.
That the Wallichs are returning to a place that bears little resemblance to what their grandparents left behind is a fact that isn't lost on the family. And they are sensitive to the difficulties their return is likely to engender. "I've thought about this moment in history," says Christine. "I've thought about what my responsibilities are and I've thought about how I can contribute to the process of restructuring in East Germany through these two properties. But I haven't answered either question."

HEADLINE: The Education of Paul Wellstone

BYLINE: By Richard L. Berke; Richard L. Berke is a Congressional correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS on a recent Saturday morning, Senator Paul David Wellstone was glued to the television, following the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into the sexual harassment accusations against the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Sitting on the living room floor in his daughter's apartment in St. Paul, the freshman Democrat watched with mounting anger as Senator Orrin G. Hatch -- in the Republicans' drive to discredit Anita F. Hill, Thomas's accuser -- recited a passage from "The Exorcist," the novel about satanic possession. When the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee simply listened in silence, Wellstone exploded.
"This is unbelievable!" he shouted to his wife and daughter, who were also looking on in disbelief. "I can't believe they're getting away with it!" Wellstone, who had opposed the Thomas nomination in a floor speech even before Hill's allegations surfaced, took refuge in the kitchen, unable to watch the rest of the proceedings. 
 In his senatorial campaign in Minnesota last year, Wellstone had hammered home this message: Washington was in the grip of a bankrupt political system. So potent, in fact, was his message that as an outsider he could change things, he became the only challenger to unseat a senatorial incumbent, Rudy Boschwitz.
The only problem for Paul Wellstone is that he is now one of them.
Wellstone insists he can function as an inside player (he refuses to attack any of his colleagues by name for their handling of the Thomas nomination) and as an outsider. "I've reached a pretty firm conclusion that I should be substantive, be on top of the legislative program, make sure your word is good and stay in close touch with colleagues, let them know what you're doing, don't blindside people," he says. "Those are, if you will, insider ethics. But by the same token, I'm even more convinced than ever that I want to push hard on the agenda. I want to continue to be a voice here for working with people on the outside of the process. I want to fight for change. I want to do it both ways."
This is a tall order under the best of times, but Washington today is a town that demands conformity, where millionaries, astronauts and even populists are transformed into virtually interchangeable lawmakers all vying for the spotlight. And the past year has been traumatic for Wellstone, a former political-science professor who had never before held public office and who had crisscrossed Minnesota in a battered school bus, portraying Boschwitz as privileged and out of touch after two terms.
"He's so lost," says John Fox Blackshaw, Wellstone's campaign manager, who quit as the Senator's chief of staff in August amid reports that he was frustrated by Wellstone's frenzied pace, heavy demands and efforts to try to do too much too soon. "He's desperately trying to find himself. He's becoming everything he wanted not to become. And he's found it a tremendous conflict in himself."
Pat Forciea, a vice president of the Minnesota North Stars hockey team who helped mastermind Wellstone's campaign, says that since the Senator arrived in Washington he has acted more like a conventional politician, always fretting about his image and not wanting to be challenged by his aides.
"I'm troubled with his obsession with polls and the media," Forciea says. "It's had a very unhealthy impact on Paul the person, and I'm surprised he let it happen. That's a different Paul Wellstone from the campaign, when Paul was very good at shutting out certain things that deserved to be shut out."
IN AN AGE WHEN style often counts more than substance, particularly in politics, Paul Wellstone is out of step.
This is especially noticeable when he appears at functions next to the senior Senator from Minnesota, Dave Durenberger. Tall and regal, Durenberger looks as though he has been sent from Central Casting. Wellstone is a 5-foot-5 former college wrestler. Durenberger wears well-tailored suits. After 20 years of flannel shirts and turtlenecks, Wellstone has only now taken to suits. During speeches, Durenberger is cool and self-assured; Wellstone resembles a basketball player going for a rebound: his arms flail, his hands chop the air and his legs convulse into deep knee bends.
In other words, Wellstone looks like a 47-year-old fireplug who was yanked from a demonstration and abruptly deposited in the Capitol, with barely time to think about his new role, let alone change clothes.
When he first got to Washington, in January, guards were reluctant to let him into his office, not believing he was a Senator. Now that they know him, the minions who cater to Senators look on Wellstone more as a lost child. In the Senate dining room, they quietly remind him he has to don a tie and jacket. And on a wintry day when Wellstone scampered into the Capitol building in his shirt sleeves for a classified briefing, a guard put his arm around the Senator's shoulders and asked: "Where are you going without your coat? We don't want you to catch cold. We want to keep you here."
Wellstone's stunning upset had made him a news-media sensation and, inevitably, he was compared to Jefferson Smith, the idealistic, somewhat naive new Senator played by Jimmy Stewart in the 1939 movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." Before Wellstone arrived on Capitol Hill, he was offered an elementary piece of advice from a seasoned politician, Walter F. Mondale, the former Vice President and Senator from Minnesota. Mondale cautioned him that his extraordinary success at winning votes did not mean he would easily win over the Washington establishment. Over breakfast in Minneapolis, he told Wellstone: "Remember, you have six years in the first term, not six days. Don't be so impatient, charging into everything."
The Democratic Senator-to-be listened, or thought he did. Then, in the space of a few days, he managed to offend President Bush, veterans groups, other Senators, the press and, most important, some of his own constituents.
At a White House reception for incoming members in late December, Wellstone defied decorum by cornering President Bush and urging him not to drag the country into war in the Persian Gulf.
The day before he took office in January, Wellstone staged an antiwar news conference near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and veterans groups immediately attacked him for being insensitive.
At his first black-tie event, the Washington Press Club Foundation's annual dinner, Wellstone appeared in a bright red tie and brown suit and was stridently self-righteous when all the other speakers were doing their level best to be funny. It was hard, he said, to crack jokes in wartime. The audience laughed several times, thinking he was leading up to a joke. He was serious.
Boldly breaching rules of propriety that govern the Senate, he publicly attacked a fellow member, Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, as someone "I despise."
Barely two months in office, Wellstone paid the price for flouting Mondale's advice and positioning himself as the most outspoken critic of the gulf war. "People Against Wellstone" buttons sprouted in Minnesota. Letters attacking him flooded the state's newspapers.
That Wellstone had sunk so low, so fast, hit home on March 12, when The Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul published a poll showing that only 35 percent of Minnesotans approved of the way he was handling his job. By contrast, Durenberger, who last year was reprimanded by the Senate on charges that he broke ethics rules in exceeding speaking-fee limits, had a 49 percent rating.
Wellstone was devastated. "To lose support from people who supported you, people who I know and like a lot, that hurts," he said the next morning in his office. Agitator he may be, but Wellstone worries all the time about what people think of him; he turns to aides, even reporters, for reassurance and evaluation.
Mondale's advice to him finally began to sink in.
Nearly one year after taking Washington by storm, Wellstone is not the combatant he was. He is still feisty but he is decidedly more senatorial. The man who used to blanch when people addressed him as "Senator," insisting that they call him "Paul," now relishes the title. "It makes me feel like there's a real honor to it," he says.
He has sought to ingratiate himself with senior members, often seeking out George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, for advice. He co-sponsored a trade bill with Senator Helms. He even got his first professional haircut in 27 years. And Wellstone went so far as to cast a vote -- to oppose aid to rebuild Iraq -- against his principles out of fear of damaging himself politically and offending fellow Democrats.
That Wellstone is succumbing will not surprise anyone who knows Washington and its ways. Wellstone himself is well aware that Washington is a town that puts a high premium on getting power and keeping it. And his precipitous fall in the polls carried this painful lesson: Not only do successful campaign tactics seldom work off the campaign trail, but also in Washington the higher profile you take on an issue, the worse the political consequences if your position becomes unpopular.
Washington does not always change people, but it seduces them into playing by its rules. Those who cannot or will not be seduced -- President Jimmy Carter being one notable example -- are not re-elected. Wellstone, though, has already demonstrated that he is willing to deal. He is being embraced by elders who could only have been embarrassed by his early tactics.
Wellstone once described Senator Wendell H. Ford, a conservative Democrat from Kentucky, as the epitome of the "crafty, wily insider" he does not want to become. But Ford, the majority whip, sees himself in Wellstone. "He is a bit like I was when I first came here," Ford says. "He has a lot of things he promised his constituents and he wants to do them like yesterday. He gets pretty tight because things aren't moving the way he thinks they should."
Senator Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat, says Washington has refined Paul Wellstone: "He came in like a storm, and I've noticed a decided change. He seems to want to get along with every member of the Senate. He'll compliment you on this and that. He probably took advantage of the media a little too much, and now he's settling back and given me the impression that he wants to be a workhorse rather than a showhorse."
Wellstone has also learned to slow down. For the first few months he was in Washington, Wellstone unconsciously emulated one of his most popular campaign advertisements, "Fast-Paced Paul," in which he spoke fast to make the point that he could not afford longer commercials. Before delivering a speech, he would follow this ritual: ignore the talking points prepared by his staff, panic for 10 minutes, sometimes put his hands together in a mock prayer and then press his hands over his face to contemplate what he was going to say.
He would take his seat at an Indian Affairs Committee hearing, only to jump up minutes later and jog to his place at the Labor Committee. He didn't want to miss out on anything, but admitted that often there was little time for substance to sink in. "So much to do, so much to do," he repeated in nearly every speech. But as he settles into the job, what he calls "an adult education every day," Wellstone is no longer obsessed with trying to be everywhere at once. He insists, though, that he is not lurching from insurgent to backroom dealer.
THE SENATOR who views himself as an outsider was actually raised in the shadow of the Capitol, in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va. His father, Leon, immigrated from Russia and worked as a writer for the United States Information Agency; his mother, Minnie, worked in a junior-high-school cafeteria. It was while he was a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill -- witnessing the civil rights struggles -- that he turned from wrestling devotee to political crusader. He got his bachelor's degree in 1965 and stayed on at U.N.C. for his doctorate in political science, his thesis on the roots of black militancy.
From the day in 1969 when he began teaching political science at Carleton College, a small liberal-arts school in the rural Minnesota town of Northfield, Wellstone never fit in. He was often at odds with his colleagues and the Carleton administration, and was more in his element instigating protests, from fighting Carleton's investment policies in South Africa to battling banks that were foreclosing on farms. He was arrested twice.
Wellstone married his high-school sweetheart, Sheila, when they were 19, and they had three children. He was too busy raising a family, he says, to be part of the 1960's easy-drugs-and-sex counterculture. In April, he and his wife became grandparents.
First running for public office in 1982, Wellstone was defeated as a Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate for state auditor. Two years later, he gained a spot as a Democratic national committeeman. In 1988, he was the state co-chairman of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign and in the general election was co-chairman of the campaign of Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.
When Wellstone decided to run for the Senate, even his wife thought he had little chance of unseating Boschwitz, who spent more than $7 million in his re-election bid, seven times as much as Wellstone. But with 52 percent of the vote, Wellstone pulled the upset of 1990 after captivating voters with witty, even endearing, television commercials depicting himself as the underdog.
Dubbed "Looking for Rudy," one ad was modeled after the film "Roger and Me," in which the main character tries to get an interview with Roger B. Smith, the former chairman of General Motors. The ad shows Wellstone desperately trying to track down Boschwitz for a debate -- even leaving his home telephone number -- but he never made it past two tall Boschwitz workers.
Wellstone himself thought the ads were too risky, but his top advisers pressed ahead, informing him that an ad would be broadcast only after it was too late to pull it. The ads, produced by North Woods Advertising, a Minneapolis company run by a former Carleton student, were a sensation and helped Wellstone capitalize on the anti-incumbent sentiment last year. He also benefited from turmoil in the Minnesota Republican Party (the party's gubernatorial nominee pulled out of the race after he was accused of sexual indiscretions) and missteps by an overconfident Boschwitz.
If Wellstone had won a seat in the more populist House of Representatives, which is more accustomed to political extremes, he probably would have felt far more at home. In the Senate, however, Wellstone stands out not only by his appearance and manner, but also by his overt liberalism. In his first few months in office, he made more of a splash -- a negative one at that -- than did Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, an outspoken liberal Democrat from Maryland who was elected in 1986. Until her eloquent speech taking the Senate to task for its handling of sexual harassment in the Thomas hearings, Mikulski seems to have purposely kept out of the national spotlight, determined to prove to her colleagues that she is serious about her legislative work.
Unlike House members, Wellstone the Senator cannot be ignored. He is one of 100 (instead of 435), and it is politically unwise for any Senator to write off a colleague whose vote he or she may need. Traditionally, rookie Senators do not wield a great deal of power; in fact, one of Wellstone's graduate-school professors, Donald R. Matthews, wrote in the 1960 textbook "U.S. Senators and Their World": "The new Senator is expected to keep his mouth shut, not take the lead in floor fights, to listen and to learn."
Wellstone, however, exemplifies the junior lawmaker who is not willing to serve an apprenticeship. On the day of the Senate vote on Clarence Thomas, when Senators were vying for precious seconds to air their position, Wellstone was given two minutes. "The bottom line," he concluded, "is that even beyond this confirmation vote, the Congress must deal, must face up to problems of sexual harassment and discrimination against women. And the sooner we do it, the better."
SENATOR HATCH, THE Utah Republican whose questioning in the Thomas hearings so riled Wellstone, says he knew the rookie Senator would be a player when, after anguishing for weeks as a member of the Labor Committee, he voted on March 13 to confirm Lamar Alexander as Education Secretary. Wellstone's vote assured a near-unanimous expression of support from the panel, even though he had serious doubts about the Administration's education policies.
"I was very appreciative of that -- he could have voted the other way," Hatch says. "It was a very good sign. He's going to be effective around here because he's sincere and not a phony and he's willing to work."
On March 14, not wanting to be pegged as a sympathizer of Saddam Hussein and not wanting to vote against every other Senator, Wellstone voted for a resolution against any funds to rebuild Iraq while Saddam Hussein remained in power. He did so even though he feared that the action would cut off humanitarian aid to the country. "I don't believe I showed much courage because I did not vote what I believed," he says. "I felt real empty, completely depleted afterwards."
The art of the compromise is something Wellstone is trying to learn in a hurry. Depending on who's doing the observing, he either is maturing as a politician or he has sold out.
The morning after America went to war in the Persian Gulf, Wellstone was still working out of a windowless temporary office on the first floor of the Hart Senate Office Building, somberly searching for a role for himself. "In a strong antiwar movement I think I can be a pretty strong voice," he said quietly as he thought out his options. "The opposition has to be with dignity and without violence. It cannot become the politics of hatred."
If not strong, his was a loud voice as he shuttled from news program to news program, denouncing the Administration's military policies while trying to make clear that he supported the troops. But the better the war seemed to be going, the less eloquent his oratory sounded.
A barrage of negative stories appeared, chronicling his outspokenness on the war and dive in the polls. Although the accounts left him bitter and hurt for months, he is convinced he could never have favored the war: "Life is sacred, and my standard is to do everything you can to avoid loss of life, regardless of who the people are and the country they live in."
He says he has only one regret about his opposition to the gulf war: his news conference near the Vietnam memorial. In an emotional speech in April before Vietnam veterans in St. Paul, he said quietly: "To the extent that I have offended or angered you, I deeply apologize." Close to tears, Rock Rochelle, a veteran who moderated the event, stood up and said he had been "very disturbed" by that appearance at the Vietnam memorial. "I want you to know," he haltingly continued, "that I accept your apology and I do believe you."
Like any sensitive, and smart, politician, Wellstone was trying to make amends. But was he compromising his ideals? After his April speech, Ann Sax Mabbott, of St. Paul, wrote the Senator a letter, chiding him for making the apology: "I feel like you are starting to behave like a politician who is more concerned about being re-elected than about what is right."
Wellstone says he won't again trade his ideals for political expedience. He drafted an amendment requiring some automobiles to get 75 miles a gallon in fuel economy, knowing it had next to no chance of passing. He has also called on Israel to be more compromising with its Arab neighbors, even though he knows this will offend Jewish supporters (he himself is Jewish).
WHENEVER WELLSTONE says his heart is back with the people in Minnesota, he sounds like the late Senator William Langer of North Dakota, a Republican known as Wild Bill, who was something of a prairie populist in the 1940's and 50's. He kept being re-elected not because he was popular in Washington but because he was beloved back home. In trying to win favor with his colleagues, however, Wellstone may score points in Washington but, like Boschwitz, he runs the risk of alienating the voters.
Wellstone is not unaware of Washington's seductive powers: "The one thing that's real clear to me is that it's very easy to get caught up in the game and the strategy and to begin to sort of accept it." It is only when he is away from Washington, he says, that he realizes how the city wears him down, tempers his idealism. "When I come back from Minnesota, I come back with a new indignation. I really do notice, I come back with the anger. It's very easy to lose it here."
Indeed, when he is in Minnesota the rebellious side of Wellstone truly surfaces. As students gathered around him in a lounge at Moorhead State University in western Minnesota, asking what they could do to get more loans, Wellstone did not offer pat political promises to push through legislation. What might wake up Congress, he told them, was confrontational politics.
In what Wellstone called a "moderate plan," students everywhere would "call back every single Representative and Senator home for an accountability session." They would give the members a list of specific proposals about the educational system that they wanted them to respond to. "Demand that they come home," he urged. "Work with the media. Do it everywhere." Wellstone then offered the "radical plan." Lowering his voice, he said conspiratorially: "It would be great if students from all over the country came in buses to Washington, D.C. It would be massive!" (What this also revealed was Wellstone's lack of understanding of Washington and demonstrations. Big demonstrations are routine, not radical, and they almost never spur Congress to action.)
When he left the student lounge, Wellstone was in an anything-can-be-done frame of mind. Then he got outside and a tearful, middle-aged woman who said her family was losing its farm grabbed his arm. Ignoring his aides' pleas that they had to leave for an appointment, Wellstone stopped to console her. The woman finally left, distraught and frustrated. As an outsider, Wellstone could organize protests to save family farms. But now that he was an insider, what could he do?
"I've just got to do something," he said in his car as his entourage pulled away. "It makes me a nervous wreck because even if I'm there, nothing can be done. She was in tears and doesn't even know me. But this is the kind of thing I'll lose sleep over because I don't know what to do yet."
Those are the words of what Wellstone calls "an emotive politician." He's approachable; he tells you what he's thinking, what he's feeling. In Washington, frank talk can be a career-killer, but back home it has scored him some points. At the Red Lake Indian Reservation in northwest Minnesota, he won over the crowd by hopping around in a tribal dance with little children.
To some people, even those who don't share his political philosophy, the things that make Paul Wellstone stick out as a politician are refreshing. "He's a little different," says Dennis Taylor, a truck driver sporting a National Rifle Association cap, after hearing Wellstone speak in St. Paul. "He's a little aggressive and cocky. But he wants to get some stuff done for the working guy." Sounding like an expert on Senate folkways, he adds: "New blood doesn't fit in well with the old Senators. They know how to get some things through because they know each other. So I don't know how long he'll last, but at least he's saying things that should be said."
Sooner or later, Wellstone may find that he cannot continue presenting himself to Minnesotans as the renegade who challenges conventions in Washington while he is conforming to the ways of Washington.
For his re-election campaign in 1996, the man who was elected as the outsider will have to retool his message. But how? "He's going to have to show at the end of six years that he's had a measurable impact on the process," says Forciea, his top strategist in the 1990 campaign. "People are not going to accept from Paul rhetoric about changing Washington. They're going to have to see evidence that he's begun to change it."

Double Dip or Dead-Cat Bounce?

 BODY:
ROSY SCENARIO, that always-cheerful economist, may soon be jilted if we are indeed in a double dip.
That dread prospect first found expression in Business Week in February 1975, attributed to an unidentified Ford Administration economist: "What is now likely is a 'double-dip recession,' as one Administration economist puts it." Three months later, it reported a scenario that "portrays a double-dip recession in which the economy recovers in the second half of 1975 but lapses into decline again in 1976." (This did not happen.) 
 The threat is back; whistling past this graveyard a couple of weeks ago was Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, who reported a poll in which "only 3 percent expect a double dip."
The meaning is "two declines in rapid succession" or "aborted recovery"; this sense is quite different from double dipping, defined in my 1978 political dictionary as "income, in the form of salary or pension, from two government sources." When Adm. Stansfield Turner retired from the Navy to become Director of Central Intelligence in the Carter Administration, I zapped him as a "ring-knocking double dipper," which some bird watchers took to be a rare specimen of woodpecker but old Washington hands knew was an Annapolis graduate drawing a Navy pension and government salary simultaneously.
Dip and deep are related words. Double dip's earlier sense -- of excess, or at least lavishness -- is based on the metaphor of a clerk in an ice-cream store digging deeply twice into a container to come up with two scoops to be placed on a single cone. (I always ask for sprinkles; Midwesterners were first to call the topping jimmies; files of the Dictionary of American Regional English include shots, hundreds and thousands, nonpareils and even bedbugs. This is taking me far afield of economic jargon, but in a recession, there's no more satisfying pick-me-up than a double dip of chocolate and butter pecan with multicolored sprinkles.) The old slang sense of excess has been shunted aside by the new sense of "two downturns."
A more graphic synonym for that worrisome news is dead-cat bounce. I first heard that phrase in July from Laurence Tisch, the CBS chairman, who told me over a power breakfast at the Regency Hotel in New York that this vivid description of a fearsome scenario was being bruited about in the nation's boardrooms. I opened a file; about that time, The Vancouver Sun in British Columbia reported: "Is the recession really over, or is it a 'dead-cat bounce'? The latter, we're told, is the market jargon for a false sign of recovery -- gruesome, but graphic."
Gruesome is right. The feline metaphor, surely distressing to animal lovers, was first used by a departing member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Administration, Hugh Johnson of the National Recovery Administration, who described his exit as being amidst "a hail of dead cats," by which he meant widespread criticism. Dr. Seuss, when a political cartoonist for the newspaper PM in the 1940's, used cats with X-marks for eyes as symbols of denunciations of politicians.
The earliest citation I have is dead cat bounce, unhyphenated, although the first two words should be hyphenated as a compound adjective modifying bounce. On Dec. 7, 1985, Chris Sherwell in Singapore and Wong Sulong in Kuala Lumpur reported in The Financial Times that investment analysts "said the rise was partly technical and cautioned against concluding that the recent falls in the market were at an end. 'This is what we call a dead-cat bounce,' one broker said flatly."
A year after this Far Eastern citation, an Associated Press dispatch from New York quoted a broker, Raymond DeVoe Jr., on oil stocks as advising, "Beware the dead-cat bounce." The broker gave this explanation of the macabre phrase: "This applies to stocks or commodities that have gone into free-fall descent and then rallied briefly. If you threw a dead cat off a 50-story building, it might bounce when it hit the sidewalk. But don't confuse that bounce with renewed life. It is still a dead cat."
The phrase -- born in the Far East, savored in Britain, adopted on Wall Street -- has nine lives. Lexicographer Paul Dickson's up-to-the-minute 1990 "Slang!" preserved it for posterity with this definition: "Small increase in the market averages after a substantial drop." Recently, Reuters resuscitated the phrase in a piece about the sad days of British yuppies: "Like any clique, they had their own impenetrable language. 'Dead-cat bounce' was when shares crashed, then rose but failed to recover to anything near their previous values."
In Chapter 6 of Mark Twain's 1876 novel, "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," Tom sees Huckleberry Finn carrying something, and Huck explains that it's a "dead cat."
"Say -- what is dead cats good for, Huck?"
"Good for? Cure warts with."
 
 
HYPOTHALAMUS HIGH

 
BRAIN WORK: THE Neuroscience Newsletter, an educational publication of the Eleanor Naylor Dana Institute in New York, includes a brief article about a study by Dr. Simon LeVay of the Salk Institute that found a region of the hypothalamus to be smaller in homosexual men than in heterosexual men; some see this as evidence that sexual orientation is inborn.
The serious, scientific newsletter duly reports scientists to be cautious, with some calling the results "inconclusive," but goes on to note: "What was conclusive was the leap of hypothalamus into pop lingo -- as in a recent issue of Time magazine."
Time quoted a popular radio talk-show commentator beginning a broadcast with "Greetings, conversationalists . . . this is Rush Limbaugh, the most dangerous man in America, with the largest hypothalamus in North America."
In the same issue, in an article about sexy Calvin Klein advertising, Time wrote about a previous campaign with Brooke Shields that "sold a lot of jeans and spawned a hypothalamus-numbing host of imitators."
We have here the popularization of a new symbol of virility. In Greek, thalamos is "an inner chamber"; the hypothalamus is the region of the brain that controls temperature and appetite, produces hormones, and presumably induces scorn for quiche and causes backward to reel the mind of trendy Time writers. Be the first caller-in to Mr. Limbaugh to pronounce it correctly: accent on the thal.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Atlanta

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; PETER APPLEBOME is chief of the Atlanta bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Braves fans have put away their tomahawks for the winter. The uproar over the sequel to "Gone With the Wind" has died down. The 1996 Summer Olympics are still five years away.
It seems as if Atlanta has been in the grip of one fever or another nonstop for the past year. If you're overcome by any lingering vapors and find yourself doing the Tomahawk Chop, no one is likely to mind. But now that things seem to be calming down a bit, it's worth remembering that what really makes Atlanta special is the amazingly lush forest, lovely neighborhoods, and inviting parks and open space that really define the city. Even though the leaf season is past its peak, the inviting early November weather make this a perfect, understated time to explore the city and its surroundings. 
 Downtown the focus is Underground Atlanta, the hugely successful reincarnation of the city's original business district. But to get a sense of what makes Atlanta special, the cool autumn temperatures make this an inviting time of year to get in a car and drive along West Paces Ferry Road in Buckhead or Lullwater Road in Druid Hills to gawk at the grand old homes and the autumnal atmosphere created by the giant oaks, dogwoods, poplars and magnolias.
The 185-acre Piedmont Park, the city's major in-town park, and the Atlanta Botanical Garden there are good places to wander around on foot. Also worth a visit is the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area along the river that snakes through Atlanta. Sixteen miles to the east is 3,200-acre Stone Mountain Memorial Park.
 
 
Attractions
 There is, alas, no Tara, although there is a proposal to build one as a tourist attraction in suburban Clayton County. But, for those caught up in the recent spate of "Gone With the Wind" fever, Atlanta offers visitors some intriguing reminders of its Civil War past.
For anyone interested in the Civil War, a must see is the Cyclorama museum, 800 Cherokee Ave S.E., (404) 658-7625. Its highlight is a Civil War film and a 42-foot high circular painting and diorama depicting the Battle of Atlanta. Hours are 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. daily. Admission is $3.50.
A nice mix of the scenic and the historic can be found at Stone Mountain Memorial State Park (404) 498-5600, 16 miles east of Atlanta on Highway 78. A 3,200-acre park that sprawls around the world's largest outcropping of exposed granite, the park offers Civil War exhibits, cable car rides and a cruise on a paddle-wheel riverboat. The centerpiece is the world's largest high-relief sculpture (Mount Rushmore, which is slightly larger, is bas-relief), a 90-by-190-foot carving in granite of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Entrance fee is $5 a car. Major attractions are open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. every day in the fall and winter.
The most vibrant bit of Atlanta's past and the best place in town for browsing, strolling and grazing is Underground Atlanta. Revived in 1989, Underground, the site of downtown's original 19th-century hub that was later abandoned, has emerged as a bustling island of activity in a downtown that really needed one. Situated between Peachtree Street and Central Avenue at Alabama Street, Underground's refurbished and renovated complex of shops, restaurants and clubs and its combination of authentic architectural elements and contemporary design have made it a huge success.
Adjacent to Underground, and a big hit with kids, is The World of Coca-Cola, 55 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, (404) 676-5151. A high-tech tribute to Atlanta's leading corporate icon, the museum includes Coke memorabilia, an electronic soda fountain, and a chance to sample Coke products. Hours are 10:00 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. Monday through Saturday and noon to 6 P.M. on Sunday. Admission is $2.50.
One of the most arresting and atypical buildings in Atlanta is the gleaming, porcelain-enameled High Museum of Art, designed by Richard Meier, 1280 Peachtree Street N.E., (404) 892-4444. On view through Jan. 5 is "Southern Expressions: Tales Untold," an exhibition of painting, sculpture and photography by southeastern artists. The museum is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Thursday and Saturday, from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. Friday, and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday. Admission is $4.
The civil rights struggle that changed the South and the country forever is captured at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, 449 Auburn Avenue N.E., (404) 524-1956. It's the home of civil rights archives and memorabilia, and the reflecting pool with Dr. King's crypt. Hours are 9 A.M. to 8 P.M., and admission is free. Dr. King's boyhood home is just down the street at 501 Auburn Avenue N.E. Hours are from 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.
 
Events
 A perfect match of the right show in the right building is "The Phantom of the Opera," performed by a national touring company at the restored Fox Theater, 660 Peachtree Street N.E., (404) 249-6400. The show runs through Nov. 16 at the historic theater, which opened in 1929, with its Byzantine architecture topped by onion domes and minarets. Tickets run from $22.50 to $47.50. On Nov. 26 at 8 P.M. the Fox will present "Stars of the Bolshoi." Tickets are from $25.50 to $35.50.
From Dec. 6 to 29, the Atlanta Ballet, 477 Peachtree Street N.E., (404) 892-3303, will perform "The Nutcracker." Tickets are $5 to $35.75.
The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra performs at the Woodruff Arts Center, 1280 Peachtree Street N.E., (404) 892-2414. Future programs include a Tchaikovsky Spectacular, Nov. 29 and 30. Tickets for most concerts are $16 to $34. For children there is SciTrek, 395 Piedmont Avenue N.E., (404) 522-5500, Atlanta's enterprising science museum. Through Dec. 31 it offers "Nature's Fury," an interactive exhibit that re-creates natural phenomona like the feeling of being in an earthquake. The museum is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday and 12 to 5 P.M. Sunday. Admission is $6.
For a more ambitious excursion, try the New Georgia Railroad's train trip to Savannah, the historic town near the Georgia coast. From Nov. 22 to 24, a train powered by a working steam engine will make the trip at the time of Savannah's "Christmas Made in the South," a popular arts and crafts show featuring over 200 artists and craftsmen. The train leaves Atlanta at 7 A.M. Nov. 22 with approximate arrival in Savannah at 7 P.M. The return trip departs Savannah at 7 A.M. on Sunday, Nov. 24. Roundtrip tickets are $80. Meals, which are extra, are available on the train. Passengers must provide for their own lodging in Savannah. Call (404) 656-0769.
 
Where to Eat
 The hottest restaurant in Atlanta's pasta wars is Pricci, 500 Pharr Road N.E. (404) 237-2941. It offers unique pizzas, homemade pastas, and other Tuscan, Ligurian and Milanese specialties. Entrees range from $10.50 to $19.50 and an average meal with wine is about $28. A recommendation is pappardelle bolognese, a handmade pasta with veal sauce for $12.50.
The most popular neighborhood restaurants in Atlanta may be Indigo Coastal Grill, 1397 N. Higland Avenue, (404) 876-0676, and Partners Morningside Cafe, 1399 N. Higland Avenue, (404) 876-8104, two side-by-side eateries that both offer excellent food, amiably cramped surroundings and often a half-hour wait for a table. Indigo offers coastal fare with entrees ranging from $10.95 to $17.95. A speciality is Cape Cod steamer, with lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, potatoes and corn for $16.95 to $19, , depending on market price. Partners offers varied entrees ranging from ravioli stuffed with lobster and shiitake mushrooms or smoked duck sausage priced from $10.95 to $17.95.
At Underground Atlanta,the best sit-down meal can be found at Lombardi's Underground, 94 Upper Pryor Street, (404) 522-6568. Italian entrees range from $8 to $17, and specialties include trittico del giorno, a sampler of three fresh pastas for $11.95 or cioppino, a stew of fresh fish, mussels, clams, calamari and shrimp, cooked in a tomato broth, and served on a bed of linguini for $14.95.
Some of the best and most convenient pre-theater dining can be found at Chef's Grill, 1280 Peachtree Street N.E., at the Woodruff Arts Center (404) 881-0652. The eclectic American cuisine includes crab cakes, fresh seafood and pizzas, with entrees ranging from $8.95 to $17.95. A specialty is sauteed crab cakes with tomato-chive butter for $14.95.
For an informal lunch or light dinner in eccentric surroundings in Atlanta's Midtown area, try R. Thomas' Deluxe Grill, 1812 Peachtree Road N.W., (404) 872-2942. It has neo-hippie decor, a heated patio garden, and it almost never closes, staying open 24 hours a day on Friday and Saturday and from 10 A.M. to 6 A.M. Sunday to Thursday. It has good chicken, omlettes, pasta and burgers with the Cajun sauteed chicken going for $7.95.
At the other extreme is the dining room at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, 3434 Peachtree Road N.E., (404) 237-2700. Dinners without wine range from $44 to $56. Menus change daily, but fall menus make use of fresh and seasonal dishes such as wild partridge and venison.
 
Where to Stay
 Atlanta's best-known luxury hotels downtown and the affluent Buckhead area, about five miles from downtown, are the two Ritz-Carlton Hotels. At the downtown hotel, 181 Peachtree Street N.E. (404) 659-0400, furnished in plush traditional style and known for fine service, doubles range from $150 to $250. The Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, 3434 Peachtree Road N.E., (404) 237-2700, where the rates, double or single, range from $145 to $210, is a short walk from two top shopping malls, Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza.

Tales From the Dark Side, Spun by a Reluctant Outlaw

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Machismo is Ice Cube's meal ticket. He has been talking tough since he first appeared with N.W.A., the Compton, Calif., group that put gangster rap on the charts with its foul-mouthed tales of gunslinging, sex, dope-dealing and hatred for the police. After he left N.W.A. in late 1989, the group turned into a pandering self-parody while Ice Cube took on a veneer of political consciousness for his first solo album, the million-selling "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted." Produced by Chuck D. of Public Enemy, the album presented Ice Cube's tales of ghetto violence as front-line reports on the status of the young black male as an "endangered species."
With his role in the recent film "Boyz N the Hood" as a brooding, reluctant gang member, and an elegy for victims of violence called "Dead Homiez" released as a single between albums, Ice Cube (whose real name is O'Shea Jackson) seemed to be recanting the outlaw persona he had created for himself. The packaging of his new album, "Death Certificate" (Priority 57155; all three formats), urges young blacks to join the Nation of Islam and shows Ice Cube reading a newspaper with the headline "Unite or Perish." 
But on "Death Certificate" it's hard to tell which is more obtuse, Ice Cube's gangster raps or his political statements. Throughout the album, the music stays basic, vamping so slowly that every word, each one shouted, is audible; Ice Cube isn't showing off his virtuosity, but rather his gift for storytelling and rhetoric.
When Ice Cube performed in July at the Apollo Theater, he acted out his dilemma: "I want to kick some knowledge," he said, but his on-stage posse demanded more gangster raps. Ice Cube seems to think that if he's not "hard" -- bloodthirsty, angry, foul-mouthed and woman-hating -- he will lose credibility (and album sales) with rap's core audience. He may be right. So the first half of the album tries to turn hypocrisy into irony; Ice Cube spins new tales of gang warfare and wild sex but frames them as "the death side, a mirrored image of where we are today."
The side opens with a funeral and ends with "Alive on Arrival," in which a young black man is shot, taken to the emergency room and questioned by police about gang activity before he is treated. He dies. The rest of the "death side" includes one more raunchy sex boast ("Givin' Up the Nappy Dug Out," with the album's catchiest chorus), a paean to guns ("Man's Best Friend"), a visit to a venereal-disease clinic ("Look Who's Burnin' ") and "My Summer Vacation," in which a gang of drug dealers, driven out of Los Angeles, sets up in St. Louis and brings with it customs like drive-by shootings. In good N.W.A. style, there are also confrontations with racist police. While his gangster raps usually end with bad news, Ice Cube clearly relishes the details of the violence.
The "life side," which opens with the sounds of a mother giving birth -- to a boy, of course -- is where the limits of Ice Cube's knowledge become clear. The album reflects some of the same concerns Public Enemy takes up on "Apocalypse 91: The Enemy Strikes Black," but at the level of a street brawl instead of a discussion. Ice Cube sounds happiest when he has someone to bad-mouth; to promote black solidarity and achievement, he has decided to fight racism with racism.
In "Black Korea," his revenge against Asian shopkeepers who are suspicious of their ghetto customers is to suggest a nationwide boycott and, as a bonus, arson. "I Wanna Kill Sam" personalizes Uncle Sam as a white supremacist, from Army recruiter to slave owner; a corpse with a toe tag reading "Uncle Sam" is on the front cover. "Horny Lil' Devil," a rant against miscegenation, goes out of its way to derogate white women and threatens to kill white men who desire black women, although Ice Cube can't quite bring himself to praise black women as anything but black men's property.
In "True to the Game," Ice Cube denounces upwardly mobile blacks who turn their backs on the ghetto as they succeed, saying they're "tryin' to be white or a Jew -- but who are they to be equal to?" The worst insult Ice Cube can think of -- applied to whites in "I Wanna Kill Sam" and "Horny Lil' Devil" and to N.W.A. in "No Vaseline" -- is to call someone a homosexual.
There's real rage and frustration behind Ice Cube's insults, and he hints at a broader perspective in parts of "I Wanna Kill Sam" and in "Us," which itemizes self-destructive behavior by blacks. Ice Cube has a few misgivings about his role. After an autobiographical rap that talks about his early misdemeanors and sexual exploits, he talks with a young boy, urging him to finish school and get a job. The youngster insists that he would rather live the street life, which becomes the transition to "Us," where the street toughs have grown up to dead-end lives.
But although some other rappers talk about changing larger political and economic structures, Ice Cube has held on to a gang mentality: it's his gang, right-thinking black males, against every other gang -- whites, Koreans, women, N.W.A. -- and all that matters is revenge.
Ice Cube speaks for parts of a suffering community, but suffering doesn't necessarily build nobility. Sometimes it just leaves scars, and those scars are revealed on "Death Certificate."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: South Bronx Houses;
Higher Density Goal Spurs New Designs

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
EVERYBODY talks about density, but builders in the South Bronx are beginning to do something about it. The results on the ground will emerge next year.
One place to examine them will be in the Melrose section, where the Procida Construction Corporation plans to break ground in March for a development called Melrose Court. The site is near the Hub, the central business district at East 149th Street and Third Avenue. 
 Melrose Court will consist of 263 condominiums in attached, four-story town houses, with three units to each house. Preliminary marketing began last month and the first houses are scheduled to be ready for occupancy by the summer of 1993. Procida's community-based nonprofit partner, the Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corporation, is assisting in sales and community relations.
Density was one of the issues two years ago when the 4.5-acre Melrose Court land was still an urban-renewal parcel known as Site 404. It was the object of competing affections from housing production organizations. A coalition of clergymen organized as South Bronx Churches, Inc., led demonstrations against Mayor Edward I. Koch because he wanted the land to be developed through the New York Housing Partnership. The coalition claimed it had been promised the site.
The housing developer for South Bronx Churches is I.D. Robbins, who in East Brooklyn popularized a one-family house for moderate-income buyers developed under the Nehemiah Plan name, with the sponsorship and financial backing of East Brooklyn Churches, Inc. Those houses are mostly built to a density of 20 to the acre.
In the Bronx, Mr. Robbins had hoped to build a similar house or perhaps two-family houses. But even he, bowing to the views of city and borough officials now that David N. Dinkins has been elected Mayor, has agreed to reach a density of 60 to the acre on the handful of larger sites that South Bronx Churches has been awarded. That means three units for each house.
Procida's design for Melrose Court makes major use of interior courtyards for front entrances. The ground-level apartment is entered from the street, but the upstairs apartments are entered from stoops that face large landscaped interior courtyards. The second-floor apartment is a simplex and the upper-level apartment is a two-floor, or duplex, unit. All the apartments have separate entrances from outside stoops.
The development, for which Marvin H. Meltzer of Manhattan was the architect, will fill three full blocks. The two interior streets will have secured entrances from the main north-south streets bordering the land, Brook Avenue and St. Ann's Avenue.
Courtyard-oriented housing has its precedents in New York City. In recent years it has been done by the General Atlantic Realty Corporation at its Spring Creek development in Brooklyn. But it is an unusual form for the burgeoning new-homes production pipeline in the Bronx. The sales experience will be watched closely for evidence of buyers' preferences.
IT is also a test of future low-rise housing forms in an area that has become a veritable laboratory for them because so much land is available and so many new-home projects have been launched. Already there is a question of how much new for-sale housing can be absorbed without rising levels of subsidy to assure affordability.
The South Bronx Churches concept for larger sites calls for two duplexes and a ground-floor simplex in a three-story building, with the units sold as condominiums. The plan is to build 270 units on five sites. "I don't think this is good, but once we start I think it will take the country by storm," he said. He is also building 270 one-family houses on 19 scattered South Bronx sites.
The Melrose Court development plan, like those in the large-lot South Bronx Churches plan, are condominiums, although it has been shown that it is easier to sell two-family houses than condominiums. The buyers' preference was confirmed last year in a survey undertaken jointly by the Housing Partnership, the nonprofit organization that acts as developer and often as marketing agent in many affordable-housing developments on city-owned land, and the Bronx office of the Department of City Planning.
On the other hand, Melrose Court should produce attractive urban design. The street scape is preserved because curbs are uncut for parking pads. Street entrances for the lower-level units assure a certain liveliness on the street, and the courtyard entrances make for a lively and useful courtyard. The two new wide streets cutting through the development will provide for parking perpendicular to the curb on both sides. And there are secured gates as entrances to these interior streets, giving Melrose Court a level of privacy most new Bronx housing lacks.
The housing will be built with masonry bearing walls and precast concrete plank, with front and rear framing that gives the look of individual town houses.
"THE development is effectively planned as a multistory building that gets subdivided," said Mario Procida, the 34-year-old architect. He is a principal with his brother, William, 29, in the family-owned company, which is based in the Bronx. Procida Construction, which has been in business since 1928, has produced close to 1,000 units of for-sale and rental housing in the Bronx over the last three years.
The form used at Melrose Court could in theory also be used for three-family houses, in which the owner gets one apartment and rents out two others, rather than for condominiums. But banks are described as wary of financing the untested three-families for fear that owners might have trouble finding enough renters at suitable prices. For builders, condominiums have been easier to finance.
The Housing Partnership considers it nothing less than a breakthrough that it has obtained financing from the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, for 15 three-family houses (45 housing units) at Sherman Avenue and McClellan Street in the Bronx. They are selling for $205,000. With Fannie Mae financing available, the number of new three-families may increase, assuming successful projects.
THE units at Melrose Court have been more heavily subsidized than typical for-sale assisted housing in New York City -- a maximum of $41,920 a unit instead of $25,000. That effectively lowers the price to make units more easily salable in their Melrose location.
Of the total subsidy, the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation is putting in $15,000 a unit, or $3,945,000; New York City is paying $10,000, or $2,630,000, and Bronx County -- the Borough President's office -- $16,920 a unit, or $4,450,000. In addition, the city has provided the land, valued at $4,538 a unit, or $1.19 million, which becomes a no-interest second mortgage on the house, repayable from a portion of any profit after resale.
The maximum subsidy would make units affordable to households earning as little as $24,000. Most buyers are likely to earn under $35,000, the Procida Organization says. People earning more -- up to the maximum of $53,000 for eligibility -- get less subsidy. With no subsidy the prices would be $97,685 for a two-bedroom and $118,714 for a three-bedroom.
Most of the people who have come to Procida's offices at 456 East 173d Street to look at scale models and floor plans have had annual incomes between $25,000 and $30,000 and will qualify for the full subsidy if they buy, said Christine Procida, Mario's sister, the marketing director for the project. Ms. Procida said that 200 people have visited the office. Contract signing has not yet started.
MELROSE COURT is viewed by Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer and city planning officials as the first phase of a longterm redevelopment designated Melrose Commons, which covers a broad swath of underutilized land between Park Avenue and Third Avenue from East 156th Street to East 163d Street. Melrose Court's four acres lie at the southeast edge of Melrose Commons.
The grand planning scheme was laid out by the Bronx office of the Department of City Planning last January. It looks forward to 3,000 owner-occupied housing units in Melrose Commons, along with the establishment of new retail and residential activities on East 161st Street and Third Avenue and a new 3.8-acre park.

HEADLINE: At Tiny Airport, Even the Ground Is Friendly

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
TO catch a recent 9:05 A.M. flight to Boston, Maureen Fleming left her Westport home at 8:15 and arrived 15 minutes later at Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford. Encountering no traffic on Interstate 95 or at the airport, she parked in the ample lot in front of the small terminal and within moments could see her 19-seat Beechcraft plane waiting on the runway only a few hundred feet from where she had left her car.
"It's a perfect situation for me," said Ms. Fleming, a communications consultant, who was bound for Fort Worth via Boston. "It's great, because you avoid the hassle of going through all that southbound traffic on I-95 in the morning and paying all that money to park at the New York airports. I'm surprised more people don't know about this place." 
 Sikorsky Memorial Airport, which is owned by the City of Bridgeport, is in the Lordship section of neighboring Stratford. Bridgeport city officials and the commission that runs the airport have sought to take a low-key approach to the complex, which Bridgeport has owned since 1937. The airport's new manager, Albert McDill, said he would welcome more business.
"The market in the area is being underserved, and the airport itself is underutilized," Mr. McDill said in a recent interview in his second-floor office overlooking the airport's two runways and spacious field. "There are a lot of opportunities here."
In large measure because the airport seemed to have been at a standstill for some years, the new manager was hired by the Airport Commission, which includes the Mayor of Bridgeport, three other city officials and the Stratford Town Manager. Before replacing the longtime manager, Morgan Kaolian, in September, Mr. McDill had been manager of the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport in Florida for eight years.
"The question is, What shall we do with this facility?" Mr. McDill said. The steps being taken to answer the question, he said, include the development of a master plan and an economic-impact study that is being done at the University of Connecticut.
The airport -- which was named for Igor I. Sikorsky, an aviation pioneer from Connecticut -- may extend one or both of the 4,800-foot runways to about 5,000 feet. Because the runways are relatively short, airlines are permitted to use only twin-engine turboprop planes that carry between 19 and 46 passengers, but no jetliners. Tweed-New Haven Airport, although a relatively small field that does not offer service to Boston, was able to initiate jet service to Chicago in May, because one of its two runways is 5,600 feet long.
In recent years Mr. Kaolian, who still flies in and out of Sikorsky Airport in the early morning and late afternoon to do traffic reports for radio station WICC in Bridgeport, had advocated expansion of one of the two runways, as long as the Town of Stratford agreed. He had also said the airport needed service from additional carriers, expanded ground equipment and up-to-date navigation instruments. Mr. Kaolian had forecast that the airport would evolve into a major transportation center for the region and would serve hundreds of thousands of travelers annually.
 
140,000 Passengers a Year
 The Mayor of Bridgeport, Mary C. Moran, said she would like to see the airport expanded. She also said that a name change might be in order, because of the confusion between the Airport and the Sikorsky Aircraft helicopter landing area near the Merritt Parkway.
"I know of people who've actually gone to the Sikorsky plant thinking it was Bridgeport airport," Mrs. Moran said in an interview. "I think it may be time to consider changing the name."
The airport now accommodates 140,000 passengers a year, Mr. McDill said. The three commercial carriers that operate at the airport -- Business Express, Continental Express and USAir Express -- account for about 35 percent of the overall business. The rest is "general aviation" -- a catchall phrase encompassing all civilian flying except scheduled airlines.
"We have a lot of corporate activity, including quite a few Fortune 500 companies," Mr. McDill said.
What Sikorsky Memorial Airport does not have are throngs of passengers, traffic congestion or long corridors to airport gates. Sikorsky does not really have a gate, just a door that leads to the runway. The door is usually opened by the same airline employee who takes tickets. Arriving passengers receive their luggage within minutes after they leave the plane, since the distance from the aircraft to the cargo area in the terminal is only about 100 feet.
Dr. Fred Sachs, who is affiliated with Yale-New Haven Hospital, said his first visit to Sikorsky Memorial Airport recently was a revelation. Normally he uses Tweed-New Haven Airport to fly to Washington, he said. But flights to Washington from Tweed go to Dulles International Airport, and on this day Dr. Sachs wanted to fly into National Airport, which was closer to the conference he was attending.
 
Empty Terminal
 "This is a really nice airport, and I definitely would use it again," said Dr. Sachs, who lives in Woodbridge, a New Haven suburb.
Even during the morning rush hour, the Sikorsky terminal, clean and spacious, is virtually deserted until a half-hour before a flight. On a recent Wednesday morning, after four planes had left between 6:30 and 7 A.M., the terminal was empty of passengers for the next two hours, until people began arriving for a 9:05 Business Express flight to Washington. Only nine passengers boarded that flight, including Greig Metzger, an exployee of Citibank, who said he had driven to the airport from his home in Fairfield in 10 minutes.
If there is a major drawback to flying out of Sikorsky airport, it is the limited number of flights and destinations. On weekdays 26 flights leave the airport and 28 arrive. Apart from one flight each day to New London and another to Albany, the flights go to Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark and Boston, with one of the Boston flights continuing on to Burlington, Vt., and another to Manchester, N.H.
Virtually all of the flights, though, connect with others to cities throughout the nation. Most fares are comparable to those at other airports in the New York region.
The airport is only a few minutes' drive from Interstate 95 and convenient to the Merritt Parkway. Yet few people seem to know the airport even exists. Finding Sikorsky is not easy; there is only one sign for the airport on Route 95, about a mile before the Lordship Boulevard exit, and no signs at all on the Merritt or on any other nearby highways.
"If you miss the one sign on I-95, you're in trouble," said Mr. McDill, the airport manager. "I've missed it a few times myself and have had to get off at the next exit."
Mr. McDill concedes that Sikorsky Memorial Airport may have to be promoted more in the future. He also agreed that a new name of a regional nature, like Fairfield County Airport, might draw more attention. "We have to let people know that it's here," he said.

HEADLINE: Republicans Now Facing Daunting Challenge

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
SOON after he took office last year, Gov. Jim Florio emerged from Drumthwacket, the Governor's mansion in Princeton, to tell reporters he had just had a meeting with legislative leaders. When one reporter asked him which Republicans were at the meeting, Mr. Florio looked surprised.
"Oh, there were no Republicans," he said. 
 If Mr. Florio wants to meet with legislative leaders starting in January, there will be nothing but Republicans around the table. Democrats were suddenly thrust into the role of virtual spectators for the next two years by voters who rejected the Democratic response to the state's economic problems and gave Republicans a landslide victory in legislative races on Tuesday.
Republicans, who are accustomed to being in the minority, were given such large majorities in both the Senate and the Assembly that they can pass any bill they want without Democratic votes and can override any veto Mr. Florio may affix to one of their bills. The present Democratic majorities of 23 to 17 in the Senate and 43 to 37 in the Assembly will be replaced by Republican majorities of 27 to 13 in the Senate and 58 to 22 in the Assembly. In short, the Republican Party is in charge. For many lawmakers who have spent their entire careers in the minority, the change may be daunting. After years of opposing solutions offered by the majority, they must now propose solutions of their own.
Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant, a Camden County Democrat who will continue to serve as majority leader until the 205th Legislature is sworn in early next year, pledged his cooperation with the coming Republican majority, but added, "Now they'll have to govern, and it can't be done with smoke and mirrors."
 
'A Lot to Say' About Property Tax
 Other Democratic leaders, including Joseph V. Doria, the Assembly Speaker, whose thumbnail synopsis of the election was that "perception has won out over reality," and John A. Lynch, the Senate President, have promised to work with the Republican majority. But Mr. Lynch said he would "have a lot to say" if the Republicans rolled back Democratic initiatives designed to hold down property taxes.
Mr. Lynch had better loosen his vocal cords. Assemblyman Robert D. Franks of New Providence, the state Republican chairman, said that "substantial changes" in the Florio administration's programs would have to be made to satisfy the mandate the voters gave the Republicans on Tuesday.
And he pointed out that the public's anger over Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax program had quickly turned into a personal dislike for the Governor that led directly to the Democrats' loss of leadership in the Legislature. "People didn't like the message, and they really didn't like the messenger," Mr. Franks said.
The kind of wholesale legislative changes seen last week usually occur only in years when a candidate for governor scores a landslide victory and pulls in legislative candidates on his coattails. A midterm election normally breaks down into individual contests in the 40 legislative districts because of the absence of a statewide election at the top of the ballot to support a unifying theme.
Although he wasn't on the ballot, and won't be until 1993 if he decides to seek re-election, Mr. Florio was the unifying presence around which the Republicans were able to devise a simple strategy: tie the Democrats to the $2.8 billion in new taxes and to Mr. Florio, whose positive performance rating has not climbed above 25 percent in public opinion surveys over the last year.
Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and a Republican Party consultant, said, "The campaign was probably monotonous and not very exciting, but it was effective."
Republicans will have a few weeks to savor their victory and prepare to deal with the harsh realities they will face next year, some of them of their own making. Republicans have promised to roll back the state sales tax to 6 percent from the 7 percent it was set at in the Florio program. They also have said they will not raise taxes.
 
Continuation of Problem Seen
 The economy is still in a recession, and there have been predictions of a continuing budget problem next year even with all present taxes in place. A drop of a penny in the sales tax will cost the treasury about $500 million.
In addition, some revenue-raising moves by the Florio administration to close holes in the current budget, like selling a portion of the state highway system to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority for $400 million, were one-time measures. Whoever is in charge next year is already faced with finding some replacement for that money.
Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers, said the problems facing the new Republican leadership were enormous.
"The recession is not going to end in the next few months and pull New Jersey out of its problems," he said. "If the Republicans roll back the sales tax, they must find other sources of revenue or make draconian cuts in the budget, and that will be extremely hard to do.
"Some people have said the one-cent drop in the sales tax could jump-start the economy, but that's a fantasy. The way things are shaping up, the Republicans are going to have to find more than $1 billion to balance next year's budget."
 
Planning to Make Changes
 In addition to the financial problems that will dominate the coming legislative session, as they have the last two years, the Republicans have said they want to make changes in other major initiatives of Mr. Florio's first two years in office -- automobile insurance revision, school financing and the ban on the sale of assault weapons.
The National Rifle Association and the New Jersey Education Association were vocal critics of the Governor's bills and contributed heavily to Republican candidates in the legislative campaign. The rifle association succeeded in getting amendments to the gun law through the Legislature a few months ago, but Mr. Florio vetoed the amending legislation. He won't be able to do that in the future.
For the Governor, who was a lawmaker for all his 22 years in public life in the New Jersey Legislature and in Congress before winning the governorship in 1989, the role of executive was a new one. Mr. Florio was not a consensus builder during his first two years in office. He dealt with a small cadre of advisers and kept his initiatives under wraps until he was ready to push them aggresively through the Legislature.
Assemblyman Chuck Haytaian, the Republican minority leader, who will move up to Assembly Speaker in January, said he had only two meetings with the Governor during the first 20 months of the administration.
 
'Sent Message to Orther States'
 Mr. Haytaian said the New Jersey election had national significance. "It sent the message to other states that people want less government and less taxes," he said.
The speed with which Mr. Florio passed his tax increase package through the Democratic Legislature after telling voters during his campaign that he saw no need for new taxes stunned many taxpayers and inspired the anti-Florio sentiment that translated into Republican votes on Tuesday.
The Governor and his aides were not good at selling their programs. It took a week for the Governor's office to produce charts that showed that only 17 percent of the state's taxpayers would pay higher income taxes under the new plan. By then, the middle-income wage earners whom the program was designed to help were furious and had stopped listening.
 
A Pledge opf Cooperation
 Just exactly how Mr. Florio will deal with his reduced power in the legislative process remains to be seen. He has said he intends to work cooperatively with the new leadership, but many Republicans, recalling the snubs of the last two years, are skeptical.
At his meeting with reporters at Drumthwacket on Wednesday, Mr. Florio said that he would have a legislative program to present to the Legislature in January and said that if the Republicans found a responsible way to reduce the sales tax, he would go along with it.
At one point Mr. Florio said that some of his policies had undoubtedly persuaded some voters to go out and vote Republican. He also said he had been told that his "bedside manner leaves something to be desired." He added, "I can accept that."
 
Choice of 'Divided Power'
 Emphasizing that the election is over, Mr. Florio said, "The people have chosen divided power, but they don't want paralyzed government."
The Governor could just sit back and watch the Republicans wrestle with the same set of problems he has faced and be prepared to make political capital out of any gaffes to help his re-election chances in 1993. But it is unlikely that he will remain silent, given his reputation for confronting problems head-on rather than seeking compromise solutions based on a broad consensus.
The Republicans strongly criticized Mr. Florio's stewardship in the Republican Party's platform, adopted earlier this year. In it the Republicans said, "After 20 months of Governor Florio and the Democrats, one thing is clear: this is the worst managed state government in the history of New Jersey."
Even though they do not hold the Governor's office, with the enormous power they were handed by the voters last week, the Republicans will now have to show that they can do a better job.

HEADLINE: Auto Insurance: Do the Fixes Need Fixing?

BYLINE: By Jay Romano

 BODY:
EVEN as many motorists watch their insurance premiums drop in the wake of Gov. Jim Florio's sweeping transformation of the state's automobile insurance laws, some insurance industry experts and legislators say the Governor's plan is already following in the footsteps of previous unsuccessful attempts to rescue the state's ailing automobile insurance system.
In the last year, for example, three independent studies have predicted that the Market Transition Facility, the successor to the debt-ridden Joint Underwriting Association, is inexorably sliding into its own multimillion-dollar deficit. 
 While Department of Insurance officials insist that they do not anticipate a shortfall, industry experts say that the studies are accurate and that consumers could end up footing the bill if companies are granted rate increases to offset losses resulting from paying off the deficit.
At the same time, some experts are calling the Governor's plan nothing more than a "Band-Aid" that will inevitably fail to mend the system. Others say that only radical, politically unpopular remedies can produce an insurance system that is fair to consumers and profitable for insurance companies.
Still others say that despite the fact that premiums are decreasing, regulations imposed by the State Insurance Commissioner unfairly penalize many drivers by allowing insurance companies to charge exorbitant surcharges against those who commit minor traffic offenses.
The renewed debate comes on the heels of last Tuesday's apparent repudiation of Governor Florio's controversial political strategies, and as the Allstate Insurance Company, which insures nearly half a million vehicles, proceeds with its plans to stop writing policies and pull its business out of the state for good.
"We have felt all along that legislatively killing the J.U.A. certainly didn't make the problems or the conditions that created them go away," said Ronald Krauss, vice president of communications for the American Insurance Association, a New York-based trade organization of insurance companies.
Mr. Krauss said that despite repeated attempts at insurance revamping by legislators and governors of both political parties, the insurance system in place in New Jersey today was only marginally better than it was 20 years ago.
"The well-meaning efforts of the politicians to hold down auto insurance rates just wind up not succeeding," Mr. Krauss said. "You can't legislate away economic reality."
The economic reality that the insurance industry is now facing, he said, is the deficit in the Market Transition Facility.
Under Governor Florio's Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act, the debt-ridden Joint Underwriting Association was dissolved and the estimated total of two million drivers who were insured by it were transferred to the Market Transition Facility.
 
Rates Set at Same Level
 Rates for drivers insured by the Market Transition Facility were set at about the same level as those that had been charged by the Joint Underwriting Association, notwithstanding the fact that the association had accrued a $3.4 billion deficit.
Unlike the association, however, the Market Transition Facility will essentially "self-destruct" as drivers are shifted into the voluntary market. Only 10 percent of the worst drivers will remain in the pool by the end of September 1993, and they will then be placed in an "assigned risk pool," an insurance pool of otherwise uninsurable drivers that would be similar to the "assigned risk plan" that preceded the Joint Underwriting Association.
When the law was passed, officials said the Market Transition Facility would be self-supporting. That expectation, however, appears to have been overly optimistic.
In November 1990, two independent studies of the Market Transition Facility were commissioned -- one by the Insurance Department and the other by the Market Transition Facility itself. Both studies showed the Transition Facility to be running at a significant loss.
Robert Aldorisio, consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson of New York, the company hired by the Insurance Department, said his company had calculated that in order for the Market Transition Facility to break even, rates would have to be raised by 62.1 percent. With no increase, Mr. Aldorisio said recently, the Market Transition Facility could have been expected to run up a deficit of as much as $1 billion.
 
$1 Billion Deficit Predicted
 The Insurance Department disagreed with the company's projections and raised rates 18.6 percent.
The department also took exception to the study that had been requested by the actuarial committee of the Market Transition Facility itself. That study, prepared by William M. Mercer Inc., New York-based actuarial consultants, predicted a $1 billion deficit.
Frank J. Karlinski, a principal of the company, said that since that projection did not take into account the 18 percent rate increase that was granted after the study was done, the projected $1 billion deficit would be about 18 percent lower.
"Anyone looking at it logically has to come up with the same conclusions," Mr. Karlinski said.
In fact, one year after the Mercer and Milliman studies, Chubb & Son, a Warren-based insurance company, commissioned a study by a Connecticut actuarial company, Tillinghast, in support of a rate increase request. The Tillinghast study projected an $865 million deficit for the Market Transition Facility by 1993.
 
'Didn't Come as Any Surprise'
 "That didn't come as any surprise," said John J. Degnan, senior vice president of Chubb & Son. "We know from history that the J.U.A. ran up a $3 billion deficit. In my view, the Market Transition Facility is just a continuation of the J.U.A."
Despite such projections, however, Insurance Department officials maintain that there will not be a deficit by the time the Market Transition Facility is phased out by Sept. 30, 1993.
"All I can say is that we think that this is a highly speculative study," said James Berzok, a spokesman for the Insurance Department, referring to the Tillinghast study. "We don't think it reflects what will really happen with the M.T.F. We're trying to operate the M.T.F. so that there will not be a deficit. We're trying our best."
Mr. Berzok said none of the studies could accurately predict the effect of several major changes included in the Governor's insurance law. "The problem with those studies," Mr. Berzok said, "is that they were using old J.U.A. data." He also said the Market Transition Facility was required by law to stop writing policies by Sept. 30, 1992.
In addition, he said, beginning April 1, 1992, drivers with eight points or less can transfer out of the Market Transition Facility and into the voluntary market. He said that on Jan. 1, 1993, age, sex and marital status would no longer be taken into consideration in setting rates.
 
Increases Might Be Necessary
 Mr. Berzok acknowledged, however, that if the studies were accurate, rate increases might be necessary.
"If the Commissioner feels that rate increases are needed to keep the M.T.F. self-sustaining, he'll grant them," Mr. Berzok said.
But Eric Salfeety, president of the Professional Insurance Agents of New Jersey, a trade organization based in Trenton, said that it was not only the potential Market Transition Facility deficit that had cast new doubts on the Governor's insurance program. Several factors are converging, he said, that will make Mr. Florio's insurance law as unsuccessful as any the state has had in the past.
"First of all, there is an inherent problem in the way he has proceeded," Mr. Salfeety said. "The style of the way the Governor's office is jamming this down the throat of the industry is causing as much of a problem as the law itself."
Another problem, Mr. Salfeety said, is that a large portion of the money being paid out in claims never gets to consumers.
 
Changes Called Halfway Measures
 "There are a whole lot of people who are making money in the accident industry," he said. "What you have to do is look at where the claims dollars go. You find that they are not ending up in the pockets of the claimant."
Mr. Salfeety said the overriding problem with New Jersey's insurance system was that political pressures to keep rates artificially low resulted in halfway measures at real changes.
"We've used Band-Aid solutions as the problems arose," he said.
John Walsh, director of consumer issues for the Hanover Insurance Company in Piscataway, said one such Band-Aid solution was the Legislature's decision to add no-fault insurance to the already existing fault system.
Under no-fault, Mr. Walsh said, an accident victim's medical bills are paid by his own insurer regardless of who is at fault in the accident. A pure no-fault system does not allow for compensation for pain and suffering, thereby keeping claim payments and premiums relatively low.
 
Need to Choose One System
 In New Jersey, however, by adding a no-fault system to the existing system, "the two work off of each other and afford an extremely high level of coverage," Mr. Walsh said. But at the same time, he said, "you're paying for two systems instead of one."
He said the only way to lower premiums would be to make the difficult political decision to choose one system.
State Senator Lee B. Laskin, Republican of Cherry Hill, who was defeated in last Tuesday's election, agrees that radical changes are necessary to create a stable, fair insurance system in the state.
"A politician will stay as close to the middle as he can trying to make the least controversial decision," Mr. Laskin said. "But to fix this system, you can't play with it. You have to take extreme, courageous measures."
Mr. Laskin, who for years has been calling for an "open market system" in which insurance companies are minimally regulated and thereby forced to compete with one another, called Mr. Florio's attempt at change "an act of political hypocrisy."
"The principal reform was to eliminate the J.U.A. and the $222 surcharge," Mr. Laskin said. In its place, he said, the Governor created the Market Transition Facility and its now-burgeoning deficit.
 
'One Monstrosity for Another'
 "He's substituted one monstrosity for another," he said, "while the underlying system remains basically the same."
Another aspect of the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act that has rankled some experts is a provision that allows insurers to impose surcharges on drivers who are involved in chargeable accidents or convicted of motor vehicle violations.
Assemblyman Michael F. Adubato, Democrat of Newark, said that under existing regulations, drivers insured by the Market Transition Facility could be forced to pay significantly higher surcharges for traffic violations than those insured by the voluntary market. Mr. Adubato, one of the Legislature's experts on automobile insurance, did not seek re-election last Tuesday.
"If people commit the same offense, they should pay the same penalty," he said. "They shouldn't have to pay over 1,000 percent more just because they have the misfortune of not being insured by the voluntary market."
By way of example, Mr. Adubato said that if a Newark resident driving a 1990 Oldsmobile were convicted of going 42 miles per hour in a 25 m.p.h. zone, he would be hit with a surcharge of $2,263 a year for the next three years. The amount of the surcharge, Mr. Adubato said, is calculated at 87.3 percent of the person's $2,592 insurance premium.
 
Voluntary Market Surcharge
 If that same person with the same car and the same coverage and in the same place were instead insured in the voluntary market, Mr. Adubato said, his surcharge for the same speeding violation would be $232 a year for three years.
"The difference is that the surcharge on the M.T.F. driver is based on a percentage of his premium whereas in the voluntary market, the surcharge is a flat rate, no matter what your premiums are," Mr. Adubato said.
That disparity is exacerbated by the fact that rates are higher for those insured by the Market Transition Facility. And similar inequities exist with respect to surcharges for chargeable automobile accidents, Mr. Adubato said.
"The Commissioner of Insurance has gone way beyond the intent of the Legislature in implementing these outrageous regulations," Mr. Adubato said. "There is no rational way to defend this system."
Mr. Berzok said that while the surcharges were calculated on a percentage of the premium, the example given by Mr. Adubato represented the "worst-case scenario."

HEADLINE: Rutgers Celebrates 225th Anniversary

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
EXACTLY 225 years ago today, the last colonial governor of New Jersey, William Franklin, granted a royal charter establishing Queen's College, which was later to become Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. From its roots as a training ground for a few young men interested in the Dutch Reformed ministry, it has blossomed into the star of New Jersey's public higher education system.
It graduates more than 9,000 students annually in nearly 100 different fields and is fast closing in on its quest to be recognized as a leading public research university. 
 To mark the anniversary, the university has planned a weeklong series of events on its campuses, starting today at 4 P.M. with a concert here at the State Theater with Marilyn Horne and the Rutgers University Orchestra. Tomorrow, visitors can ring the Rutgers bell atop Old Queen's, a landmark building, as part of a self-guided walking tour, visit classrooms at Cook College and on the Camden campus view crafts demonstrations that celebrate Rutgers's colonial heritage. Later in the week there will be festivities on the Newark campus and a dinner to honor alumni for their community service.
For years considered just another sleepy state university, Rutgers came fully into stride in the 1980's when it aggressively began to transform itself into a major research university with a leading faculty. The shift in direction has brought charges that university teaching is being neglected, and significant cuts in state aid over the last few years threaten the momentum of change, but Rutgers's reputation continues to improve both within the state and nationally.
"While we are a very old institution, we are in another sense a fairly new institution in terms of the dimensions of Rutgers," said Richard P. McCormick, professor emeritus of history.
Rutgers's enhanced stature can be seen in everything from its buildings, now more than 600, to the quality of its students. A $600 million capital construction program, begun in the 1980's, has added many new buildings and renovated scores of others.
While performance on the Scholastic Aptitude Test has been declining nationally, scores for entering students now average 1095, an increase of more than 100 points over the last 10 years and more than 150 points higher than the current national average. There is also the much publicized statistic that one in five New Jersey high school valedictorians chooses to attend Rutgers.
Quality is not the only thing that has risen for students. Tuition has jumped 300 percent over the last decade to $3,114 for full-time undergraduates, causing fear that Rutgers is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many students.
The university has a roster of noted alumni, including Paul Robeson, the singer and political activist; George Segal, the sculptor; Ozzie Nelson, the bandleader and television star; Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Dr. Selman A. Waksman, a Nobel laureate for his discovery of streptomycin to treat tuberculosis. Jim Florio, a 1967 graduate of the university's law school in Camden, is the seventh Rutgers alumnus to serve as Governor of New Jersey.
Then there are the nearly famous graduates and the nearly graduated famous. Garret A. Hobart, an 1863 alumnus, died in office as William McKinley's Vice President and was replaced by Theodore Roosevelt. To the regret of development officers, Albert B. Wells, the wealthy president of the American Optical Company and creator of Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts, did not remember Rutgers after he was expelled from the college in the 1890's for stealing the bell clapper. Quincy Magoo, the absentminded cartoon character, was a 1949 graduate, although no one is sure exactly why.
Information on the schedule of events is available from the department of university communications at (908) 932-7315 Monday to Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.
 
<HD>UNIVERSITY'S MILESTONES
 
HERE are some important events in the history of Rutgers University, as adapted from Rutgers Magazine:
1766: William Franklin signs the charter establishing Queen's College, named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg, consort of King George III.
1771: The first classes are held at the Sign of the Red Lion, a tavern on the corner of Albany and Neilson Streets and the current site of Johnson & Johnson's international headquarters.
1793: Facing a severe fiscal crisis, the board, by one vote, rejects a proposal to merge with the College of New Jersey, which is to become Princeton University in 1896. The college will be closed for much of the next 32 years because of a lack of resources.
1825: The school is renamed Rutgers College after Col. Henry Rutgers, a former trustee and wealthy Revolutionary War hero. A year later, he gives the college $5,000 and a bell that still hangs in the cupola of Old Queen's, but much anticipated future contributions are not to come.
1864: Rutgers is selected over Princeton and what is to become Trenton State College as New Jersey's land grant college. The designation marks the first official tie between Rutgers and the state, and expands Rutgers as a scientific institution, particularly in the fields of engineering and agriculture.
1869: In the first intercollegiate football game in the country, Rutgers beats Princeton, an outcome that will not be repeated for 70 years. Also, scarlet becomes the unofficial school color when no ribbons can be found in orange, the students' first choice. Trustees will make scarlet the official color in 1900.
1892: "I'd die for dear old Rutgers" becomes the slogan of the college after Frank (Pop) Grant, a football player, breaks his leg in a game against Princeton and supposedly utters the famous phrase.
1918: The New Jersey College for Women, now Douglass College, opens. Three years later, the College of Agriculture opens.
1945: The New Jersey Legislature designates Rutgers as the state university and increases its support. This infusion of aid, coupled with a huge influx of World War II veterans in the next few years, sparks a period of growth that accelerates in the 1950's.
1956: A major reorganization by the State Legislature shifts control of Rutgers's affairs from an autonomous board of trustees to a board of governors, the majority of whom are appointed by the Governor and the New Jersey State Senate. The change paves the way for a building boom, financed by more than $100 million in bond issues, at Rutgers in the 1960's.
1961: The Rutgers Medical School, now the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, is founded.
1972: Rutgers College becomes coeducational.
1981: The board approves a blueprint for becoming a major public research university.
1989: Rutgers is invited to join the prestigious Association of American Universities, an indication of the university's increased national stature.
1990: The university bestows its 250,000th degree.

HEADLINE: Zaleski's First Task: Settling Housing Issue

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
MAYOR-ELECT Terence M. Zaleski, fresh from a victory few had predicted with any confidence nine months ago, pledged a new professional approach to Yonkers' problems last week. He indicated he would begin with the housing controversy that has been the city's single most divisive issue.
The choice is probably a good one, according to housing experts and others familiar with the decade-old landmark court case, because a solution is at hand. The city may not be required by the Federal court or the plaintiffs to build the final 800 housing units ordered as part of the remedy for 40 years of segregation in the city's schools and housing. 
 Worsening economic conditions have scattered the contractors and developers who were originally offered cash, zoning bonuses and other incentives to mix 800 units of low- and moderate-income housing among 4,000 units in market-rate developments.
The judge in the case, Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, has said that the 800 units of moderate-income housing, designated for the long-term phase of the plan, could be purchased instead of built. The city has expressed a desire to do that if the units do not represent more than 2 to 4 percent of any individual condominium or cooperative.
 
142 Units Are Almost Finished
 The court has recognized that in today's weak housing market it would be cheaper to buy existing apartments than to build them, and that it could be done expeditiously.
The first 142 units in the court decree -- public housing for low-income tenants -- are already in place, some of them ready for occupancy. They are two-story town-house structures on five sites in the city's mostly white neighborhoods.
Those on the so-called Raceway site, a former parking lot on the southbound service road of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway facing Yonkers Raceway, are the most advanced, with brick facades and landscaped front yards. They were described in enthusiastic terms by neighbors interviewed recently by National Public Radio.
Neil J. DeLuca, the City Manager whose job is being eliminated under the new strong-mayor form of government that Yonkers voters approved for inauguration Jan. 1, suggested several years ago that empty condominiums or cooperative apartments be purchased to fulfill the requirements of the long-term plan.
 
A Reluctance to Accept Proposal
 But when he announced the proposal, he was unable to identify any apartment complex willing to take one unit of such housing. City officials realized that it would have to be done in a coordinated fashion, with each condominium or cooperative taking a share.
This is a challenge that those familiar with the situation believe Mr. Zaleski, a Democrat, might take on -- to put the housing-remedy order behind him and be able to proceed with the other issues he has outlined since his election.
Some activity in this aspect of the housing case is already under way. Karen Hill, who has been seeking developers on behalf of the city to fulfill the long-term requirements of the housing plan, is understood to be negotiating to buy cooperative units in an apartment complex that is in financial difficulty in northwest Yonkers.
Mr. Zaleski said last week that his victory over two Republicans, Councilman Peter A. Chema and former Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli, who ran as an independent, was part of a reform process that included "pushing the political machine past us."
 
Republican Vote Was Split
 He said he was referring to the successful campaign by reformers in the party to replace Ralph Arred, the Yonkers Democratic Party chairman. "With Arred in place I'm not sure I would have won," said Mr. Zaleski, who won a primary against James J. Mannion, a restaurant owner who had the backing of the city's Democratic leadership.
It is generally assumed that the two Republicans split a vote that otherwise would have been enough to overwhelm Mr. Zaleski, who took 36 percent of the mayoral vote. Mr. Chema had 33 percent and Mr. Martinelli 28 percent. The six-member City Council will be led by a Democrat, Vincenza A. Restiano, holding the new post of Council President. That post includes a vote.
Four incumbent Republicans, John Spencer, Salvator J. Sialiano, Thomas Dickerson and Edward Fagan Jr., won re-election. Symra Brandon, a Democrat, won the seat representing a mainly minority district in southwest Yonkers, given up by Joe L. Farmer, also a Democrat, to seek the Council presidency.
A close struggle for the seat given up by Mr. Chema pitted former Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko, a Democrat, against Edward Magilton, a Republican. It was likely to be resolved only after a recount of the votes.

To the Editor: I worked for our State Department in Germany from the beginning of the Allied High Commission (1949-1954) and so lived on the Rhine, Bad Godesberg, for four years, after a year in Frankfurt.
In a Chicago bookstore in 1958 I found "The Rhine From Rotterdam to Constance," published in 1892. 
 In June I was on an Elderhostel program in Germany with a week in Goslar and visited Bad Harzburg again, and thereby got a glimpse of the Brocken. Our group was driven over to Halberstadt and Quedlinburg in the former East Germany. Halberstadt had been devastated by the Communists, after being bombed by the Allies because of an aircraft factory nearby. Quedlinburg was in better shape: That's the town from which the Texas G.I. took medieval artifacts at the end of the war and his heirs wouldn't give them up until the Germans paid them. They were not yet on display.
During our program in Goslar, we had a professor of economics from the University of Leipzig who described the uprising in that city, which then stirred the rest of the country. Since all teachers in the East had to submit their resignations by Sept. 1 this year, he didn't know if he would have a job after that. A nice man.

Antitrust Actions on the Rise Again

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
A decade after the Justice Department dropped its long-running lawsuit against the International Business Machines Corporation, the computer industry is seeing a resurgence of Government antitrust investigations and private antitrust lawsuits.
The new antitrust actions are aimed not at I.B.M., whose power has waned, but at a group of younger companies and coalitions that have risen in prominence through their control of industry standards. 
 Lawyers say the renewed attention to antitrust matters is partly in reaction to two important recent trends in the computer industry.
One is the aggressive tendency of some technology companies to use their patents and copyrights to stymie competitors.
The other is the growth of joint ventures or consortiums, either to set standards or to allow companies to share research. Coalitions have recently been accepted by the Government partly because of a belief that standards help customers and improve American competitiveness with foreign rivals.
In light of the goal of increasing competitiveness, the greater antitrust activity might have a perverse effect, some observers say. Antitrust actions could have "a chilling effect on those kinds of ventures which U.S. economic policy seemingly wants to encourage," said Lee T. Gesmer, a Boston lawyer who represents several industry coalitions that have formed to promote standards.
But many other lawyers and industry executives said that the antitrust investigations, while making some companies nervous, have not yet affected corporate behavior much.
In recent months, Microsoft, the leading software company; Intel, the dominant chip maker, and the Open Software Foundation, a company backed by several computer makers, have acknowledged that they are under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The F.T.C. does not comment on its investigations unless it decides to take action against a company.
The Open Software Foundation, the founders of which include I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment, develops standard operating system software for computers. Intel dominates the market for microprocessors used in personal computers, and Microsoft is the leader in the market for the operating system software used to control personal computers.
The F.T.C. also recently settled a price-fixing case against Nintendo, the video game giant, but some rivals think the Government is still looking at Nintendo's business practices. Nintendo said it did not believe such an investigation was under way.
The Justice Department, which shares responsibility for antitrust matters, does not seem to be as active as the F.T.C., but computer industry lawyers say it is also stirring. Recently, they said, the department fought a bitter turf battle with the F.T.C. and won the right to conduct the antitrust review of the acquisition of the Ashton-Tate Company by a software rival, Borland International Inc.
Last month the Justice Department and Borland signed a consent decree permitting the merger to proceed but requiring Borland to allow other companies to make products compatible with Ashton-Tate's popular dBase program.
Private lawsuits are also more noticeable. In a recent action filed in United States District Court in San Jose, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a large maker of semiconductors, charged Intel with trying to bar it from the microprocessor business.
A similar suit against Intel has been filed in Texas by the Cyrix Corporation, a maker of math processing chips based in Richardson, Tex. The Addamax Corporation, a small software company in Champaign, Ill., has filed suit against the Open Software Foundation in United States District Court in Boston, and several video game companies are locked in legal battles with Nintendo.
Industry was torn by Government and private antitrust lawsuits throughout the 1960's and 1970's. Virtually all of the cases were directed against giants -- notably I.B.M., which was dominant in computers, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which had a monopoly in telephone service and equipment. But that era ended in January 1982, when the Justice Department dropped its I.B.M. case and reached a settlement with A.T.& T. that broke up the Bell System.
Experts say one reason for the resurgence of antitrust investigations is simply that Federal regulators are becoming more aggressive in general after eight years of little enforcement during the Reagan Administration.
"I don't know of any particular bent toward going after computer issues," said Ron Rowe, director of litigation for the F.T.C. Bureau of Competition. But industry lawyers say that several factors have made the industry more subject to antitrust scrutiny and lawsuits.
One is that technology companies in the last few years have become a lot more aggressive in using patents and copyrights to block competitors. "Intellectual property and antitrust are two sides of the same coin," said Gary Reback, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif. "Any time there's an assertion of intellectual property rights, generally speaking there's a counterclaim on monopolization."
Indeed, Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix have been sued by Intel for copyright and patent infringement, respectively. Similarly, Hewlett-Packard, which is being sued by Apple Computer Inc. for copyright infringement, has claimed that Apple is trying to monopolize the market for computer screen display software.
Another factor is the growing number of mergers, joint ventures and consortiums that mark the consolidation of the industry. Some such collaborations like the Sematech semiconductor consortium are meant to share basic research. The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 encourages such cooperation on basic research by providing limited protection against antitrust suits. The electronics industry has been pushing for legislation to extend that protection to joint manufacturing ventures.
Many coalitions have been formed recently to set standards because customers want to be assured that they can buy computers from more than one vendor and still have them work together. That has fostered numerous such joint efforts as Unix International, X/Open, Sparc International, the Object Management Group and the Advanced Computing Environment -- formed by companies to convince customers that they are adhering to a standard.
Lawyers say standards enhance competition and are therefore desirable. "It's a matter of public knowledge that I.B.M.-compatible standards are probably pro-competitive," said Mr. Rowe of the F.T.C.
"Look at all the competition it engendered," he added, referring to the dozens of companies making personal computer "clones" and hundreds of software companies making programs for such machines.
But the ability to control the standard is critical. In I.B.M.-compatible PC's, Intel controls the development of microprocessors and Microsoft, the operating system software.
Detractors say microprocessors and operating systems would have advanced faster and been less expensive if there had been more competition. Intel, for instance, recently slashed prices of microprocessors and math processors, a move that some analysts said came only because its monopoly ended with the introduction of competitive products by Advanced Micro Devices, Cyrix and others.
Moreover, competitors have complained that Intel and Microsoft have used their sway to help each compete in other areas. Both Intel and Microsoft say they have bent over backward to be fair and have rapidly advanced the technology.
The case against the Open Software Foundation also raises questions about how to set standards. The foundation, based in Cambridge, Mass., evaluates software submitted by various companies, chooses winners and incorporates their software into the standard Unix operating system. It then licenses the standard Unix to its members and other companies.
Addamax, which makes software to enhance the security of Unix, claimed in its antitrust suit that Open Software is a cartel whose members control 70 percent of the Unix market. It said that Open Software offered to pay Addamax a ridiculously low price to include its software in the standard Unix and that Addamax had no choice but to go along.
"Addamax had a simple choice: to be the selected supplier and get a little money out of the market or not to be selected and get no money out of the market," the company said in its complaint, filed in United States District Court in Boston in April. Eventually, a competitor's software was chosen, forcing Addamax to reduce its staff from 80 to 15 people.
Lawyers contended, however, that Open Software was somewhat exceptional in that it actually sells software. Most other standards groups merely choose standards and allow any company to make a product that adheres to their standards. Still, some coalitions are being careful in light of the lawsuit and F.T.C. investigation of Open Software.
Sematech has also been the subject of complaints that it "plays God," in that its endorsement of certain equipment gives the manufacturers of that equipment a big marketing edge. But the consortium says it has not been been sued over the issue.
Nintendo, meanwhile, has attracted lawsuits because its game machines prevent unauthorized cartridges from being played. Nintendo says this is to prevent the market from being glutted with poor games. Others, again, see a simple pattern of control.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Plenty of Bells and Whistles on the Latest Portables

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Battery-powered color displays and data entry from pens or styluses appear to be the next frontiers in portable computing, judging from the new models on display at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, Nev., last month. While pen computing does not appear likely to capture a significant share of the portable market soon, primarily because of the lack of pen-based software, color displays are attractive for some specialized applications. And they use existing software.
Epson America, AST Research, Dell Computer, Sharp Electronics and several other computers makers showed off new battery-powered, color laptops at Comdex, with prices ranging from $5,000 to more than $10,000. The Sharp PC 6881 appears to be especially good, but it, like many other models, will not be ready until late spring because companies have had difficulty in getting reliable color screens. 
 The Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston, which did not mount a major display at Comdex, recently offered an alternative to the color portable -- a 17-pound color "luggable" that has to be plugged in to an electric outlet. Priced at $9,999, it offers the best color screen and system performance of any portable, if you are willing to regard it as a portable.
"This is the beginning of a migration process," said Bruce A. Stephen, director of PC hardware research at the International Data Corporation of Framingham, Mass. "Color is starting to appear at the high end, but it will eventually become a common, economical feature on most products." He predicted it would be a couple of years before color was the norm for battery-powered computers.
Portable computers capable of displaying color images have been around for a few years, but the high cost and weight of the systems made them impractical for all but the most desperate users. Color screens have added about $2,000 to the cost of otherwise conventional laptop computers. The least expensive of the color systems announced at Comdex was AST Research's Premium Exec 386SX/25C, with a suggested list price of $4,995. Without color, an otherwise comparable system sells for less than $3,000.
For many users it has been far easier and less expensive to buy or rent a conventional color monitor and attach it to the portable PC, using a "video out" jack that most of the newer laptops and notebooks have. A worker who moves among several offices on a regular basis, for example, could buy a color VGA monitor for each site for less than the price of the color option on a laptop machine.
For most people, color is a convenience, not a necessity. Apple Macintosh and Next computer users did without color for years, and the new Apple Powerbook notebook Macs are all monochrome machines. (A striking sign of the importance Apple attaches to color is that the Powerbooks have no standard way to attach to a color desktop monitor, except through a Radius Inc. adapter sold separately for $600.) How essential can color be for most business applications, after all, when few businesses invest in the color printers or copiers needed to transfer the images to paper?
But color can be important for special applications, like presentations, software development and graphic design. Color adds emphasis to information: a deficit on a spreadsheet pops out when it is highlighted in red ink; a colorful chart makes it easier to distinguish among different facets of the data presented.
Does a traveling sales representative need a color portable computer? On the one hand, as a visual aid for a sales presentation, it helps hold the customer's interest. On the other, the small size of the screens on most portables limits presentations to small, intimate groups. And some new portables use a color technology that becomes hard to read except by those directly in front of the screen, awkward for more than three people, huddled together, to watch.
Two technologies are popular for color portables. One, called active matrix, yields the best performance, at a higher price than passive matrix. Both technologies can produce VGA-level resolution, but only active-matrix screens can theoretically show 256 shades and colors at once, with the passive-matrix screens limited to 16. (VGA, for variable graphics array, refers to a system capable of displaying 640 picture elements, or pixels, horizontally and 480 pixels vertically.)
The active matrix screens offered by Sharp, Epson and Compaq, use a thin-film transistor technology that controls each pixel on the screen individually. With one or more transistors behind each pixel, the computer can supply more information to each point on the screen, yielding a greater palette of colors. And the colors are much brighter and the contrast sharper than on a passive screen. People standing to the side of the computer can see the image clearly. Passive matrix screens are essentially the same as monochrome liquid crystal displays, with a color filtering system added.
Part of the high cost of active-matrix screens is the result of United States Government trade regulations. In an effort to protect American makers of active-matrix screens against unfair competition from the Japanese, the Government slapped a 66 percent tariff on imported screens. The trouble is that there are no significant American makers of active-matrix screens to protect.
There is no tariff on active-matrix screens if they are imported as part of a complete computer system, rather than as components. As a result of the Government sanctions, then, American computer makers have shifted production of the new color portables to foreign plants.
The microprocessor driving many new color laptops is the Intel 386SL, a chip that has special power-management features that can be exploited by computer makers. Although it takes more power to operate a color screen than it does to run a monochrome screen, each computer maker says it can promise two to three hours of battery life for the color computers. As they say in car ads, your mileage may vary.
Dell, which was showing its seven-pound 325NC color notebook at the show, uses a nickel-hydride battery system instead of the conventional nickel-cadmium battery. So does Toshiba America Inc., one of the first companies to switch to nickel-hydride batteries. These batteries are supposedly more "environmentally correct" because they use a hydrogen derivative instead of toxic cadmium. And Toshiba officials say they are not subject to the infamous "memory effect" of nickel-cadmium batteries. The memory effect occurs when a user recharges the battery before it is completely exhausted. The battery then tends to lose power at the point it was recharged, shortening its effective life. Makers of ni-cad batteries dispute the existence of a memory effect, but users say it happens all the time.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Humming Along With Hyundai's Sonata

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
AS one afflicted with an oft-misspelled and usually mispronounced name, I am sympathetic to Hyundai. The South Korean company has been sending cars to the United States for five years now, and you still hear some very strange renditions of its moniker.
To set the record straight (and this is a good day for it), the name is Hunday as in Sunday. And the names of its products are Excel and Elantra, Scoupe and Sonata. 
 By whatever name, though, the company has made its presence known in fairly short order. It followed the introduction of its subcompact Excel in 1986 by moving from its beachhead in Garden Grove, Calif., to an 18-acre headquarters just off the San Diego Freeway, and then set about building large complexes for parts and distribution in Ontario, Calif.; Aurora, Ill.; Portland, Ore., and St. Louis.
For 1992, there is a new corporate logo in the shape of a stylized "H," and the company's American arm -- Hyundai Motor America -- has become the largest subsidiary of the Hyundai conglomerate, which sells cars and trucks in 65 countries and which accounts for 10 percent of South Korea's gross national product.
A lot of that is the result of the Excel, which quickly became a bestseller. But the Sonata has done well, too, and its new design merits a look.
The car in question was a black four-door Sonata GLS, the top of the line, and when I slid behind the wheel it was a case of love at first sit.
I had been driving a BMW 325i, and while it seems an embarrassment to say it, the Hyundai was more to my liking, or at least it seemed to make more sense than all the dollars that one would tie up in the sporty Bimmer. The Sonata was so . . . well, so liveable.
The styling is not spectacular and the Sonata turns no heads, despite its smoother lines and more aggressive look. But the car's appearance, with a new grille, a lower hoodline and different lights and accents, is average-nice. There is chrome trim, and the molded wheels carry big Michelin tires for what Hyundai says is a "more competitive" stance.
For a compact, there is surprising legroom in the back seat, and the interior is generally open and pleasing. The trunk, too, is relatively commodious, and the rear seatback folds down to form a pass-through and provide a cargo platform.
The tester had a dark gray interior of cloth and vinyl, but leather is available if you want to put some icing inside the cake. The front buckets have manual adjustments, but they include up-and-down functions in addition to sliding to and fro.
There is also an automatic "down" function for the driver's window. And, while many makers seem fixated on losing the power window switches somewhere on the center console, the Sonata's are where they ought to be, easy to manipulate on the armrest of the door. Even more amazing, the back windows go all the way down. Take note, Detroit.
The wheel is typical sport-sedan, padded but hard. And the wheel represents one flaw in an otherwise neat package: There is no airbag in its hub, and that means passive belts that motor up and over the door frames. They are annoying and dangerous, and they serve little purpose, since the lapbelts still must be buckled manually. Unfortunate, too, are the lack of standard antilock brakes and a standard sunroof, although both features are available as options, with ABS being new for '92.
Otherwise, the interior is well and sensibly put together. There is a flat and usable shelf in the top of the dash, and storage extends to a somewhat small glovebox and a series of bins, cubbies and toll-change holders.
The instrument panel carries full gauges, including a 130-m.p.h. speedometer and an 8,000-r.p.m. tach. Controls are easy to use, and the heating system is a good example. There are three simple knobs, one for temperature, one for the fan and one, with illustrations, to direct the flow of air.
The ashtray is large and easy to find at night, which is important for the relative safety of smokers, and the Sonata also offers a slide-out tray with two cupholders. Be warned, though, that it is directly above the ashtray, meaning you can't feed both vices at the same time.
As the top of Hyundai's line, the test car was equipped with a V6 engine, which can be had only with an automatic transmission. Attention has been paid to thriftiness, however, through an overdrive button on the shift handle. Fuel economy with the V6 is estimated at 18 miles per gallon, city, and 24, highway.
Lesser Sonata's carry four-cylinder engines and are available with five-speed sticks. Economy with the 2-liter four and the manual transmission is rated at 20, city, and 27, highway.
The 3-liter V6 puts out 142 horsepower, which is plenty in a car that weighs only 2,932 pounds, and both acceleration and highway performance are good. But, while there is sufficient potential for a speeding ticket, the car wants to go 60 m.p.h. just as you do, which means you need not keep an overly cautious eye on the speedometer.
On the road, the Sonata tracks as well as it hums, and there is a steady feel that lends a sense of security. The ride is comfortable if a bit stiff, and the car is happiest away from potholes, which does not necessarily make it a bad person.
It is price, of course, that makes the Sonata the truly solid citizen that it is. This plain-vanilla car starts at $11,150, and moves up to $13,995 for the basic GLS and $15,535 for the GLS V6.
At that rate, you could have two Hyundais for the price of the Bimmer. Keep one for Sunday, one for Monday.

HEADLINE: Welcome To 1992;
A Survival Guide For Elected Officials (Results May Vary)

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Yes, Mr. or Ms. Elected Official, the voters really are angry out there.
This is not the time to run on your savvy, your years of influence or your ability to work the "corridors of power," as Dick Thornburgh, the former Attorney General, put it in his hapless campaign for Senate in Pennsylvania. The voters are frustrated with the corridors of power, tired of the status quo. 
 They made that clear in Pennsylvania last week and they made it clear in turning the New Jersey Legislature on its head. The economy is ailing -- you've heard, right? -- and the majority of voters now tell pollsters that they believe the country is headed down the wrong track. The sweeping changes abroad only seem to underscore the feeling of drift and stall at home. The message to incumbents is clear: "Fight for change or die," in the words of Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee.
Incumbent governors seem to be an endangered species. Buddy Roemer, a Republican, lost in Louisiana and a Democrat, Ray Mabus, was ousted in Mississippi. The stunning Republican gains in the Virginia and the New Jersey legislatures were widely seen as slaps at the Democratic Governors, L. Douglas Wilder and Jim Florio -- who, fortunately for them, were not on the ballot.
This does not mean that incumbents are necessarily doomed. But many are in need of serious repositioning before the 1992 elections. "This election was not so much an anti-incumbent message as an anti-business-as-usual message," said Representative Vic Fazio, who as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is charged with protecting a few hundred nervous Democratic incumbents next year. There are clear lessons from this election for all incumbents, including the No. 1 incumbent, President Bush.
 
First, Get Real
 In a troubled economy, voters get down to basics. "This is about money in my pocket, prices for the essentials of life, the level of fear on the block," said Mr. Tully. Don Sipple, a Republican consultant, said, "Understand that the American people have an agenda, whether their leaders do or not."
Unemployment and health care were on the agenda in Pennsylvania, taxes in New Jersey, crime in the Houston mayor's race. The health care issue took off after Senator Harris Wofford rode it to victory in Pennsylvania: Democrats said their proposals would gain new momentum, Senate Republicans produced a plan of their own, and Mr. Bush announced that he would produce a measure before the 1992 election.
Over-arching it all was the economy: "Every issue that popped up is related to a stagnant economy," said a top Republican strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This helps explain why a traditional conflict seems all the more acute among the voters: the demand for services and the aching sensitivity to taxes. Tax cuts for the middle class, also urged by Mr. Wofford, are now the rage.
 
Don't Be 'One of Them'
 Given the public's current distaste for Washington, its institutions and its policy gridlock, the smart incumbent will try to set himself apart. Witness George Bush in his first official campaign foray for 1992: "You work your heart out for new ideas in trying to bring new systems to this country, and you face the same old tired liberal cliches in Washington, D.C."
Harrison Hickman, a Democratic pollster, tells incumbents: "You have to separate yourself out. You have to say, 'Yeah, throw the bums out, but I'm not a bum.' " Mr. Hickman added, "I don't think you'll see a lot of people sitting behind their desks in their offices in their ads -- they'll be out, amongst the folk."
In fact, political professionals advise more town meetings, more talk radio interviews. "If I were doing an incumbent race, I'd show I wasn't the typical politician," said James Carville, a strategist for Mr. Wofford. "I'd have a lot of testimonial ads from people saying I cared about people and helped them. I'd document a lot of trips back to the state."
Incumbents in the House and Senate have often campaigned on their seniority, their accumulated clout. Next year, "fighting for change" might be the more appropriate theme. "I'm going to be working for Bob Packwood," said Mr. Sipple, "and the worst thing he could do is, 'I've been there for 24 years, I have seniority and I can get things done for Oregon.' "
Washington State showed this trend has its limits: Confounding experts, its voters defeated a stringent, retroactive term limitation measure after opponents warned it would cost the state influence in Congress.
Still, there is a restive air in politics, and last week's elections showed that outsiders can run at incumbents from the left or the right. Mr. Mabus, a Harvard-educated Democrat, was elected Governor of Mississippi in 1987 as a New South reformer. He was defeated on Tuesday by a conservative Republican businessman, Kirk Fordice, who ran an outsider's campaign that included attacks on liberal elitists, welfare abuse and racial quotas. "What we have tonight is a mandate for change," Mr. Fordice said.
 
Stay Clean, Stay Home
 Voters are in an unforgiving mood. This is not a good time to be associated with big political action committee money. This is not a good time to be taking Congressional trips to exotic climes. This is certainly not a good time to have bounced checks. Representative Larry Hopkins, Republican candidate for Governor in Kentucky, was already behind Lieut. Gov. Brereton Jones, his Democratic opponent, when the Congressional check-bouncing scandal broke. But the Democrat's lead exploded after Mr. Hopkins acknowledged writing 32 overdrafts at the House bank, according to Mr. Jones's polltaker -- growing from 12 to 23 points in two nights.
Any of the perks that make an incumbent look insulated from the ways of everyman and generally out of touch should be avoided, political professionals agree.
Mr. Bush is not immune. He revels in his role as Commander in Chief and a world leader. But last week he announced, with a trace of annoyance, that he was canceling a trip to the Far East later this month -- to keep an eye on Congress, he said, and tend to pressing domestic affairs. Democrats have been campaigning hard against Mr. Bush's travel, trying to make it a symbol of neglect of the domestic agenda. Mr. Bush seemed stung and defensive last week as he headed off to Rome for a NATO meeting, taking pains to describe how foreign trade agreements affect hometown U.S.A.
In the end, it is worth remembering that 96 percent of the House incumbents were re-elected last year, and that Mr. Bush remains at a comfortable level in the polls. Still, something is stirring among the voters, and a body can't be too careful out there.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
There's a New World Order in Asia; The U.S. Will Have to Catch Up

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

 BODY:
A handful of Asia-based diplomats are willing to give President Bush the benefit of the doubt. They are willing to believe that he canceled his trip to Asia this month for reasons that go beyond opinion polls suggesting that the President's globetrotting habits have cut into his approval rating among voters.
In fact, some diplomats say, President Bush may have been well advised to stay home until he knows with certainty how Washington should respond to the political and economic changes that are sweeping across the Far East, and that appear destined to alter the American role. "Everything is fluid in the region right now," said a senior European diplomat in Bangkok. "Perhaps now is not the moment for the President to visit Asia. The United States needs time to absorb it all." 
 Since World War II, American policy in Asia has centered on -- indeed, tens of thousands of Americans have sacrificed their lives over -- the two great land masses on the Pacific rim of China: Indochina and the Korean peninsula. But consider the news from the region in just the last few weeks: Cambodians announced the end of their 12-year civil war; Vietnam restored full diplomatic relations with its chief adversary, China, in hopes of concentrating on economic development; North and South Korea reported the first substantive progress on a framework to resolve more than four decades of brotherly hate.
Any one of those developments would have been startling a few years ago. Taken together at a time when the cold war is all but over, they could be important evidence of a new era of peace and prosperity, even amid reminders of lingering suffering like that of the Vietnamese boat people now resisting forced repatriation from Hong Kong..
Last week Mr. Bush and the other NATO heads of state met in Rome to chart a new role in a Europe without the Soviet threat that had defined the alliance's reason for existence. It was a get-together that Mr. Bush, who considers himself a sort of honorary chairman of the club of world leaders, might well have relished not only for its reassuring pomp but also for its comparative lack of ambiguity.
The Bush Administration has made its own Asia headlines in recent weeks by announcing its willingness to open talks with Hanoi to normalize diplomatic and trade ties 16 years after the war's end, its plan to remove tactical nuclear weapons from the region, and its intention to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to Beijing this month. Mr. Baker would be the highest-ranking American official to visit China since pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananman Square were put down in a bloody confrontation by Chinese soldiers two years ago.
The American Century in Asia is not over yet, but already the United States is facing what could be the starkest policy choices since 1898, when President William McKinley invaded and colonized the Philippines even though he knew it as little more than a group of islands "somewhere away around on the other side of the world."
The question for the United States is whether it should continue in the role of policeman and mediator in a region that is increasingly able to resolve its own conflicts and that, far from being the home of "little brown brothers" of old, is now America's fiercest economic competitor. The Bush Administration insists that the choice has already been made, and that the United States military will remain in Asia indefinitely, although the Pacific force, which last year numbered about 140,000 men and women, will be cut by more than 10 percent as part of worldwide Pentagon reductions.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says a complete military withdrawal would almost surely result in a "series of destabilizing regional arms races, an increase in regional tensions and possibly conflict."
Yet that has not silenced forces on Capitol Hill and private defense analysts in the United States who argue that, at a time of domestic austerity, there is no need to continue defending nations that are able to do it themselves. They say, too, that American military forces in Asia are seen increasingly as a paper tiger, since it seems unlikely that the United States, still traumatized over the war in Vietnam, would ever allow itself to be drawn into another large regional conflict in Asia.
"This isn't Kuwait -- there's no oil here for the United States to rush in to protect, and the threat of Communism is dying here as it is everywhere in the world," said a Thai official. Selig S. Harrison, a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment, argues that the American military umbrella in Asia has subsidized the economies of booming East Asian nations, particularly Japan, by freeing them from large military expenditures. "We are helping to make Asia safe for Japanese investment," said Mr. Harrison, who estimates that the United States spends $42 billion a year in direct and indirect costs for its Far East military forces. "It's a ridiculous expenditure."
There is one important area of agreement between analysts like Mr. Harrison and the Bush Administration, and that is over the need for a continued American military presence in South Korea, which faces an isolated and unpredictable enemy to the north. Pyongyang is believed to have an active program to develop nuclear weapons and in the near future could have the bomb. Even in the Koreas, however, there is hope of finally making peace. Late last month, the two nations agreed on the broad outlines of a peace plan reported to include a non-aggression pact, a pledge of respect for each other's political systems and provisions for reuniting families across the border.
 
China and Vietnam
 In Indochina, the optimism about peace is greater still. Despite apprehension among their neighbors that China and Vietnam might be contemplating a destabilizing military alliance, diplomats say the recent warming between Beijing and Hanoi is instead a marriage of convenience between two still-bitter rivals wishing to put aside their differences for now to focus on economic progress.
Closer ties between China and Vietnam may also be the factor that prevents Cambodia from collapsing into civil war again. Beijing has broad control over the genocidal, Chinese-armed Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians in the 1970's, while Vietnam retains influence with the government it helped install in Phnom Penh under Prime Minister Hun Sen. Under a United Nations peace treaty, the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Hun Sen and his political allies, and two other Cambodian factions will share power in what amounts to a coalition government.
In the expectation that the United States military will gradually reduce its presence in Asia, countries now living under the American defense umbrella have begun putting forward proposals for stepped-up regional military cooperation.
Several of the more ambitious proposals have come from Japan, which last summer recommended to the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that they begin regular consultations on military issues. Last week, the new Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, expressed his hope that Japan would soon rewrite its defense laws to permit the use of its troops outside Japanese borders, as part of United Nations peacekeeping forces.
But with only a month to go before ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor and with memories of Japanese occupation and atrocities during World War II still vivid across Asia and the Pacific, Mr. Miyazawa's suggestion met with a decidedly unenthusiastic response outside Japan.
Said an American diplomat: "Given a choice between an Asian defense umbrella provided by the United States and one offered by Tokyo, you'd better believe that we're going to remain the more popular option."

Highlights of last week's elections

 BODY:

Some Surprises Beat Big Odds In National Races
 
 
Pennsylvania Senator
 
Harris Wofford, a little-known Democrat with an anti-Bush message, trounces former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, winning 56 percent of the vote to Mr. Thornburgh's 44 percent. Mr. Wofford was 40 percentage points behind Mr. Thornburgh, a popular former Governor, as the race began, but had hammered away at related themes: that President Bush's policies had damaged the economy and particularly the middle class, and that the United States badly needs national health insurance. Pennsylvania voters told pollsters that national health insurance was the No. 1 issue on their minds. On Thursday, Republicans in Congress introduced a new bill to create an insurance plan; it includes tax credits to help people buy insurance, millions for new clinics and regulations on insurance premiums. More Congressional Democrats spoke up for their own bill, which is modeled on Canada's system.
 
 
Mississippi Governor
 
Kirk Fordice becomes the state's first Republican governor since 1876, ousting the incumbent, Gov. Ray Mabus. In a bitter campaign, Mr. Fordice, a wealthy construction contractor, painted Mr. Mabus as a liberal in the Kennedy tradition and charged that he had bloated the state's payroll as its economy slid downhill. And, although he rejected comparisons with David Duke next door in Louisiana, he introduced racial themes late in the race, stressing his opposition to quotas and attacking welfare recipients.
 
 
Kentucky Governor
 
Lieut. Gov. Brereton C. Jones, a Democrat, gets 65 percent of the vote for governor, easily defeating a seven-term Congressman, Larry J. Hopkins. Mr. Hopkins had received campaign help from President Bush but was hurt when it was revealed that he was one of the lawmakers who wrote bad checks on the House of Representatives bank.
 
 
 
Power Shifts in State and Local Ruling Bodies

 
 
New Jersey Legislature
 
Republicans riding a tide of anger over tax increases by Gov. Jim Florio sweep Democrats out of their majorities in both houses for the first time in 20 years. The next day, as they introduce the members of their new veto-proof voting blocs, G.O.P. leaders say they will roll back about $550 million in taxes.
 
 
Virginia General Assembly
 
Although the Democrats maintain their majorities in both houses, Republicans become a major force in the legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. The Senate is now split 22 to 18 in favor of Democrats; before it was split 30 to 10. The results are seen as an embarrassment for Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination and describing how effective his government has been, but whom voters apparently felt was ignoring the state.
 
 
Suffolk County, New York
 
G.O.P. regains control of the government of this suburban Long Island county as a little-known Assemblyman, Robert J. Gaffney, defeats the incumbent, Patrick G. Halpin, in the race for county executive. Mr. Halpin's popularity suffered from the effects of the recession and the county's high taxes. In adjacent Nassau County, however, traditional Republican dominance of the legislature is sharply reduced as Democrats gather enough votes to block Republican ordinances.
 
 
New York City Council
 
A new 51-member council is elected with few surprises because most of the races were settled in the Democratic primaries. Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker from Queens who has led the newly powerful council in several challenges to Mayor David N. Dinkins, seems in no danger of losing his grip on the body.
 
 
 
Closely Watched Ballot Measures Are Defeated

 
 
Term limits for officeholders
 
In Washington State, a proposal to limit the state's governors and members of Congress to two or three terms is defeated. It is the first time such a measure has lost since term limits got the public's attention last year, when voters in California, Colorado and Oklahoma approved them -- although not for holders of national office. Opponents argued that term limits would mean populous states like California would overwhelm smaller ones like Washington that are protected by having senior representatives in important Congressional posts. One such opponent was House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Representative from Washington who would have lost his job if the measure had passed and whose last-minute campaigning against it was thought to have been crucial to its defeat.
 
 
Suicide help by doctors
 
Another Washington ballot initiative, one that would let doctors kill or assist in the suicide of terminally ill patients who ask to die, is also defeated. Opponents said the bill would mean elderly people with little money would feel family pressure to commit suicide, that Washington would become a "fly and die" destination for people from other states and that some people might be labeled terminally ill prematurely. The turnout in Washington is a record for an off-year election.

Chileans Pay Dearly For Economic Growth

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
The only people in America who may not be ready for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to decide whether he will run for President are the political cartoonists and satirists.
In a world overstocked with Dan Quayle jokes, Mr. Cuomo's should-I-or-shouldn't-I routine has provided fresh material for the monologues of Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and Mark Russell. Political cartoonists from coast to coast have searched for the best visual vehicle to depict the baggy-eyed Governor in the throes of his indecision. 
 Examples abound: Mr. Cuomo paralyzed by irresolution on the starting line of the New York marathon. Mr. Cuomo forlorn as The Boy Who Cried "Maybe." Mike Luckovich of The Atlanta Constitution drew three frames to show the Governor agonizing over a choice before revealing his decision in the fourth frame: "I'll have the lasagna."
Mr. Cuomo's monthlong bout of Presidential pondering is funny, said Stuart Carlson, a cartoonist with The Milwaukee Sentinel, because people can relate to the torment of making big decisions. But they are unaccustomed to seeing it in their public officials and their amusement can quickly turn into irritation if the process lasts too long, he warned.
"If you get past that point, people start to ridicule you," said the cartoonist, who drew a Super Mario video game that accepts quarters only after the player undergoes self-analysis as to whether it's the best way to spend the 25 cents. "If you take too long that tolerance begins to fade real fast," Mr. Carlson said.
Last week, Johnny Carson joked about a new car model, the '92 Cuomo, which "you drive down the center of the road with both directional signals on." Mark Russell, the political satirist, joined a number of comedians in poking fun at Mr. Cuomo's description of the conflict between his heart and his head.
"Cuomo says, 'My heart tells me to go for it but my head says stay home,' " Mr. Russell said in a recent television appearance. "I gather his spleen has the deciding vote."
Not all comedians interpreted this anatomical conflict in a completely negative light. "If he's got a heart and a mind," Jay Leno said last week, "he's already overqualified."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Forecasting the Hungriest Soviet Winter in Years

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan drew a laugh at a recent Congressional hearing when he told of seeing potatoes and onions in the Soviet Union being stored together in the same sealed boxes, so that they would not only spoil quickly but also smell bad.
The disorganization and waste of Soviet agriculture have long appalled visiting foreigners. Worsening the problems this year are regional droughts, the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and half-hearted efforts to establish a market economy. The result, some American officials increasingly fear, is that this winter's food problems may be the worst in decades. 
 At the same time, the Soviet Union's sheer size and the West's weak economic growth and budget troubles have made a heroic international effort to feed the Soviet people unlikely. And the disorganization is likely to limit the immediate effect of programs now being drafted to teach the Soviet authorities to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.
These programs are likely to include the creation of two model distribution centers, a crop forecasting system to make information on harvest sizes available earlier, and agricultural extension services to teach better farm production and distribution techniques.
Some experts are skeptical about how much these measures will help. "The prospect of these little technical assistance programs having much impact on the crisis that looms this winter in the Soviet Union is not high," said Richard T. McCormack, who until last spring was the Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs.
Food riots by hungry Russians this winter could end the Soviet Union's new flirtation with democratic rule, he said, and result in a crackdown by an authoritarian regime denouncing hoarders and speculators.
Bush Administration officials have been less pessimistic, warning of hardships for the Soviet people but no starvation and playing down the risk of social unrest. Large quantities of food have been hoarded, they say, though it is unclear how much, or how well the food is being preserved. Mr. Madigan told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Oct. 30 that the Soviet Union should restrict access to low-price state stores to the genuinely needy. The rest of the population, he said, should be paying market prices at privately run stores that still obtain adequate supplies by doing their own purchasing and trucking. Moscow's mayor appeared to take a step in this direction last Tuesday when he ordered the rationing of basic foodstuffs and allowed higher prices for sales exceeding the quotas.
Three United States delegations led by top Agriculture Department officials have concluded that less grain than usual was produced this year and that cities and remote republics are not receiving what little there is. Distribution problems have worsened because of the new political and economic freedoms in the Soviet Union, American officials have concluded.
Unable to persuade Soviet citizens to buy bonds and Soviet republics to hand over tax receipts, the nearly bankrupt central authorities are offering state farms the equivalent of as little as $8 a ton for wheat and have stopped compelling state farms to deliver the goods. With the Soviet Union using subsidized Western loans to pay $120 a ton for imported wheat, including shipping costs, and with the value of the ruble rapidly falling, farmers have sold only half the usual amount of grain to the authorities this year.
Much of the grain left on the farms may now rot for lack of adequate protection from the elements. As part of a campaign to break the political independence of the Soviet countryside in the 1930's, Stalin eliminated most of the country's grain storage bins on farms and replaced them with grain elevators in cities.
 
Rival Republics
 Independence movements in the Soviet republics and a shortage of wholesale markets and private transportation are limiting the ability of entrepreneurs to take the government's place. The Soviet republics, for instance, are increasingly blocking the movement of grain and other commodities across their borders.
Azerbaijan has closed Armenia's oil pipeline, which provides fuel for Armenian industries, including food processing plants, and it was reported that troops were used Thursday to disperse shoppers who sacked a bakery still in operation. Russia and the Ukraine are now restricting exports of grain to other republics, requiring private traders to pay for licenses, tolls or bribes to move their stores across borders.
Danielle S. Downing, the owner of a small Moscow grain trading company, said that last month she was quoted a price of 2,500 rubles a ton for delivery of wheat within Russia. But the price was 4,000 rubles a ton for delivery in neighboring Uzbekistan, a fertile region that under Soviet central planning has specialized in cotton at the expense of food production.
The United States, Japan and Europe have made highly publicized pledges of food to the Soviet Union. But the only country making large deliveries in recent months has been the United States, which by the end of the month will have sent $2.5 billion worth of grain. France and Germany have sent smaller quantities.
But because of difficulties with the transportation and distribution of food and the eventual repayment of credits, the European Community has delivered only a ninth of the $1 billion in food assistance it pledged nearly a year ago. And Japan has not yet delivered on any of its food pledges for this fall because it is still haggling about repayment.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Must Democrats Shift Signals on Blacks to Win the Presidency?

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson confided to a young aide, Bill Moyers, that by signing the Civil Rights Bill into law he had "delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come." In a sense Johnson got it wrong; there are still more registered Democrats in the South than there are Republicans. But some political analysts now think that if L.B.J. had substituted the words "the white vote" for "the South," he would have been right on target.
The bill, the most far-reaching civil rights measure ever passed by Congress, has been credited with greatly reducing discrimination and helping to create a viable black middle class. But juxtaposed with this progress are the fortunes of the Democratic Party, which, except for the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, has been shut out of the White House since 1968. 
 These days there is a provocative line of reasoning that attempts to explain the slide: The Democratic Party is bleeding white working- and middle-class voters in Presidential elections in part because it is seen as being too concerned with the plight of the poor and of racial minorities -- mainly blacks.
 
'The Burden of Race'
 "I'm inclined to believe that the Democratic Party is permanently handicapped by its civil rights role," said Milton Morris, a vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group specializing in black issues. "That image is not going to be easy to erase. What is now happening is long-term Republican ascendancy based on the burden of race that the Democrats bear."
Analysts say that these whites who have crossed over to vote Republican, in the main, are not racists loath to see blacks move up the economic ladder. Instead, they see Democrats as asking them to pay -- either through taxes or by giving up a job or a promotion -- for programs to compensate for a history of discrimination that they had nothing to do with. Whether this is a valid perception is almost irrelevant where the party's election performances are concerned.
"It's simply a question of mathematics," said Peter Brown, author of "Minority Party," and a proponent of this political theory. "About 80 percent of the people who vote in Presidential elections are white, and since Lyndon Johnson, no Democratic Presidential candidate has gotten more than 46 percent of that vote."
Mark Mellman, a pollster who has worked with a number of Democratic candidates, agrees. "There is no question that the Democratic Party has a problem on race," he said. "Many of the philosophical principles we have espoused put us fundamentally at odds with the majority of the American people. And when your principles are at odds with the majority, you have a political problem."
Cognizant of the party's racial Achilles heel, some Democratic officials and civil rights leaders gave a palpable sigh of relief over two recent events -- the decision of the Rev. Jesse Jackson not to seek the party's Presidential nomination next year and the passage of a new civil rights bill with the blessing of the Bush Administration. With Mr. Jackson deciding not to run, the most visible symbol of the Democrats' links with blacks is on the sidelines. "It is fair to say that some Democrats have expressed anxiety about both the Jackson candidacy and what it symbolized to traditional Democrats -- white Democrats, Southerners, blue collar, working-class Democrats," said an official with a major civil rights organization who asked that neither he nor his group be identified.
 
Fear and Civil Rights
 The agreement between Congress and the White House on the civil rights bill removes at least for the near term a difficult racially tinged issue -- race-based preference programs -- from the political debate. Indicative of the concern the so-called "quota" issue was causing Democrats was a list distributed at a Congressional Black Caucus forum in September, which called 16 Senators "shaky" in their support of the civil rights bill. Thirteen were Democrats, including Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Southerners like Richard Shelby of Alabama, John Breaux of Louisiana and Wyche Fowler of Georgia. Kerry Scanlon, an attorney with the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Education Fund, told the forum that a number of Southern Democrats were "scared to death" of being forced to take a stand on the civil rights bill in an election year.
But racial politics are being stoked by others. David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, has achieved remarkable success running as a Republican in Louisiana by raising three hot-button issues with racial connotations -- crime, welfare and affirmative action. And in Mississippi, Republican Kirk Fordice scored an upset victory over the incumbent Governor Ray Mabus, using a commercial calling for "workfare, not welfare," which featured a stark photograph of a young black woman holding a baby.
 
A Two-Sided Dilemma
 Some Democratic analysts have noted with hope that the middle class is directing its anger not only against the poor, but also toward the other end of the class spectrum: the rich. The success that Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania had in last week's election in portraying Dick Thornburgh, his Republican opponent, as the defender of the status quo and the powerful, holds promise for Democrats in 1992; the success of Mr. Duke and Mr. Fordice does not.
Elaine Ciulla Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic research organization, defined the anger in a recent article: "What do the C.E.O.'s of major American corporations and members of Congress have in common with 15-year-old welfare mothers? Plenty. The vast American middle class is sick to death of all of them."
Racial politics places Democrats in an ethical and political dilemma: If the party moves to recapture those whites who have moved away, won't it alienate blacks who have been the Democrats' most loyal supporters in recent years? And Dr. Morris says that the situation presents difficulties for blacks as well. "Blacks could change the dynamic, but the only way they could do that is to leave the Democrats and go into a Republican Party which doesn't really care about them and is doing just fine without them," he said.
Some Democratic analysts think that the best bet for leading the party out of its racial thicket may be black politicians who can appeal to whites. L. Douglas Wilder, the black Governor of Virginia who is a fiscal conservative, seemed to aspire to that role. But, in searching for a solid base for a run for the party's Presidential nomination, he is more and more making a traditional appeal to black voters.
A few Democrats see the way out of the racial conundrum by fashioning programs to help people lift themselves out of poverty through work, home ownership and investments, rather than transfers of Government money.
But some Democrats are beginning to say that it is black politicians and civil rights leaders who will have to change if the party is to gain back the middle class.
"I think there are some people in the black leadership who need to wake up and realize that you can have all the litmus tests you want for candidates," said Bob Beckel, who was Walter Mondale's campaign manager in 1984, "but if they don't get you the Presidency, you're not helping your people."

HEADLINE: ROHATYN PUSHES DINKINS TO DROP FISCAL PROPOSAL

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In an unusually blunt appraisal, Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, has urged Mayor David N. Dinkins to abandon the long-term fiscal plan that the Mayor unveiled last week.
Describing the Mayor's proposal to use $1 billion in assistance corporation funds to freeze property taxes as a financial "sacrilege," Mr. Rohatyn called on Mr. Dinkins instead to enlist financial monitors and business and union leaders in a more fundamental effort to make New York City government more efficient. 
 "There comes a time when you have to say the emperor has no clothes," Mr. Rohatyn said in an interview on Friday, referring to the fiscal plan.
Mr. Rohatyn's remarks raise the stakes in the city's effort to fashion a satisfactory plan to meet the series of budget gaps looming over the next few years. The assistance corporation money could substitute at least in part for unpopular tax increases or service cuts.
By threatening to withhold that money, Mr. Rohatyn appears to be trying to prod Mr. Dinkins and the municipal unions into serious bargaining for labor concessions and restructuring of city government.
 
To Cut 16,000 Jobs
 Through his spokesman, Leland T. Jones, the Mayor said yesterday, "The plan meets a number of the objectives we had thought were shared by Mr. Rohatyn."
In the plan, submitted to the State Financial Control Board, Mr. Dinkins proposed to balance budgets in the four fiscal years beginning next July through a program of attrition that would eliminate 16,000 jobs and that would pay for wage increases over the next two years only through productivity agreements. The funds from the assistance corporation, an independent agency that borrows money on the city's behalf, would be used to avoid a $500 million property-tax increase that the Mayor had previously discussed.
But Mr. Rohatyn said the money should not be used as a substitute for new taxes or cuts. If the Mayor thinks the city cannot absorb more of either, he said, then he should ask the Legislature for the power to close budget gaps by borrowing -- a power that would trigger the return of state overseers that Mr. Dinkins has pledged to avoid at all costs.
"That's not something I support, nor does the Governor," Mr. Rohatyn said. "It's a theoretical alternative, not necessary at this point, but which has to be considered if the city can't make the cuts or raise the taxes."
But Mr. Rohatyn described himself as deeply frustrated at what he views as the Dinkins administration's indifference to fiscal realities.
"My mood is not anger, not despair," Mr. Rohatyn said. "It is sheer and total frustration. It is the frustration at watching a city degrade itself when it doesn't have to. People have given up hope partly because the administration doesn't give them any hope. The failure of this administration is its failure to give the city a sense of direction. The administration views itself as a victim instead of as leader of the city, and if there're any victims they are the people of the city."
 
'Everything for Nothing'
 The investment banker said he was speaking out reluctantly -- aware that he could be cast as the villain who refused to bail the city out -- in the hope of elevating the debate from a personal confrontation between himself and the Mayor and to enlist other partners, such as the State Financial Control Board, which he implied has been too reticent.
"The city administration has to recognize that this is not a personal thing, that institutionally we cannot do what the city wants, which is everything for nothing," Mr. Rohatyn said. "I couldn't do it if I wanted to. My board wouldn't do it. The rating agencies wouldn't let us do it. How does M.A.C. put its credit and legal liability on the line by selling a billion dollars in bonds to the public if we have to include in our offering a city plan in which we have no faith?"
Mr. Rohatyn's remarks were striking, even beyond their vehemence, because when the Mayor released the financial plan last Wednesday his administration left the impression that Mr. Rohatyn would acquiesce in, if not actually embrace, the proposals.
 
A Matter of Givens
 "While the city needs to accommodate M.A.C.'s fiduciary responsibilities as best it can, at the end of the day this is still the city's money, and M.A.C. needs to accommodate the fiscal needs of the city," First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said. "I thought in terms of programmatic and policy thrusts we had moved a long way toward the kinds of things Felix was talking about."
Mr. Rohatyn agreed that the direction was right but said that the Mayor had not gone far enough. He recalled that as recently as last week he had delivered a speech about what the corporation could and could not do without jeopardizing its own credibilty: "That the city can't raise taxes, that it has to cut the work force. Those weren't conditions; they were givens."
"It's a bad plan regardless of M.A.C.," Mr. Rohatyn said. "But the city has lobbied all sorts of organizations as part of a political effort to create the impression that the only thing standing between the city and prosperity is M.A.C. With a $120 billion budget over the next four years, the billion dollars from M.A.C. is a very small tail wagging a very big dog."
One measure of the strained relationship between the administration and the corporation was City Hall's suggestion that the timing of Mr. Rohatyn's remarks may represent a calculated strategy to create the crisis atmosphere that he had said all along was necessary to resolve the long-term budget impasse. Why, Mr. Steisel asked Mr. Rohatyn in a telephone conversation on Friday, had he not warned the Mayor of his reservations in advance and told Mr. Dinkins that "your guys are about to let you walk off a cliff?"
 
Replacing Mayoral Appointees
 To which Mr. Rohatyn replied that he had not been briefed until Tuesday, when the plan was already being printed. Also, he said, Mr. Dinkins had consulted him personally only once while the plan was being drafted -- to inform Mr. Rohatyn that Mr. Dinkins intends to replace the four mayoral appointees on the nine-member M.A.C. board who had been named by his predecessor.
"It was a message," Mr. Rohatyn concluded.
When Mr. Dinkins telephoned Mr. Rohatyn on Thursday to express disappointment over his initial response to the plan, Mr. Rohatyn recalled: "I said to the Mayor that I was astounded that there was any surprise. I couldn't conceive anyone not knowing this would be our reaction. If they didn't know, they shouldn't be there. He suggested breakfast. I said this was more than a two-hour breakfast discussion."
Instead, Mr. Rohatyn plans to confer with Mr. Steisel, Budget Director Philip R. Michael and, perhaps, officials of the Financial Control Board next week to present his objections in detail.
The Municipal Assistance Corporation was created during the city's 1975 fiscal crisis to borrow on behalf of New York City while it was shut out of the credit market and dug itself from under a mountain of debt that had been accumulating for years. Its bonds are backed by city sales-tax revenues. Mr. Rohatyn, senior partner in Lazard Freres & Company, was the architect of the corporation, and its only chairman.
Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board, concurred in some of Mr. Rohatyn's criticisms, saying the plan was so unspecific that it seemed more like a first draft. "This plan, in many ways, was far more impressionistic than any other plan has been," Mr. Proctor said.
 
Looking for Latitude
 Last week, Mr. Michael, the Budget Director, hailed the plan as "revolutionary," even though, he acknowledged, some of its components represented only first steps toward reform and others, such as inviting private contractors to maintain the city's fleet of vehicles or to collect recyclable garbage, were significant but "not sexy."
Mr. Steisel also said that while a billion dollars over two years might not seem like much nowadays, it would widen Mr. Dinkins's latitude to affect spending at the margins of a nearly $30 billion budget.
Mr. Rohatyn, who said he was sensitive to the perception that any outside intrusion could be viewed as undermining the city's first black mayor, volunteered no specific budget buts, except to cite proposals to replace more deskbound police officers with civilians and to demand a full day's work from trash collectors who are idle when they finish their routes.
Mr. Rohatyn recalled that he had voted for Mr. Dinkins for mayor in the Democratic primary and general election in 1989 but said it was too soon to say whether he would do so in 1993.
"It is both unnecessary and unfair for me to answer that question," he said. "He has two more years and the jury is still out. I would like to be able to vote for him again."
 
 
THE MAJOR PLAYERS

 
Who controls the city's finances
 
MAYOR DAVID N. DINKINS
 
He ran with a liberal agenda, but as the Mayor during a recession he has been reduced to allocating losses among his friends. In yet another effort to demonstrate his fiscal conservatism, Mr. Dinkins proposed this week to freeze property taxes for two years, but the business community and budget watchdogs were still wary about a plan that they maintained lacked specifics.
 
 
GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO
 
Struggling with his own deficit of nearly $700 million, the Governor persuaded Mr. Dinkins not to press for quicker relief from Medicaid costs than the pace Mr. Cuomo proposed last month. But City Hall has been less responsive to gentle prodding from Albany to follow the state's example of bold budget-cutting -- a recalcitrance that may figure in the Governor's Presidential plans as he mulls whether the unresolved state and city budget crises require him to remain in New York.
 
 
FELIX G. ROHATYN
 
The chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created in 1975 to borrow on the city's behalf, has been placed in a bind: How long can he hold the city's feet to the fire by withholding the $1 billion he could deliver by refinancing the M.A.C.'s debt without getting burned politically himself?
 
 
PETER F. VALLONE
 
The Mayor's plan was the product of unusual cooperation with the City Council Speaker -- a tribute to Mr. Vallone's emerging influence and to Mr. Dinkins's recognition, even before Tuesday's election, that voters are fed up with more taxes for fewer services and that the business community is desparate for some predictability. The plan tentatively embraces some other Council recommendations and eschews a proposal anathema to Mr. Vallone and his colleagues from Brooklyn and Queens: tolls on the free East River bridges.
 
 
THE UNIONS
 
If Mr. Dinkins's metaphor for the city applies to its budget, the four-year financial mosaic is still missing a giant piece that may well not take shape until after Mr. Rohatyn's refinancing deadline. The plan doesn't rule out raises, but requires that they be paid for by productivity. The city and its police union are in arbitration, but talks with other unions have stalled as looming deficits and the proposed property tax freeze place more pressure on labor.
 
 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
 
In the coming weeks, the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, must review the Mayor's plan. Mr. Rohatyn has made the board's approval of the plan one requirement for making the $1 billion available. In January, Mr. Dinkins will submit his preliminary budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. That plan will then be reviewed by the Wall Street credit rating agencies. In April, the Mayor will present his final budget plan. After negotiations, a budget must be approved by the City Council. -- SAM ROBERTS

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ACTIVITY BY NORTH KOREANS WORRIES THE U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The rapid expansion of a mysterious nuclear complex in North Korea is heightening concern in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that the unpredictable regime of President Kim Il Sung may be closer to producing a crude nuclear weapon than anyone thought just a year ago.
The concerns are being driven by North Korea's continued refusal to allow international inspection of the site at Yongbyon, a nuclear complex 60 miles north of Pyongyang that dates back at least two decades. 
 But a steady trickle of new intelligence information emerging from North Korea, one of the world's most closed Communist countries, suggests that a host of new installations at the site are nearly complete, including a suspected reprocessing plant that could produce hundreds of pounds of weapons-grade plutonium. And there are hints that other nuclear complexes are being built elsewhere in the country, perhaps underground.
 
Fear of U.S. Misjudgment
 While there are conflicting interpretations of the evidence, some of which has recently been made public, each new morsel seems to deepen the enigma of Yongbyon, and to stir nervousness among America's allies in Asia that Washington may again be misjudging critical warning signals, much as it did with President Saddam Hussein's bomb project in Iraq.
"The Iraqi experience scared us all, and we know much less about North Korea," said a senior Japanese official who has directed Tokyo's efforts to gather intelligence about North Korea's nuclear capabilities. "And it is far more serious to Japan than to the U.S. You have nuclear weapons; we don't."
Interviews with nuclear experts and government officials in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington in recent weeks -- along with new commercially available satellite photographs and sketchy information from recent defectors -- indicate that North Korea has already acquired an impressive degree of nuclear expertise.
 
British Reactor Replicated
 Though largely cut off from the Western technology and training that brought wealth to many of its neighbors, Mr. Kim's Government has successfully replicated a British reactor used to produce fuel for weapons, obtained some materials from Germany and received tutoring in nuclear physics from the Soviets that continued at least through this summer.
Very quickly, oratory surrounding the plant is growing more belligerent. A white paper issued by the South Korean Defense Ministry 10 days ago said that the project "must be stopped at any cost."
On Friday, South Korea's President, Roh Tae Woo, pledged for the first time that his nation would not "manufacture, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons," a statement that seemed to confirm that all American nuclear weapons now stored there would be removed. But Mr. Roh also said, "Nuclear weapons in North Korean hands would be so dangerous and destablilizing that they would not only threaten the very survival of our nation, but could in an instant shatter the peace in Northeast Asia and the world."
American officials say it is premature to consider military options, and calming Seoul's powerful military establishment is expected to be one of the main tasks facing Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d when he visits Seoul next week, to be followed by the Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney.
For more than a year, the official line from American and South Korean officials has been that North Korea will have the materials needed to produce several bombs -- but not necessarily the technology to trigger them -- within three to five years. That estimate, however, appears to be based largely on the evidence provided by satellite photographs, combined with assumptions about the depth of North Korea's technical skills and its access to key components. In the case of Iraq, which has a much larger corps of trained nuclear experts, many of the same assumptions turned out to be wrong.
"I think that the detection methods we have really have their limitations," said James R. Lilley, who served as Ambassador to South Korea in the late 1980's and continued to monitor the project as Ambassador to China, a post he left this year. "As far as I know, you don't have the wealth of defectors in Korea that there were in Iraq to lay it all open."
"No one can afford to assume a country like North Korea is bluffing," said Mr. Lilley, who is expected to take up the post of assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. "You end up with a lot of people dead in the sea that way."
Nevertheless, while many of the critical details needed to assess the North Korean nuclear program are still muddled, American experts doubt that the country has the financial resources or the depth of engineering talent that Baghdad has dedicated to its nuclear effort. Iraq has been a far more open society than North Korea, with connections throughout the Western world.
But there are few doubts that North Korea will be able to produce a simple nuclear weapon, and perhaps mount it atop a Scud missile. North Korea reportedly has already exported 90 to 100 Scuds to Iran and 20 improved versions to Syria.
Worrisome as North Korea's nuclear potential is, Japanese, South Korean and American analysts say they are even more worried by the Kim Government's unpredictability. It mounted an assassination attempt against the South Korean Cabinet in Rangoon in 1983 that killed 17 people, including 4 Cabinet members. And it was believed to be behind the explosion of a Korean Airlines jet in 1987 that killed 115.
 
Old Allies Provide Aid No Longer
 The Government's erratic behavior, many fear, may worsen now that the country is now being abandoned by its traditional allies.
On the other hand, the recent flood of disclosures, especially those from South Korea, raise the possibility that the North's capabilites are being exaggerated. Seoul has been nervous about negotiations between North Korea and Japan over the normalization of relations, and recognizes the propaganda value of portraying Mr. Kim's Government as the next Iraq.
No one knows how the North would use the bomb politically. But presumably the country's military leadership views the weapons -- and any agreement to allow international inspection -- as one of its few viable bargaining chips. It could trade inspections for economic aid from Japan or, over the long term, use it to bolster its position in future talks with the South over unifying the Korean Peninsula.
The coming visits of Mr. Baker and Mr. Cheney have been preceded by political maneuvering on both sides of the border. North Korea hinted over the summer that it would finally accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency -- a requirement under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which North Korea signed in 1985. But in September it backed away from the inspections, saying the United States first had to remove its nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
Now that demand appears about to be fulfilled. In September President Bush said he would order the removal of all American tactical ground and ship-based nuclear weapons from Europe and Asia. And although there has been no formal announcement, officials say a private agreement has been reached with South Korea to remove air-launched weapons as well.
Playing for more time, Mr. Kim's Government recently added a new condition, announcing that the United States must also remove South Korea from the American nuclear umbrella. Then on Friday President Roh made his non-nuclear pledge.
 
Nuclear Ambitions Go Back to 1950's
 It is unlikely that the announcements from Seoul or Washington will dissuade Mr. Kim. North Korea's nuclear ambitions stretch back to the Korean War, when there was open discussion of using American nuclear weapons to end the conflict. The North's anxieties were heightened in the mid-1970's, when it was an open secret that the United States was basing at least 600 nuclear weapons on South Korean soil.
In the late 1960's, having already acquired a miniature reactor from the Soviet Union, the North decided on a a design for a 1950's-era British reactor called "Calder Hall," still operated by the British Nuclear Fuels Company, according to published accounts in the nuclear trade press and one intelligence official.
There are disagreements about whether enough details of the reactor's design were available in public documents to give North Korean scientists the outlines of what they needed, or whether classified details leaked. But the reactor uses graphite to modify, or control, the nuclear reaction -- and graphite is something the Koreans could produce at home. That would eliminate the need to import heavy water, or deuterium oxide, a highly controlled substance.
Construction began in 1980, and it took about seven years to complete the 20- to 30-megawatt reactor, about a mile downriver from the Soviet research installation. North Korean officials insist the reactor for peaceful research. Others have their doubts.
"When you look at the pictures, you see the reactor, but no electric lines, no transformers," said Toshibumi Sakata, a professor at Tokai University here whose laboratory has used computers to enhance French and American commercial photographs of the area, providing the clearest unclassified images of the sprawling facility.
There is even what appears to be a huge guest house, presumably for Mr. Kim or other dignitaries.
According to some South Korean estimates, by next year the reactor will have produced up to 20 kilograms of plutonium -- plenty for several bombs, if processed and incorporated into a weapon.
Two years ago American intelligence satellites picked up images of an even larger nuclear plant, estimated at 50 to 200 megawatts, which is expected to begin operation in early 1992.
Alarming Signs
Of Reprocessing Plant
More alarming are indications of another nearby building that is widely believed to be a reprocessing installation, which experts say should be operational by 1993 or early 1994. That would permit North Korea to extract weapons-grade plutonium from the spent nuclear fuels generated by the reactors. From all indications, the new installations at Yongbyon are being constructed with no direct help from China or the Soviet Union, both of which have joined the effort to convince North Korea to open itself to inspection. In fact, the Soviets appear to have cut off the supply of new nuclear equipment.
Nonetheless, the Soviet Union's longtime training of North Korean scientists appears to continue. A Japanese television crew that visited a Soviet nuclear research installation this year at Dubna, north of Moscow, took pictures of Korean children playing outside the residences and Korean-language signs in the institute. "They have been here for the last 35 years," a Soviet official says of the North Koreans in the television report.
There is also some evidence that North Korea, like Iraq, has cast a wide net in the West for needed materials. Last year the United States fined Degussa A.G. of Frankfurt, Germany, $80,000 for re-exporting to Pyongyang a shipment of American zirconium, which can be used to make uranium fuel rods.
Another German company, Leis Engineering G.m.b.H., was named in the German press a week ago as under investigation for shipping a specialized steel alloy to North Korea that could be used as a container for radioactive materials. The company denied the report.
The North has also nurtured relations with other non-nuclear countries interested in developing their own weaons. For instance, it is reported to have sold advanced Scud missiles to some Arab countries, perhaps in exchange for some nuclear expertise. "There are suspicions that Iran, Romania, and possibly the former East Germany contributed," Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. said last month in Jane's Intelligence Review.
Another likely source of technology is Japan, which has a large population of ethnic Koreans sympathetic to Mr. Kim's Government.
The biggest unknown is whether Yongbyon serves as the country's only nuclear complex, or whether it is the only one built within easy view of reconaissance satellites as a diversion.
A North Korean diplomat who recently defected to Seoul, Ko Yong Hwan, insists that there is at least one other major nuclear site, almost entirely underground, not far from Yongbyon. Intelligence officials say they harbor similar suspicions, but they are not sure that Mr. Ko, who spent the last several years in Africa, was in a position to know many details of the North's capabilities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Goes Along With Sanctions On Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Hoping to pressure Yugoslavia's republics to stop their civil war, President Bush said today that the United States would join in the European Community's economic sanctions against that strife-torn nation and in the call for the United Nations to impose an oil embargo.
"We will apply sanctions on Yugoslavia comparable to those of the European Community," Mr. Bush said at a news conference after four hours of talks here with the community's top two officials. "The E.C. can also depend on the United States to co-sponsor a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Yugoslavia looking toward a possible oil embargo and cooperate fully in efforts to strengthen an embargo on arms exports to Yugoslavia." 
 At a meeting in Rome on Friday, the community decided to withdraw trade preferences, end a trade agreement and economic aid, and urge the United Nations to impose an oil embargo.
Before ending a three-day European trip that was criticized at home as an attempt to escape domestic political problems, Mr. Bush said that he and the top community officials had narrowed their differences in a long-standing dispute over reducing subsidies in agricultural trade, but had achieved no breakthrough that could lead to a resumption of global trade talks under the General Agreemant on Tariffs and Trade.
Washington has called for slashing the industrial world's subsidies for farmers, but the community, not wanting to hurt its heavily subsidized farmers, has resisted such cuts. With pressures growing at home about the stalled domestic economy, President Bush took pains today to emphasize that a trade accord could help American farmers by increasing markets for their exports.
He and the European leaders vowed today to push forward with the aim of ending the 108-nation trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, in a few months.
"For the first time, I am reasonably optimistic about the possibility of reaching an agreement," said Jacques Delors, president of the community's Executive Commission, adding that a trade accord would be "a very important signal" to spur trade and the world economy. But neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Delors nor Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, which holds the community's rotating presidency, described the progress that had been made.
The United States has for several months held back on applying heavy pressure to end the Yugoslav fighting, but at the urging of the European Community, it has stepped up its efforts. The community places most of the blame for the fighting on Serbia and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, which have fought to capture parts of Croatia since that republic declared independence.
 
Makeup of Yugoslav Trade
 Sixty percent of Yugoslavia's trade is with the community, while only about 5 percent is with the United States. American officials here said the Administration would probably move to deny Yugoslavia the preferential tariffs that come with most-favored-nation status, and would withhold a $5 million grant that was being made to assist Yugoslavia's transition to democracy and a market economy.
United States exports to Yugoslavia have been stagnant in recent years, totaling only $566 million last year. But Yugoslavia's exports to the United States have been growing steadily, to $773 million last year from $478 million in 1984.
Most of Yugoslavia's oil is obtained from the Soviet Union and Libya, and Moscow is said to be ready to support an embargo. Libya's position is unclear.
 
Effect of Sanctions
 A day after berating many Democrats for wanting to rely on sanctions rather than fight to oust Iraq from Kuwait, Mr. Bush said he could not say whether sanctions would succeed in ending the Yugoslav war. "I don't think anybody can predict with any accuracy that sanctions alone will solve the problems -- in Yugoslavia, in Haiti, or in Iraq, or in other places," he said. But he added that the community and the United States thought sanctions would make their position clearer to those parties in Yugoslavia refusing a cease-fire.
Asked by a journalist whether he would support a United Nations peacekeeping force to intervene in Yugoslavia, the President said, "You're too far ahead of the power curve. We're not talking about force, we're talking about economic sanctions."
In a luncheon speech in the resplendent Hall of Knights in the Dutch Parliament building, Mr. Bush made his strongest statement ever about the corrosive effect that ethnic tensions in Eastern Europe have had since the Berlin Wall came down.
"We see in Yugoslavia how the proud name of nationalism can splinter a country into bloody civil war," he said.
He said there was nothing to fear in healthy national pride, but added, "We must guard against nationalism of a more sinister sort: one that feeds on old, stale prejudcies, teaches people intolerance and suspicion, and even racism and anti-Semitism."
He said Western Europe is a model for how national frictions can be buried. "Western Europe stands as proof that in the space of little more than one generation, the spirit of democracy can transcend centuries of rivalry, war, nationalistic strife."
As part of the efforts to break the deadlock on farm trade, the President's trade representative, Carla Hills, and Secretary of Agriculture Edward R. Madigan, met with community officials here on Friday. The talks collapsed last December primarily over an American-community clash over how deeply to cut farm subsidies.
The United States has called for reducing subsidies for farm goods by 75 percent over 10 years and a 90 percent cut for export subsidies. But the community backs a 30 percent cut over 10 years starting with 1986, when the community made some cuts in subsidies.
In recent days, several European officials suggested that there was a broad outline for an agreement in which farm subsidies would be cut by 30 percent over five years.

HEADLINE: Duke: The Ex-Nazi Who Would Be Governor

SERIES: Louisiana Showdown: Duke vs. Edwards/First of two articles

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The chant builds like a freight train and bounces off the walls in auditoriums and American Legion halls from Monroe to Metairie: "Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke."
It has become a familiar scene in Louisiana. David Duke -- an open white supremacist and anti-Semite for most of his adult life, who sold Nazi literature from his legislative office in 1989 -- stands a chance of being elected governor next Saturday. 
 Racing from Larry King to Phil Donahue, from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, Mr. Duke, now running as a mainstream conservative Republican, is basking in this moment, and the last thing he wants to do is ruin it by dwelling on the past.
"It's the same old stuff," he says with irritation as he wolfs down his chicken chow mein at the Ming Palace restaurant near his campaign headquarters. "People are sick of all that. They've heard it for two years."
 
Conceding the Link
 But in a campaign that has aroused searing racial and cultural emotions, Mr. Duke concedes a fundamental unity between his campaign now and his life spent at the dark fringes of the religious and racial right.
To hear Mr. Duke, the unity is cultural and benign, a love for Western Christian civilization that took him on a dark detour to Ku Klux Klan and Nazi activities he now disavows. "The common strain is my love for Western civilization," he said. "That's what I've always been about."
But watching a thickening stew of economic, political and racial unease, many see something far more ominous in his rise to mainstream politics.
David Duke was a voracious reader of white supremacist literature from the age of 14. An avowed Nazi in college, he is as steeped as any academic in the intricacies of eugenics and theories of racial differences.
Critics say his campaign is about developing a new vocabulary for old obsessions, a language in which images of Christian unity and "the rising welfare underclass" convey old messages in new code. Some say the fact that he is in a neck-and-neck race for Louisiana Governor means he has already won the race that matters to him.
"By the time this race is over, regardless of who wins, Duke will become the uncontested leader of the racial right in America," said Lance Hill, executive director of the Louisian Coalition Against Racism and Nazism. "Not only that, but there will be a racial right in America. He is both ascending to that position while creating it. Prior to that, there was Reagan and Bush. There was nothing to the right of that. There will be now."
"People ask who's the campaign manager," said Mr. Duke's top aide, Jim McPherson, a New Orleans lawyer. "There is no campaign manager. David Duke is the campaign manger."
Mr. Duke is in a runoff with former Gov. Edwin Edwards because of an unerring instinct for the pressure points in the American psyche that he has shown since his election to the State House of Representatives two years ago.
His first two issues were welfare abuse and the anti-tax mood of the 1980's. He made opposition to affirmative action a centerpiece of his 1990 race for the United States Senate.
Now, his message is a blend of dark and light, stories of welfare mothers and their unwanted babies contrasted with allusions to a morality based on his newly professed, born-again Christianity. His bottom-line image -- that of a nation decaying from within -- strikes a resonant chord, particularly in a state that has been reeling economically for almost a decade.
Tall, trim and blond at 41, his features enhanced by cosmetic surgery and an air of softspoken humility, Mr. Duke finished a televised debate Wednesday with a message aimed straight at middle-class fears.
"I appreciate the honorable people who have not been intimidated, who know that the time has come in this country to stand up for us, to stand up for our heritage and our way of life," he said. "Our Christian values are under attack. In some places in this country, we can't even sing Christmas carols anymore. We're losing the values the nation was built upon."
The message, combined with his incessant racially tinged attacks on welfare recipients, has made Mr. Duke the clear favorite of white Louisianans. Most political analysts believe that Mr. Edwards needs to get only about a third of white voters to win.
A recent poll showed Mr. Edwards with a lead over Mr. Duke of 55 percent to 33 percent, with 11 percent undecided. The poll, by the Marketing Research Institute of Jackson, Miss., for the magazine Louisiana Business 2000, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Poll takers caution that surveys in past elections underestimated actual support for Mr. Duke.
 
The Man Is the Issue
 Admirers say Mr. Duke generates strong feelings less for his past than for his courage in speaking honestly about taboo topics. "I think there's a self-generated, vitriolic attack on him to engage in character assassination and dwell upon his past as a basis for rejecting what he is today," said Minos Simon, a lawyer in Lafayette and Duke supporter. "I think he's just saying something that the majority of the American people, let alone the people of Louisiana, feel."
Others see a very different David Duke.
Beth Rickey, a New Orleans Republican, talked with him for 40 to 50 hours on the phone and in person during 1989 as he tried to win her over to his views. She said his conversation was a diatribe on the primacy of race in culture, what he called "the Jewish question," and race mixing. In one conversation, she said he rattled on for so long that she dozed off -- only to awake to hear him still talking.
"He's a racial ideologue of a type that I have yet to encounter in my entire lifetime," she said. "He is not a George Wallace. He is beyond that. He is truly a type that one would find in the 1930's in Germany. He sees himself at this Messiah, that he's going to save the white race."
Mr. Duke said he was misinterpreted. "She came with preconceived ideas," he said. "She's a very strong liberal, and I'm not."
 
Words of Contrition Do Not Quiet Fears
 Whatever, the case, there is a palpable sense of fear in Louisiana as the campaign nears its finale. This week, a black television reporter, Norman Robinson, enunciated that mood during a televised debate.
"I am scared, sir," he said to Mr. Duke. "I've heard you say that Jews deserve to be in the ash bin of history. I've heard you say that horses contributed more to the building of America than blacks did. . . .Convince me, sir, and other minorities like me, why they should entrust their lives and the lives of their children to you."
Mr. Duke replied, as he usually does when challenged about past statements, with a combination of contrition and accusation: "Mr. Robinson, I don't think there's a human being on this earth or in this state who hasn't been at some time intolerant in their life. And I think that's true of white people. I think that's true of black people."
He admitted his own past intolerance, asked whether Mr. Robinson had ever been intolerant himself and went on: "I don't think you'd ask that question to him, but Jesse Jackson admitted spitting in white people's food when he worked in a restaurant as a young man." Mr. Jackson said in a 1987 interview with The Los Angeles Times that he had bragged -- falsely -- in 1969 about doing that.
The newspaper ad on the wall of David Duke's campaign headquarters in suburban Metairie quotes from Proverbs. "When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice," it says. "But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn."
"Rejoice with David Duke," it continues. "Mourn with Edwin Edwards."
The overt Christianity is new. But from his early teens, Mr. Duke has seen the world as a Manichaean struggle between good and evil, pure and impure.
 
An Unsettled Childhood, Then His Life Changes
 David Ernest Duke was born July 1, 1950, in Tulsa, Okla., the second of two children. The family later moved to New Orleans.
According to his biographer, Michael Zatarain, and interviews with neighbors, Mr. Duke's mother, Maxine Crick Duke, was an alchoholic who spent much of her time fearful and disoriented. His father, David Hedger Duke, a petroleum engineer, traveled extensively, including trips to Southeast Asia, where he was an engineer for the United States Agency for International Development.
According to Mr. Zatarain's biography, "David Duke: Evolution of a Klansman" (Pelican, 1990), Mr. Duke's life changed at 14, when he was asked to give an argument against integration in a term paper.
His research took him to the office of the New Orleans Citizens Council, one of dozens of such groups that sprang up throughout the South to oppose integration. He first read a book called "Race and Reason -- A Yankee View," by Carlton Putnam, which argued that history, psychology, culture and biology insured that integration would fail. After reading other books, he developed a passion for the idea that race and genetics is the dominant feature in human society.
Soon, the Citizens Council ofice became his home away from home. By high school, his interests had spread to Nazism and the Ku Klux Klan. A neighbor recalls a Nazi flag on the wall of his room. Before long, he came under the wing of Jim Lindsay, a Klan leader and rabid anti-Semite, who became Mr. Duke's mentor while his father was away.
In 1968, when he moved on to Louisiana State University, he became a fixture at L.S.U.'s Free Speech Alley castigating Jews and blacks. He called himself a Nazi and became a devotee of the Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell. Dressed in a Nazi uniform, he carried a sign reading "Kunstler is a Communist Jew" when William Kunstler, a lawyer often identified with liberal causes, spoke at Tulane University.
"He would talk about 'Mein Kampf,' " said William Connelly, then state chairman of Young Americans for Freedom. "He would describe how he was going to become mainstream and get elected to the Legislature. He thought Adolf Hitler's ideas were right."
After college, he switched his focus from the Nazis to James Lindsay's Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, becoming its leader or Grand Wizard in 1975 and building a reputation as a shrewd marketer for racist ideology.
Danny Welch, director of the Klanwatch project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, says Mr. Duke's performance at that time presaged his later career.
"If I had to choose anyone from the white supremacy movement to get in a position of power, it would be David Duke," he said. "He used tactics that had never been used before -- throw away the robe, put on a three-piece suit, cut your hair, and get yourself on TV."
He did something else new. He ran for office, getting 33 percent of the vote in his race for the state Senate in 1975, the first of his seven political campaigns.
 
Trying for a New Start After the Klan Days
 Mr. Duke left the Klan in 1979. Depending on who tells it, he left either because of a rift in which he was accused of trying to sell the Klan mailing list for $35,000 or because of a belief that the Klan's image carried too much negative baggage.
He spent virtually all of the 1980's consorting with those at racist fringes of society and trying to jump-start his career.
Mr. Duke had often been involved in odd ventures. In the 1970's, he wrote two books under pseduonyms. Under the pseudonym "Mohammed X," he wrote, "African Atto" a martial arts manual for black militants. He later said it was a way to develop a mailing list to keep track of potential black agitators. Under the pseudonym "Dorothy Vanderbilt," he wrote "Finderskeepers," a dating-and-sex manual for women.
In the 1980's, he was implicated in, but never indicted for, an abortive plot to set up a white supremacist regime on the island of Dominica. He went through Est, the confrontational personal development group, and used what he learned in marathon "white leadership" training sessions. He got a divorce and cosmetic surgery, and attended a conference of organizations devoted to debunking the Holocaust.
He twice ran for President, first as a Democrat with a former Nazi as a campaign manager, then as the candidate of the Populist Party, an amalgam of extremists including Neo-Nazis and Klansmen.
In 1980, he founded the National Association for the Advancement of White People, which advertises Nazi and racist books.
In 1989, his electoral efforts finally bore fruit. By a 227-vote margin, his virtually all-white district in Metairie sent him to the Louisiana Legislature as a Representative.
 
Riding a High Tide Of Voters' Resentment
 Now, he is within reach of his biggest breakthrough yet.
Virtually all of those rallying to Mr. Duke's campaign say they are attracted by rock-solid conservative issues.
"I'm not a racist; it's plain stupid to hate a whole race," said Bill Lee, a 64-year-old inventor outside Mr. Duke's headquarters. "If Duke's able to cut taxes, he'll do more for business than Edwin Edwards ever could."
Some, even some on the radical right like the white supremacist Tom Metzger, agree. They say Mr. Duke has moved toward the mainstream.
"That's what sort of amuses me, the people who are attacking him who don't think he's changed," Mr. Metzger said. "I think David Duke will make a great politician, because politicians make themselves acceptable to a majority of people."
Mr. Duke's campaign spokesman, Howie Farrell, goes further, saying Mr. Duke's born-again Christianity makes his personal history irrelevant. "I don't think once you become a professed, born-again Christian that anything prior to that matters," he said.
But those who have followed Mr. Duke say it is hard to see, aside from his vague apologies on the campaign trail and on national talk shows, where the old Mr. Duke ended and the new one started.
In taped 1985 interviews with a doctoral candidate named Evelyn Rich, he advocatd an American apartheid, denied the existence of the Holocaust, and said: "People always say it's the same old Klan package. Well, it's true from the standoint of myself. My ideology has not fundamentally changed."
In 1989, he was still selling Nazi books from his legislative office. In his long conversations with Ms. Rickey, he voiced his traditional anti-Semitic and white supremacist agenda. In a 1989 taped interview with Abby Kaplan, a student, he said: "There's only one country anymore that's all white, and that's Iceland. And Iceland is not enough.
One who has watched Mr. Duke carefully is Sam Jones, the mayor of the small town of Franklin, one of several minor candidates without enough contributions to become a serious threat in the gubernatorial primary.
After eight months of appearing at the same campaign functions as Mr. Duke, Mr. Jones says the mainstream image is a hoax. "His greatest fear is for people to find out what he really is thinking and to have a full debate on his Nazi beliefs," he said. "The mistake the press makes around here is to call him a neo-Nazi. He's not neo-anything."
He saw no signs of a tendency toward violence in Mr. Duke, but he cannot say the same for some of his followers or the movement he is building.
"I had one of them after one of the forums come up to me and say, 'How would you feel about a constitutional amendment to exterminate Jews?' " he said.
 
A Message Is Heard Far Beyond the Bayous
 Played out on the often outlandish tapestry of Louisiana politics, the story of Mr. Duke is sometimes viewed largely as a product of the state's distinctive bayou fevers.
But Mr. Jones said Louisiana's sour economy more than anything else has created an environment in which Mr. Duke has won acceptance, and that the message should not be lost on the rest of the country.
"We've been in a 10-year depression here, and now it's going to get worse," he said. "Everyone is on the edge, and they're just angry. If he didn't have the baggage he had, he could have blown this race wide open, and even with the baggage, he could conceivably be elected Governor."
Win or lose, Mr. Duke has a national visibility he could not have imagined as a fringe figure just two years ago. When asked what the race has been for him, he answers with cool reserve: "One small step."

DAIVD DUKE, IN HIS OWN WORDS

On Whites
 "There's only one country anymore that's all white, and that's Iceland. And Iceland is not enough." -- Interview with Abby Kaplan, a Tulane University student, Nov. 29, 1989
 
On Jews
 "Well, the Jews have developed a disease and given it to us already. It's called race mixing, and they're being quite successful." -- Interview with Evelyn Rich, doctoral student, Feb. 17, 1986.
 
On Blacks
 "We don't have a program to send them back to Africa. I think that's impractical. We do feel an ideal, perhaps an impossible ideal, would be geographic separation of the races, either within this country or on an extra-continental basis." -- Interview with The Baton Rouge State-Times, 1985
 
 "I tend to believe now that it (the Holocaust), didn't happen, O.K.?" -- Interview with Evelyn Rich, March 1985.

HEADLINE: Suburban Belfast: Is It a World Apart?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland

 BODY:
The road to Bangor curls northeast from the city's center, skirting the shipyards and the bleak neighborhoods beyond the River Lagan before it opens onto the green, suburban landscape of outer Belfast.
Here are the well-tended towns of Knocknagoney and Holywood and rural County Down, where "the troubles," the euphemism used to describe three decades of sectarian strife, are more often cursed because the odd bombing has tied up traffic along the Bangor road. 
 In the poor Catholic districts along the Falls Roads or the working class Protestant quarters of the Shankhill, people refer to the city's more affluent fringe as "cloud cuckoo-land," places less than a half hour's commute from the impoverished and barbed-wire parts of Belfast, but seemingly as foreign and inaccessible as the far side of the moon.
These green quarters and suburban enclaves are the other face of Belfast, and a measure of some of the forces subtly altering the landscape of Northern Ireland, where income increasingly has become as much a factor as religion in defining the great divide.
 
Ignoring the 'Troubles'
 "The troubles are as far away for some people who live in Northern Ireland as they are for people living in the U.S., and that includes a lot of middle-class Catholics," said the Rev. Eamon O'Brien, a Catholic priest whose parish of 800 poor and mostly unemployed is in the middle of a Protestant neighborhood in East Belfast.
Some of them, he said, have become calloused by a kind of cynical determination: since they can't do anything about the troubles, they might as well move away and ignore them. "There is an indifference among such people that is as deadly as opposition," said Father O'Brien.
In this era of European union, and talk of dissolving borders and the end of national emnities, the British image makers and main-line representatives of the Northern Ireland government like to argue that change is afoot in Northern Ireland too. They say you can measure it, in part, by the numbers of fine cars and nice homes and uninvolved people whose lives area far removed from the embattled zones of Belfast and Armagh and Londonderry.
It is a proposition that seems, on first glance, difficult to believe, given the fact that the Unionists, who are mostly Protestant, and the Nationalists, who are mostly Catholic, could not even settle on a way to begin negotiating their differences, when they sat down at the abortive peace talks last summer.
 
50 Murders in 4 Months
 Moreover, the province is now enduring one of its most violent years in nearly a decade. In the last 4 months alone, nearly 50 people have been murdered, many of them apparently innocent victims chosen at random simply because of their religion.
But while unemployment in the worst ghettos still runs as high as 80 percent, and fear prevents vasts numbers of young Catholic males from searching for work outside their own neighborhoods, it is also true that the proportion of Catholics working in Government jobs here has grown over the last two decades.
After years of overt discrmination in the civil service, which accounts for nearly half of all jobs in Northern Ireland, the percentage of Catholics now employed in Government jobs, outside the security sector, is more than 39 percent, nearly equal to their percentage in the overall population, which is about 42 percent.
Since Government salaries in Belfast are comparable to London, but housing costs and other essentials are about a third less, many middle-class Catholics, like the much larger pool of middle-class Protestants, have found themselves largely insulated from the effects of the current recession.
 
Many Contrasts
 The relative prosperity and, arguably, the growing diversity of those at the upper tiers of Northern Ireland society has served to accentuate the contrasts within Northern Ireland society, between the Catholic and Protestant haves, and the Catholic and Protestant have-nots.
Here is a place where overall unemployment rates continue to hover around 14 percent, as a result of declining job opportunities in the city's shipyards and industrial sector, but where a luxury car dealership in downtown Belfast reports that sales of new cars were up by 11 percent over a year ago, and used cars by 33 percent, in spite of the recession.
Measured against the rest of Britain, Northern Ireland also has the highest percentage of students who graduate with grades at the top of their class. On the other hand, a higher percentage of Northern Ireland students, mostly from the lower economic orders, drop out of school early, with no qualifications whatsoever.
And along Great Victoria Street, in the center of city, a struggling entertainment strip has emerged over the last five years, a stretch of pubs, clubs, restaurants and fast food outlets. Here, along streets patrolled by soldiers, is the site of Belfast's first McDonalds, as well as Roscoff's, the first restaurant in Northern Ireland to receive a one-star rating from the Michelin Guide, the much coveted measure of culinary distinction.
 
View of the Door
 If anything, all of these changes only serve to make Belfast seem more surreal than ever, a place where the well-furnished reception areas of downtown offices look just as they might in London, except many doors have handles that allow them to be opened only from the inside, and local politicians literally choose their lunch tables so they have a clear view of the front door.
In one sense, the specter of terror never leaves the mind, like the police guards encased in heavy flak vests who still greet drivers outside Government parking lots each morning with a cheery hello, followed by the question: "Did you check your vehicle for bombs this morning?"
But life does go on, in some parts of the province much more comfortably than others, and there are those here say it could be a lot worse. Not long ago, the Government published a group of statistics to demonstrate that rates of burglary, assault and routine crime are lower in Northern Ireland than almost any place in the Western world, once the impact of terrorism and sectarian crime is removed.
Locals soon gave the index their own name. When it comes to "O.D.C," or "ordinary decent crime," they say, Belfast is a lot safer than London, Chicago or New York.

HEADLINE: Doubts Voiced on Yugoslav Sanctions

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSANSKA DUBICA, Yugoslavia, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The European Community's limited economic sanctions against Yugoslavia have little chance of forcing the Serbs and the Croats to end their deadly feud and find a way of sharing in peace the lands they jointly inhabit, or once did, Yugoslav economists and Western diplomats say.
"The boycott will not achieve the results expected by those who imposed it," said Ljubomir Madzar, a Belgrade University economics lecturer. 
 The European Community has banned Yugoslav textile imports, ended trade concessions to this country and dropped it from an aid program for East European countries.
The United States and Canada announced today they would follow the European Community's lead, with President Bush declaring at a news conference in The Hague today that Washington would co-sponsor a United Nations resolution calling for an oil embargo against Yugoslavia.
The Yugoslavs -- burdened with a collapsing economy -- are certain to suffer further hardship as a result of the sanctions.
"But in a state of war there are always strict priorities," Mr. Mazdar said, "and for military priorities, there will always be enough resources. The fact is that the civilian population will carry the burden of these measures."
The 12 European Community countries accounted for about half Yugoslavia's $23.3 billion in foreign trade in the first eight months of 1991. Half of that is with Germany, the country pushing hardest for sanctions.
The Europeans hope to coax the six Yugoslav republics into accepting a plan they have proposed to transform this country into a loose association of sovereign states within the republics' present borders.
 
Steps Aimed at Serbs
 The European Community has imposed the sanctions on Yugoslavia as a whole because its trade agreements with Yugoslavia are with the country's national Government and not with the governments of its republics. There is no doubt, however, that the punitive economic measures are primarily aimed at Serbia and the army.
"It is pointless to think you can direct sanctions selectively against one Yugoslav republic and leave the others untouched," said another Western envoy, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Evidence of that could be seen here in Bosanska-Dubica, a small place on the border between Croatia and the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Gas lines were long, and fuel supplies seemed to be declining day by day.

HEADLINE: NICARAGUA SEEKS TO CALM CONTRAS

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Seeking to calm the fears and angers of former contra rebels who have returned to arms, the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is reducing the army presence in the northwest of the country and has promised to incorporate former contras into the police in the area.
But one rearmed contra leader, known as Indomable, has rejected the Government 's efforts as inadequate, and officials acknowledge that the ranks of his followers grow in spurts when something occurs to upset or frighten them. 
 Concurrently, demobilized members of the Sandinista Army militia have appeared with arms again, sometimes confronting Indomable and his men in numbers as large as 100.
Minister of Government Carlos Hurtado, who has responsibility for internal security, said the police and army measures were being taken progressively as the Government continues a series of negotiations with the main group of rearmed former contra field commanders.
 
Persecution Asserted
 "If we get an agreement with those people it will solve a good part of the problem," Mr. Hurtado said in an interview Thursday. "Groups will remain, but they will be minimal."
The former contras, who fought the former Sandinista regime for a decade with backing and training from the United States, began rearming in small numbers in April. They are still thought to number considerably fewer than 1,000.
They say they made the decision because in their disarmed state, they were being killed, persecuted and threatened by the army and the police, which are still controlled by the Sandinista Front under the transition accord that followed Mrs. Chamorro's election last year.
Officials and mediators say that what sets Indomable -- whose name is Jose Angel Moran Flores -- apart from the other rearmed contras is that he is much more confrontational and has little interest in negotiating unless it is for the total dissolution of the army and the police.
 
Confrontation With Patrol
 Other than actions by Indomable, there have been relatively few actual military operations by the rearmed contras, nor have the army and the police undertaken significant operations against them.
For example, in one recent encounter between about 60 rearmed contras and an army patrol of about 30 men, what first threatened to be a battle turned into a verbal argument, then ended with the contras disarming the soldiers and ripping off the officer's epaulets.
The Government's policy has been to negotiate, and most of the rearmed contra chiefs have sought to use their arms as a means of forcing the Government to recognize their security concerns.
"In any other country, these people would be hunted down with arms," said Mr. Hurtado, referring to the rearmed contras and the Sandinista militias. "We have opted to solve this as a socio-economic problem."
Roberto Menendez, deputy chief of the observer mission of the Organization of American States, which has played a mediating role between the Government and the former contras, said one army base has already been closed -- at Pantasma in the department of Jinotega -- and that two others would follow shortly.

HEADLINE: Action Now or Next Year? Bush's Advisers Are Split Over Campaign Strategy

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The results of last week's elections exposed weaknesses in President Bush's still emerging campaign and highlighted divisions among his advisers over how to handle Mr. Bush's unofficial candidacy.
On the broadest level, White House strategists say they still envision a plan that blames Congress for the country's ills and portrays President Bush as concerned about domestic issues. But the specifics are another matter. After the Republicans' embarrassing defeat in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Administration officials and party leaders said privately that the immediate reaction was little more than a frenzy of finger-pointing. 
 "We have no quarterback," said one Administration official. "We're a football team trying to keep our heads down."
In a political operation that has not taken formal shape and has lost key leaders since Mr. Bush's victory in 1988, two main factions have emerged. One group, which includes John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and key members of the Cabinet, advise Mr. Bush to remain above the fray until he officially announces his candidacy early next year. The other, more activist group, which includes Vice President Dan Quayle and Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, argue that Mr. Bush should take the offensive now.
 
Contrast to 1988
 Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledge that the campaign at this point lacks a coordinated top management team like the aggressive duo of Lee Atwater and James A. Baker 3d that carried Mr. Bush to victory in 1988.
The White House, for its part, is abiding by its original campaign timetable, which calls for Mr. Bush to delay formal announcement of his candidacy until after he has delivered the State of the Union address in January.
"His biggest strength is being President, the governmental things he's done," said Charles Black, one of Mr. Bush's top political strategists. "He will still spend the majority of his time being President."
Even though the speculation over who will run his campaign is common in political circles, the President is resisting assembling anything that looks like a formal organization.
So far, the campaign planners include the longtime Bush advisers Mr. Black, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, the poll-taker Robert Teeter and Clayton K. Yeutter, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
None of the top advisers has titles yet, though several have begun meeting weekly to start assembling what one described as the "short-term strategy" that will be the groundwork for the campaign. But most are so conscious of Mr. Bush's desire to play down talk of a real campaign that they will either not speak for the record or not talk at all.
Others expected to play major roles in the campaign are Craig Fuller, an aide to Mr. Bush when he was Vice President and who is expected to plan the convention; Frederic V. Malek, the businessman who briefly ran the 1988 convention; Roger Ailes, a media consultant; James H. Lake, a veteran Reagan-Bush strategist; Rich Bond, the political director for Bush in 1988; Mary Matalin, the Republican National Committee's chief of staff; Richard G. Darman, the budget director; Nicholas F. Brady, the Secretary of the Treasury; Ron Kaufman, a political director, and Mr. Sununu, as well as other members of the White House inner circle.
 
Awkward and Abrupt
 Mr. Bush has been testing campaign themes that emphasize domestic issues for several weeks now, but his statements have often been awkward, as they were in Rome on Friday when he came out against "higher tax cuts."
The abrupt, panicky appearance of the decision on Election Day to cancel Mr Bush's planned trip to Asia pointed up the organizational work that remains to be done.
So far, the two main factions within the White House have not agreed on a coherent and quick-witted response to the issues that are taking center stage -- especially health-care policy and the economy.
"The Bush Administration is either focused inside Washington or outside the United States," one Administration official said. "The problem is we need to focus on the United States."
 
Missing: Two Strategists
 Both sides admit that this year's campaign lacks the sort of top management team that ran the campaign in 1988, when Lee Atwater and Mr. Baker had Mr. Bush's ear and had aggressive political instincts.
But Mr. Atwater died this spring, and Mr. Baker is not expected to play a key organizational role because of his duties as Secretary of State. Most analysts agree that, together, they supplied most of the political muscle for the 1988 campaign. Mr. Sununu was a valuable asset in the New Hampshire Primary in 1988, but some Bush insiders doubt his grasp of national politics.
"Ask me how many times today I thought of Lee," said one Republican strategist on a particularly bad day last week.
Mr. Teeter, a veteran poll-taker and longtime friend of Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush, is counted on in some quarters to emerge as a central figure who could help fill the vacuum left by Mr. Atwater and Mr. Baker. But he and Mr. Sununu have clashed in the past, and it is unclear if the uneasy peace between them can last through a tough campaign.
 
'A Year is a Very Long Time'
 For the moment, Mr. Teeter is trying to do his part for the President by playing down the long-term impact of the vote in Pennsylvania, in which Dick Thornburgh, the former Attorney General, was a surprise loser to Harris Wofford, the interim Senator who is a Democrat. "Off-year elections are very bad predictors," he said. "There is a lot of historical evidence of that. They certainly have some implications on issues and the sense of the country, but a year is a very long time away."
By and large, however, many of the Republicans who are spending the most time denouncing Congress, keeping an eye on announced and unannounced Democratic candidates and thinking of 1992, say Mr. Bush still has time to smooth out the rough spots.
"Let me tell you about these early wake-up calls," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. "They're almost always wrong numbers.
"Ultimately when an election is lost, people are always trying to find someone to blame," he said. "If we had won, you would have had six or seven different groups and people claiming credit."

HEADLINE: Insurers' Drive to Sell 'Bare Bones' Health Policy Falters for Lack of Interest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
A major push by health insurers to provide affordable coverage for millions of uninsured workers is running into unexpected trouble: Employers are not buying.
And that is creating a big problem for insurers, who have furiously lobbied state legislatures and insurance commissioners to be allowed to sell these so-called bare-bones policies. 
 The insurers have argued that these policies, with more limited benefits than the standard policies, were the best way to make coverage affordable for the many small businesses and individuals who cannot pay the steep premiums for more complete coverage.
The insurers had expected to sell millions of these policies and head off Federal programs, possibly even a Government takeover of health insurance. A variety of proposals before Congress offer solutions from a universal health system to tax credits for buying insurance.
 
Dearth of Employer Interest
 The bare-bones plans, the insurers calculated, would have a strong appeal to small businesses, allowing them to appeal to more qualified workers with benefits that could be offered at little additional cost. In addition to the lower cost of the limited-benefit policies, existing Federal tax incentives and new tax incentives in some states would reduce the cost still further.
But the dearth of employer interest in these basic policies, at a time when health benefits are of paramount concern to workers, is bolstering the arguments of those who contend that the best way to provide health insurance to the 34 million Americans who lack it is by mandating it.
Most of the limited-benefit policies, some of which can cost as little as about $50 for a single person, include the benefits required in standard policies with the exception of treatment for mental illness and alcohol and drug abuse. But they require the insured to pay more on doctor bills and for hospital stays and have lower maximum benefits.
 
23 States Encourage Policies
 Already, 23 states, from New Jersey to Washington, have altered their laws to encourage the bare-bones insurance plans. Changes are under consideration in New York and a dozen other states to make the insurance available. The approach involves no new taxes and, theoretically, could save millions of tax dollars spent on caring for the uninsured.
"It's a legislator's dream," said Richard E. Merritt, director of the Intergovernmental Health Policy Proj ect, a nonprofit research organization at George Washington University. But the plan has not been popular in the marketplace.
In the half-dozen states where insurers have marketed the limited-benefit policies, relatively few employers have signed on. The main reason, they say, is that the policies are still too expensive. They generally require that employers pay at least half the premium.
But Mr. Merritt, who said he was baffled by the poor reception of the policies, asserted, "It is too early to sound the death knell on these products."
Consumer advocates, who oppose most of the limited policies as inadequate, are pleased that the plans are not selling well. "Thankfully, the marketing has been disastrous," said Arnold Bennett, a spokesman for Families USA, a nonprofit advocacy group for health care changes in Washington. "The bare-bones plan is just a decoy, a way of delaying action on more fundamental reforms that threaten the insurance industry."
Insurers have successfully sold the bare-bones idea to legislators with the argument that some coverage is better than none. But Chris Petersen, senior counsel for the Health Insurance Association of America, a commercial insurers' trade group that promotes the new concept, said, "The solution has to be greater than this little piece of the puzzle."
Groups in Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the nonprofit insurance concern, have been the first to offer the limited-benefit policies. But industry spokesmen say nonprofit health maintenance organizations and commercial insurance companies will be playing an increasingly larger role by next year.
Introduction of the bare-bones policies has also cast some light on the decades-old debate about whether state rules mandating the breadth of coverage have greatly inflated costs, as insurers have long asserted. The states' consumer protection regulations specify the minimum benefits and services that must be contained in any policy sold.
Over the years the number of mandates have swollen, going beyond setting minimal coverage for such things as hospital stays, mental health and substance abuse treatment to more controversial items such as in vitro fertilization in Maryland, hair transplants in Minnesota and herbal therapy in Connecticut.
 
Limited to Small Businesses
 The limited-benefit policies are often 25 to 35 percent less expensive than standard health insurance policies, but state insurance officials say that about two-thirds of the savings come from higher deductibles and in the amounts paid by the insured, steps that the insurers could have taken without obtaining changes in law. The policies are usually limited to businesse with 50 or fewer employees as well as to self-employed individuals.
"What we've seen indicates that if you remove all mandated coverages, it reduces rates by only 3 to 10 percent," said James T. Odiorne, health care services administrator for the Washington State Department of Insurance.
So far, the bare-bones policies have been marketed in six states, including Rhode Island, where 242 policies have been sold since September. In Illinois, Kentucky and Virginia, where insurers have been selling the policies for up to 15 months, insurers have signed up businesses with only a few hundred employees total.
"The insurers overblew the market," said Steven T. Foster, Virginia's Commissioner of Insurance. "They thought there would be 80,000 or so people who would want this product, but as it turned out only about 35 employers have opted for it."
One of those employers is the Chase Concrete Construction Company, a four-year old concern in Chesapeake with five employees. "Most of our employees are young, and you wouldn't think they would give a hoot about health insurance, but they were ecstatic about it," said Jim Johnston, the former president of the family business who now serves as its bookkeeper. He said the company and its employees split the premiums, which are $76 a month for a single person and $180 for a family.
The program, offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia, provides maternity care, outpatient surgery, two doctor visits, a dental check-up and children's medical check-ups. It pays for up to 30 days of hospital care a year with a $250 deductible and with the insured paying 20 percent of the bill. The maximum benefit for the overall plan is $50,000 a year.
In introducing the plan in July 1990, the company estimated the market at 350,000 uninsured employees, but it has sold the plan to only 25 businesses with a total 100 employees. "We're planning to restructure the product," said Ronald H. Bargatze, an executive vice president of the insurance company.
In Washington State, insurers have enrolled only 2,300 employees since last year. And half of the enrolled employees were in businesses that were downgrading their insurance plans from more standard insurance policies, a switch that is not permitted in most of the other states experimenting with the policies.
"We're not actively promoting it anymore," said James D. Conant, a vice president of the insurance concern of Seabury and Smith in Seattle, said of the limited policies. "We don't hear of any resounding success with the product anywhere."
Mr. Conant said most small employers would not buy the policies unless forced to by law. Part of the problem is that employers do not want to cut into their profits, he said. But the recession and problems related to specific businesses play a role as well.
To some of those advocating the policies, the most disappointing sales statistics come from Oregon, which has been a leader in efforts to reform its insurance programs and laws. The Legislature, not the insurers as in most other states, defined the benefits of a bare-bones policy, making it one of the most comprehensive in the nation. The state set a base price of only $53.33 a month for a single employee; two insurers offer this low-price policy, but three others provide higher-priced bare-bones policies with more benefits.

HEADLINE: Tuskegee Announces Effort to Raise $150 Million

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Tuskegee University, one of the nation's most prominent historically black colleges, is seeking $150 million in donations by the year 2000 in the largest fund-raising effort any black college has ever attempted.
Officials of Tuskegee, founded in Alabama a century ago by Booker T. Washington,, announced the campaign at a luncheon on Wednesday in New York. 
 "We know it's not going to be easy," said Benjamin F. Payton, the university's president. "It's a monumental challenge for us, but we can't wait for the recession to end to attack the needs we have."
Dr. Payton and Andrew F. Brimmer, who is chairman of the board of trustees, said Tuskegee had already received $54 million in gifts and pledges as part of the campaign, begun in 1989. Colleges and universities typically begin raising money two or three years before they announce a campaign.
Tuskegee's effort comes as the United Negro College Fund, the consortium of 41 historically black private colleges and universities, is itself in the middle of its largest-ever capital campaign, a $250 million drive. That effort's kickoff, last year, drew widespread attention when Walter Annenberg, the financier and former Ambassador to Britain, pledged $50 million.
But officials of Tuskegee and of the College Fund, to which Tuskegee belongs, said they saw no conflict in the two campaigns. Dr. Payton said Tuskegee would continue to receive money from the College Fund throughout its own campaign.
"They're raising $250 million for 41 schools, and we support them wholeheartedly," he said. "We're raising money for ourselves and they support us. We believe, as they do, that the more each individual institution does, the easier it will be for all to benefit."
Dr. Payton said the money Tuskegee is seeking would be used for campus buildings and equipment, endowments for faculty chairs and research, student scholarships and general operating expenses.
Tuskegee's curriculum emphasizes business, scientific and technical courses, a legacy of Mr. Washington and of George Washington Carver, the Tuskegee professor and scientist who became famous for, among other things, his discoveries of the many uses of the peanut and sweet potato.
 
Trading on Value
 Education and fund raising experts agreed with Dr. Payton's assessment, saying there was no reason to believe that the College Fund and Tuskegee would be competing for the same philanthropic dollars. Charles V. Willie, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said Tuskegee "is pioneering in what other black colleges have to do: take the issue of their value to the larger society through fund-raising campaigns."
Dr. Willie added: "Tuskegee's courage in launching this big a campaign at the same time as the U.N.C.F. demonstrates how chronically under-funded black colleges have been. It's a challege to Tuskegee, sure. But it's also a challenge to the nation, because these colleges have to be supported for the good they do America."
Tuskegee's goal puts it in rarified company, according to George A. Brakeley 3d, a fund raising consultant. He noted that roughly 30 colleges and universities have begun efforts to raise more than $250 million each and that at least 50 are aiming for between $100 million and $250 million. Eight have set goals of $1 billion or more.
Mr. Brakeley, president of Brakeley John Price Jones of Stamford, Conn., added that, despite the recession, Tuskegee's "landmark campaign makes perfect sense" for three reasons.
 
'An Emotional Decision'
 "First," he said, "their needs aren't going to go away because of the recession. Indeed, they'll get more pressing if they leave them to fester. Secondly, the kind of big givers a campaign like this needs aren't affected by these economic downturns. They can draw from deep wells." And, he said: "Giving to a college or university is as much an emotional decision as a financial one. If the institution says it has a need, and says it in the right ways, alumni and non-alumni donors are going to give."

HEADLINE: An Institution Under Duress

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
It has been a tough few weeks for Congressional committees.
First, the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on Judge Clarence Thomas provided material for late-night comedians. Then, two major, complicated bills -- energy in the Senate and banking in the House -- suffered embarrassing defeats on the floor. 
 And for the last two weeks, the House Ways and Means Committee has been struggling to steer to the floor a bill on extended unemployment benefits that can pass. Members' technical wrangling has failed so far, even though there is something very close to a bipartisan consensus that the time has come to stop arguing and scoring political points and find a way to send checks to the jobless.
The first three problems produced complaints that the committees were failing the Congress. Republicans complained bitterly about the banking bill that the Rules Committee put before the House, and then they helped to kill it. Environmentalists assailed the Arctic drilling provisions in the energy bill that they successfully filibustered. Almost everybody complained at one point or another about the Thomas hearings.
And while Ways and Means has escaped much public criticism over the delays on the unemployment measure, that is probably because the differences among party leaders, the two Houses of Congress and the Bush Administration are at least as much at fault and more prominent.
 
Defense of the System
 Democratic leaders insist that these difficulties do not represent a pattern. Asked about the problems with the energy bill and the Thomas hearings, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said they were just a pair of exceptions. "It's as if a pitcher gave up two home runs and struck out the other 27 batters and you said he pitched a bad game," he said.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, argued that Congress was simply "not a place where it is simple to get clear, crisp, clean solutions."
It seems less simple than it used to be. Committees and their bills are treated with less deference on the floor than in the past. Junior members now act as if their votes and opinions count for as much as those of elderly chairmen. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that was nothing for the Congress to apologize for; "people want their members to be more independent," he said.
But sometimes the independence suggests fragmentation, or "a series of independent baronies," in the view of Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. He also complained that as committee members stay with an issue for years and become expert on it they lose touch with their colleagues and even the country and "start talking about some arcane thing as if it was real."
 
Rising Use of Filibuster
 The Senate has to contend with another institutional change that makes a committee's task of forging a coalition much harder than it once was. The increased use of the filibuster means it takes 60 votes -- the number required to shut off debate -- even to take up a controversial issue. Once reserved for matters of fundamental principle, the filibuster is now a routine tool of legislative harassment.
Divided government is another hurdle for committees. They must either shape policies so President Bush will agree with them, or find the two-thirds majorities needed to override a Presidential veto. Since he became President in 1989, all of Mr. Bush's vetoes have been upheld.
 
Bypassing Committees
 Committees were given no chance to fail when it came to the two biggest legislative issues of the year. They had little to do with the vote to go to war over Kuwait and the compromise civil rights bill. The first was played out on the floor; the second was negotiated in Capitol offices.
To Thomas E. Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, a research organization, decisions like that are not a reflection of committees but a realistic understanding of their limitations. "There are times when they simply can't manage enormous political conflicts," he said.
But, Mr. Mann added, he has less sympathy when different kinds of sensitivities, approaching political panic, led the Senate to rewrite its procedures for protecting its employees from discrimination and allow them to go to court.
The Senate should have sent the issue to its Rules Committee to examine the scope of the problem and consider how to solve it, he said. But as Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, complained, "the frightened may prevail," and the political imperatives created by the Thomas hearings would not allow anything but a quick vote on the floor.
The war, the civil rights bill and the treatment of Senate staff remain an exception, though. There are more checks on committee influence than there used to be, of course, but as Woodrow Wilson wrote in 1885, "It is not far from the truth to say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee rooms is Congress at work."

HEADLINE: Planning Company's Failure Leaves Class Reunions in Lurch

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Class reunion organizers across the nation are scrambling to put together their own celebrations after the nation's largest reunion planning company closed its doors.
"The D.J. is out -- we'll bring in a stereo if we have to," said Gayle Shearer Smith, who is helping organize a reunion in Latrobe, Pa. "We're cutting corners, but there will be a reunion." 
 The company, Reunions, A Class Organization Inc., based in the Chicago suburb Hoffman Estates, closed last week. A letter to the company's creditors said that the recession had caused its revenue to plummet and that refunds to customers were extremely unlikely.
Reunions was the nation's largest organizer of class reunions, said officials at the National Association of Reunion Planners in Washington.
 
1199 Reunions in Limbo
 The company's collapse left in limbo about 119 celebrations scheduled this month, said John Kallergis, an accountant representing the company's largest investor. The investor's identity was not disclosed, but the liquidation firm said it was owed $350,000.
Officials were unable to estimate the amount of money Reunions had collected for events that have not yet occurred, but it was more than $10,000 for some get-togethers. Lawyers for the company did not return phone calls.
The collapse left class members in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., trying to put together celebrations they had paid Reunions to organize.
Organizers sought help from local businesses, negotiated with hotels and other suppliers already scheduled to provide food and entertainment for their reunions and solicited alumni for more money.
In Latrobe, the Elks lodge has agreed to accept payment over time for the use of its center. The Chicago White Sox are helping pay for a reunion planned by the company at Comiskey Park's Stadium Club, a spokeswoman, Barb Kozuh said.
Organizers said they had lost thousands of dollars the company collected by selling tickets for the coming event.
 
'What Are We Going to Do?'
 "I was in shock," said Beth Bakunowicz, chairwoman of the reunion committee of the East High School class of 1981 in Rockford, Ill. "I just kept asking myself, 'What are we going to do?' At the point I got the letter, I wasn't even sure we had a place to have the reunion."
Ms. Bakunowicz estimated her classmates had purchased at least $4,500 in tickets, and she said she did not expect to get any of the money back.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Takes Over Troubled Staten Island Bank

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Community National Bank and Trust Company, one of Staten Island's largest banks, was declared insolvent Friday and most of its deposits were sold to Chemical Bank.
Although Community National's deposits were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that government backing will not apply to accounts that exceeded the $100,000 insurance limit. The loss on accounts of more than $100,000 will depend on how much the Government collects on the loans and other assets of the failed bank. 
 At the bank's main branch at 3511 Amboy Road in Richmond yesterday, Michael Miano, who said he was a depositor for 24 years, read the signs announcing the bank's closing and said, "There's not much we can do about it. There was never any warning or anything."
He questioned David Barr, an F.D.I.C representive, and after he was reassured that his money was safe, he said, "You know, I don't have that much, but whatever I have is mine."
 
Echoes of Freedom National
 Mr. Barr said on Friday that a week ago, there were 174 accounts at the bank holding a total of $12.6 million of uninsured deposits. He said Federal examiners did not yet know how many of those account holders -- mostly local businesses and individuals whose accounts would exceed $100,000 when interest was paid -- withdrew funds in the past week. The fully insured deposits at the bank totaled $321.8 million and were spread among 47,400 accounts.
The F.D.I.C.'s decision to cover only insured depositors was similar to its handling of the Freedom National Bank, a black-owned Harlem bank that failed last year. Freedom National's failure resulted in losses for several churches and other nonprofit organizations that held some of the $11 million in uninsured deposits at the bank. At Freedom, insured depositors were paid by the Government because there was no other bank willing to bid for the deposits.
Community National depositors with accounts of up to $100,000 will have access to their money on Tuesday, the F.D.I.C. said. In the meantime, checks drawn on Community National, up to the insurance limit of $100,000, will continue to be honored.
"My stuff is insured," said Steve Demizio, who stopped by the bank yesterday. "But if this one is at fault, what about the next one, and the next one? What are you going to do, put your money under your mattress at night?"
Community National was a victim of the ailing New York economy, particularly declining real-estate values. The bank was a heavy lender for construction of new projects and other commercial real-estate loans, which accounted for more than 40 percent of its assets.
In 1990 the bank lost $17 million. Earlier this year regulators forced the bank to sign agreements to improve its lending practices, change management, and strengthen its finances. By late October, the bank's growing financial problems caused it to miss an interest payment on bonds it had issued.
For larger banks that have failed, like the Bank of New England in Boston, uninsured depositors have avoided losses because government regulators have made payments to other banks that agreed to accept all the deposits of the failed bank. Those large banks have been handled differently because government officials say the losses could be too disruptive to the financial markets and the local economy.
After Federal bank examiners decided a week ago that Community National was insolvent, Chemical Bank on Monday submitted the best of two bids received for the bank's deposits. As recently as Oct. 23, Community National was expecting to stay in business, and announced the hiring of Keith L. Dalrymple, a bank executive from Addison, N.Y., as its new chief executive.
The six branches of Community National -- five on Staten Island and one in Brooklyn -- will open for business on Tuesday, following the Veterans Day bank holiday tomorrow. Chemical, which already operates four branches on Staten Island, agreed to pay $972,000 for the deposits.

HEADLINE: FIRE INVESTIGATION ANGERS L.I. POLICE

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
When fire destroyed the Long Island mansion of Reginald Lewis last week, the chairman of a big New York food processing company, Mr. Lewis telephoned his friend Mayor David N. Dinkins for help.
The Mayor phoned Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, spokesmen for City Hall and the Police Department said, and two police arson specialists were dispatched to study the ruins of the mansion in Amagansett. 
 Suzanne Trazoff, the spokeswoman for the Police Department, said yesterday that she did not see anything wrong with sending two officers working for the city to provide personal assistance to a leading businessman with a problem in an outlying community. Leland T. Jones, the spokesman for City Hall, said he was not sure.
But both said it had been wrong for the city police not to notify the police on Long Island that two specialists were coming out. And they said that it had definitely been out of line for Lieut. Phil Pulaski, the head of the arson squad, and one of his sergeants to identify themselves at the scene of the fire as a lawyer and an arson consultant. The incident was first reported in Newsday.
 
Displeasure in East Hampton
 In East Hampton Township, which includes Amagansett, the police were not pleased that they were not notified of the city's helping hand. They refused to let the strangers cross their police lines around the mansion and only learned that they were from the New York police department through a computer check of the license plate of their unmarked detective's car.
"They were told to be unobtrusive," Ms. Trazoff said. "They were not told not to identify themselves, but that was their interpretation."
No one in East Hampton complained formally until Thursday, the day after the fire, when Thomas L. Scott, the Chief of Police in East Hampton Township, returned a call from David W. Scott, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the city. They are not related.
"I pointed out that we were aware that two of their people were out here and that we were upset that they didn't identify themselves," the Long Island chief said. "He apologized profusely. The guy apologized and that was enough."
A short time later, Commissioner Brown telephoned. "He told me it was a matter of miscommunication," the Long Island chief said. "He just wanted me to know it should not have happened and that he was sorry about it."
There were, said the Mayor's spokesman, "obviously some protocol problems," but he added he was not sure that anything was improper.
 
'Problem of Celebritidom'A Matter of Courtesy
 It was all really a matter of courtesy, Mr. Jones said, and what he described as "the problem of celebritidom in New York." It was not, he said, just that Mr. Lewis and the mayor were friends.
"That was one of the reasons," Mr. Jones said. "But the other reason is that he's the head of a major business in the city and this is just the kind of courtesy you extend to the heads of institutions in the city -- the publisher of a newspaper, the head of a church, a major businessman or a sports celebrity. You take their calls and if they need help you generally provide them with help."
The East Hampton police chief said the mansion, which he valued "in the millions," had "completely burned." He said his investigators had not yet been able to figure out what started the fire. He said he could not rule out arson, but added that nothing so far suggested criminal activity.
Mr. Jones said Mr. Lewis, the chairman of Beatrice Foods, is a friend of the Mayor and an acquaintance of the Police Commissioner who serves on the Mayor's appointed Council of Economic Advisers.
Ms. Trazoff said she checked with city lawyers and had been assured that nothing illegal had taken place. "It's really very simple," she said. "Mr. Lewis called the Mayor. The Mayor called the Police Commissioner and asked if he could help Mr. Lewis. The Commissioner called Mr. Lewis and offered his assistance. Mr. Lewis said he just needed some advice. So the Commissioner asked the chief of the deparment who asked the chief of detectives if they could make some one available to advise Mr. Lewis. And two detectives were sent out, not to do an investigation but to give Mr. Lewis some advice. No one is being disciplined because of this."
Henry J. Stern, head of the Citizen's Union, a civic group, faulted the Dinkins administration for its handling of the matter.
"What was done here was done so poorly," he said. "It's obvious that the local cops blew the whistle. The local force was rightly insulted. That made it into a farce."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Virgin Islander Has Shot at 5 Olympics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
With health and even a hint of ability, Seba Johnson of the United States Virgin Islands has a chance to do something not even Sonja Henie, the legendary figure skater of Norway, could achieve.
The youngest skier in the 1988 Calgary Olympics, at 14 years of age, Johnson is well positioned to compete in five Winter Olympics, one more than Henie and two other women who share the record for the winter games. 
 Johnson is an Alpine specialist who finished 28th in the giant slalom in Calgary. More important to the Virgin Islands, she served as a pioneer of sorts, becoming the first skier to represent the United States territory in the Winter Olympics, along with athletes who competed in the bobsled and luge events.
For Albertville, the Virgin Islands Olympic committee plans to enter Johnson and a second skier, John Campbell, as well as teams in bobsled, luge and curling.
"I wish the Virgin Islanders youth would get more interested in skiing," Johnson said from her dormitory room at the University of Maine, where she is a freshman, enrolled in the ski-industry management program.
"I'm going down there in December for a few days to talk to kids at some of the schools. I'm going to try to get them interested in racing or, at least, in skiing."
If it has taken some doing to get young athletes involved in winter sports, the Caribbean weather might be one reason. There isn't much snow in the Virgin Islands, and athletes like Johnson, who was born in Frederiksted on St. Croix, generally move elsewhere to live and train. Johnson was 7 when she and her mother moved to Kittery, Me. Her parents had divorced four years before, and her father returned to his country of birth, Burundi.
 With the new four-year cycle for the Winter Olympics starting in 1994, Johnson has a reasonable chance to compete that year in Lillehammer, Norway, when she would be 20, four years later in Nagano, Japan, and in 2002, when she would be just 28, a prime age for Alpine skiers.
Improved as a skier since Calgary, she was less concerned over a better finish in Albertville than in setting a good example for the young people of the islands.
"They all write me fan letters," she said. "They love me down there."
 
Bruised, and Now Blond
 It has been quite an autumn season for Christopher Bowman, the former United States national champion figure skater who has never quite fulfilled the greatness expected of him. Several weeks after winning Skate America in Oakland two months ago, he was punched in the face in downtown Toronto, suffering a broken bone around his right eye.
Bowman said he was leaving the home of his coach, Toller Cranston, when he was approached by a woman asking for money. After refusing, two males appeared. He said one tried to choke him; the other hit him with his fist.
For two weeks, Bowman thought subsequent medical attention was unnecessary despite bruising, swelling, blurred vision and occasional discomfort. Finally, after consulting a doctor, he underwent surgery to repair his cheek, which had fallen several centimeters as a result of the blow.
"But I'm fine now," he said the other day. "I'm feeling great and looking great."
He might have added, looking different. In a recent moment of whimsy, he had his jet-black hair dyed blond. He left his eyebrows black, along with his recently produced goatee. "It's pretty scary," he said. "Halloween just came a few days late for me."
But then he swore the reason for the hair-color change was not altogether frivolous.
"It's the pre-Olympic pressure," he said. "Now, people look at me and they don't want to talk about the Olympics. They want to talk about my hair. It's a way of turning the tables on them."
 
The Luge and Its Legions
 Luge is one of those arcane sports that elude the public eye in most places, including the United States, until the next Winter Olympics. Even at that, people in few countries are likely to notice. At the 1988 Olympics in Calgary, just 23 countries sent athletes to slide down the track on those tiny sleds, less than half the nations represented by skiers.
In an attempt to expand the sport's popularity, the international federation for luge began conducting an outreach program after Calgary to introduce the sport to countries without a track or without a luge program. By Albertville, as many as 30 countries are expected to compete.
"We feel the program has been very successful," Jan Steler, the secretary general of the federation, said from his office in Marseilles, France. "We now have more athletes from more small countries than we ever had before."
The program is funded by the federation, using coaches and former world-class athletes as instructors, and by the International Olympic Committee. Among the countries or territories participating have been Spain, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Bermuda, the Virgin Islands of the United States and Puerto Rico. After Albertville, Steler said, the program will be expanded to reach luge-less countries in Oceania.
 
Unity Campaign Planned
 Administrators at the European Community headquarters in Brussels have planned a unity campaign for Albertville to celebrate the elimination of economic borders on the continent next year -- and to assuage any fears. They intend to flood competition venues with European Community banners, flags and posters and disseminate information through an exhibition inside a Euromobile and over a community-sponsored channel that will be transmitted to high-definition televisions placed in public places throughout the Olympic venues. . . . The mayors of the various villages in which Olympic events will be held complained at a news conference in Paris last week that occupancy rates for the season, normally at capacity, will be no more than 70 percent through the Games. Higher prices than usual might have something to do with it, but they didn't mention that. The mayors also announced that no cars would be allowed into the various areas within three hours of a competition. Spectators will be taken in and out by bus. . . . The sluggish economy has not left the United States Olympic Committee budget untouched. Officials said recently that they would reduce expenditures by up to 3 percent for 1992 although they promised that athlete-assistance programs would not be affected.

HEADLINE: All Those Tax Cuts: Fool's Gold

 BODY:
Last Tuesday, the 1992 campaign began for real. The parade of personalities was finally coupled to the engine of real issues.
Pennsylvanian voters, for instance, showed how much they care about jobs and health care by electing unheralded Harris Wofford to the Senate. Within hours, Republican senators were talking about health care reform and tax cuts, and Dan Rostenkowski, the Democratic chairman of the House tax-writing committee, proposed cutting taxes on middle-class families. 
 Health care reform is essential. The various tax-cut proposals are reckless. They risk selling out the future.
Election-year tax cuts for the middle class: that sounds like the purest political honey. Sponsors rationalize the idea by claiming such tax cuts will propel the economy out of recession and lift an unfair burden. It's a false promise.
Tax cuts are an ineffective way to fight recession; by the time a proposal could wind its way into law and affect the economy, the recession will almost certainly be over. Besides, under current law, Congress is required to offset tax cuts with spending cuts or tax hikes. The net impact on the economy would be zero.
Of the many tax-cut plans before Congress, Mr. Rostenkowski's is the best. It would provide modest tax relief to 80 percent of all taxpayers. He proposes giving a two-year tax credit of at most $400 to a working couple. Families too poor to owe tax would get the credit as cash.
Mr. Rostenkowski would pay for the credit by permanently raising the tax on couples earning more than $145,000 to 35 percent and placing a 10 percent surcharge on taxable income above $1 million.
The plan does a lot that's right. It would not bust last year's budget law, thereby maintaining Congress's pledge to control the deficit. And it would not burn up the peace dividend to pay for tax cuts, but would preserve it for desperately underfunded public programs.
But good as Mr. Rostenkowski's plan is, even it is perilous. By raising the tax on the richest families to 38.5 percent, it invites -- begs -- Congress to undo the Tax Reform Act of 1986. For one thing, Congress would be sure to cave in to President Bush's obsessive campaign to cut the tax on capital gains. And that in turn would start a rush to restore other wasteful tax shelters that were swept away in 1986. All told, much more harm than good.
The middle class is suffering, but not because taxes are unusually onerous. The problem is that for 20 years now, earnings have stagnated. The only solution is to raise workplace productivity. And that requires massive new public and private investment in job training, education, equipment and infrastructure.
Finding the money won't be easy. Starting in 1994, Congress will be forced to make huge cuts in domestic programs to meet its deficit targets. The only way out of the bind is to cut defense significantly beyond the huge reductions already scheduled. Either that or raise taxes.
Congress cannot afford to use the peace dividend to pay for tax cuts when it will need every dollar it can find to pay for the investments needed for prosperity.
It will take intelligent, honest candidates to carry that message to the public. Middle-class tax cuts are fool's gold.

How to Beat the Democrats

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
President Bush's new campaign strategy of bashing Congress will defeat some Congressional Democrats, but it won't get him re-elected. It leads only to blind alleys. And if Mr. Bush pushes it to extremes, as he did last week by canceling his trip to Asia, he will undermine his own great strength in foreign policy.
Mr. Bush's outside political advisers plus his chief aide, John Sununu, advocate bashing. "All he's got to do is to create an enemy, and the enemy is Congress," Charles Black, a Republican political consultant told me by way of explaining the strategy launched by Mr. Bush two weeks ago in Texas. "Even if the public doesn't like the President, they don't like Congress more," Mr. Black said. "He's got to become more confrontational." 
 Many inside Bush advisers such as White House aides Richard Darman and Brent Scowcroft along with Secretary of State James Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady counsel less confrontation with Congress and more "Presidential" action. They're on the right track, given the many cynical legislative games now being played by Democrats. If only Bush aides could come up with some Presidential-quality ideas on domestic problems and the economy, they might be able to sell their case.
But they don't have any good ideas. So all they can do is punch holes in the bashing strategy that at best is shortsighted and at worst is dumb politics. Here's what they can say:
* Mr. Bush will not find it easy to blame Congress for a weak economy when history shows the public eventually holds the President more accountable than Congress for financial ills. That's what is popping up in the polls as hard times set in. A recent Gallup poll shows that for the first time in years people put Democrats ahead of Republicans as the party better able to manage the economy.
* He cannot beat up on Congress about the economy and, at the same time, insist that the economy is not all that bad. The Bush line remains that there is no recession, only a "lack of consumer confidence." And if he does start acknowledging bleak prospects, he's got to have a program for rebuilding confidence -- and he doesn't have one.
* Mr. Bush will be hard put to portray Congress as irresponsible one day and make deals with it the next. If he signs the civil rights bill as expected, he cannot go around condemning Congress for legislating quotas. If he and the Republicans want to share political credit for extending unemployment benefits or health care, they will have to work closely with Democrats.
* In any war over taxes, Democrats can outbid the President. Mr. Bush is stuck to suspect schemes like reducing the capital gains tax for wealthy investors. Democrats can always counter with tax-the-rich proposals. They can also advocate tax cuts for the middle class, while Mr. Bush has to worry about the effect of such cuts on his efforts to reduce interest rates.
* Mr. Bush will have trouble deflecting Democratic attacks about not paying attention to the home front, and still do what he should abroad. Yet he must -- for the national interest and his own.
He had to go to the NATO summit meeting in Rome last week or forfeit America's vital leadership role in Europe. He has to be involved from time to time in Mideast talks or there will be no progress toward peace. He has to reschedule his trip to Asia, particularly to Japan and South Korea, because trade with Pacific Rim countries is critical to American well-being. His deft handling of such issues, including the war against Iraq, is what made him a popular President in the first place.
Mr. Bush may think his declaration of war against Congress will serve him as well as Harry Truman's fight against a Republican Congress in the 1948 Presidential campaign. If so, he's got things backward. That feisty Democratic President had a visionary domestic program and challenged Congress to approve it or pay the political consequences. Mr. Bush has no such program for what ails the country. If he fails to present plausible and compelling domestic legislation, voters will read his attacks for what they now are -- a cover for an empty shelf of ideas.
Of course, Mr. Bush's final campaign strategy will have to await the choice of his Democratic rival. But whoever the opponent, Mr. Bush's best strategy will be not to brawl with Congress, but to govern.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Bush's Strong Suit

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
President Bush seems rattled by sudden pressures to turn his attention to domestic problems. But even as he tried at his Rome news conference to change the subject, he sounded a warning that next year's Democratic nominee would do well to heed.
First, Mr. Bush beat his breast with words voters are likely to hear in 1992 as often as they heard "Willie Horton" in 1988: 
 "If I had had to listen to advice from the United States Senate leadership, the Democrats -- or from the House, the leadership over there -- to do something about the Persian Gulf, we'd have still been sitting there in the United States, fat, dumb and happy, with Saddam Hussein maybe in Saudi Arabia."
That may not be the political sledgehammer it appeared to be last winter. For one thing, it's not true -- Democrats supported the original dispatch of U.S. troops to defend Saudi Arabia, as well as economic sanctions on Iraq; and no one but Mr. Bush suggests that Saddam Hussein would have invaded Saudi Arabia after these actions.
More to the point, however, are the indications of polls and focus groups that euphoria over the desert war has largely faded, owing to disappointment at an inconclusive outcome that left Saddam Hussein in power, and to concern for the domestic economy.
But in a more potent vein, Mr. Bush added that though Americans are hurting economically and need help, "They don't need the President to forswear his obligations for national security and foreign affairs."
They certainly don't, and any President who did so, or even appeared to, would court defeat. One reason, of many, why Jimmy Carter was not re-elected in 1980 was widespread public doubt about his willingness and capacity to represent the nation forcefully in its foreign and security policies.
Americans like to think their nation is No. 1 in the world, which is why the quick desert victory was so cheering -- if only briefly -- to a people hungry for a demonstrable victory. Whatever else they may think of their President, they expect him, as their representative, to be a formidable figure on the world stage. Winning a war, as Mr. Bush did, tends to make any President just such an international champion.
Thus, any candidate the Democrats nominate to run against Mr. Bush next year is not likely to win merely by denouncing the President on the economy (unless the country is in a Depression on a scale approaching 1932) and other domestic issues. Those issues make Mr. Bush vulnerable; but voters also will have to be convinced that if a Democratic challenger is elected, the nation's foreign interests and its military security will be in strong, reliable hands.
This is more nearly a problem of personality than of experience. Ronald Reagan, for instance, was elected in 1980 with no foreign or security policy experience; but the public saw him as more trustworthy in these fields than Mr. Carter, whose standing as a tough guy had been hurt by his inability to win or force release of the hostages then held in Iran.
Similarly, in 1992, the problem for a Democratic nominee will not be the debatable question of his or her party's role in the desert war; rather, it will be that Mr. Bush himself organized an international coalition, led it and the nation, and won a war, however messy its diplomatic results. In doing so, he became "Presidential"; he showed himself capable of the primary duty the people demand of their leader -- strong assertion and defense of American interests in the world.
That may be a commentary on Americans -- that war is more convincing to them than, say, the peace that Jimmy Carter maintained. But for the politics of 1992, the real question is whether any Democrat can match George Bush's claim to be a proven Presidential figure, validated by war and victory.
It won't be easy and it probably can't be done by pointing the finger at Mr. Bush on domestic issues alone, vulnerable though he may be. Many voters hold the Democratic Congress, not to mention governors and legislatures, equally or more culpable. The President and his advisers will not hesitate to blame Democrats for domestic failures, as Mr. Bush did at Rome.
A renewed security crisis -- in the Middle East, for example, or in the former Soviet Union -- would quickly direct attention abroad again. Even the economy is strongly influenced by international affairs. That's George Bush's strength, and the Democratic nominee will have to deal with it.

HEADLINE: Conflicted on Europe

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser in the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Within a month, two cities in Europe are likely to symbolize a basic challenge to U.S. policy toward Europe. In Maastricht, in the Netherlands, the European Community's heads of government will seek to reach a breakthrough agreement on political union. And in Kiev, the Ukraine's legislators are likely to formalize their state's independence of any Soviet and thus Russian control.
Whatever the outcomes -- and these efforts will face many complications -- both represent historical milestones. Both will change Europe's political map. Both will contribute to the further redistribution of global power. And both will soon require a strategically sound and timely United States response to complex, even potentially dangerous, new dilemmas. 
 The painful fact is that U.S. policy and rhetoric concerning these basic choices have been strangely in conflict. We have proclaimed a thousand times that we would like to see a unified Europe -- a true U.S. partner in promoting economic progress, European security and global peace. We have said we want America and Europe to assume equal responsibilities, especially in the costly defense area. But when confronting the choice of whether to facilitate or obstruct genuine European political -- hence, also military -- unity, the U.S. at best waffles and at worst impedes.
We want European unity but feel uneasy about the European Community's growing economic power. We want Europe to stand on its feet politically and militarily, but we object to efforts to create a European defense structure by obstructing French and German efforts to link the Western European Union -- a purely European military coordinating structure -- with the community.
In practice, though not in rhetoric, we tend to be closer to the prevailing views of the British Tories, who would prefer not to see the emergence of a federal Europe endowed with political and military decision-making organs. Is such a stance wise and in keeping with the needs of the times?
Europe is groping for a new sense of self-definition, and it perceives a new destiny, especially with the collapse of Communism. A larger Europe up to the Bug River, Poland's eastern frontier, is becoming possible, perhaps less than 15 years from now. A larger Europe could offer hope to the millions liberated from Communism but fearful that post-Communism will increasingly mean poverty. And a larger Europe could be a stabilizing world power.
But before a wider Europe comes into being, it must first become deeper, and soon. Unless an integrated, increasingly federal Europe takes visble shape, there is danger that unity will not only become so diluted that it becomes meaningless but that Europe will be submerged by a wave of xenophobia and ethnic antagonisms. Every Western European country is susceptible to this danger, and the danger is rising.
In the absence of a genuine federal development, Europe is likely to remain powerless and increasingly vulnerable to a renewal of old national conflicts. Its failure to cope with the Serbian-Croatian war dramatically illustrates the urgent need for a Europe capable of acting as one politically. The inevitable rise in German economic power reminds us why it is essential to create joint and truly binding political institutions. An integrated Germany can be a locomotive of economic growth; a dominant Germany in a politically disjointed Europe can be a source of conflict.
All of this argues for a significant adjustment in U.S. policy. The Maastricht meeting will surely not overcome all the obstacles on the way to a federal Europe, but one of them should not be an America that is shortsighted in its European perspectives. Of the two competing visions of Europe's future -- the French-German and the British -- the first deserves American support.
American policy toward the crisis in the Soviet Union is also out of focus. Our rhetoric has traditionally favored democracy, pluralism and self-determination. But that theme has been overshadowed by one that is closer to real U.S. policy: that it is somehow in the interest of "stability" that a "Soviet center," preferably with Mikhail Gorbachev at the helm, be preserved.
The unintentional consequence of such a position might be a showdown between Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Claiming that he has the support of Western leaders and that "the main issue for them is the preservation of the union," Mr. Gorbachev is positioning himself as the defender of "the union" and "the benefits of socialism," both allegedly threatened by Mr. Yeltsin's reforms. This is bound to appeal to the Army, the last institution of central power.
But "the center" of the former Soviet Union can be restored only by coercion. The nations of the former Russian empire have awakened politically. Most will not accept a political center in the Kremlin. It is doubtful that even coercion would obtain compliance, but there is danger that misguided Western statements could encourage the Army to try coercion. (Early Western statements urging the preservation of Yugoslavia may have encouraged the Serbians' recourse to arms.)
The Soviet economy can be rebuilt only from the bottom up, on a highly decentralized basis. That renders useless, even counterproductive, notions of reform conducted by "the center." Western aid can be productive only if related directly to republican, even regional, governments, which are more capable of dealing with very diverse local problems.
In any case, on Dec. 1 the Ukraine will certainly vote for independence and then assert it. That, in turn, will force the Russians to redefine their political identity, which will not be easy. The gifted but troubled Russian people will face the question of whether they wish to remain an imperial nation destined to rule their neighbors, no matter what and no matter at what cost even to themselves, or to become a normal, increasingly modern and democratic European nation.
A moment of truth is thus approaching, but not only for the Russians. If the U.S. and the rest of the West refrain from recognizing the legitimate right of the Ukrainians to a sovereign state, they will encourage a crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations. And rather than helping Russia define itself as a modern and post-imperial state, the West will reinforce its declining but still strong imperial impulses.
American strategy toward the former Soviet Union thus needs historical updating. We can help the Russians and non-Russians make the difficult transition to the post-Communist era only if we recognize and try constructively to channel the new political realities.
And since the Ukrainians' rejection of continued subordination cannot be avoided and the international significance of this stand cannot be ignored, a revision of America's position is needed. It is wrongheaded to ignore Ukrainian aspirations and even worse to twist Canada's arm to get Canada to renege on its plans to recognize the Ukraine's independence.
Instead, the West should seek to insure that the consequences of Ukrainian independence are benign. The Ukrainians are almost certain to favor a long-term economic agreement with Moscow and the other former Soviet republics. The Ukraine intends to be a non-nuclear state, while loose talk of an eventual army of 450,000 men (fewer than the current Soviet deployment of more than one million on the republic's soil) was largely the result of an effort to figure out what to do with the 600,000 Ukrainians in the Soviet Army.
The separation of the Ukraine, the second largest republic, will mean that the Soviet Government will in effect cease to exist. Its international responsibilities and nuclear weapons will be inherited by the Russian state. The dangerous division of power between Mr. Yeltsin (and the Russian state) and Mr. Gorbachev (and the Army) might thus be ended.
A formula I recently discussed in Kiev with the Ukrainian leaders would provide for a League of Sovereign States to replace the fading Soviet center. Much like the British Commonwealth, the league would not be a state (nor a U.N. member) but a coordinating and consultative organ, headed by a respected but not a policy-making figure.
The league could have mechanisms for arbitrating disputes and even for some coordination of policy. But, most important, over and above an open economic association, it would be based on the principles of pluralism and self-determination instead of imperial subordination.
Certainly, this would be in keeping with the best interests of all concerned. And this is why the time is ripe for a readjustment of U.S. policy. Maastricht and Kiev challenge us to define worthy and relevant goals for American policy in Europe. These can be stated directly: a federated European Community, and a League of Sovereign States in place of the former Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Rid American Sports of Racial Stereotypes;
Diversity's Pitfalls

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 28 front-page article about the debate at New York City's Hunter College on what to teach about diversity understates the opposition at faculty hearings to the proposed curriculum changes. 
 Two of the three proposed requirements -- courses on women and American minorities -- lack clear intellectual rationale. Political agendas and emotional sentiments, rather than reasoned thinking on the requirements of a liberal education, better explain why some groups -- blacks and Hispanic Americans, for example -- are included in Hunter's definition of minorities while Scottish-Americans, the disabled and the working class are excluded.
Moreover, contrary to the assertions of group advocates, the college curriculum already reflects considerable diversity, both in the range of courses and through the steady incorporation of sound scholarship on ethnicity, race, class and other group characteristics into the mainstream of academic disciplines.
The third proposed requirement, for a course on non-Western culture, would be more defensible if Hunter first required students to study Western civilization. There are many good reasons to study foreign countries and cultures, especially at a time of revolutionary changes in international politics and growing global economic competition. But it makes no sense to explore other cultures and civilizations without standards of historical and comparative perspective.
Increasingly, it seems only the best students are acquainted with the ideals of the European Enlightenment. An alarming number cannot even identify the differences between democracy and totalitarianism. More than 15 percent of the students in one of my classes recently equated the policies of Nazi Germany and the Bush Administration, stating that both: "systematically oppressed lots of people, including the homeless"; "were imperialists who started wars," and sought a "new world order to take over the world."
Hunter may benefit from revision of its curriculum, but the proposed diversity requirements are intellectually unsound and likely to be counterproductive.

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
An important element in "Trials Face a Hurdle Named David Duke," (The Times, Nov. 6) about the 1992 New Orleans Olympic track and field trials and David Duke's gubernatorial candidacy has been omitted. 
 The New Orleans bid to be host to the trials was considered a million-to-one shot by track and field insiders, especially given the sorry state of the proposed venue, 55-year-old Tad Gormley Stadium. But with one of the most depressed economies in the United States, the New Orleans Sports Foundation raised $7 million in public and private funds -- nearly $5 million more than was required -- to bring the stadium up to minimum specifications.
Whether Louisiana voters vault Duke into political legitimacy or not, the city of New Orleans and the sports community in general will be left with a world-class facility -- thanks to the efforts of the New Orleans Sports Foundation.

COMPANIES
 
The Market Get Jittery Over Maxwell's U.S. Holdings 

Though Robert Maxwell spent his career building a business that spans the globe, 90 percent of the profits of the Maxwell Communication Corporation -- about $352 million -- come from the United States. "The businesses have performed more strongly than Maxwell really had any right to expect," said William Reilly, former president of Maxwell Communication. Still, there is nervousness among investors that Mr. Maxwell paid too much for his American holdings and that his heirs would be forced to sell assets. Interest payments last year were $344.96 million, almost entirely offsetting profits. Last week, David Shaffer was named Maxwell chief executive. Though he has experience in American business, as head of Macmillan since 1990, his appointment did not qualm market jitters over Mr. Maxwell's death. Maxwell share prices fell in London to about $1.20, down almost 50 percent for the week.
 
 
Compaq's New Chief Moves In
 
Eckhard Pfeiffer is moving swiftly to rewire the ailing Compaq Computer Corporation. After just two weeks on the job as Compaq's chief executive, Mr. Mr. Pfeiffer outlined a new business strategy. Costs will be cut and the company will bring out a new line of cheaper PC's. It will also drop the price on some of its notebook computers by 25 percent and set up a new distribution system. Mr. Pfeiffer said he was also putting a new top-management team in place. Wall Street was pleased with Mr. Pfeiffer's remarks. The company's stock (it was in the $50 range in May) gained a little ground. Its shares rose $1.25, to $27.875, on the announcements and closed the week at $26.50.


Another Alliance for I.B.M.
 
Big Blue was once considered aloof. No more. Last summer, the International Business Machines Corporation announced plans to join forces with Apple Computer Company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Germany's Siemens and Japan's NEC. Last week, I.B.M. announced one more. It formed a 10-year pact to jointly design computer chips for PC's with the Intel Corporation. Intel makes the chips that are at the heart of most PC's. The new pact gives I.B.M. the right to buy Intel's chips first. It also allows I.B.M. to modify them. It gives "I.B.M. the flexibility to build things the other guys don't have," said Michael Slater, the publisher of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.


An Industry Running on Fumes
 
The automobile industry's octane rating could use a little boost right now. Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America for October were down 8 percent at the end of October. Business has been so bad that Standard & Poor's issued a credit watch "with negative implications" to creditors of the General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Company.


Can Pepsi Catch Up?
 
When it comes to globalization, no company knows more than the Coca-Cola Company, which gets 80 percent of its profits from abroad. Those profits have been the been the fizz behind Coke's 20 percent annual growth rate over the last five years. For arch-rival Pepsico Inc. -- which outsells Coke in the United States but not elsewhere -- that smarts. So last week Pepsi said it will invest $1 billion in Spain over five years to build plants, fast-food restaurants and distribution system. Is Pepsi trying to be more like Coke? "All companies in the United States are trying to become more like Coke," said David A. Goldman, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.

 
Lockheed's Stock Ploy
 
The Lockheed Corporation said last week it would purchase 6.3 percent of its outstanding shares of common stock. At current prices, that will cost the company $180 million. The announcement came after the company had pared down its debt and won a number of large Pentagon contracts, including one to build the Air Force's next-generation fighter plane. After a tough proxy battle last year with Harold C. Simmons, the Dallas investor, Lockheed's management said it would do more for investors. Last week, it revealed what it would do: Buy them out.


Rating Off at American Express
 
A stellar credit rating is something the American Express Company has rarely been without. But last week, Moody's downgraded about $7 billion of Amex's long-term debt. That was a first. The turmoil at its Shearson Lehman Brothers subsidiary did not help the company. Nor did defaults from its Optima credit card holders. While still investment grade, Amex's borrowing costs are expected to rise slightly from the ratings change.
 
Last week, American Express dropped Ogilvy & Mather, its green-card account ad agency, for Chiat/Day/Mojo in New York.
 
 
Mr. Olasky's Charity Litmus Test
 
Each year, Marvin Olasky, a journalism professor at the University of Texas at Austin, grades corporations on their philanthropy. The worst? Dayton Hudson, one of the most generous corporate contributors in America, got an "F" last week. Dayton Hudson gave money to "groups that lobby for increased government welfare, which increases dependency," he said. Which groups are those? The Children's Defense Fund and the Center for Community Change. Top marks -- a "B plus" -- went to the FMC Corporation. It gave money to the conservative Heritage Foundation, where Mr. Olasky was a resident scholar.
 
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
The Fed Gives It a Try
 
To control the economy, the Fed has two buttons it can push. Last week it pressed them both. First, it lowered the discount rate, the rate it charges member banks to borrow money, to 4 1/2 percent from 5 percent. Then it pulled down the Fed funds rate on overnight loans to 4 3/4 percent from 5 percent. Together, the cuts are designed to add a little pep to the economy. Banks lowered their prime rates to 7 1/2 percent from 8 percent in the aftermath. But some observers remain dubious. "People do not go out and buy a car just because rates are down half a point," said Ezekiel S. Ketchum, of Meridian Bank in Reading, Pa.
 
 
Hope of a Tax Cut?
 
To give the lethargic economy a jolt, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, introduced a bill to cut taxes.

 
The Meaning of Productivity
 
One side of the argument goes like this: Productivity improvement means workers are adding more value to the nation's economy; wages and living standards increase. But the other side says productivity increases when companies shed workers but still sell as many goods; life becomes harsher. So when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that productivity grew 2.4 percent in the third quarter which side of the argument was supported? "I'm going out on a limb," said Allen Sinai, of the Boston Company. "This could be the beginning of the process of an increase in the standard of living."

 
More Gloom for Workers
 
With the economy's engine ignited, but so far failing to lift off, forecasters are skittish. Once they ignored weekly unemployment statistics. Now they ponder them. When the Labor Department said 14,000 people were added to the jobless lists in late October what did it mean? "We're stagnating." said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities.
 
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
A Real Soviet Bang for the Buck
 
With the remnants of the Soviet economy spinning closer to the 'abyss' -- a word used by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last week -- everything is for sale. Desperate for hard currency, the Soviets are willing to sell once-secret Mig jets, miniature nuclear reactors and possibly the Mir space station (it's still in orbit). They are also offering services involving underground nuclear explosions. For between $300 to $1,200 a kilogram, the International Chetco Corporation in Moscow is prepared to vaporize toxic waste in an underground explosion. Scientists, environmentalists and weapons-control experts around the world have lodged loud complaints. But so far the Soviet Union is undeterred. According to Vladimir B. Dmitriev, Chetco's president, "it will be possible to export services."
 
After hesitating for two weeks, the Ukrainian Parliament voted last week to join with Moscow in a new, looser economic union.

 
Opening More Lines to Europe
 
Right now, 57,750 conversations can be carried on simultaneously between the United States and Europe, not enough capacity to avoid delays. Next February, capacity will jump to about 150,000 simultaneous calls, still too little capacity for this burgeoning market. So last week, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced it would lay two new fiber-optic cables between the United States and Europe. That would add enough capacity to handle 300,000 simultaneous conversations and data transfers. The project, which will cost about $580 million and take a year to complete, still must be cleared by the Federal Communications Commission.

 
Slow Growth in the Philippines
 
This has not been a good year for the Philippines. First Mount Pinatubo erupted, causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. Then tropical storm Thelma ravaged the islands that make up the country, killing as many as 5,000 people. Nevertheless, growth is still expected to be positive. Last week, President Corazon Aquino said the official estimate is that the Philippines would grow by just less than 1 percent, compared with 3.6 percent last year. One of the reasons for the slowdown is that thousands of Filipino guest workers living abroad who send their salaries home have traveled back to the Philippines to repair their damaged villages.

HEADLINE: Amid Cuts, California Is Curtailing College Dreams

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8

 BODY:
For 30 years now, Californians have had an implied promise from their state government: a high-quality and low-cost public college education for every resident who wanted it. It was a promise the prosperous fast-growing state seldom had much trouble fulfilling.
But suddenly the state that operates the largest system of higher education in the nation may no longer be able to honor that promise. 
 Under intense pressure from a stagnant economy, all 236 campuses in the state's three public college systems face mounting troubles. The vaunted 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education in California that built it all a generation ago is in jeopardy.
At San Diego State University, where 550 part-time instructors have been let go and 662 classes canceled, more than 1,300 students got none of their requested courses when the semester began. Some have perfected the process known as "crashing," by which they attend classes to which they have not been assigned and beg overloaded professors to admit them. And many are "freeway flying," madly dashing by car between the campus and various junior colleges trying to gain the credits they need to graduate.
Janitorial services have been cut back so sharply at California State University, Northridge, in Los Angeles, that students and professors in the Department of Communicative Disorders regularly pick up brooms and mops to clean the clinic and therapy rooms.
Many professors are typing exams in small type to save paper and using tests that can be electronically graded instead of essays to save time. Budgets for phone calls, copier paper and clerical help have been reduced sharply.
The Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California at Berkeley can no longer afford a receptionist; it keeps its doors locked and a machine takes phone calls. Across the Bay at San Francisco State University, students sit on the floor in many classes.
"We have reached the point where the there is a fundamental mismatch between the Master Plan assignment and our resource base," said Barry Munitz, Chancellor of the 20-campus California State University system. "We are the gatekeepers for socioeconomic mobility in this state. Many of our students work. For them to be out of a campus is to be put out of the system. Suddenly we are eroding the very reason we created the Master Plan in the first place."
For example, Michelle L. McClure, a 21-year-old junior majoring in English at San Diego State, works 30 hours a week delivering packages for Airborne Express, and has only mornings to attend classes. She requested six classes and got only one of them this semester.
"Seniors told me to go to professors' offices and beg," she said. "I took a day off from work, and they were not there." She "crashed" 15 or 20 classes and ultimately got three courses, one in geology, one in history and one in women's studies -- none counting toward her major. "You end up with bizarre classes because that's all that's left," she said.
 
A Notion of Prosperity
 Budget ills afflict state colleges nationally, but nowhere have they taken more urgent form than in California, where the colleges have long been the route to fulfilling the California dream of egalitarian prosperity and where the American dream has reached its broadest realization. Though never a guarantee, it was based on the notion that even the poorest family could send its children to college if they had the brains.
"It's going to be awfully tough for the Legislature because so many people have been telling their children if you stay through high school you can go to college," said Clark Kerr, the former President of the University of California, who was an architect of the 1960 Master Plan. "That is a promise people keep in mind. It is almost a right now."
But now the California colleges find themselves under the conflicting pressures of drastic state-imposed budget cuts and a fast-growing population, demanding more, not less, access. This has posed some tough questions for California's educators and politicians: Shall quality be sacrificed to maintain universal access? Should faculty teach more and do less research? Should student fees vary according to ability to pay? And can the colleges continue to serve as the economic entryway for the ethnic minorities and immigrants who have gravitated to the largest state?
On Oct. 17 in Los Angeles, the current president of the University of California, David P. Gardner, told the regents the system might have to raise admission standards to cut enrollments and that such cuts could stir ethnic tensions because many whites and Asians might have to be refused admission if access for black and Hispanic students was to be maintained.
 
Climbing Enrollment
 The California Postsecondary Education Commission, a state agency that coordinates the activities of the disparate systems, estimates that the state's three systems will add 700,000 students to the 2 million they now enroll and that 37 new campuses will be needed by the year 2005. But the University of California has delayed building its long-promised 10th campus, and plans for other new campuses are now in doubt.
The Master Plan, most of which was passed by the Legislature in 1960, created three interlocking systems and established admission standards.
It gave the University of California the exclusive right to issue doctoral and professional degrees, designated it as the main research university and gave it authority to select from the top 12.5 percent of high school graduates in the state for undergraduate admission. The Cal State system became the main undergraduate teaching system, allowed to select from the top 33.3 percent of students. The California Community College system, a loosely linked archipelago of two-year colleges, was to be open to all for vocational training and to be a stepping stone to the four-year colleges.
If the economy does not pick up, Mr. Kerr foresees a difficult struggle as the Legislature pressures professors to take on heavier teaching loads and students to pay a larger share of the costs of education. "So one of the implications is more student unrest," he said.
Should substantial numbers of students be barred from University of California and the Cal State system, David Mertes, chancellor of the 107-campus California Community College system, fears that his system will be swamped. Already, he said, the junior colleges last year turned away 50,000 students.
 
Problems Were Unseen
 None of these troubles were foreseen as recently as 1987, when the Master Plan was renewed by two special commissions, one appointed by George Deukmejian, the Republican Governor, and the other by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Both commissions assumed the state would continue -- indeed greatly expand -- public higher education.
"We were so optimistic, almost naively so," said Lee R. Kerschner, executive director of the governor's commission, now vice chancellor of academic affairs at the Cal State system. "It was assumed California would fund it because it always had. Governor Deukmejian had just returned a $1 billion surplus to the people. Nobody really asked if we can afford this."
Under Governor Pete Wilson's current budget, the colleges took substantial cuts in state support. Each system responded differently.
The University of California's budget was cut by 1.1 percent. Saying it was determined at all costs to preserve quality, it raised student fees by 40 percent, to $2,274 a year, froze all salaries, planned to cut enrollment by 5,500 over the next few years, and gave early retirement to nearly 3,500 employees, including 672 faculty members.
Harder hit, with a 3.2 percent cut, the Cal State system raised fees by 20 percent, to $936 a year, cut more than 4,000 classes, laid off more than 1,000 faculty members and did not rehire more than 2,000 part-time teachers. Eight of the 20 campuses have closed admissions for the spring semester.
 
Students and Teachers Upset
 These cuts have produced rising student anger, particularly at San Diego State, where enrollment dropped by 1,500 students, or 4 percent, this semester because so many students could not get enough classes. The cuts have proved devastating for many of the 32,951 remaining students, many of whom work and who face spending another semester or two in college because general education classes required for graduation have been full.
The experience has hardly been less painful for professors. "Every teacher knows there will be a lot of people in class who are not on the roll," said Clare Colquitt, an assistant professor of English, whose department was particularly hard hit because part-time teachers were let go. "Most just show up, hoping I'll have pity on them."
The cuts have led to a new student organization, the Student Movement for Education. One of its leaders, Merek Findling, a sophomore psychology major, has been battling with the campus president, Dr. Thomas B. Day, for information on how the decisions on cuts were made and for answers to such questions as why the athletic department suffered much lighter cuts than English and women's studies.
Ethan A. Singer, associate vice president for academic resources, said the cuts were forcing the university to re-evaluate its offerings. The assumption is that the cuts are permanent, he said, and to preserve high-priority general education programs it may be necessary to eliminate entire programs and to lay off probationary tenure faculty.
All this means California's historic commitment to access and quality is in jeopardy. M. Brian Murphy, director of external affairs at San Francisco State University, who directed the legislative commission on the Master Plan renewal, said his group was determined to make California's eligibility standards for higher education into an outright entitlement.
 
'Hostage By the Budget'
 This involved requiring the University of California and Cal State systems to admit as transfer students those who completed two-year programs at the community colleges.
"But the capacity to deliver is held hostage by the budget," Mr. Murphy said.
William B. Baker, vice president for budget and university relations at the University of California, said: "We are at the point where we are just barely able to accept all eligible California citizens who want to come. The Master Plan's admission standards are not law. It is an administrative policy. We very strongly support it. But we would have to make a decision whether or not to comply."
And Maureen DiMarco, secretary of child development and education to Governor Wilson, said: "The primary issue is access. This is a very serious business issue. Unless we are able to educate our work force, our competitive edge will really be damaged."
Access is a key issue facing the Legislature. "If the financial situation does not improve, we really ought to be serious about the issue of access," said Senator Gary K. Hart, chairman of the state Senate's Education Committee, adding that political pressure is growing to force members of the University of California faculty, particularly those no longer doing pioneering research, to teach more. "Restricting admission is an option that needs to be looked at very carefully."

 CORRECTION:
A chart with an article last Sunday about the troubles of the public university systems in California misstated the student-to-faculty ratios and the faculty totals at California State University. For the 1966-67 academic year, the ratio was 16.9 to 1, with 7,779 faculty members; for the 1990-91 year, the ratio was 18.4 to 1, with 15,099 faculty members. These figures are adjusted by the university to convert part-time faculty members to their full-time equivalents. The chart also misstated the growth in the student population for that period. It was 112 percent, not 115 percent.

HEADLINE: Potent New Pest Hits California, Harming Crops

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL CENTRO, Calif., Nov. 9

 BODY:
In 30 years of farming the Imperial Valley, Ben C. Abatti and his brother Tony have fought every kind of natural and economic foe, but nothing like the poinsettia sweet potato whitefly.
Mr. Abatti has just finished plowing under his entire melon crop, turned into pitiful shriveled and rotted fruits by the tiny but voracious creature. And, farm experts say, the misfortune of farmers like Mr. Abatti will soon translate into shortages and higher prices in markets as far away as New York in the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. 
 Already, farmers have plowed under about 95 percent of the fall crop of cantaloupes and honeydew melons in Southern California and adjoining areas of western Arizona and northern Mexico. The region supplies the vast bulk of produce to the nation in the winter months.
 
Fear for Other Crops
 Fears are mounting that the winter crop of lettuce, broccoli and other vegetables will also be devastated. The plants are stunted and farmers plan to delay the harvest, which usually begins in early December.
"This is the first time we've seen a pest that will eat just about anything," said Richard C. Weddle, an entomologist with the Imperial County Agricultural Commission. "This is a first-rate natural disaster."
The culprit is a potent new strain of the sweet potato whitefly, an old foe of farmers. The new strain has been dubbed the poinsettia because it first appeared on poinsettia plants in Florida in 1986. It lays about twice as many eggs as earlier strains and eats five times as much, said Thomas M. Perring, professor of entomology at the University of California at Riverside.
The fly seems almost omnivorous, finding hosts in about 500 plants, not only melons but also cotton, alfalfa, squash, carrots, tomatoes, even ornamental plants and weeds. Asparagus and onions are among the few crops it seems to avoid.
 
Shortage of Melons
 The pest colonizes the undersides of leaves and sucks out their juices. It has thus far proved resistant to all chemical pesticides. Experts are furiously searching for natural predators, but for now have been reduced to trying to halt the fly's spread by having farmers quickly plow their infested fields and sow the few crops it does not attack to interrupt the creature's life cycle.
The most immediate effect on consumers will be a shortage of melons. The wholesale price of a carton of cantaloupes in the Imperial Valley has risen from about $6 to about $20, said Arthur M. Verissimo, chief of the market news branch at the California Department of Food and Agriculture. A carton contains 12 to 18 cantaloupes.
This has already more than doubled retail supermarket prices in parts of the country. The outlook for the winter vegetables is unclear, Mr. Verissimo said, but prices of lettuce and broccoli are expected to soar, too.
But Keith Mayberry, a farm adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension in Holtville, said the advent of cold weather could bring at least some improvement because the insects are sensitive to cold. Thus, he said, later plantings are apt to survive better, meaning steep shortages for Christmas but improved supplies and lower prices in February and March.
If the fly means inconvenience for consumers nationally, it has meant extreme hardship in the Imperial Valley, a wide fertile plain that straddles the Mexican border. Imperial County's 120,000 residents depend mainly on agriculture.
Already, officials tally $85 million in lost revenues from melons alone, not counting business lost to suppliers of cartons, glue and seeds, and to truckers and local retailers. More than 2,500 pickers and packers are out of work; unemployment stands at 20 percent.
"We're working fast and furiously to find a short-term solution," said Stephen Birdsall, the County Agricultural Commissioner. "We have to find something that works or we will be wiped out as an agricultural area."
Clouds of flies have been so thick this fall that it has sometimes been difficult to breathe. The damage is stunning.
At Mr. Abatti's farm, small misshapen fruits lay rotting on the surface. Mr. Abatti showed two visitors a leaf of one of the fallen vines. It was covered with thousands of eggs and nymphs.
 
Tried Every Approved Pesticide
 "At this time we'd be at peak production," he said, adding that he expects to lose about $1.8 million in receipts. "We've been through a lot of battles -- lupers, aphids, crickets, beetles -- but this is one we're not used to."
He tried every approved pesticide, as well as soap, chili pepper and garlic, but nothing worked. He has begun to worry about his vegetable crops now, too. The broccoli, for example, should stand about 18 inches by now but are only 6 to 8 inches, he said.
Imperial and neighboring Riverside Counties have asked Gov. Pete Wilson to declare a state of emergency. He is expected to visit the area next week.
The troubles are only beginning. Already, said Gabriel V. Leyvas, supervisor of cantaloupes for Five Crowns Marketing in Brawley, many farmers are planning to cancel the fall melon crop next year because of the risk.
Experts believe the fly originated in the Middle East, possibly Pakistan, found its way to Florida and ultimately to California. They say it has spread with impunity because it was imported without its natural enemies.
The fly has been detected in small numbers in this area since the summer of 1989, but the number exploded this fall for unknown reasons. The insect spreads easily by wind.
The main question now is whether the infestation can be slowed. The immediate priority of state agricultural officials is to use the coming cold months to interfere with its natural life cycle.
The University of California Cooperative Extension recommends that fields that can be harvested be plowed under within hours of harvest, that cotton be terminated by next July, next fall's melon planting be canceled and other crops delayed. The idea is to deprive the pest of food for the crucial summer months.
But the ultimate solution is finding biological foes of the whitefly, said Tom Bellows, of the University of California at Riverside and a leading specialist in natural means of fighting pests. "U.C. researchers are evaluating the possibility of developing a program to import and test natural enemies against the sweet potato whitefly," he said in a news release from the university.
The fly is vulnerable to certain small wasps. But getting them established in sufficient numbers in time is a daunting task.
"It's almost a plague," said Joseph Colace, owner of Five Crowns Marketing. "We have no means to control them now or to stop them in the near future."

LOS ANGELES
Capital of the Third World.
By David Rieff.
270 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $20.  
 The old Los Angeles soldiers on in such verdant Westside communities as Brentwood, Bel Air and Pacific Palisades. The new Los Angeles toils on in war zones of ethnic vigilance and random armed visitation in Koreatown and Little El Salvador. Ready or not, says David Rieff, the Los Angeles metropolitan area finds itself "an anthology of the world," in transition from the capital of the Sun Belt to the capital of the third world.
By the year 2000, Mr. Rieff notes in "Los Angeles," the city will be less than 40 percent white, a dramatic reversal from the palmy days of the early 1960's. Already Los Angeles has the second largest populations of Filipinos, Koreans, Mexicans and Salvadorans of any city in the world. Adding, in significant numbers, Chinese, Druze, Ethiopians, Indians, Indonesians, Iranians, Pacific Islanders, Pakistanis, Tamils and Vietnamese, Los Angeles is a distinctively cosmopolitan city. Speaking some 82 languages and representing more than 100 ethnic and cultural backgrounds, this multicultural influx has swept aside the barriers that kept Los Angeles white and well-heeled, an "immense, hypertrophied subdivision."
Seeing the city as a preview of the next American century, Mr. Rieff went to Los Angeles from New York City believing that a "new epoch" had begun. "Could anyone seriously imagine that changes of this magnitude would leave the United States as it had been before?"
Mr. Rieff discovered that contemporary Los Angeles is but an engorged replica of the one he knew "in that distant country called the early sixties." The freeways are gridlocked, the water system is imperiled, the cost of housing is beyond mortal reach, the white middle class is in flight to the Northwest.
But he also found the Los Angeles mystique, the "blond ideal of eros, Arcadia, material wealth, and American exceptionalism," going strong -- only now that myth rests on the hordes of new immigrants willing to support "the pleasure dome of solitude and gleaming careers" of the affluent. During his year in Los Angeles, Mr. Rieff grew increasingly disturbed by Westsiders' indifference to the exploitation of "our new fellow countrymen" and its implications for the future of California dreaming. "My questions failed to impress most people I met," he reports.
"When Angelenos did occasionally take a moment to think about what was going on in the city, they tended toward slogans and formulas that were all but guaranteed to inhibit thought, and ranged from the harmless bromides of self-esteem and the celebration of diversity, to rosy economic scenarios of the type the boosters were peddling, to various leftist or nativist versions of an impending class or race war collectively known as the Blade Runner scenario."
In general, Mr. Rieff looks askance at sunny folk memories of assimilation and vatic pieties of multiculturalism; he argues that the rapidly expanding third-world population poses formidable, perhaps insuperable, problems not only for Los Angeles but for a country no longer sure about its identity or sanguine about its future.
"Los Angeles" is an important study marred by Mr. Rieff's occasional facile prose and conceptual anarchy. At once too ambitious and not ambitious enough, the book is all over the map yet neglects the one locale that matters most, the new Los Angeles. Although he professes to find on the Westside "none of the sharpness . . . that tang which made days I spent in Asian or Hispanic L.A. so vivid, peculiar, and unsettling," it is precisely the Westside that he brings into sharp, scathing focus; the Los Angeles of the third world remains an enigma.
In his fine first book, "Going to Miami," Mr. Rieff rendered that city in vivid, peculiar and even unsettling fashion. He anchored his perceptions in the drama of the Cuban-American community, turning a "personal obsession" into a diverting portrait of a city in the throes of demographic redefinition. In "Los Angeles," Mr. Rieff anchors his perceptions in himself, his reading, his bus riding and his table talk; as a result, the book lacks the heft of his "obsessive theme." Still, Mr. Rieff asks the right questions, and his account of Los Angeles is, more often than not, intrepid and provocative. "Going to Miami" was the better book; "Los Angeles" is the more important one. Mr. Rieff's sensibility is unerring in its assessment of what is important to this country's future. It now is time, he says, for us to stop averting our eyes as "our new fellow countrymen" introduce us to the travails of global history. Demography, as Los Angeles is finding out, is now destiny.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Arthur Miller's 'Price' Is Revived in Norwalk

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
AMONG the plays of Arthur Miller "The Price" (1968) holds a nebulous place, nowhere near the summit or the nadir of his considerable oeuvre, yet not steadily ensconced midway either. Every now and again the play resurfaces in one regional theater or another, not as evidence of endurance, but almost as if in search of reappraisal, real status and critical consensus.
No one is going to pretend that the Rainbow Theater production in Norwalk will establish a niche for "The Price" once and for all. A revival scheduled for May by the Roundabout Theater, now situated on Broadway, with Eli Wallach as star and John Tillinger as director, will provide yet another chance. 
 But in its modest way, the Rainbow Theater production makes a clear and persuasive case for the value of a play that is precisely about values misguidedly based upon wanting and winning. The play investigates relationships within a family, which is to say it is also necessarily about the gnawing power of animosity, the perverse need to keep the grudges going, to not let go.
Just when it looks as though two brothers will clear the air of recriminations, following 16 years of estrangement after the death of their father, they don't, for revelations breed rationalizations. Victor is a police officer with a sense of martyrdom and moral superiority, and with no money; Walter is a rich, successful and "important" doctor who has fulfilled his own ambitions and worked out his own neurotic success drive.
Although Mr. Miller has written that "The Price" is his most "specific" play, in that it ostensibly is more concerned with characterization than abstract or cosmic truths, a Miller play is not a Miller play without a social context, and its impact is derived from one's awareness of the perpetuity -- the continued or suddenly new relevance -- of that context. In the best of Miller's work perception implies prophecy.
When Victor refers to "grass covered with men" during the Depression, the image has a shuddering contemporary resonance. Victor sacrificed the promise of a career in order to care for their father; Walter, ostensibly, abandoned him. What then is Walter's "moral debt"? The damage wrought by the weak, demanding father, himself victimized by false values, recalls the dramatic fallout suffered by the sons of Willie Loman and Joe Keller.
The brothers' dizzying confrontation boils over in an absorbing second act that gives the play unanswerable arguments and dramatic complexity. Mr. Miller conceived "The Price" to be performed in one act, but that is seldom followed; instead, an interval comes at the point of Walter's arrival. Clearly, each brother's chosen life has cost him dearly -- and back and forth as they go, no one is fully vindicated.
With characteristic intertwining of morality and materialism, Mr. Miller's title is multilevel. On the surface, it has to do with how much an attic full of furniture, now to be disposed of, will command. And to establish that price, a wonderful 89-year-old character, Gregory Solomon, a furniture dealer and appraiser, takes over, in a vein of warm comic writing not normally associated with Mr. Miller.
The actor playing Gregory Solomon is expected to give the play's standout, scene-stealing performance, and so why should it be different in the Rainbow production? Stefan Schnabel, the theater's co-founder, is spreading wisdom and cheer, though more studiedly so, with less whimsy than impishness than the role generally invites. Here is a more commanding Solomon than one usually encounters, though he's every bit as shifty. The character is a former vaudevillian and acrobat, but Mr. Schnabel gives the impression that maybe he took a detour to other boards, doing a little Shakespeare on the side.
Given the narrow, constricted and peculiar playing area -- the company's next production is to take place in a new theater -- the glorious, massive clutter intended as the play's actual and symbolic background is hardly imaginable. Under Ugo N. Toppo's mountingly good direction, the performances of Ed Simone (Walter, a bit too watery at first) and Kevin Donnelly (Victor) rise to confrontational heights. And the bright, reactive skill with which Linda Meleck plays Esther, Victor's complaining but strong wife, tempers a character that is as much dramatically unsatisfying as she is personally dissatisfied. It appears that Miller has been so accustomed to writing subservient roles for women who honor or hound their husbands, that he overlooked the possibilities for the accomplished, intelligent Esther to find her own marketable skill, so she could spend less time squawking -- and shopping.
Still, as Esther -- the symbolism in the characters' names is a bit much -- searches for "some crazy kind of forgiveness," Victor and Walter rehash the misunderstandings of a lifetime. And Solomon has the last laugh in a theatrically rich curtain scene.
Throughout, Mr. Miller proves a master builder of tension and conflict, never disregarding how the stuff of irreconcileable family discord is determined by the pull of economic necessity -- or panic. "The Price" is a throwback to strong, well-crafted middle-class plays that hardly come round anymore. And that just might be the play's rightful identity after all. It'll just have to keep coming around.
"The Price," at Norwalk Technical College, Richards Avenue. 831-0411. Remaining performances Friday and Saturday at 8.

HEADLINE: Oasis on I-95 Lures Truckers With Hot Coffee and Warm Smiles

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
THE other day at the Mayflower Diner in Milford, Kenny Perkins was mopping the last dollop of chili out of a wide ceramic bowl with a piece of bread while discussing the travails of driving a two-ton diesel truck across the southern Connecticut stretch of Interstate 95. Though he had never received a ticket anywhere, he said, he knew of truckers who had passed through the state and been fined for barely violating weight restrictions and for not tying down their portable refrigerators.
"I don't want to offend anybody or anything," said Mr. Perkins, who wore a blue flannel shirt, jeans and a baseball cap. "But out on the road Connecticut's known as a communist state. The police are too strict here. They harass us and don't make us feel very welcome. They've got no respect for us, plain and simple." 
 As he spoke, Donna Alturi, a waitress, worked in unbroken movements, sweeping past the steady flow of customers, gently setting down plates and saucers on Formica-topped tables, then swirling around to reach for the coffee pot.
"I'll bet you could use a refill," she said to Mr. Perkins.
"There you go, reading my mind again," he replied.
Mr. Perkins, who delivers meat to distributors in the Northeast for Iowa beef processors, added that he stopped at the diner every time he drove through the state, because the food was good and the service was friendly.
"It's sure a nice change from out there," he said, nodding toward Interstate 95.
Established 53 years ago as the first of its kind in Connecticut, the Mayflower Diner and Truck Stop has always aimed to offer truck drivers a little respite from the pressures of the highway, said its owner, Howard Merk. The business originally opened on Route 1 in Mianus, in a two-story Colonial that contained bunk beds, a small restaurant and reading room where truckers could relax and listen to the radio. The truckers' village moved to Old Gate Lane off Exit 40 in Milford in the early 1960's to accommodate the flow of drivers along the newly built highway.
With its orange neon signs that tower above the road and the streamlined diner, the Mayflower has become one of the hallmarks of the state's transportation history, Mr. Merk said. Within the 16-acre complex, which is open 24 hours a day, truckers can park and sleep in their cabs or in a 96-room motel, shop at a store that stocks everything from aspirin to hiking boots and truck lights, get service and fuel their trucks and even purchase a new one from the Kenworth Truck sales office.
But the hub of the complex is the chrome-and-Formica beanery, built in 1963 from two old diners that were welded together and later sided with corrugated metal to look like a truck trailer. Inside, window booths are dressed with silk flowers, and some have telephones. There are video games near the entrance, a coffee station and muffin bar for take-out orders and a glass gift cabinet with pens, mugs and brooches that read "I Love Jesus."
On a recent afternoon, drivers from Ohio, Florida, Tennessee and New York sat at the counter on chrome stools that swiveled and ate corned beef and cabbage served with boiled potatoes and Jell-O. Other specials on that day's menu included chicken-fried steak with gravy, and liver and onions "fried the way you like it." Songs by the Captain and Tennile and James Taylor played over the speaker system. "What'll it be, hon?" Marie Meselli, a waitress, asked Warren Wright, an owner-operator from Long Island, whose oil-stained baseball cap read "Operation Desert Storm." "I have a yellow cake with coconut frosting and a carrot cake that's mighty good," she said.
Mr. Wright politely declined the offer but asked for a refill of coffee. Unlike Mr. Perkins, he said he had no problems with Connecticut highways.
"Come on, already," he said. "I'm from New York!"
He started driving a truck 34 years ago, he said, and has hauled everything from boats to rocks to gasoline, "and I never did get rich on any of them." Back in the late 50's truck stops like the Mayflower were rare, Mr. Wright said, and if a driver happened to stumble across one, "it was always some hole in the wall with fuel."
 
Unfriendly World
 But he said there was more camaraderie in those days among drivers, who drove in convoys and ate and socialized together. Deregulation and hard economic times have changed all that, he said, pausing to take a sip of coffee.
"Then again, I doubt the world in general is as friendly as it used to be," he said. "And TV has a lot to do with it."
Behind the diner, in a small prefabricated building, lies Mr. Merk's office. Decorated with mementoes of his travels, like the ebony sculpture of a Masai warrior that he brought home from Africa, the office also contains awards and certificates that document his 50 years of service to the truck stop business.
Mr. Merk, 78 years old, said he started out as a pharmacist before buying his first gas station on Byram Road in Greenwich in the early 1940's. Soon after, he heard that the manager of the nearby Mayflower Truck Station in Mianus had been called to serve in World War II, leaving the property abandoned.
The Mobil Oil Company had opened the station in 1938, labeling it the first truck stop in the East, according to a company brochure from that period. As part of its service the Mayflower offered customers diesel fuel, wide driveways, sleeping quarters, showers, a recreation room, coffee and food described as home cooked.
Mr. Merk, who lives in Woodbridge, said he began leasing the property in 1941 and soon after sold the Byram Road gas station. In 1949 he purchased the Mayflower name from Mobil and moved the truck stop to Route 1 in Orange, where it remained until 1963. He later bought 16 acres of what was then a pine forest on Old Gate Lane in Milford for $10,000 an acre. In the early 1960's, Mr. Merk said, he had it cleared and moved the truck stop there, speculating that the newly constructed Interstate 95 would be a boon to business.
 
'All Nice Guys'
 Fifty years after he first set eyes on the Mayflower sign, Mr. Merk, who wears a cowboy hat and often surveys the grounds of his operation from a black Lincoln Town Car, said he remained a spokesman and defender of truck drivers, whom he called "gentlemen of the road."
"Truckers are a different breed of cat," said Mr. Merk. "You've got people who've got degrees in just about everything, but just like the open road. Then you've got the middle guys, who've worked for the same company for 30 to 40 years, all nice guys. Then you've got the guy who's barely getting by, and he's on the stuff and drinking and having some real serious problems."
He added that compared to a few years back, drug and alcohol abuse among truckers has declined dramatically.
For the operator of a large truck stop, he said, it helps to know the lingo of the gear jammer. For instance, drivers who haul bananas, oranges and apples are known as fruit jockeys, and those who carry mattresses are called bedbugs. All the drivers like to be greeted with "Hey, good buddy," he said. "That'll always make a trucker feel at home."
In recent years the Mayflower has served as a movie set for the James Bond film "License to Kill" and "Jacknife," with Robert De Niro. "I saw that one in a motel room in Italy," said Mr. Merk.
And the Mayflower has had its share of true drama, he said. Three years ago, Mr. Merk said, he got a call from an F.B.I. agent who said the agency had been tracing a Colombian cocaine smuggler who was on his way to meet a contact at the diner. Before the man arrived, five agents staked out the parking lot and diner, he said, with one agent posing as a 90-year-old man. When the drug dealer walked in the door, "they all whipped into action," Mr. Merk said. "And boy, did that guy have a rude awakening."
 
First Time in a Truck
 But mostly, he said, the Mayflower Diner is simply a good spot for low-key banter or snappy repartee. At a window booth Robert Seagroves of Chattanooga, Tenn., and a friend, Laura Jacoby of Phillipsburg, N.J., sat next to each other eating bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches and french fries. A driver for Nobel Trucking Company in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Seagroves said he delivered some steel rails to a construction company in Wallingford and was awaiting word on his next assignment.
The couple said they had met earlier that week in a bar in Phillipsburg. Ms. Jacoby said she'd never ridden in a diesel truck before and thought the experience would be fun. "It's really neat when they try to park," she said.
Mr. Seagroves said that if he could, he would avoid driving north of the Mason Dixon Line.
"It's a speedway up here," he said. "Which is O.K. if people here knew how to drive. You all seem to have this crazy notion that us truckers are driving Toyotas or something."
In a corner booth Robert Brown was talking on the telephone to his 14-year-old grandson in Ohio, telling the boy he would not be home until the following Saturday. "His father's not around, so I have to watch over him," Mr. Brown said as he hung up the phone.
Mr. Brown, who said he had been stopping at the Mayflower for more than 10 years, was on his way to Warren, Mich., after returning from New Haven, where he went to pick up some old railroad ties. Unlike many truck drivers, who spend weeks away from their families, he said he was lucky, because he got to see his daughter and grandson almost every weekend.
After placing a tip on the table, he walked to the cash register, where Barbara Stowe, an assistant manager, was rearranging the candy shelf. Mr. Brown slapped his check on the counter and helped himself to a toothpick.
"Well, it looks like I'll see ya next time around," he said to Ms. Stowe. "Probably sooner than later."
"Whenever," she said. "We'll be here when you get here. Our lights are always on, and our door is always open."

Mr. Olsen Hangs On . . .

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Kenneth H. Olsen, the 65-year-old president and founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, is under the gun these days. His company, the nation's second-largest computer maker after the International Business Machines Corporation, is struggling to regain a strong footing during difficult economic times.
Mr. Olsen has faced a series of financial and organizational crises during Digital's 34-year history and each time he has pulled the company out, stronger than before. But analysts say this time is different: he has never had to initiate massive layoffs and cutbacks as he is doing now. 
 In a recent interview from the company's headquarters in Maynard, Mass., Mr. Olsen admitted that the current struggles are painful -- they have cost Digital more than 11,000 employees and $1.6 billion in restructuring charges -- but insisted that his enthusiasm has not waned. "There's an awful lot to learn in times of recession," he said. "When things are going well, you really have no idea what you are doing right and doing wrong."
Mr. Olsen also admitted that with Digital's stock languishing under book value for much of the past year, it was time to think about paying a dividend to shareholders, something the company has never done.
"We aren't doing great in profits but we have a positive cash flow, which in time of a serious recession is an accomplishment," he said. Does this mean the company is going to announce a dividend? "Oh no, I'm talking about sometime in the future."
About his own future, Mr. Olsen is even more hazy. He refuses to anoint a successor, calling it "the kiss of death" for that individual, a view he repeated at the company's annual meeting last week. "What we do do is keep overworking people and see who survives," he explained.
Already a business legend, Mr. Olsen said he would not accept praise if he were to turn Digital around yet again. "There's only one measure of success and that is, five years after I'm gone, how is the company doing," he said. "I will accept no accolades until five years after I'm gone. I may avoid that by not going."

HEADLINE: Focus: Sacramento, Calif.;
A Transit-Oriented Approach to Suburbia

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, CALIF.

 BODY:
FOUR busloads of California city plan ners about 180 of them -- recently traveled to a flat, windy plain 11 miles south of this city to tour Laguna West, which has been touted as the next evolutionary stage of the American suburb.
While home building has just started at the 1,000-acre subdivision, the planners could see the outlines: a designated site for a transit station, surrounded by land soon to be filled with stores, commercial buildings and a day-care center, all within walking distance of about 3,400 planned homes . 
 Laguna West was created by a novel coalition of developers, government officials and nontraditional planners. It is a pilot project to see whether home buyers will accept a new idea of suburbia, intended to encourage pedestrian movement, social interchange and a sense of place more typical of traditional cities than of postwar suburbs.
Much is riding on the success of what local planners call "transit-oriented developments." County planners are trying to control growth in an exploding region; environmentalists are trying to concentrate growth in small areas in an effort to prevent sprawl and preserve open space. And home builders are seeking a politically acceptable formula at a time of growing antidevelopment feeling.
In large part, Laguna West embodies ideas of Peter Calthorpe, a 42-year-old London-born architect and planner who grew up in Palo Alto and saw that city's quick growth in the 60's. He has won recognition for his elegant plans, which echo the 19th-century Beaux-Arts movement, and his critiques of suburban life.
Mr. Calthorpe, who calls himself a reviver rather than an originator of ideas and "an ecologist first and a designer second," has his own firm, Calthorpe Associates, in San Francisco. He says he is "cynical about architecture purely as a formal exercise outside of culture and economic conditions."
He is applying a similar integration of transit, housing and commercial buildings in the 140-acre South Brentwood Village project in Brentwood, 25 miles northeast of Oakland, and at the 1,800-acre Dry Creek Ranch subdivision, 10 miles north of Sacramento.
Mr. Calthorpe has been particularly critical of suburbia as a car-oriented environment that discourages human interaction. In a 1988 essay in "Pedestrian Pocket Book: A New Suburban Design Strategy" (Princeton Architectural Press, $9.95), he says that a "profound mismatch" between the suburbia of the last 40 years and the needs of current society "is generating traffic congestion, a dearth of affordable and appropriate housing, environmental stress, a loss of open space and life styles that burden working families and isolate the elderly and singles living alone."
He says he especially dislikes suburbia's tangle of spaghetti-like streets and cul-de-sacs that lack orientation and circulate poorly. Much of the impetus behind transit-oriented developments, or "pedestrian pockets," as he calls them, is to get people out of their cars, at least those who want to. Transportation engineers say suburban households typically generate 10 automobile trips daily.
"IN our time," Mr. Calthorpe said in an interview, "housing production occurs on a mass scale, so we must work with that." His ideas, he added, "are not for a small elite."
In the pedestrian pockets concept, a rational street system replaces the "spaghetti." Often, streets converge on a neighborhood center, including a transit station. The center offers a supermarket and other neighborhood-oriented stores and services.
Mr. Calthorpe's idea of community revives some traditional, if neglected, ideas in home design, as well. Front yards become shallow as houses are pushed forward to line the street; in Laguna West, each house is to have two trees -- there will be 20 species of disease- and drought-resistant trees, one species to each block. This will eventually provide a continuous canopy of shade under Sacramento's relentless sun.
Front porches on at least half the houses will provide a public face to private housing. The streets themselves are narrow to slow down traffic and are punctuated with "tree wells" -- concrete-walled planters -- that protrude two or three feet into the line of traffic and serve as parking dividers.
Garages, which typically bulge forward in recent suburban homes, are pushed to the side of the house, well behind the front facade, or can be entered through back alleys in some cases. Home buyers also have the option of buying rental units or so-called "granny flats" atop garages. Mr. Calthorpe says the strategy provides another type of affordable housing while counteracting the insularity of suburban life.
Instead of cul-de-sacs, Mr. Calthorpe provides through-streets, sometimes creating urban centers where diagonal streets meet.
"The goal is to provide multiple pathways that lead to the same place," he said. "The notion of a center is reinforced by the formal pattern."
Phil Angelides, president of River West Development of Sacramento and one of three partners in the Laguna West land development, hired Mr. Calthorpe in 1989 after hearing him speak. Shortly after that Mr. Angelides scrapped the original plan for Laguna West, which had already completed a lengthy approval process, and started anew.
Mr. Angelides, who was a housing advocate in the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown in the 1970's, contends that he could have readily sold homes in a conventional subdivision.
"There was no economic incentive for us to change the plan," he said. "But we wanted to do the right thing."
The final plan of Laguna West is unusual in its mix of housing, from three-to-an-acre custom homes perched on the waterfront to 30-to-an-acre apartments. Prices for production housing are to range from $135,000 to $280,000, while homes on custom lots may cost up to $700,000.
In October 1990, Mr. Calthorpe was hired by Kaufman & Broad of Northern California, an affiliate of one of California's largest home builders, and surrounding landowners to design the Dry Creek project. His ideas have achieved a sort of semi-official status with Sacramento County officials, who are rewriting the county's general plan using his ideas as guides.
"PEOPLE here do not want Sacramento County to be like L.A. or San Jose," that is, a limitless sprawl, said Thomas Truskowski, a senior planner for the county. "We needed to abandon the business-as-usual approach to home building. We are trying to bring together those places that we use the most: the places where we shop, where we work and where we recreate."
Not all people find the pedestrian-pocket concept convincing. Some shopping center developers and merchants, in particular, seem unwilling to depart from the successful L-shaped shopping center in favor of buildings lining miniature boulevards.
Local home builders are also hesitant to endorse the transit-oriented development concept.
"The Calthorpe approach is untested," said Kim Dellinger, a lobbyist for the Building Industry Association of Superior, Calif., a home builders' trade group. "For the home builder, it is a big risk."
Mr. Calthorpe, however, said homeowners bought into existing suburbia because they had no choice. The old subdivisions, he said, "were a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Mr. Angelides, the home builder, said he believes that the market, not ideology, will have the last word.
"The risk is genuine," he said. "If Laguna West sells, all the home builders will want to build similar projects." But if the concept fails to attract buyers, he added, "they will become gun-shy."

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
A Transit-Oriented Approach to Suburbia

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, CALIF.

 BODY:
Four busloads of California city planners about 180 of them -- recently traveled to a flat, windy plain 11 miles south of this city to tour Laguna West, which has been touted as the next evolutionary stage of the American suburb.
While home building has just started at the 1,000-acre subdivision, the planners could see the outlines: a designated site for a transit station, surrounded by land soon to be filled with stores, commercial buildings and a day-care center, all within walking distance of about 3,400 planned homes . 
 Laguna West was created by a novel coalition of developers, government officials and nontraditional planners. It is a pilot project to see whether home buyers will accept a new idea of suburbia, intended to encourage pedestrian movement, social interchange and a sense of place more typical of traditional cities than of postwar suburbs.
Much is riding on the success of what local planners call "transit-oriented developments." County planners are trying to control growth in an exploding region; environmentalists are trying to concentrate growth in small areas in an effort to prevent sprawl and preserve open space. And home builders are seeking a politically acceptable formula at a time of growing antidevelopment feeling.
In large part, Laguna West embodies ideas of Peter Calthorpe, a 42-year-old London-born architect and planner who grew up in Palo Alto and saw that city's quick growth in the 60's. He has won recognition for his elegant plans, which echo the 19th-century Beaux-Arts movement, and his critiques of suburban life.
Mr. Calthorpe, who calls himself a reviver rather than an originator of ideas and "an ecologist first and a designer second," has his own firm, Calthorpe Associates, in San Francisco. He says he is "cynical about architecture purely as a formal exercise outside of culture and economic conditions."
He is applying a similar integration of transit, housing and commercial buildings in the 140-acre South Brentwood Village project in Brentwood, 25 miles northeast of Oakland, and at the 1,800-acre Dry Creek Ranch subdivision, 10 miles north of Sacramento.
Mr. Calthorpe has been particularly critical of suburbia as a car-oriented environment that discourages human interaction. In a 1988 essay in "Pedestrian Pocket Book: A New Suburban Design Strategy" (Princeton Architectural Press, $9.95), he says that a "profound mismatch" between the suburbia of the last 40 years and the needs of current society "is generating traffic congestion, a dearth of affordable and appropriate housing, environmental stress, a loss of open space and life styles that burden working families and isolate the elderly and singles living alone."
He says he especially dislikes suburbia's tangle of spaghetti-like streets and cul-de-sacs that lack orientation and circulate poorly. Much of the impetus behind transit-oriented developments, or "pedestrian pockets," as he calls them, is to get people out of their cars, at least those who want to. Transportation engineers say suburban households typically generate 10 automobile trips daily.
"In our time," Mr. Calthorpe said in an interview, "housing production occurs on a mass scale, so we must work with that." His ideas, he added, "are not for a small elite."
In the pedestrian pockets concept, a rational street system replaces the "spaghetti." Often, streets converge on a neighborhood center, including a transit station. The center offers a supermarket and other neighborhood-oriented stores and services.
Mr. Calthorpe's idea of community revives some traditional, if neglected, ideas in home design, as well. Front yards become shallow as houses are pushed forward to line the street; in Laguna West, each house is to have two trees -- there will be 20 species of disease- and drought-resistant trees, one species to each block. This will eventually provide a continuous canopy of shade under Sacramento's relentless sun.
Front porches on at least half the houses will provide a public face to private housing. The streets themselves are narrow to slow down traffic and are punctuated with "tree wells" -- concrete-walled planters -- that protrude two or three feet into the line of traffic and serve as parking dividers.
Garages, which typically bulge forward in recent suburban homes, are pushed to the side of the house, well behind the front facade, or can be entered through back alleys in some cases. Home buyers also have the option of buying rental units or so-called "granny flats" atop garages. Mr. Calthorpe says the strategy provides another type of affordable housing while counteracting the insularity of suburban life.
Instead of cul-de-sacs, Mr. Calthorpe provides through-streets, sometimes creating urban centers where diagonal streets meet.
"The goal is to provide multiple pathways that lead to the same place," he said. "The notion of a center is reinforced by the formal pattern."
Phil Angelides, president of River West Development of Sacramento and one of three partners in the Laguna West land development, hired Mr. Calthorpe in 1989 after hearing him speak. Shortly after that Mr. Angelides scrapped the original plan for Laguna West, which had already completed a lengthy approval process, and started anew.
Mr. Angelides, who was a housing advocate in the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown in the 1970's, contends that he could have readily sold homes in a conventional subdivision.
"There was no economic incentive for us to change the plan," he said. "But we wanted to do the right thing."
The final plan of Laguna West is unusual in its mix of housing, from three-to-an-acre custom homes perched on the waterfront to 30-to-an-acre apartments. Prices for production housing are to range from $135,000 to $280,000, while homes on custom lots may cost up to $700,000.
In October 1990, Mr. Calthorpe was hired by Kaufman & Broad of Northern California, an affiliate of one of California's largest home builders, and surrounding landowners to design the Dry Creek project. His ideas have achieved a sort of semi-official status with Sacramento County officials, who are rewriting the county's general plan using his ideas as guides.
"People here do not want Sacramento County to be like L.A. or San Jose," that is, a limitless sprawl, said Thomas Truskowski, a senior planner for the county. "We needed to abandon the business-as-usual approach to home building. We are trying to bring together those places that we use the most: the places where we shop, where we work and where we recreate."
Not all people find the pedestrian-pocket concept convincing. Some shopping center developers and merchants, in particular, seem unwilling to depart from the successful L-shaped shopping center in favor of buildings lining miniature boulevards.
Local home builders are also hesitant to endorse the transit-oriented development concept.
"The Calthorpe approach is untested," said Kim Dellinger, a lobbyist for the Building Industry Association of Superior, Calif., a home builders' trade group. "For the home builder, it is a big risk."
Mr. Calthorpe, however, said homeowners bought into existing suburbia because they had no choice. The old subdivisions, he said, "were a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Mr. Angelides, the home builder, said he believes that the market, not ideology, will have the last word.
"The risk is genuine," he said. "If Laguna West sells, all the home builders will want to build similar projects." But if the concept fails to attract buyers, he added, "they will become gun-shy."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Manalapan

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
GROWTH is a touchy issue in the 31.2-square-mile Township of Manalapan. Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, its population soared by 41.2 percent and developers recently sued the town successfully for the right to build 3,400 high-density housing units in the sparsely populated southern section, which will almost double the township's current 4,000 housing units.
"The recession has held them up," said Mayor Lorraine Kulick, "but when these projects come in, they will change the whole township. When I moved in 27 years ago, the old-time residents didn't like the new developments. Now, even two-year residents say, 'Stop development.' " 
 Besides slowing the pace of building, the recession also has depressed housing prices, with some down by 30 percent, said Linda Trott, president of ERA-Trott Realty on Route 9.
Most one-family houses have four bedrooms and are on a third to half an acre, she said. Prices range upward from about $170,000 for some 1,800-square-foot, four-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath houses on Old Queens Boulevard or Kipling Way in the northwestern section of town. At the $650,000 level are five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot center-hall colonials on two acres on Stonebridge Court and Shira Lane at the southern end of town.
One of the larger developments is the 25-year-old, 685-home Monmouth Heights off Route 9. Deeds obligate buyers to join the Monmouth Heights Community Association, which maintains an olympic-sized swimming pool, a kiddy pool, two tennis courts and a volleyball court on Ryan Road. Annual association dues are $185.
Three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath colonials and ranches in Monmouth Heights are priced from $185,000 to $200,000. Four-bedroom houses are $15,000 to $25,000 more.
The Covered Bridge retirement community off Route 9 has 1,831 one- and two-bedroom condominium apartments. To buy there, at least one spouse must be 62 or older. One-bedroom units sell for $50,000 to $55,000; two bedrooms go for about $58,000, with ranch-style end units fetching up to about $115,000.
The two other major condominium developments are Oak Knolls, off Longwood Drive, and Southfield, off Symmes Road. There are 266 completed units in Oak Knolls, which eventually will have 330. New units range from $110,000 for a two-bedroom town house with no basement to $130,000 for some three-bedrooms with basements. Resales go for $115,000 to $125,000 for two-bedrooms and about $10,000 more for three-bedrooms. Prices at Southfield start at $130,000 for two-bedrooms and go to $150,000 for some three-bedroom town houses.
MRS. TROTT said it is hard to find rentals in Manalapan. Covered Bridge condominiums rent for $600 to $650 for one bedroom and $700 to $750 for two. Oak Knolls condominiums rent for $900 to $950 for two bedrooms and about $50 more for three.
Howard P. and Pamela K. Dorman moved to the Monmouth County township in 1986. Like many others, they did so to escape the congestion of northern New Jersey.
"We lived in an apartment in Teaneck and were looking to expand our family," said Mr. Dorman. "We had cousins and friends in Manalapan and found that the properties were larger and the housing more affordable."
They bought a four-bedroom colonial on Saupe Drive for $250,000. Mr. Dorman says their boys, Neil, 11, David, 5, and Jeffrey, 2, all have friends on the block.
Mr. Dorman, a partner in an accounting firm in Union, is, like many other local fathers, a volunteer coach in the Manalapan recreation program, which provides baseball, basketball and soccer teams for more than 1,200 children 5 to 18 years old.
Manalapan (pronounced man-AL-a-p'n), which means "land that produces good bread" in the Leni Lenape language, became a farming community when the first English, Dutch and Scottish settlers arrived late in the 17th century.
Among the earliest was John Reid, Surveyor General of the English Province of New Jersey, who bought large tracts from the Indian sachems Pyahekan and Wilgruylas in 1686. Reid deeded most of what is now Manalapan to his son-in-law John Anderson and his grandson John Anderson Jr.
In 1685, three men from nearby Shrewsbury -- Alexander Brown, Samuel Dennes and Thomas Hewett -- bought 3,000 acres from the Indians, subdivided it into more than two dozen farmsteads and sold them off.
Among the attractions for the 17th-century settlers was the abundance of streams and rivers, which were used to power grist, lumber and fulling mills.
Best-known of Manalapan's many historic buildings is the Old Tennent Church on Tennent Road. The Georgian-style 1751 cedar-clad church has a cemetery that dates to 1731, when an earlier church stood on the site. The Rev. John Tennent and his brother, the Rev. William Tennent Jr. were pastors of the churches from 1730 to 1777.
During the Revolution, nearly 30,000 British and Colonial troops fought the Battle of Monmouth on an area that straddles the current Manalapan-Freehold border. Although a clear victor was never established, official records indicate that about 500 men, three-fifths of them British, died in the battle. In 1978, the state bought 1,520 acres of farmland and opened Monmouth Battlefield State Park, 80 percent of which is in Manalapan.
The only other major park is the 93.5-acre Manalapan Recreation Center on the Freehold-Englishtown Road. It has three baseball diamonds, six soccer fields, six basketball courts, a fitness trail, six tennis courts, a roller-hockey rink and playgrounds.
Residents shop at two major supermarkets, at the 22-store Manalapan Mall on Route 9 and at several strip shopping centers on Routes 9 and 33. The town also has three large farm stores and the Englishtown Auction, a giant flea market established in 1929 as a farmer's auction market, on the Freehold-Englishtown Road.
AMONG the well-known restaurants are JJ's on Route 33 and the Battleground Country Club, which serve continental food. On Route 9 are Japantown, Hunan Gourmet and Jesse and David's, a kosher deli.
Children attend the four elementary schools and one middle school in the 4,150-student, k-8 Manalapan-Englishtown Regional School District. Superintendent of Schools Joseph F. Scozzari says that the schools use a whole-language approach, in which reading is taught within the framework of other disciplines, rather than on its own. He also said that the schools try to teach children how to learn and how to work in groups.
Manalapan's growth has brought class sizes to 30, rather than the 22 Mr. Scozzari considers ideal. A new state-of-the-art middle school, with fiber-optic wiring for computer networking, scheduled to be completed in July, is expected to ease some of the overcrowding.
Manalapan High School belongs to the Freehold Regional High School District, which includes four other schools and eight municipalities. The principal, Robert F. Breuche, says the regional approach lets the schools share services and programs and negotiate better purchases with vendors. It also lets them make specialized learning centers available to all students.
Manalapan High provides the science and engineering learning center; other schools have centers for international studies, computer sciences, business, performing arts and humanities.
Mr. Breuche says that 89 percent of Manalapan High School graduates go on to higher education. The school offers advanced placement courses in English, American history, calculus, physics, chemistry and biology.
Manalapan is home to the Monmouth County Library on Symmes Drive. Besides its extensive collection of books and films, the library also serves as a social center, sponsoring lectures, concerts, arts and crafts and movies.

HEADLINE: For St. John's: Tricentennial and Repairs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
IN a corner of Getty Square here, in the crowded downtown area that has its share of drug problems, homelessness and other ills, there is a quiet place that remains unruffled by the passage of time, despite centuries of sometimes turbulent changes that have taken place outside its gates.
In the churchyard of St. John's Episcopal Church one recent morning, vendors brought fall fruits and vegetables to sell at a farmer's market. Passers-by strolled through the open gates, some to buy homemade jams and jellies or perhaps a bag of fresh-picked apples, and others merely to savor a few moments away from the jostling of the crowds on the street. 
 The oldest house of worship in Yonkers was founded in 1693 on the shores of the Hudson River as a parish of the Church of England. Its rectors have witnessed the Revolutionary War, the growth of a shipping port in the city's harbor, the development of the railroad and the industrialization of the area.
Over the years, as Yonkers flourished, so did the church, counting among its many parishioners during the late 19th century some of the wealthiest industrialists in the Northeast.
And in the middle of this century, when numerous city merchants left to set up new businesses in shopping centers away from the deteriorating downtown, and when the middle- and upper-middle classes moved to less densely populated areas in other parts of the county, the church's congregation, and its coffers, dwindled.
 
Leaky Roof and Crumbling Stone
 But as the current rector of St. John's, the Rev. S. Burtner Ulrich, explained, "It is a policy of the church that we don't pick up and leave, too."
Now approaching its tricentennial anniversary, the brick and fieldstone church, which was built in 1752 and enlarged after the Civil War, is beginning an $855,000 restoration campaign. The old slate roof is leaking, the intricate stonework is crumbling and the lead in many of the stained-glass windows of the chancery -- some of the oldest in the United States -- is giving way.
Although Father Ulrich, the 35th rector at St. John's, estimated that full renovation of the church would cost $2 million and take 10 years to complete, the first stage would involve only "sealing the envelope" of the building -- replacing the roof and resetting the stones to prevent further water damage.
 
Shared Fortunes
 For the St. John's Episcopal Tricentennial Restoration Campaign, the church is seeking funds to match the $300,000 it was awarded last May by the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation under the Environmental Quality Bond Act.
Of 121 applicants, St. John's was one of 23 projects awarded a total of more than $4 million in matching grants to preserve buildings on the state or national registers of historic places. The Getty Square church is on both registers.
"Clearly, the building is one of the most historic structures in the area," said Karl Bertrand, a fund-raising and grant consultant working for St. John's. "But it is also one of the most seriously deteriorated buildings."
"In a sense," Mr. Bertrand said, "St. John's has shared the fortunes of the neighborhood."
In another sense, said Michael P. Rebic, historic preservation planner for the Yonkers Department of Planning and Development, "St. John's has remained a steady force throughout many years and many changes, a pillar of our downtown area."
"The idea that St. John's would undertake this project, instead of leaving, as other institutions have, shows a real commitment to our city," Mr. Rebic added. "It's too easy to wash your hands of an area and move on when things get tough."
The Getty Square section of Yonkers has declined over the last 30 to 40 years, Mr. Rebic said, and the social and economic problems of the working- and middle-class residents who stayed behind have increased. As of August 1991, for example, there were 404 homeless Yonkers families, including 832 children.
 
Taking an Active Role
 To meet the needs of the downtown area, St. John's has taken an active role in providing the city's first shelter for the homeless, a soup kitchen, a battered-women's shelter, community residences for the mentally ill, a shelter for recovering drug-addicted women and a support group for those with AIDS.
Throughout its history, St. John's has been more than a house of worship. In 1869, the church opened a home for the sick on Warburton Avenue that later became St. John's Riverside Hospital, the city's first hospital. A century earlier, during the Revolution, the church building served as a hospital for wounded soldiers fighting for both sides.
"It is our tradition," said Father Ulrich, "to take care of those in need, whether they be Tories, the homeless or people with AIDS."
For years, legend had it that troops from the Revolutionary War were buried on the grounds, although no markers were erected on the graves. But the story took on more credibility during the 1950's, when an entire crew walked off the job after workers excavating earth underneath one of the building's underpinnings found human bones.
 
Inspired by London Churches
 The building, with its Georgian-style detailing, rounded arches and fanlight window above the entrance, was built by Frederic Philipse 2d, an English lord who owned 90,000 acres of land from the Bronx north to Croton-on-Hudson. The small rectangular structure was built of local fieldstone, and its style was inspired by London churches designed by the 17th-century English architect Sir Christopher Wren.
The first major renovation of the church came in 1871, when Yonkers had become large and prosperous. Edward Tuckerman Potter, a well-known architect who also built the Mark Twain House in Hartford, was hired. In a break with tradition, the architect turned away from the Gothic Revival style that was popular in churches of that period, and instead built upon the church's existing Colonial architecture.
"Potter did an unprecedented thing," Mr. Rebic said. "And in doing so, he ushered in a new appreciation for American Colonial architecture.
"At a time when old buildings rarely survived and were torn down to make way for the new, Tucker and the vestry insisted on maintaining the architectural integrity of the existing building," Mr. Rebic said.
 
A Confiscated Tory Manor
 Orin Lehman, Commissioner of the state's Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, said recently that St. John's "one of the finest works of Edward Tuckerman Potter."
The restoration campaign officially began in September, with opening ceremonies attended by British Maj. Basil Hugh Phillips Heaton, a direct descendant of the British Loyalist whose manor was confiscated in 1785 by the state.
To match the state grant, the church will seek financing from the parish, the city, corporations, the Episcopal Diocese of New York and foundations specializing in religious properties and historic places, Father Ulrich said.
"Despite the problems, we like being here," the rector said of his church's commitment to renovate the building and remain in Getty Square.
"We feel needed," he said. "I'm never bored in Yonkers, and I have great hopes for this community."

When Shut-Eye Goes, So Does the Work Day

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
Gail R., a 42-year-old attorney with a New York real estate law firm, could not get a good night's sleep. Day after day, she arrived at her office dog tired. She tried everything -- gallons of coffee, pinching her legs -- and still dozed off at her desk.
"I felt tired and lousy all the time," she said. "My work was uneven because my energy was sapped." 
 And so, at about 10 P.M. on a recent Monday, Gail R. -- all those interviewed refused to be identified by name for fear of hurting their careers -- arrived at Manhattan's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to participate in an all-night session at its Sleep Disorders Clinic. Dressed in pink cotton pajamas, she plumped up her pillows, grabbed her teddy bear and adjusted the two-dozen wires taped to her body. For the next eight hours, she was hooked up to an encephalograph monitor and videotaped via infrared camera so that every movement of her brain, eyes, nose, mouth, arms and legs would be analyzed. "I'd do anything for a good night's sleep," she said.
 She's not the only one. Call it the leading sleep indicator: as the economy worsens, more bleary-eyed executives turn up in the office of Neil B. Kavey, the clinic's director. "The recession has had a real impact," Dr. Kavey said. "When people start losing their jobs or fearing they might lose their jobs, they start losing sleep."
It's a vicious cycle: job worries foster stress and depression, which create -- or aggravate -- sleep disorders, which hamper job performance. Along with insomnia, or sleeplessness -- which afflicts 50 million Americans -- come hypersomnia (sleepiness) and parasomnia (sleepwalking), as well as various circadian rhythm disorders. These disruptions in the body's sleep schedule can be caused by changes in routine, such as working until 2 A.M. to close a deal or flying to Europe for a meeting.
Sleep disorders take their toll on business people. "Lack of sleep impacts your memory, your judgment, your concentration -- all of your decision-making powers," Dr. Kavey said. Some 75 percent of his patients are business people; with corporate health insurance, they have the means to seek treatment.
Your dealings with co-workers worsen, too. Linda P., 38, a research analyst with a New York investment banking firm, suffers periodic bouts of insomnia. "My work always gets done," she said, "but my interpersonal relationships bear the brunt. I have to hide in my office so I don't break down and cry if my boss looks at me the wrong way."
In minor cases, Dr. Kavey recommends "sleep consolidation" therapy: limiting sleep to specific intervals and gradually increasing the amount until the patient sleeps uninterrupted. He also advocates improved "sleep hygiene" -- avoiding alcohol, caffeine and other stimulants before bed, and trying to set a regular sleep routine.
For more serious problems, he suggests an evening at the clinic. At $1,000 a visit (covered by most major medical insurance carriers), it's not for those who occasionally stifle a yawn after a late dinner with clients. It's for those who habitually fight to stay awake.
Take Gail R. At the sleep clinic, she registered a whopping 334 respiratory irregularities -- otherwise known as snores. She spent 29 percent of her time in the lightest sleep, which is akin to being partially awake, and never made it into a deep slumber. "No wonder she's tired," Dr. Kavey said. "Her breathing patterns are horrendous."
Gail R. has several options to remedy her physical breathing problems. She might try a plastic mouthguard or a mask with an oxygen tube. They might not seem conducive to sleep, but do help restore normal breathing patterns. If they don't work, surgery may be required to remove excess tissue from her throat that keeps her from breathing easily when she sleeps.
Because sleep disorders are relatively new as a medical specialty, little research exists. And what there is concentrates on manufacturing workers and security guards, for whom dozing spells mean physical danger.
But now, with business having gone global, sleep -- or lack thereof -- is becoming a big issue with executives. As faxes and electronic mail whizz around the world, executives complain to Dr. Kavey of lying awake worrying about work they could be doing. "These people have to pay attention to their bodies," he said. "They can't keep cutting down their sleep to make more money."
Some are resisting the 24-hour trend. When the New York Stock Exchange announced plans last year to start trading a half hour earlier, brokers at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco launched a protest, and their East Coast brethren joined in condemning the idea. "I feel sorry for our people on the West Coast who would have to get up so early," said Alan Greenberg, chairman of New York-based Bear, Stearns & Company. The plan was shelved.
Of course, some executives thrive on little sleep. (Most adults need seven hours; a few require eight or nine but others get by on five or six.) "Aggressive types, like investment bankers, think it's macho to pull all-nighters," Dr. Kavey said. "They brag about surviving without any sleep."
Ultimately, though, it catches up. Mike L., an executive vice president in his 50's at a New York record company, realized he wasn't sleeping properly when he started dozing in meetings. But it was only when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car -- and drove off a highway -- that he sought help. Medical tests revealed several problems, including sleep apnea, a respiratory disorder. Now, with treatment, he is sleeping better -- and colleagues notice the difference. "I think they forget what a nice guy I am when I'm not tired," he said.

 BODY:
AS the late Robert Maxwell's son Kevin begins the daunting task of filling his father's huge shoes at The Daily News, there is wide disagreement about just how daunting a task he faces.
Mr. Maxwell said in an interview Friday that The Daily News would be operating profitably by March. But the newspaper has not released any statistics on its operation. 
 Executives at New York Newsday and The New York Post, who have analyzed The Daily News using their own estimates and assumptions, assert that the newspaper is losing a fortune. In an article Thursday in New York Newsday, that paper's president, Douglas Fox, said The Daily News had no prospect of becoming profitable.
The truth?
Without authoritative data, any analysis is -- at best -- informed speculation.
On condition that they not be identified, executives at The Daily News and at the Maxwell organization, union leaders and other newspaper executives provided information about The News's current and past operation.
From these fragments, a mosaic emerges that suggests that The News must still overcome big hurdles if it is to break into the black in 1992.
In 1989, the last full year of operation under the Tribune Company of Chicago, The Daily News had revenues of about $420 million. Of that, about $275 million was from advertising and $145 million from circulation.
The recession of 1990 pushed revenues down. Had there been no strike, revenues for the year were expected to be about $385 million, with $250 million in advertising and $135 million in circulation.
The Daily News's prestrike circulation totaled 1.4 million on Sunday and 1.1 million daily.
Before his death, Robert Maxwell said the paper had advertising revenues in excess of $3 million for the week before Columbus Day, which begins the Christmas season and is usually a very good week for newspaper advertising. Advertising usually dips significantly after Christmas.
But The Daily News expects increased advertising rates and some new advertisers to generate an average of $3 million in ad sales weekly in 1992, which would produce $156 million for the year.
The Daily News claims to have a paid circulation of about 800,000 daily and a million Sunday, although the paper reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations that average circulation for the six months ending Sept. 30 was 762,078 daily and 911,684 Sunday.
Based on the higher numbers, The Daily News would generate circulation revenue of about $90 million.
Therefore, a rough -- and optimistic -- estimate of advertising and circulation revenues for 1992 is $246 million.
In 1989, The News's costs were about $410 million, and the costs were projected before the strike to rise to $420 million in 1990. Of that, about $210 million was in wages, benefits and overtime; $126 million in ink and paper, and $84 million in administration, leases and other expenses.
Mr. Maxwell claimed to have negotiated savings with the paper's unions worth about $80 million, leaving $130 million in labor costs.
The newspaper's lower circulation means that it is using about a third less paper and ink, which makes current costs about $84 million.
If one assumes that administration, lease and other costs declined by $20 million, as Mr. Maxwell boasted, the current cost is about $64 million.
These current annual costs, again viewed optimistically, would total about $278 million.
By this rough analysis, The Daily News would lose $32 million in 1992.
Should advertising revenues fall short of the $3 million a week that is expected, the deficit could be far greater. For instance, should the weekly advertising average be $250,000 less than expected, the annual loss could be $45 million.
In an interview last week, Kevin Maxwell said he hoped to get help and cooperation from the paper's unions, which usually means concessions. There seems little doubt that he will seek to reduce labor costs in a new contract to replace the current one that expires in March.
The Daily News is also seeking to renegotiate the lease on its headquarters building on East 42nd Street in Manhattan, exchanging a long-term commitment for a significant reduction in annual cost.
While Mr. Maxwell has pledged his family's support to The Daily News, he has also made it clear that the family's investment in The News is based on expectation of profit.
Should that profit not appear in 1992, the cost of shutting the paper down -- if it cannot be sold -- would be substantial.
As part of the purchase agreement with Mr. Maxwell, the Tribune Company agreed to be responsible for any shortfall in the paper's pension plan if it were to be closed within five years of the sale.
But the Maxwells would be responsible for severance, which would probably be about $20 million.
In addition, The Daily News has lease obligations and other contractual commitments estimated to be about $20 million.
As such, the total cost for closing The Daily News would probably be roughly $45 million.
Avoiding such an expense could encourage the Maxwells to keep The Daily News alive, even if 1992 does not turn out to be the year the paper turns the profit corner.

HEADLINE: An Effort To Salvage Bank Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
In the face of increasingly partisan wrangling on the verge of an election year, Congress will take one final stab this week at passing banking legislation.
After several days of negotiations last week, Administration officials and lawmakers from both parties said the chances were about 50-50 that a key proposal from President Bush, to allow banks to open branches nationwide, would be enacted. 
 Paradoxically, the main factor in favor of such a measure is not what it would do for banks but that it could provide cover for legislators who have no alternative but to approve billions of dollars to bail out failed banks. If they pass a bill that includes the bailout money and authority for interstate banking, the latter will probably dominate the headlines.
 
Parts of Proposal Are Dead
 Other main parts of the banking proposal, which Mr. Bush said at the beginning of the year was his top domestic priority, are dead at least for this year, and maybe for years to come. They would permit banks to sell insurance and stocks and underwrite securities and allow commercial enterprises like retail chains to own banks.
Last Monday, the House of Representatives voted down comprehensive changes in the nation's banking laws. In the end, the Bush Administration worked against the bill because it had become bogged down with rules limiting the operations of banks.
The next day, the House Banking Committee approved a stripped-down bill that would do little more than provide a $30 billion taxpayer loan to the deposit insurance fund to pay off depositors of failed banks and increase by billions of dollars the ability of the insurance fund to borrow money to buy the assets of banks that fail.
Every responsible lawmaker knows such a bill must be enacted. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's insurance fund is now down to about $2 billion, and with a number of bank failures in the offing, the fund will become insolvent early next year.
Without the new loans, blameless depositors would not be reimbursed when their banks fail next year, and that could lead to a run on banks like the ones in the Depression that led the Government to begin insuring bank deposits.
But the whole situation sounds so much like a replay of the savings and loan disaster that many, perhaps a majority of, lawmakers, including almost all Republican representatives, would vote against a bill like the one that came out of the Banking Committee. "These guys just don't want to vote for a naked bailout bill," said a senior Administration official.
Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Banking Committee, explained the situation this way: "It's a lose-lose proposition for a politician. If you vote no, you turn your back on depositors and risk a recession if not a depression. If you vote yes, you are acknowledging a past Congressional mistake and risk being criticized for one whale of a hit on the taxpayers."
So Congressional leaders and Administration strategists began late last week to try to fatten the bill to give the lawmakers some political protection. The interstate banking provision is one likely sweetener. Another would place new restrictions on the ability of banks to sell insurance, a provision sought by the insurance industry, which is one of the most influential and pervasive lobbies in Washington.
The negotiators were close to agreement on those two matters, but Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the chief antagonist of big banks in the House, insisted on a moratorium on banks' entering securities underwriting.
This is mostly forbidden now, but in recent years the Federal Reserve has used its regulatory authority to permit a few large banks to do a small amount of underwriting.
The Bush Administration objected to the Dingell moratorium, and the negotiations were deadlocked at the end of the week. "We're in lobbying gridlock," said Edward L. Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
 
Action in the Senate
 The Senate is also prepared to take up a banking bill next week, but it will probably wait to see what happens in the House. If the House approves the measure allowing nationwide branches, the Senate will probably follow suit.
The Administration has argued that such legislation would strengthen the banking system because it would make banks less vulnerable to economic distress in certain regions of the country and because it would allow banks to merge and take advantage of economies of scale.
Over the years, positions on banking legislation have not generally broken along party lines. The divisions were more likely to be over whether lawmakers came from big cities or small towns, whether they served on the banking committees or on committees with jurisdiction over competing industries and who provided their most important sources of campaign support.
In the last week or two, however, these issues have become sharply partisan. That is mostly because President Bush has decided to make attacks on the Democratic Congress the centerpiece of his re-election campaign and because Democrats are frustrated that Mr. Bush and President Ronald Reagan before him have managed to avoid responsibility for the savings and loan debacle.
These disputes boiled over Wednesday when the Senate Banking Committee, voting along straight party lines, rejected the President's nomination of Robert L. Clarke to a second term as Comptroller of the Currency, one of the top bank regulatory positions.
Some Democrats acknowledged that they had no particular problem with Mr. Clarke but wanted to send a message to the Administration for the string of bank failures that could end up costing the taxpayers a great deal. Speaking at the public meeting, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said: "I've never before cast a vote on the basis of a message. Unfortunately, Mr. Clarke must be the messenger."
Republicans expressed outrage and maintained that the committee's chairman, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat, was trying somehow to cleanse his own record. Mr. Riegle was rebuked by the Ethics Committee this year for having intervened with bank examiners on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., who ran one of the largest savings and loan associations that failed.
At one point, Senator Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, looked past Mr. Riegle at the other Democrats on the committee dais and declared: "You don't need a scapegoat for anything. Maybe the chairman does, but you don't."
The banking bill will not end the Congressional misery. The lawmakers must also approve a new $80 billion appropriation for the savings and loan bailout and increase by billions more the amount that can be spent to buy the assets of failed savings institutions.
As is the case with the deposit insurance fund, Congress has no choice but to approve this money. But it is painful to vote to spend a huge amount to make up for mistakes of the past. Some lobbyists believe the legislators may look for a way to sneak this money into the banking bill at the last minute to avoid a separate vote.
Albert V. Casey, head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency that manages the savings and loan rescue, suggested this week that each month Congress delayed approving the additional money could cost the Government an additional $100 million. That is because the Government's cost rises the longer an insolvent savings institution is allowed to remain open.

HEADLINE: Office Glut Spreads in California

BYLINE: BY RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10

 BODY:
For the last decade, downtown Los Angeles stood as a gleaming testament to Southern California's seemingly boundless economic growth. In rapid succession, new office towers sprouted to house banks, law firms, stock brokerages and others that poured into the city as the region boomed.
But today, downtown Los Angeles stands awash in vacant office space, a grim reminder to developers and lenders that no region, and no real estate market, is immune to economic dowturn. With new buildings still opening and the recession in California showing no signs of ending soon, the vacancy rate here will only worsen in coming months. 
 Developers and building owners are already being forced to slash rents, sometimes to unprofitable levels, to attract the few available tenants. And banks are being forced to write off or renegotiate loans that only a few years ago they were competing with each other to make.
Los Angeles is the largest -- and only the most visible -- example of how the commercial real estate markets throughout California have weakened precipitously, jolting not just the state's own big banks and developers, but lenders and investors from across the country and around the world.
Citicorp, the largest banking company in the United States, has about $4.2 billion worth of commercial real estate loans in the West, mostly in California, comprising nearly a third of its $13 billion commercial real estate portfolio.
"The commercial market in California is wallowing in a really severe slump, and I don't see it turning up yet," said Paul R. Alanis, the president of Koar Inc., a development company that recently put off plans to start a new office building in downtown Los Angeles.
"There was a feeding frenzy here, with significant inflation in property values, partly fueled by foreign capital coming in, especially from Japan," Mr. Alanis said. "It tended to obfuscate what was really happening, which was ever-increasing supply and a softening demand situation."
 
Small Consolation
 No is predicting that the California market will go the way of some of the great real estate disaster areas of the 1980's, like Boston, Dallas or Austin, Tex. Indeed, many analysts predict that California will eventually bounce back, thanks to its role as financial center for the West, a hub for the booming Pacific rim area and the state's diverse and historically resilient economy.
But that is small consolation right now to developers with buildings in the area from San Diego to Irvine to Los Angeles. In downtown Los Angeles, nearly a quarter of all offices stood vacant on Sept. 30, an increase from about 15 percent only a year ago, and about 5.5 percentage points higher than a 35-city average compiled by Cushman & Wakefield Inc., the real estate brokerage firm. Midtown Manhattan's vacancy rate was 16.9 percent, Cushman & Wakefield said.
To make matters worse here, three big office buildings are still being built downtown, offering space almost equivalent to the Empire State Building.
Already, the slump has shown up on the bottom lines of California's big banks. Most, including the Security Pacific Corporation and First Interstate Bancorp, have greatly increased their reserves for losses on commercial real estate loans in recent months. Analysts think that otherwise strong banks like Wells Fargo & Company could face additional large write-offs in the next quarter or two.
 
Still Looking for the Bottom
 "Our feeling is that the loss situation probably has not bottomed yet, because you don't see the problems peak in real estate until maybe 18 months after the trough of the recession," an executive of one of California's largest banks said.
The situation is also threatening the earnings of Japanese and out-of-state banks that lent heavily to California developers in recent years. Citicorp is the main lender on California Plaza II, a 52-story office tower being built in downtown Los Angeles by Metropolitan Structures West Inc. Just a few months before the building's completion, Metropolitan Structures has leased only about 30 percent of its space.
The slump has already claimed some casualties. The Equitable Life Assurance Company is foreclosing on the Westin Bonaventure, a hotel in downtown Los Angeles owned by a partnership including John C. Portman Jr., the Atlanta developer, and the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. The First National Bank of Boston foreclosed earlier this year on two office buildings adjacent to the John Wayne Airport in Orange County owned by the McLachan Investment Company. Scores of smaller properties across the state, including office buildings, shopping centers and industrial buildings, have been seized by lenders in recent months.
"The volume now is enormous," said Kurt DeMeire of County Records Research of Huntington Beach, which tracks property foreclosures in the previously fast-growing Southern California counties of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino.
The squeeze is likely to continue for months or even years. "There's no doubt that some owners, whether investors or builder-developers, are experiencing financial problems because cash flows on a lot of properties are insufficient to meet the debt service," said Stan Ross, a managing partner at Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a real estate accounting firm in Los Angeles. "As a result, you're seeing a lot more troubled debt restructurings."
Amid all the gloom, some new projects appear to be relatively successful. A group that includes Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman turned investor, is putting the finishing touches on an office complex in Santa Monica called the Water Garden. The project, financed by Citicorp and the Bank of America, is 65 percent leased and should be 80 percent leased by the end of the year, executives of the development group said.
Most of the new construction downtown is backed by insurance companies, pension funds, Japanese real estate companies and other deep-pocketed investors that can afford to ride out years of weak income from buildings without being forced to sell at depressed prices. Those new buildings are aggressively wooing tenants from older buildings by offering not only spanking-new surroundings but also deeply discounted rents and other incentives.
 
Problems at Older Buildings
 As a result, owners of older buildings are already losing tenants, and analysts said many would be unable to pay their bank loans if they could not find new tenants.
Jonathan Marine, a broker with CB Commercial Real Estate in downtown Los Angeles, said he was negotiating for a large foreign financial institution, which he declined to identified, that wants to move to a new building from an older one.
The developer of the new building is willing to pick up the tenant's existing lease, which has six years to run, at a cost of $8 million, Mr. Marine said, in return for a 10-year lease in the new building. The developer is also willing to give as much as two years' free rent in the new building, and provide the tenant at least $60 a square foot in cash -- or $4.5 million for 75,000 square feet -- to finish the office's interiors and add furnishings.
Those terms are far better than developers were offering just a year or two ago, Mr. Marine said, and much more favorable than anything the owner of the tenant's current building can afford to grant.
Owners of older or less prestigious buildings "are going to have an impossible time," Mr. Marine said. "There is no demand for those buildings at all."
 
Virtually No New Construction
 If there is good news for the Los Angeles and California real estate markets, it is that new construction has virtually halted. Most economists expect California's recovery to lag the nation's, but they think that within a few years the state will resume its steady growth, albeit at a slower pace than during the roaring Eighties. Eventually, they said, the backlog of office and industrial space will be whittled away as economic growth picks up, forcing rents higher, allowing loans to be repaid and increasing property values.
"Longer term, we think the place works," said David Shulman, the head of real estate research at Salomon Brothers. "But in the short run, who knows?"

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fear of Political Moves Keeps Bond Rates Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A weak economy and a marked slowdown in inflation usually occasion falling long-term interest rates.
Some credit market analysts say those factors could indeed be potent enough to induce bond yields to fall toward 7.75 percent within weeks. 
 But improvement beyond that level seems unlikely, the analysts said, even if the Federal Reserve Board continues to push short-term interest rates lower. The reason: persistent fears about what Washington might do to insure a recovery.
There is little argument that long-term rates have room to come down. Even though yields fell a bit last week, the spread between 30-year Treasury bonds and 2-year Treasury notes was more than 2.2 percentage points, an extraordinarily wide margin.
 
Several Worries
 Concern that the Fed is reinflating the economy through its measured reduction in short-term interest rates is one reason that the yield curve is so steep.
But at the moment the greater worry seems to be that Congress and the Administration will come up with a fiscal-rescue package that will mainly succeed in expanding a Federal budget deficit that some economists now project will reach $400 billion in the current fiscal year.
"One of the things we have learned over the years is that you can't trust Congress on fiscal policy for more than a year at a time," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "Whenever things start to get tough, they bail out, and the deficit goes up."
Mr. Wood, who recently spent a week talking to people in Washington, said the atmosphere was reminiscent of 1981, when Congress gave Ronald Reagan all the tax relief he asked for, and then some. "That is one reason," he said, "why I am pessimistic about the chances of bond yields falling much further."
 
Regulatory Concerns
 Compounding the challenge of coping with mountainous Federal financing needs -- a fact of life in the credit markets for the last decade -- is the cloudier relationship the market now has with its regulators.
Various investigations undertaken since the Salomon Brothers bidding violations were disclosed in August have made market participants highly cautious and have led to greater inefficiencies in the pricing of securities, traders contend.
Those inefficiencies were reflected at last week's refunding auctions, when demand for the new 3-year and 10-year notes was far below expectations.
A letter sent to dealers last week by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, is not likely to ease tensions or improve the market's efficiency.
Mr. Markey sent dealers a list of requests for information on why the three-year notes were so poorly received.
 
Types of Information
 Information as to whether dealers had stayed away from the auction as a form of protest against new Treasury bidding regulations was deemed to be of particular interest. So, too, was information about contacts between primary dealers concerning the auction.
The letter, which asked that the information be supplied by Friday, did not sit well with some primary dealers.
"A lot of people who don't understand the securities business are doing what they think is right to insure the integrity of the market," said the chief executive of one primary dealer, who insisted on not being identified. "But in so doing they are risking complicating the lives of market participants to such a degree that results shown at the first two stages of the refunding may become commonplace."
The request for information about who is talking to whom, and about what, "won't make communication more frequent," the executive said, adding that such communication is highly important if a market is to function efficiently.
"A market which functioned extremely well is being tampered with," the Wall Street executive said.
 
Awaiting Statistics
 The bond markets will be closed today in observance of Veterans Day, and the focus for the rest of the week is expected to be on economic and inflation reports scheduled for later this week. Analysts expect the reports to confirm that the economy is extremely soft and that inflation is coming down.
"There can be little doubt that inflation is improving steadily," said Steven Slifer, executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. "Industrial prices, which have been falling since the recession began in August 1990, hit a new low last week. And wage pressures continue to abate."
Further confirmation will arrive in the form of very favorable figures on producer prices and consumer prices, Mr. Slifer said.
According to his forecast, the Producer Price Index, due out on Wednesday, probably rose by just one-tenth of a percent in October. And consumer prices, which are expected to be released on Thursday, increased by only two-tenths of a percent, he said.
Weak retail sales figures and a report on industrial production showing that factory output did not rebound sharply in October are also expected, bolstering the case that the economy remains weak.
"I am getting very fearful for the Christmas season," said Mr. Wood of Bank of America.

HEADLINE: Trade-Talk Progress, but Still No Deal

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Trade negotiations in the Netherlands on Friday and Saturday failed to produce a breakthrough in the deadlocked global trade talks, but American and European officials insisted today that progress had been made.
The sides said in a communique at the end of the discussions that they were in virtual agreement on an accord to protect copyrights, patents, computer chip designs, trade secrets and trademarks. But no compromise was struck on Europe's lavish subsidies to farmers, which have become the biggest sticking point in the five-year, 108-nation negotiations intended to lower trade barriers. 
 President Bush, ending a three-day visit to Europe, said on Saturday that he and top European Community officials had narrowed their differences over agriculturual policies. He provided no details, nor did the Europeans.
 
'Major Areas of Difficulty'
 The United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and other food-exporting nations have demanded an end to or sharp reductions in the subsidies, which they say have the effect of closing foreign markets to them.
"There are still some major areas of difficulty on both sides," Ray MacSharry of Ireland, the community's farm commissioner, said after the meeting in Europe.
The European Community's agricultural ministers, who are closely allied with farmers and have blocked efforts to reduce subsidies, gather in Brussels next week to discuss the subsidies, said Willard A. Workman, the vice president for international issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce. They are expected to produce a communique on Nov. 20 indicating whether they are willing to compromise.
Senior American trade officials last month put a new priority on the global talks, which are being conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They set extra negotiators to work after the German and French Governments expressed a willingness to change the community's agricultural policy. The Governments said they might be willing to shift more costs from consumers, who subsidize farmers through high prices, to taxpayers, who would do so directly.
American officials have been hoping to strike a GATT deal within a few weeks because pushing a trade agreement through Congress takes about seven months and because the chairmanship of the European Community Council of Ministers, and with it the politial leadership of the community, will shift from the Netherlands to Portugal on Jan. 1.
This routine rotation of the community's leadership has made United States officials nervous for three reasons: Portugal is not as close an ally of the United States as the Netherlands; Portuguese officials have expressed less enthusiasm for changes in the community's agricultural policies than Dutch officials, who strongly criticize the current system, and Portugal is a fairly new member of the community, with a small and relatively inexperienced team of diplomats that has never tackled the responsibilities of chairmanship.
 
Free-Trade Pact on Hold
 A senior American trade official acknowledged recently that the new priority for the GATT talks has partly impeded talks with Mexico and Canada about a free-trade agreement. Some meetings have been canceled, as American negotiators, and particularly trade lawyers experienced in drafting agreements, have been transferred to the GATT talks.
Many American officials have also said privately in recent weeks that any North American free-trade agreement might be put off until 1993 because a weak domestic economy is undermining President Bush's popularity and might be eroding public support for a trade agreement that would allow more Mexican products into the United States.
But three Administration officials said this weekend that no decision had been reached on whether it was politically feasible to complete an agreement with Mexico next year.
 
Other Tough Issues Remain
 Success in the global talks will not be guaranteed, even if the European agricultural ministers agree to compromise. "The focus has been on agriculture, but there's still a lot of tough neogtiations to do on other issues, especially on dumping and especially on services," Mr. Workman, of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said today.
Japan and many European countries have been seeking the repeal or watering down of American laws that allow companies to seek punitive duties on imports that are "dumped" in the United States at low prices. They contend that the Commerce Department formula for calculating whether goods have been dumped is heavily weighted in favor of Americans.
American lawmakers oppose any such move. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, sent a letter to President Bush on Thursday saying they wanted a trade agreement "that preserves strong remedies against subsidies, dumping, and other unfair trade practices."
Negotiations on services concern the offering of insurance, investment banking, credit cards and other services in foreign countries. The United States and other industrialized countries think they have a competitive advantage in service industries and want to pry open markets in developing countries.

HEADLINE: Kemp Urges A Cut in Taxes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
President Bush should join Congress in reducing tax rates "to get America growing again," Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said today.
In an appearance on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Mr. Kemp said he thought such a measure could be enacted this year. 
 Mr. Kemp has suggested a tax cut, but the President said last week that he did not think taxes could be cut within the constrictions of the budget agreement between the White House and Congress.
The President also said the state of the economy "is not recession" and "does not meet the definition of recession."
Asked about that, Mr. Kemp said, "This economy, while technically, perhaps, out of recession, it's limping, it's anemic, and it needs some oxygen in the body economic to create more jobs, to create more growth."
Mr. Kemp said the Administration should embrace some Democratic proposals to stimulate the economy, citing as examples low-income housing tax credits and a program like individual retirement accounts for first-time home buyers.

HEADLINE: Serving in Military May Cut Later Earnings, Studies Say

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A study by two economists has concluded that "the earnings soldiers sacrifice are greater than first appears," continuing a debate over the impact of military service on income.
Joshua D. Angrist of Harvard University and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University have been comparing the economic fortunes of veterans and nonveterans in a series of recently published papers. 
 For starters, they found that Vietnam veterans earn about 15 percent less a year than similar men who were not drafted. "Earnings rise with experience and these guys missed out on two years of job experience," Professor Angrist said.
The pay gap exists despite the G.I. Bill of Rights, the Government program that has helped pay for veterans' college educations since World War II. While the program has been extremely effective in increasing veterans' education and earnings, its benefits were pared back for a while in the 70's. And "a lot of people didn't use it," Professor Angrist said. "Many had families and couldn't go back to school."
The Vietnam-era draft also contributed to the income gap, the economists recently found, by giving young men who were at risk of being drafted an incentive to use student deferments and stay in college longer. Since they got more schooling than they might have without the draft threat, they ended up with permanently higher pay, on average.
All this confirms the suspicions of many Vietnam veterans themselves. The real surprise, Professors Angrist and Krueger show, is that those veterans are not alone. World War II veterans, who were generally thought to have received a leg up by serving in a popular war, also suffered financially, though only about one-third as much as Vietnam veterans.
Among veterans of various eras, there are disparate views on how their careers were affected by their time away from civilian life.
"I never would have gone to college if I hadn't gone into the service," said Ben V. Luden, a 66-year-old World War II veteran who lives in Westport, Conn.
And Rosalind R. Beech, a 37-year-old veteran from Silver Spring, Md., who joined the Army in 1974, recalled: "I came from a very low economic background. The military was a means of escape."
But others believe their stint in the service set them back. Eugene R. Manfrey, 60, a Korean War veteran and former steelworker who lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., said: "The guy who stayed home and went to college got the better job. I operated a machine. He was probably up in the office."
John J. Fanning, 44, a Vietnam veteran, had a similarly dim view: "There is a tax for all the men and women that served. That tax will be paid for the rest of their lives."
 
'Were Discriminated Against'
 Many other Vietnam veterans cite problems stemming from the unpopularity of the Vietnam war. "We were discriminated against," said James B. Hubbard, a Vietnam veteran in North Potomac, Md. "When my father came back from World War II, they were proud to hire veterans."
Three circumstances may have magnified the perceived contrast between the impact of serving in the Vietnam War, compared with World War II or Korea.
First is the nation's economic performance. World War II and Korean veterans came home to an economy that was on the brink of a two-decade-long boom. Recessions were short, unemployment stayed low and pay grew rapidly. Against that backdrop, whatever losses may have ensued from military service did not loom all that large in anyone's consciousness.
"I feel very good about myself," said Frederick P. Cipoletti, a 71-year-old World War II veteran, who lives on Staten Island.
By contrast, Vietnam veterans were discharged in the early 70s, just in time for the two worst recessions in postwar history; the combination of high unemployment and rapidly rising prices known as stagflation, and a sharp slowdown in real wage growth.
Unlike World War II, Vietnam was more of a poor man's war: Those who served were disproportionately from the working class, and the post-Vietnam economy was particularly harsh toward young blue-collar men. Vietnam veterans, as a result, have fared even worse than other members of their age group -- a generation whose after-tax pay has declined by roughly 20 percent since 1973.
 
Less Demand for the Semiskilled
 Finally, the skills of Vietnam veterans might not have been as useful in the economy of the 70's and 80's as they would have been a couple of decades earlier. For 20 years or so after World War II, the demand for high school-educated, semiskilled workers soared -- and so did their wages, relative to those of more educated workers.
Vietnam vets, by contast, came into a labor market in which manufacturing jobs were shrinking and the demand for less-educated workers within manufacturing was declining.
Richard Flannigan, a Vietnam veteran in Washington, said, "I got out in 1971 and was unemployed for eight months." 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Aid for Veterans
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (AP) -- The Small Business Administration and a trade group are starting a program aimed at helping military veterans purchase their own businesses.
More than 100 members of the International Franchise Association are offering veterans either a reduced franchise fee or market-rate financing for up to half the fee. The Small Business Administration will provide management and financial counseling and offer loans to eligible Vietnam and disabled veterans.
All veterans have until Aug. 15, 1993, to apply to the program. Armed forces members returning to civilian life between now and that date will have two years from the date of discharge to apply. Information is available from the administration's 110 offices around the nation.

HEADLINE: Marxist Revolt Grows Strong In the Shantytowns of Peru

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Defying the drift of recent world history, a Marxist rebel movement is rapidly expanding in Peru, carrying the fight from its remote Andean strongholds to this coastal capital's impoverished and politically crucial shantytowns.
The rebel group, the Shining Path, has intensifed its program of killing anyone blocking its way -- Roman Catholic priests, Protestant pastors, foreign aid technicians and housewives running slum soup kitchens. It has seriously disrupted aid programs that offered succor to some of Peru's poorest people. 
 The rebels hope that the poor will embrace their cause, even though the terror campaign is making their lives more miserable. And in a society sharply divided on ethnic and income lines, the alienation of these desperately poor people is so great that the rebel strategy appears to be succeeding.
The Shining Path now says it has reached "strategic equilibrium" with Peru's demoralized army, and analysts fear that as early as next year a violent showdown could take place between two radically different visions of the future of South America's fourth most populous nation.
"Shining Path could easily mobilize 5,000 people and take the presidential palace," a rebel sympathizer boasted. "But the army would counterattack with 10,000 and there would be a genocide. So they will wait."
Rebel leaders are open about their goal: strangling the capital "with bands of iron."
Gustavo Gorriti, a journalist who has studied the Shining Path's growth since its first armed actions in May 1980, said, "If they continue this way, they will be able to beat the Peruvian state."
For its part, the civilian, democratically elected Government of President Alberto Fujimori seeks a free-market revolution in Peru. By slashing bureaucracy and adopting one of the hemisphere's most liberal investment policies, Mr. Fujimori hopes to duplicate the capitalist success of Peru's southern neighbor, Chile.
But the immediate effect of the President's radical adjustment program, called "Fuji-shock" by many here, has been increased unemployment and poverty. Peruvian business executives are telling pollsters that terrorism is their No. 1 concern, and foreign investors are discouraged by the rating given Peru by Business Risks International, an American company: "The world's riskiest country for business."
The Shining Path rebels, known in Spanish as Sendero Luminoso, look across the Pacific to the China of an earlier day, where the movement's leader, Abimael Guzman, lived during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. Luis Arce Borja, editor of the movement's clandestine newspaper, El Diario, has estimated that it may cost a million lives for the Shining Path to win power and to restructure this nation of 22 million people into a Maoist peasant and worker state.
 
The Toll to Date
 So far, the 11-year-old war has cost about 23,000 lives and about $18 billion in economic damage.
The rebel leaders, believing their movement to be "a beacon for world revolution," hope one day to export Marxist revolution to neighboring Bolivia and Ecuador, nations with the large Indian and mixed-race populations that are Shining Path's power base.
With Peru at a crossroads, Mr. Fujimori is touring the world in search of emergency economic help. In September, he visited Washington. In October, he toured four European capitals. And now he is making appeals in four Asian countries, including Japan, the birthplace of his immigrant parents.
Industrial nations, lauding Mr. Fujimori's efforts to regain international financial standing after his predecessor, Alan Garcia, suspended the country's foreign debt payments, have committed $1.1 billion to help Peru pay its debts to banks, and the Inter-American Development Bank has approved a $425 million loan to Peru.
 
The Shantytowns
Rebels Cement Hold Over Nation's Poor
 Cupped by bone-dry mountains five miles east of Lima's center, Raucana is a model Maoist town. Protected by high walls, watchtowers and trenches, squatters collectively dug wells, raised light poles and laid out streets. A square was designated for "people's trials" and for public whippings of prostitutes, thieves, homosexuals, drug users and wife beaters.
"Long live President Gonzalo," red graffiti proclaim outside the settlment entrance, using Mr. Guzman's nom de guerre. "Fujimori: servant of reaction and imperialism."
Last Sunday afternoon, in a shack made of woven reed mats and plastic sheets, the owner's eye gleamed with more than the homemade corn alcohol he offered a visitor. "If one of us falls, another immediately rises to take his place," he said of the leadership structure implanted by the Shining Path. "It's been 160 years of government by the rich. Now it's our turn."
In August, when the police threatened to carry out an eviction order, 1,000 Raucana residents twice took up rocks, slingshots and firebombs and blocked a one-mile stretch of the nearby Central Highway, Lima's lifeline to food-producing areas in the interior.
Shining Path squads exploded a car bomb in front of a factory owned by an industrialist who holds title to Raucana's land and killed an army general who organized the distribution of medicine in Raucana under a military civic-action program.
 
Tactics of Coercion
 It is in places like Raucana that the country's future is likely to be decided. Sprawling Lima slums of its kind, bereft of Government support and clogged with war refugees from the Andean highlands, are now home to almost one-quarter of the nation's population.
Shining Path militants are spreading their influence through the shantytowns with nighttime marches, killings of political opponents, indoctrination of children in clandestine Schools for Pioneers, seizing of loudspeakers in markets and public squares for political harangues, and intimidation of directors of neighborhood soup kitchens and of Glass of Milk public programs.
Two shantytowns responded with marches against hunger and terror. But increasingly, neighborhood leaders appear too frightened or demoralized to react.
"It's very worrying in the pueblos jovenes," a Western diplomat said, using the local term for shantytowns. "Lots more kids are joining Shining Path."
Acceptance of the radical group now appears to be spreading among those victimized by a deep economic depression. By one estimate, the number of Peruvians living in extreme poverty has nearly doubled in three years, to 13 million.
A graphic indicator of poverty was Peru's cholera epidemic this year. The disease killed 2,540 people and sickened 263,761. Health authorities warn that without money to invest in clean water and sewage disposal, cholera will erupt again soon with the return of the Southern Hemisphere summer.
In a recent poll, 17 percent of those replying said that in today's Peru subversion was "justifiable." Approval of subversion grew as income dropped -- from 2 percent among Lima's wealthiest to 23 percent among the poorest. Among the poor, 38 percent of respondents said the Shining Path would win.
 
The Politics
Widespread Racism Drives the Revolt
 The Shining Path has benefited from the collapse of Peru's once-powerful left-wing parties, mainly the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance of Mr. Garcia, who is accused of destroying the country's economy and is the target of a Congressional corruption investigation. Traditional right-wing parties are also discredited.
The fragmentation of the traditional political order is so complete that Mr. Fujimori's coalition of independent, fiscally conservative technocrats was able to win the June 1990 presidential election despite having the support of only 1 percent of the electorate in a poll taken in March of the same year.
With voters adrift, some political analysts fear that the Shining Path is moving into the vacuum. But the driving force behind the rebellion is a racism that permeates Peruvian society.
When people in this country scrutinize the photographs of arrested guerrillas, few fail to notice their pronounced Indian and mixed-race features, while once again this year Miss Peru looks as is she was plucked off a Spanish beach.
On weekends, Lima's popular television game shows display the nation's rigid class system. The hosts and hostessess, with their milky complexions, invariably look as if they were recruited in Miami. The audiences, with their mixed Indian and Latin features, look as if they were recruited in Lima's shantytowns.
"Sendero doesn't have to prove that they are Andean," said the sympathizer, a mixed-race intellectual. "They speak Quechua and everyone knows it."
Peru's middle and upper classes, sensing that the Shining Path's "new state" holds little promise for them, have been quietly leaving.
Last weekend, swimming pools shimmered in the Andean sun at a golf course in Chaclacay, a mountain resort 40 minutes from Lima. Belying the tranquil image, the renter of condominium walked the links, pointing out the houses that remained unvisited because the owners were afraid to risk a weekend outside Lima.
 
Foreign Aid
Rebels' Message: Keep Out of Peru
 A nondescript brick building here carries no sign identifying its mission. Only after an invisible guard screens visitors does a bombproof street door click open. Stepping inside a steel cage, a visitor waits for approval.
The building holds the Peruvian offices of Catholic Relief Services.
The Shining Path has declared war on foreign aid programs. In part, the opposition is doctrinal. Seeking totalitarian control, the movement rejects competition from church, state or the private sector.
To underline its campaign against foreign aid, the Shining Path chose the 11th anniversary of its armed struggle to kill two directors of World Vision International, a Protestant charity with headquarters in Monrovia, Calif., outside Los Angeles.
"We lost six lives in two months," said Corina Villacorta, acting director of World Vision Peru. Two weeks ago, World Vision decided to end virtually all operations here. In December, aid will be stopped to 136 communities and to 22,000 children it has sponsored.
After the guerrillas killed three Japanese agricultural workers in July, the Japanese Government pulled out its entire mission of 52 aid workers.
In a well-secured building that had been East Germany's Embassy, Karl Ahlers, director of the German aid program here, ran a mental checklist: "We have frozen our level of people. The French, the Swiss, the Dutch, the British -- they have all reduced personnel."
Explaining why some aid missions maintain skeleton staffs here, he said, "Psychologically, it would be fatal for Peru if we pulled totally out of the country."
The terrorists have also started attacking religious leaders.
In August, Shining Path squads shot to death three Catholic priests -- two Poles and an Italian. Many analysts say the intimidation campaign caused the Catholic hierarchy's decision two weeks ago to decline a Government invitation to preside over a National Peace Council.
Even harder hit have been Peru's evangelical Protestant churches, which are strong in rural areas.
As many as 1,200 Protestant pastors and lay leaders have been killed in a decade of violence, said Caleb Meza, director of a human rights commission for the National Evangelical Concilium of Peru.
"The pastors often also serve as civil authorities or as leaders of rural defense militias," he said, adding that Peru's army is responsible for about 20 percent of the killings.
 
The Military
Army Is No Match For Cocaine Trade
 Many Peruvians would like to see more effective counterinsurgency operations by their country's military. But the 120,000-soldier army is demoralized by low salaries and old equipment.
"When a typical colonel has to drive a taxi to make ends meet, you know you have problems," a Western diplomat here said. Officers who make $90 a month have proved incapable of standing up to Peru's $1 billion-a-year cocaine business, some of which is controlled by the Shining Path.
Arms aid from the United States, $24 million this year, is running into Congressional opposition because of the Peruvian armed forces' dismal human rights record. This country leads the world in documented cases of disappearances of people taken prisoner by the security forces. Mr. Fujimori has ordered the military to crack down on human rights violators in its ranks.

HEADLINE: Rogue or Reformer, Edwards Seeks Louisiana Vindication

SERIES: Louisiana Showdown: Duke vs. Edwards - Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Even in Louisiana, where politics has always resided in a steamy limbo somewhere between stern moral drama and ribald fruitcake theater, there is something extraordinary in the vision of Edwin W. Edwards as penitent seeking redemption.
"I can't tell you how important this is to me," Mr. Edwards, who faces State Representative David Duke in the Nov. 16 election for governor, told a packed fund-raising event in Lake Charles on Monday night. 
 "No person in Louisiana thought four years ago, or two years ago, or even six months ago, I would ever have the opportunity again given me to leave a legacy and leave a good record. I can't tell you how important this is to Edwin Edwards. I'm not going to miss this opportunity."
After dominating Louisiana politics for two decades, first as a colorful populist who symbolized the glories of the oil boom, then as a discredited rogue who was booted out of office when the boom went bust, Mr. Edwards, the only three-time governor in Louisiana history, is back seeking a fourth term.
His is an unlikely comeback in every way. Mr. Edwards's opponent is a former Nazi and Ku Klux Klan leader, which helps explain why Mr. Edwards's longtime enemies in the business establishment are now rallying to his side. And Mr. Edwards has even tried to assume the role of elder statesman after symbolizing the let-the-good-times-roll ethic of the boom years.
Mr. Edwards, who has testified more than 15 times before grand jury investigations and was tried twice, but never convicted, on racketeering charges, has a lot to overcome.
"Just one screw-up, one sleazy friend to get indicted, one more grand jury investigation that sticks, would really turn people against him," said John Maginnis, author of "The Last Hayride," a biography of Mr. Edwards published by Gris Gris Press of Baton Rouge in 1984. "But Edwin Edwards is a very proud man who has everything in life except his good name, and he wants it back, even if he has to give good government to do it."
From the jumbo jets packed with campaign contributors who flew to Paris after his election in 1983 to the racketeering charges, Mr. Edwards symbolized an era when Louisiana was awash in oil money.
 
From City Council To State Capital
 But his story is far more complicated than that. Born poor near Marksville in central Louisiana 64 years ago, Edwin Washington Edwards first ran for office in 1954, when he was elected to the City Council in Crowley, in the Cajun country of southwest Louisiana.
That victory began a string of victories that took him to the State Senate in 1964, to Congress in 1965 and to the governor's mansion in 1971.
That year, he beat a 17-candidate field that included two cousins of Huey Long; Jimmie Davis, the former governor and country western star; David Chandler, a Life magazine writer who was running to write a book about it, and State Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, later to be a United States Senator.
The first Governor of Cajun descent to be elected since Reconstruction, he won with a coalition of blacks, Cajuns and blue-collar whites and took office pledging reform and racial unity. He took the oath in French and English, exchanged a Gallic embrace with his brother Nolan and proclaimed:
"To the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the thousands of black Louisianans who have not yet enjoyed the full bounty of the American dream, we extend not a palm with alms, but the hand of friendship."
He made breakthroughs in hiring minorities, eliminated a chronic budget crisis and got the Legislature to agree to a constitutional convention that led to a modernization of the State Constitution. He pushed through legislation changing the method of taxing oil from a flat rate to a percentage of value, a change that paved the way for the boom years.
After serving the two consecutive terms allowed by law, he left office in 1979 more popular than when he was first elected -- a feat no one had pulled off since the days of Huey Long.
 
Silvery Good Looks In an Era of Glitter
 With his quick quips, silvery good looks, and bayou charm, Mr. Edwards did more than preside over the boom. He personified the spirit of a time when the biggest crime was to be boring. In one of his most famous quips, he said of his Republican successor, David Treen, "He's so slow, it takes him an hour and a half to watch '60 Minutes.' "
But even during the height of his popularity, Mr. Edwards had a personal record that might have sunk anyone else. His womanizing was so well known that when asked by reporters if he feared that his phone was being tapped, he said no, then added, "Except by jealous husbands."
He gambled tens of thousands of dollars (his own) at the craps tables in Las Vegas, made light of allegations that state offices were sold to campaign contributors, and somehow escaped unscathed from one scandal after another, including his admission in 1976 that the South Korean lobbyist Tongsun Park had given his wife a $10,000 gift.
"There's a big difference between what's illegal and what causes you people to raise your eyebrows," he told reporters. But when he was re-elected to an unprecedented third term in 1983, the boom was already over, and so was its laissez-faire morality.
He was tried twice in Federal court on charges that while out of office he earned $2 million as part of a conspiracy to obtain and sell lucrative hospital and nursing home approvals and then aided the conspiracy when he returned to office in 1984.
Prosecutors said he illegally used his influence to aid the applications of associates, who then sold the permits at huge profits to developers. They also alleged that he furthered the conspirary while in office by calling for a moratorium on further permits.
Mr. Edwards never denied making money on the transaction but denied doing anything illegal.
A 1985 trial ended in a hung jury. A 1986 retrial ended in acquittal. But the image of influence peddling had more sting in tough times than it might have during the boom. And while he was tied up in court, the state's budget, like all those in the Oil Patch, was spinning out of control.
In 1987, Mr. Edwards, who had never lost a political race in his life, finished second to Buddy Roemer in the open primary and withdrew from the runoff, seemingly ending his colorful career.
But Mr. Edwards never considered that the end. In fact, his son Stephen said, Mr. Edwards had begun planning his comeback two weeks before his defeat, when it became obvious that the tide was running against him.
Mr. Edwards got his revenge on Oct. 19, when Mr. Roemer finished third in the primary, behind him and Mr. Duke. But Mr. Edwards is quick to say that he ran not to avenge a defeat but to redeem his good name.
"There's no way I would go through what I've gone through simply to beat somebody," he said. "I have a more important goal, that is to be a good governor and leave a good record."
 
A Political Marriage Is an Uneasy One
 "This last campaign is for him," said his son Stephen, a partner in his father's law firm. "At 64 years old, he doesn't need the work. He doesn't need the money. It's the only chance and the last chance for him to change his image and his place in history."
In the world turned upside down by David Duke, Mr. Edwards now finds himself supported by all the corporate, good-government interests who had always considered him anathema.
It is anything but a natural marriage. In fact, there is widespread fear that a corrupt Edwards administration that could last eight years could be a bigger menace than an ineffective Mr. Duke for four years.
"There are still lots of what I call good people that can't vote for Edwards," said Mark Drennen, president of the business-oriented Public Affairs Research Council in Baton Rouge. "They just know too many political deals that were cut."
But Mr. Edwards has promised to put together a diverse business coalition and keep on State Inspector General Bill Lynch, a former reporter who has dogged him through the years, in an effort to insure clean government.
Even the skeptics admit that no one in Louisiana is a smarter politician or a more adept master of the legislative process than Edwin Edwards. "A lot of us have said, 'Wouldn't it be great if the Governor were a combination of Edwards's political skill and Roemer's integrity and progressive government issues?' " Mr. Drennen said. "If he's sincere, he has the experience and the skills to pull off some major reforms."
Still, some wonder whether Mr. Edwards knows how to mount a real reform agenda even if he wants to, or if he will be committed to resolving the state's enormous environmental problems after a dismal record in the past.
 
Desire Still Bright If the Magic Isn't
 Mr. Edwards has promised that he will attract good jobs and work effectively for reform with the Legislature in a way that eluded Mr. Roemer. But other than a proposal to build a new airport in New Orleans, he has offered few initiatives.
Even the old Edwards personal magic seems to have dimmed.
When Mr. Edwards and Mr. Duke appeared recently at the International Rice Festival in Mr. Edwards's hometown of Crowley, Mr. Edwards looked stiff and subdued as he rode in a blue Chevrolet van. Mr. Duke rode standing up in the front seat of an open bright red 1950's Thunderbird, smiling expansively as the breeze ruffled his blow-dried blond hair.
Mr. Maginnis said that in a state where even good-government types like Mr. Roemer are supposed to be mavericks, Mr. Edwards may look like yesterday's populist.
"Duke is the guy that has the maverick appeal that Edwards had," he said. "Edwards represents the populism of Huey Long and the New Deal, which ran out of gas long ago. Duke has the Reagan agenda, which is so hot."
But Mr. Edwards has shown that he has some passion of his own left. He ended his debate Wednesday night with Mr. Duke with an impassioned evocation of Mr. Duke's history of racial and religious extremism.
"While David Duke was burning crosses and scaring people, I was building hospitals to heal them," he began. "When he was selling Nazi hate literature as late as 1989 in his legislative office, I was providing free textbooks for the children of this state."
He went on: "Don't let him divide us. Don't let him separate us from the rest of the nation. Don't let him make a mockery of Louisiana. We're too important, and too good for that."
If the stakes for Louisiana are huge, they're just as large for Mr. Edwards. If he loses, he adds handing Louisiana over to Mr. Duke to the ignominious finale of his last term.
If he wins, he enters the governor's mansion for a fourth term with a chance for redemption.
Asked how he expects his political obituary to read, he doesn't hesitate for a second.
"He had his last best chance and he used it," said Edwin Edwards.

HEADLINE: U.S. Withholding Drug Aid to Peru

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A United States plan to aid Peruvian Government efforts to reduce coca production, a $1 billion industry with connections to the Shining Path guerrilla group, has stalled over charges that the Peruvian Army and security forces are continuing to take payoffs to protect cocaine traffickers, Administration and Congressional officials say.
United States officials report that Peruvian Army units have repeatedly shot at police helicopters on drug interdiction and herbicide-spraying missions, including once last month when an agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency was on board. Although no one was hurt, the incident revived the fears expressed by members of Congress who opposed the Administration's plan to send military advisers to Peru to train its security forces in antidrug techniques. 
 The Government of President Alberto K. Fujimori has been unable to discipline officers and troops who refuse to halt smugglers' flights from Peru, the leading producer of coca, to Colombia, where it is refined into cocaine for export to the United States and Europe. Recognizing the unreliability of the Peruvian security forces, Congress has frozen the $24.9 million military aid program and $60 million more in economic assistance.
"There is a policy gridlock with regard to Peru," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. "The Administration's entire strategy of using the police and army against the traffickers is flawed because they are totally and completely corrupted."
 
'No Police Inspections'
 Mr. Torricelli reported that on a trip to Peru two weeks ago, drug administration personnel told him that Peruvian military commanders were receiving protection fees from traffickers.
"I saw airplanes leaving municipal airports for Colombia under the instruction of air traffic conptrollers with no police inspections," he added. "They say they don't have jurisdiction to intervene in the cocaine flights."
A State Department official who monitors Peru acknowledged: "We're not ready to disburse the money. Right now, the Peruvians haven't fulfilled the conditions."
But officials say the aid program is critical to their antidrug efforts since most of the cocaine that is consumed in the United States originates in the Peruvian Andes. They say the war on drugs is directly linked to the war on the Shining Path, since the rebels protect growers and may even cultivate coca plants themselves to finance their insurgency.
The divergent priorities of Lima and Washington may work against one another. While the primary objective of the Bush Administration is to reduce cocaine supplies, Peruvian officials fear that eradication of coca cultivation could further impoverish the Indian peasantry. If the army is seen as taking away their incomes, some officers say, more peasants will join the ranks of Shining Path. Such thinking, ironically, sometimes places the army and the guerrillas on the same side of the drug war.
In September, the Administration reluctantly accepted cuts and conditions set by Congress on the proposed aid program, which included sending a few dozen American military trainers to help Peruvian forces improve their antinarcotics abilities and performance on human rights.
 
Military Aid Withheld
 Eager for increased American help, the Peruvian military and police forces have begun to meet the Congressional conditions on human rights, but they are failing to meet the Congressional condition that they improve their performance in the war on drugs. The Administration has not yet released any of the $24.9 million in military aid, and while it is preparing to give Congress a report on Peruvian human rights performance this week and release $22 million in economic aid, it has delayed consultations with Congressional leaders on Peruvian progress in the drug war.
State Department officials said they were still optimistic that United States military aid would eventually flow to Peru, but they acknowledged that it would be politically difficult and perhaps even counterproductive to report to Congress that Peru was improving its performance in the drug war any time soon.
The Peruvian Ambassador, Roberto Maclean, conceded that "corruption in the armed forces is a problem," but he said his country could not address such shortcomings without Washington's help in training the security forces and providing aid to provide crop alternatives to peasants who grow coca to eke out a living.
The Administration originally intended to send Special Forces and Navy personnel to train two Peruvian Army combat battalions, create river patrols and refurbish Peruvian Army helicopters and Air Force combat jets. The trainers were to concentrate on improving coordination between the army and the police in antidrug operations. Congress has already cut the program intended to train the two battalions.
The economic aid program was intended to complement the military aid by providing money for Government programs that encourage growers to substitute beans, tomatoes and other crops for coca. But American officials are now reporting that while coca farmers are planting vegetable and fruit substitutes, they are clearing jungle lands to expand their cocaine crops as well.
 
Growing U.S. Involvement
 The United States has increased its involvement in the war against Peruvian cocaine over the last four years. Since 1987, Drug Enforcement Administration officials and antidrug officers under State Department contract have worked at the American-built Santa Lucia base in the coca-growing Upper Huallaga Valley advising the police on eradication and on maintaining helicopters and other equipment. Beginning in October 1989, United States Army Special Forces have instructed 800 Peruvian police officers in jungle drug interdiction.
State Department officials said they still had confidence that Mr. Fujimori would eventually fulfill their demands that he clean up the military. "He listens to our concerns," said a State Department official, who noted that Lima had made much progress in the last month in improving its human rights record.
In recent weeks, fulfilling major Congressional conditions for aid, military prisons have been opened to inspections by international human rights monitors, and military units have begun to register the detention of all suspects with a central registrar. And last week the army for the first time charged an army officer with murder.

HEADLINE: Health Plans That Cut Costs Gaining Favor

BYLINE: By GLENN KRAMON

 BODY:
With reassuring advertisements starring Snoopy, Gene Kelly and New Yorkers themselves, insurance companies are urging employers and employees in the metropolitan area to join cost-conscious health plans. And after years of resistance, they are finding many takers.
The health plans are built around networks of doctors and hospitals that have agreed to charge lower-than-normal fees and to allow reviews of their methods. 
 The plans offer employers a chance to limit health-care expenses. They offer employees lower costs -- most pay almost nothing beyond what their employers pay -- as well as freedom from burdensome claim forms, coverage for preventive care like cancer screening and insurer review of their treatment.
 
Resistance to Constraints
 Some of these "managed care" networks are simply variations on the health-maintenance and preferred-provider organizations that have been around for years but have never gained wide popularity in the metropolitan region, largely because employers in the region, unlike their counterparts in places like the West Coast and Minneapolis, resisted constraints on the freedom to choose doctors. They offered plans based on networks only as an option, if at all.
Many new plans have met objections about freedom of choice by allowing members to decide whether to use network doctors and be fully covered or go outside the network and pay more themselves.
But with those changes, with the region in the grip of a recession and with medical costs rising sharply, a growing number of employers are forcing their workers into network plans or creating stronger financial incentives to join.
 
Large Corporations
 As a result, "the New York metro area is beginning to look a lot like other parts of the country," said Joseph W. Duva, a partner at Ernst & Young specializing in managed care. "We're seeing a lot of employers adopt managed-care programs." They include large corporations -- among them, A.T.&T., Citicorp, I.B.M., American Express, Grumman, Pepsico, Macy's and Xerox -- as well as government employers -- including New York City and the states of New York and New Jersey.
They also include a growing number of midsized businesses and organizations, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Hunts Point Multi-Service Center, and even companies with as few as five employees, like Randall Decorators on Staten Island and Allied Metal in the Bronx.
About a quarter of those insured by employers in the region now use some form of medical network, and the number is expected to grow, said William R. Broyles, publisher of the National Managed Care Newsletter in Washington. Some of that growth may be a result of heavy advertising by a variety of commercial and nonprofit insurers. One of the most aggressive, U.S. Healthcare, has used upbeat commercials featuring Gene Kelly ("Singin' in the Rain"), Maurice Chevalier ("Thank Heaven for Little Girls") and Louis Armstrong ("A Lot of Livin' to Do"). Metropolitan Life has enlisted its spokesman, the "Peanuts" character Snoopy.
The Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, a classic health maintenance organization known as HIP, is countering with lighthearted ads emphasizing the diversity of the people it covers. And Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has used its top executives in full-page advertisements with the slogan "Bet You Didn't Know" to talk about a medical network introduced last summer.
The battle for new insurance customers is being fought as a growing number of people -- the self-employed and those whose small employers do not offer insurance benefits -- are unable to find affordable coverage anywhere.
And it is not clear that the networks will limit medical-cost increases enough to satisfy employers. If they don't, "we will move much more toward government regulation, as every other country has," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health-insurance expert at Princeton University. "This is the last hurrah for the market approach to running the health-care system."
The networks come in several forms. The traditional health maintenance organization receives a fixed, prepaid fee for each enrolled employee, no matter how much treatment that employee requires, and employs doctors or contracts with them for full-time service. An employee must commit to membership at the beginning of the year and choose a doctor -- usually an internist or family practitioner -- who oversees care and makes referrals to specialists. The organization provides no coverage for treatment provided by doctors outside the network. Many employees choose such plans for lower costs.
 
Challenged in Westchester
 The nonprofit HIP, which began in 1944 and now has more than a million members, is the dominant health maintenance organization in New Jersey, New York City, Long Island and Westchester. It is being challenged in Westchester by Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit giant from the West Coast that will expand in a new health center in White Plains next spring.
Other network health plans try to offer a wide selection of physicians and hospitals in diverse locations as a way of making themselves attractive. Doctors in these plans may work for more than one network. Some of them receive fixed, prepaid fees; others are paid for each service they render. Patients are not covered for treatment outside the network.
U.S. Healthcare, a publicly held company, operates this style of network, as do such big commercial insurers as Metropolitan Life, Prudential, Aetna, Cigna, Travelers and New York Life.
Some independent networks have entered the field. On Long Island, there is ChoiceCare, owned by Winthrop University Hospital and a Buffalo plan. In Westchester and Connecticut, there is Physicians Health Services, largely owned by a group of physicians. And throughout the region is Oxford Health Plans, which recently offered stock to the public.
By far the fastest-growing type of health plan is one that operates a network but will pay something for treatment outside it. Almost every insurer is moving to offer such a plan.
U.S. Healthcare is among the latest to join the trend. One employee it covers is Harvey Hershey, who works in sales at Towne Office Supply in Manhattan. If Mr. Hershey stays within the network, he pays just $2 to visit a specialist, $2.50 for a prescription and nothing to see his primary physician or for a hospital stay or preventive care or a lab test. And he no longer files claims -- that is the doctor's responsibility.
If Mr. Hershey goes outside the network, he must pay a $250 deductible ($500 for family coverage) and 25 percent of the bill beyond that, up to an annual maximum of $2,500, or $7,500 for a family. By offering such escape clauses, insurers hope to persuade people who are wary of network plans to try them out.
 
Limiting Increases
 In theory, if more employees use the cost-effective physicians in a network, the employer saves more. Insurers say networks can limit the annual increase in an employer's medical costs to 10 to 15 percent or even less, compared with more than 20 percent under plans that do not provide cost controls.
Insurers are also trying to prove that they care as much about quality as about price. Like some other insurers, U.S. Healthcare checks physicians' credentials and malpractice records when considering them for its network. It also surveys patients about how satisfied they are and uses these surveys and a twice-a-year audit of medical records to determine the doctor's compensation.
If enough employees can be sold on the networks, or if medical costs continue to climb, insurers are likely to cut back or eliminate the out-of-network coverage. That would save employers money because it would cut administrative costs and because they would be paying only the doctors offering better financial deals.
The networks do have problems. The physicians and hospitals are not always convenient for employees, particularly those living in outlying areas. And physicians sometimes drop out of networks, forcing members to find new doctors.
Networks may complicate life, Mr. Hershey said. "You have to go through your primary-care physician before you can see a specialist," he said.
What is more, the medical networks add administrative expenses, typically equal to 5 percent of the employer's medical bill.
Finally, said Mark V. Pauly, a health economist at the Wharton School, all these efforts to restrain costs may be swamped by the added expense of new kinds of treatments and the eagerness of patients and doctors to try them even if the chance of success is low. For all the new cost-control apparatus, it is still hard to say no to a patient.

HEADLINE: Arriving in Tokyo, Baker Starts 3-Nation Asia Tour

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived in Tokyo today at the start of a politically risky Asian tour likely to determine whether relations between China and the United States remain strained or can begin to recover in the aftermath of Beijing's violent crackdown on democracy advocates in 1989.
After stops in Japan and South Korea, Mr. Baker is to travel on Friday to Beijing in the highest-level visit by a Bush Administration official since the Tiananmen Square killings of June 1989. Although Mr. Baker's trip is going ahead as planned, President Bush last week responded to domestic political concerns by canceling a planned Asian tour beginning late this month. 
 Administration officials say that secret contacts between Washington and Beijing have assured Mr. Baker that he will not leave China empty-handed or embarrassed. But it is far from certain that members of Congress will be satisfied with what he extracts from the Chinese in the key areas of arms control, human rights and trade.
 
Solarz 'Uneasy'
 "I am uneasy with this trip," said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, and a leader of efforts to punish China for the crackdown. "If Baker comes back and demonstrates that the trip was justified in the areas of our concern, fine. If he comes back as empty-handed as some others in the Administration before him, the trip will be rightly judged as not only a failure, but a mistake."
Mr. Solarz argued that if Mr. Baker "gives the present Chinese leadership gratuitous legitimacy" without getting anything substantial in return, the debate over the Administration's China policy will likely be rekindled. An unimpressive result might also give new impetus to efforts to strip China of "most-favored-nation" trading benefits, which the Administration renewed in June.
 
Movement Is Seen
 An Administration expert involved in planning the trip said, "The Chinese have been doing some things -- not in the human rights area -- in a direction which we see as more positive than negative and we would like to encourage them to continue that movement.
"Look, everyone has mixed feelings about this trip," the official added. "I supported it because you cannot talk credibly about Asia, about Japan becoming a regional power, about the future security architecture in Asia and leave China unattended. It is too important. You avoid China at your peril."
Chinese leaders, the official said, "will want the maximum to give themselves face out of this visit. They will limit their cooperation in the absence of such meetings in order to get that. You go into it aware of that, and it is just a question of how you deal with it."
Bush Administration officials cite several areas where they contend the Chinese are moving in the right direction. The first is their agreement in principle to sign the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons. Others include Beijing's limited cooperation on Middle East arms control -- which primarily involves not yet delivering missiles contracted for by Syria -- and its commitment in principle to join the Missile Technology Control Regime. Finally, on Sept. 23, the Chinese agreed to begin talks on assuring Washington that it will not export to the United States goods produced by prison labor.
 
Cooperation With Iran
 And then there are the areas where Washington will try to prevent further deterioration, like China's increasing nuclear cooperation of with Iran.
What Mr. Baker will apparently try to win from the Chinese is some sort of ironclad commitments not to sell nuclear technology to countries like Iran, Syria or Pakistan, nor any ballistic missiles. Even if the Chinese sign the treaty controlling missile technology, the question is how closely they will abide by it. The treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons is before the Chinese legislature and the Chinese authorities are saying it must be passed there first, although the regime could push it through any time.
"The Chinese are very good at appearing to make concessions and then not doing it," said a Congressional staff expert on China. "That is why the assurances have to be ironclad."
Because so many other issues have captured the headlines in recent years, American trade problems with China have been largely lost from view, but they are extremely serious. To control inflation in recent years the Chinese have clamped down tightly on imports, devalued their currency and erected import-license trade barriers to support their state-owned enterprises -- including those that depend on prison labor. This has led to diminished American exports to China and a trade defict in 1990 of about $10.5 billion.
 
Talks on Market Access
 The United States is already engaged in negotiations with the Chinese over market access. Another yardstick for the success or failure of Mr. Baker's trip will be the extent to which it can speed up these negotiations.
The area where Congress will be most closely watching Mr. Baker's trip, however, will be in the field of human rights. Legislation that would strip China of its preferential trading status is now on hold in Congressional committees; whether the legislation is revived will depend in part on how many political prisoners the Chinese release amonng those arrested since the 1989 crackdown.
Amnesty International estimates that there are roughly 800 such political prisoners, and Congressional experts hope that half will be freed, including some prominent dissidents.
Before Mr. Baker visits Beijing, he will be making his inaugural stopover in Seoul, the South Korean capital.
The most pressing issue now on the Korean-American agenda, say American officials, is what can be done about quickening pace of North Korea's nuclear arms program. Some experts believe North Korea is only 6 to 12 months away from producing a bomb.

HEADLINE: Bishops and Liberals Split on Agendas

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A group of liberal and radical Roman Catholics meeting to discuss changes in church structures only smiled and shrugged when they learned that a major item on the agenda at this week's meeting of Catholic bishops was whether to trim the number of days when the faithful are obliged to attend Mass.
"You can't even explain Holy Days of Obligation to most of our kids," said one of those attending the meeting here, Robert McClory of Evanston, Ill. "It's hard enough to get them to go to church on Sunday." 
 At their semiannual conference in Washington Monday through Thursday, the several hundred bishops will be dealing with a number of substantive issues, like the environment and the needs of American Indians. But they have become extraordinarily cautious when it comes to taking up matters of internal church change. The scope of their actions has steadily narrowed as a result of Vatican pressure and of the appointment of more conservative bishops by Pope John Paul 2d.
 
Issue on Masses
 The bishops are expected to vote on rules that narrowly define the circumstances in which lay people can preach at Masses. But the meeting of Catholics here was more concerned with whether small groups of lay people that formed to worship together or for community action should celebrate Mass without an ordained priest. Such practices have arisen because of a shortage of priests and because of a growing dissatisfaction in some circles with church laws that bar women from ordination and that require celibacy among priests.
The differences in the agendas reflects some of the gaps that exist between the bishops and Catholics who are becoming increasingly outspoken.
The meeting here was sponsored by groups on the liberal-to-radical wing of Catholicism in this country, making the 1,000 people in attendance by no means representative of the nation's 55 million Catholics. But in their ranks are people who have been extremely active in church affairs.
Among them are many who were prominent in the Call to Action of 1976, a national conference in Detroit of Catholic laity and clergy that was sponsored by the bishops in honor of the American Bicentennial. This weekend's meeting observed the 15th anniversary of that conference, which recommended changes in church structures and teachings that the Vatican considered out of bounds.
Although a series of public hearings leading to the 1976 meeting influenced the bishops' 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear arms and 1986 letter on the American economy, most of the recommendations were shelved. It also brought together about 125 members of the hundreds of small Catholic groups that were formed for worship and community action by people who are dissatisfied with their parishes or who are at odds with church policies.
Not long ago, the idea of carrying out the Eucharistic rite without an ordained priest would have been almost universally viewed by Catholics as heretical, if not sacrilegious. Some people at this gathering still appeared to be uncomfortable with the idea of departing from church practices regarding ordination, fearing that it would shock or antagonize most Catholics. But there were virtually no objections, at least in principle, to such practices.
"There's a feeling that a lot of those issues don't really matter anymore or are simply legalistic," said Mary Ann Savard, an officer of Call to Action, a Chicago group that was the chief sponsor of the meeting. "A lot of people have moved beyond where the bishops are and will figure out a way to do Eucharist."
 
A Bid for Change
 Two years ago the group ran advertisements in newspapers nationwide as part of an effort to obtain 100,000 signatures in support of changes in the Catholic church. These included the opening of the priesthood to women and married men, reconsideration of church teachings on sex, establishment of due process in disciplinary actions and financial accountability at all levels, and participation by the laity in the selection of bishops.
The 100,000 signatures have proved hard to obtain. To date, the group has received about 21,000. Call to Action says it has 9,000 members, about 25 percent to 30 percent of them in the Chicago area. The advertisements were sharply criticized by conservative Catholics, many of whom also criticize church officials because they say the hierarchy does not take strong enough measures against Catholics like those meeting here.
Despite the frustration with church leadership -- almost all remarks about conservative bishops drew laughter -- the meeting's mood was subdued rather than angry. Anger did surface in a few workshops, like one entitled "Pedophilia and a Patriarchal Church," linking scandals about church negligence of sexual abuse of children by priests to rules on celibacy and to what was called greater concern for the institution's reputation and clergy than with victims.
In addition, a few speakers noted that the vast majority of people attending the conference were white and middle-class. Many appeared to be between 50 and 60 years old. A large majority were women.
There will be a much larger presence of minorities, although not, of course, women, in the ranks of the bishops and on their agenda. For example, the bishops will consider a statement expressing the concerns of American Indians to next year's commemoration of Columbus's arrival in the Americas as presented in a document that was partially written by two American Indian bishops. It also will discuss plans for a national congress of black Catholics and for a ministry among Hispanic Catholics.
Among other sponsors of the conference here were the Women's Ordination Conference; Corpus, an association promoting a married priesthood; the Association for the Rights of Catholics in the Church; Dignity, an organization of homosexual Catholics, and Network, a liberal Catholic lobbying group.

HEADLINE: Boston Ignores a Trend In Re-Electing a Mayor

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
It was just an impulse, as it often is for Raymond L. Flynn, that prompted him to take a break from campaigning for re-election as Mayor one recent morning to drop in at the Gavin Middle School in South Boston.
How are things going? Mayor Flynn asked the principal, Joseph Lee. Fine, said Mr. Lee, except that the school had no books; the School Department had failed to deliver them. Outraged, Mr. Flynn was soon making a blizzard of phone calls and eventually tracked down the missing volumes. 
 The incident was classic Ray Flynn, who bypassed television and radio advertising in the last election to campaign door to door and who runs several miles a day, making frequent stops to chat with passersby. His strategy paid off: Mr. Flynn won a record-high 75 percent of the vote in his re-election to a third term last Tuesday.
The triumph of the 52-year-old Democrat was all the more remarkable because it came when Boston is mired in its worst economic slump since the Depression and in an election season in which voters around the country vented their anger by ousting incumbents.
 
'An Untypical Politician'
 Mr. Flynn's victory marks him as the most popular politician in Massachusetts, according to John Marttila, a Democratic political consultant here, who cited a variety of private polls that show the Mayor's approval rating surpassing that of Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican.
His impressive showing would make him a strong contender for Governor or possibly as a Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, said Mr. Marttila, who has been a consultant to several of Democratic Presidential aspirants. Mr. Flynn has also gained national recognition as a spokesman on urban issues in his tenure as president of the National Conference of Mayors.
"Ray is really an untypical politician, because he touches average people in the way few politicians these days can," Mr. Marttila said. "He makes people feel that he cares."
Mr. Flynn's appeal, which some critics deride as more style than substance, grows out of a humble boyhood that fixed in him a conviction that "all politics is personal."
Mr. Flynn's father was a longshoreman, often in poor health and out of work, and his mother was a cleaning woman. Mr. Flynn made his way out of poverty by getting a basketball scholarship to Providence College and eventually a tryout with the Boston Celtics. He didn't make the team, and instead got involved in politics, working on Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey's Presidential campaign in 1968 and later being elected to the state legislature to represent his old neighborhood, South Boston. Today he still lives in a modest row house in "Southie," a working-class district on the waterfront.
"I don't have to read memos to know what is going on out there," Mr. Flynn said, sitting in his City Hall office, his feet propped on a coffee table. On the wall is an old campaign poster of his political idol, Mr. Humphrey, who was Mayor of Minneapolis before his terms as a United States Senator and the Vice President.
The Boston press has chided Mr. Flynn for his penchant for showing up at fires or at the scene of racial disturbances, saying that he spends more time getting his picture on television than solving the city's problems.
But voters have reacted differently. "The vast majority of the people who voted for him actually know him," said Ira Jackson, a deputy mayor under Mr. Flynn's predecessor, Kevin H. White, and now a senior vice president of the Bank of Boston. "In today's world, with problems spiraling out of control, that is very reassuring. The voters know Ray will be there."
In fact, a Boston Globe poll last August of 814 registered voters found that 43 percent said they had met Mr. Flynn personally.
 
Challenge of a New Term
 The challenge for the peripatetic Mr. Flynn now, as he enters his third four-year term, is whether personal politics will still be enough.
In his first two terms, Mr. Flynn was widely given credit for easing racial tension that had grown out of a conflict over court-ordered school busing in the mid-1970's. Although he had opposed the busing himself at the time, Mr. Flynn as Mayor made a concerted effort to reach out to Boston's black population, opening predominantly white housing projects to blacks. He restored many of the city's neglected neighborhood parks. And he increased the number of blacks, Hispanics and Asians on the city payroll to 22 percent from 6 percent. Minorities make up 35 percent of Boston's population.
But in the past few years Mr. Flynn has come under growing criticism from some prominent blacks for racial insensitivity.
 
Justice and Education
 In particular, blacks have complained about police behavior, especially in the handling of the investigation of the fatal shooting in 1989 of Carol Stuart and her unborn baby. Her husband, Charles Stuart, claimed the couple had been attacked by a black gunman.
An angry Mr. Flynn called for every available detective to join the investigation, and the police soon disclosed they had a suspect, a black man with a long criminal record. But Mr. Stuart stunned the city a few months later when he apparently committed suicide by jumping off a bridge after one of his brothers implicated him in the killing.
A second issue has developed out of Mr. Flynn's successful drive to replace the elected Boston School Committee with an appointed board. In Mr. Flynn's view, as well as that of some blacks, the quarrelsome School Committee was an obstacle to improving Boston's poor public schools. He will begin appointing the new committee January 1.
But in a city where blacks have held little political power, several prominent blacks believe that Mr. Flynn's dissolution of the old school committee, which had four blacks among its 13 members, was an attack on them, although his aides have indicated that the Mayor may appoint two blacks, a Hispanic person and an Asian to the new, seven-member committee.
"Here is someone not of our community saying, 'I will select your leaders for you,' " said the Rev. Graylan Ellis Hagler, who finished third and was eliminated in the September preliminary election for Mayor.
Mr. Flynn acknowledged that the fight has "caused me some pain." But in his view the schools hold the key to the future of Boston, a city that has been transformed into a center of universities, medical research and investment management. Mr. Flynn wants to streamline what he regards as the bloated bureaucracy of the school system as well as restore athletic programs and improve vocational education.
"School is the ladder out of poverty," he said. "So I will take everyone on to make the schools better."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Defends His Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
As he prepared to depart for South Africa yesterday, Mayor David N. Dinkins strongly defended his long-term fiscal plan against the blunt criticism of Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who urged the Mayor over the weekend to abandon it.
"It is our plan," the Mayor said.
"It's not just Felix." 
 But the Mayor said that "we're willing to talk with all the other players," and in his absence, the Mayor said, First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Philip R. Michael, the budget director, would meet with Mr. Rohatyn and his aides, among others, to "fine-tune" the plan. The proposal includes a request for $1 billion in M.A.C. funds.
Then the Mayor turned his thoughts ahead and across the ocean to his long-planned and long-awaited mission of solidarity to South Africa's blacks. His luggage bulging with coloring books, balloons and used math and science textbooks for schoolchildren, the Mayor left New York last night with an entourage of more than three dozen city officials and private business people.
As Mayor of the city with the largest black population in the country, Mr. Dinkins has said it is important for him to keep pressing economic sanctions against the white majority government that has subjugated 30 million South African blacks and to lend support to the black majority. Returning to the continent from which, he often notes, his ancestors were brought "chained and whipped in the hold of a slave ship" will be "a profound, singular experience," he has said.
He is traveling under the auspices of Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader whose triumphal reception in New York last year is often cited by Mr. Dinkins as the high point of his mayoralty.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Foxboro Follies: A Franchise on the Brink

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH

 BODY:
When he was 8 years old, Victor Kiam peddled Cokes to people as they waited for streetcars in New Orleans' sweltering bayou heat. Thus began the career of a man who through years of hustling, ingenuity, diligence and self-promotion crafted himself into a consummate entrepreneur.
Kiam's leveraged buyout of Remington Products from Sperry-Rand for $25 million in March 1979 and the strategies that then sparked Remington's worldwide sales from $43 million to $250 million in nine years are material for business-school courses. But Kiam's purchase of the New England Patriots in October 1988 for $85 million could end up damaging his image as an adept businessman. 
 Last year, the perception of Kiam as the jovial customer-turned-owner of Remington, cultivated through a series of television ads hawking his shavers, suffered heavy damage as he bungled the handling of sexual-harassment allegations by Lisa Olson, then a Boston Herald reporter, against three Patriots players. In the midst of the controversy, Kiam was quoted as using a profane term to describe Olson. He denied doing so, but months later, he openly made her the subject of an off-color joke.
 
Moment of Truth
 The three Patriot players and the team itself were eventually fined by the National Football League in the Olson incident, but as damaging as that decision was to Kiam, he faces an even more crucial moment of reckoning tomorrow.
The 1988 agreement between Kiam and Francis Murray, his partner in taking over the Patriots, stipulated that Kiam, who was buying 51 percent of the team, had to purchase Murray's 49 percent share after three years if Murray demanded it. Murray has made this demand, and is seeking $38 million, which Kiam has had trouble raising.
If Kiam doesn't come up with the money, or someone else to buy out Murray, by tomorrow, the league will in effect take over the team, but Murray will run it from day to day and will be allowed to seek a buyer in order to get his money back.
Murray will then move on to St. Louis, where he is part of a group trying to land an N.F.L. expansion team.
Kiam will be left with nothing but bad memories and, most likely, debts. The proceeds of an eventual sale of the Patriots will go first to covering Murray's share, then to covering a fee for the league. Only if there is something left over will Kiam get back any of the money he borrowed to purchase the team from William (Billy) Sullivan in 1988. As late as Friday, the N.F.L. was trying to help Kiam, who will be 65 years old next month, arrange a financial solution that would enable him to maintain control of the team.
 
Remington Also Under Pressure
 Compounding Kiam's problems is Remington's loss of market share in men's and women's shavers to the industry leader, Norelco, and to Braun, a recent entry in the market for expensive electric shavers.
Rich Dzieruua, the associate editor of Appliance Magazine, said that Remington's share of men's shavers on the market dropped from 30 percent to 28 percent from 1989 to 1990, and that its share of women's shavers dropped from 51 percent to 30 percent from 1989 to 1990.
Dzieruua said his research on market share only reflected the number of units produced for the market and did not track actual sales. But an article in the May 6, 1991, issue of Adweek, which used information from Housewares Executive, a company that follows the manufacturing and sale of household products, reported that Remington's overall sales dropped by an estimated $50 million from the end of 1989 to the end of 1990, to about $200 million.
How Kiam, the son of a lawyer who sold Government bonds on Wall Street, could go from being such a business wizard, and the Patriots' majority owner, to standing on the brink of no return in just three years is a complex study in making a bad deal for a bad team in bad economic times.
Kiam did not return phone calls last week to his office at Remington Products in Bridgeport, Conn. And efforts to arrange an interview through the Patriots were unsuccessful. But at least two people close to the situation were willing to talk about Kiam's predicament.
 
A Victim of Economics
 Norman Braman, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles and a friend of Kiam, was instrumental in advising Kiam to purchase the Patriots. He also advised Kiam almost a year ago to hire Sam Jankovich away from the University of Miami to become New England's general manager in the wake of the team's 1-15 season in 1990.
Braman said recently that Kiam is a victim of tough economic times.
"It's not just Victor," Braman said. "You see it throughout the United States. The banks are having problems. Companies are having problems obtaining capital from banks. There's no secret to that. Victor's problems are tied into the same problems that are facing our economy."
But Jankovich is trying to stop a financial hemorrhage that has been going on since Kiam took over in 1988. The Feb. 25, 1991, issue of Business Week reported that Kiam lost between $5 million and $6 million on the Patriots in 1989 and 1990, respectively.
"Victor is in very good shape, financially, himself," Jankovich said. "He just doesn't have the collateral that he needs to secure large bank loans."
Kiam certainly did not take a financially solvent team and run it into the ground. The team was losing money before he bought it. Last year, Kiam had to ask the N.F.L. to raise the Patriots' debt limit from $35 million to $45 million. The league agreed, with the provision that Kiam keep the team in the Boston area for the next three years.
If he wasn't facing the deadline tomorrow, perhaps Kiam could engineer a Remington-like turnaround with the Patriots over time, Jankovich said.
 
Sold Bras and Girdles
 Kiam, a Navy veteran, graduated from Yale in two and a half years, attended the Sorbonne in Paris and then received a Master's of Business Administration degree from Harvard in 1951. He was a traveling salesman for Lever Brothers, then sold bras and girdles for Playtex before becoming the company's executive vice president. He left Playtex in 1968 to become president of the Benrus Corporation, a watch manufacturer. Kiam left Benrus in 1977, then in 1979 bought Remington Products for $25 million, using $1 million in stock that he owned and borrowing the rest of the money.
Remington had lost more than $30 million between 1976 and 1979. Kiam turned the company around by eliminating 75 executive positions, slashing corporate perks, consolidating manufacturing at the Bridgeport plant and cutting the cost of the shavers.
The decision to buy the Patriots, a team with a history of debt and management wracked by nepotism and cronyism, now appears to have been a questionable one.
One person in the N.F.L. with knowledge of the Patriots' plight, who did not want to be identified, suggested that Kiam might have been motivated by a desire to attain the high profile that goes along with being the owner of a pro football team. "None of the more recent owners buy teams as moneymakers," he said. "They do it because it puts them in the public eye."
For William Sullivan and nine of his friends who in 1960 paid $25,000 each for the Boston Patriots, the eighth team sold in the American Football League, it was a business venture. In 1966, the A.F.L. merged with the N.F.L., taking the Patriots to a higher financial level. To compete, Sullivan found that he had to spend money he didn't have. So, he borrowed. In 1974, Sullivan borrowed $11 million to buy out his partners.
 
Mounting Losses
 When Kiam bought the team, it was $50 million in debt and Foxboro Stadium, owned by William Sullivan's son Chuck had been placed in bankruptcy court with debts totaling $52.6 million. Chuck Sullivan had lost a reported $8 million promoting Michael Jackson's Victory Tour in 1984. Then, in an attempt to recoup his losses, Chuck Sullivan lost another $18 million trying to sell Michael Jackson souvenirs.
In 1988, the N.F.L. forced a sale. Several prospective buyers looked at the Patriots, but they balked at purchasing the team because the $85 million price tag did not include the stadium, which was in bankruptcy court. Murray, who had an option on the team because he loaned the financially strapped Sullivan $22.6 million in 1986, was close to buying the team along with Paul Fireman, the chairman of Reebok. But the stadium situation was not to Fireman's liking. The deal fell through.
Murray, who did not want to lose his option on the team, then joined with Kiam, the Sullivans' choice buyer, in an uneasy alliance. Kiam was gambling that once he purchased the Patriots, he could buy the stadium out of bankruptcy.
He lost big on that gamble in late 1988 when his offer of $19 million for the stadium was topped by a $25 million bid by the K Corporation, which is owned by Boston businessmen Robert Karp and Steve Kraft. K Corporation assumed the over-generous lease arrangement that William Sullivan had worked out with his son, Chuck. The lease, which has 10 years left on it, is generally regarded as one of the worst in the N.F.L.
Under the arrangement, K Corporation gets all the money generated by luxury boxes, concessions and parking, which amounts to about $2.5 million a year, and it gets $1.2 million in rent from the team, including $125,000 a year for Kiam's box. The Patriots also have to pay for stadium security and cleanup.
Not all N.F.L. teams own the stadiums they play in, but most share in the revenue from concessions, parking, luxury boxes and stadium ads. While the biggest revenue generator for teams is the league's television contract, which amounts to $36 million per team this season, money from stadium-related areas can mean the difference between profit and loss, particularly for teams with high player payrolls and big administrative staffs, both of which New England has.
"It is a big problem," Jankovich said of the Patriots' stadium lease. "It's something that we've had to work around since I arrived. If an N.F.L. team is to succeed, it definitely needs a good stadium lease."
Once he became owner, Kiam fumbled in some situations that could have eased his financial burden. He didn't trim the Patriots' administrative staff the way he did when he took over Remington. And Patrick Sullivan, William Sullivan's youngest son, was kept on as the team's general manager as part of the purchase deal.
After the team finished 9-7 in 1988, Kiam increased ticket prices 17 percent for 1989, alienating season-ticket holders who were already complaining about deteriorating conditions at the stadium. The season-ticket sale has dropped from 37,000 in 1988 to 18,000 this year, and attendance has plummeted by an average of nearly 15,000 fans a game in the same span.
The Patriots have gone through three head-coaching changes in Kiam's three years as owner -- from Raymond Berry to Rod Rust to Dick MacPherson. Jankovich estimates the buyouts on the Berry and Rust contracts cost the team $5 million. Add to that bonus-ladened player contracts linked to individual, rather than team, performance, and the financial drain has been significant. The Patriots' player payroll last season was $19.4 million, which ranked it 12th among the league's 28 teams.
Jankovich hopes that Kiam can somehow keep control of the Patriots. And the general manager adds that this is not because Kiam's ouster could put him out of a job.
"He's a very good person," Jankovich said. "He's a guy who lives at the edge. An eternal optimist, who is very bright and who is constantly selling."
What happens to the consummate salesman when nobody's buying? It appears that Victor Kiam is about to find out.

HEADLINE: Adlai & Mario & Ike & George

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston is former chief Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After watching Gov. Mario Cuomo flirting with the Presidency and teasing the press with his mystifying soliloquies, one is reminded of how Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois handled similar doubts in the campaign of 1952.
They have some things in common: the most eloquent politicians of their times and the favorite candidates of their political parties. But otherwise they seem quite different. 
 After Dwight Eisenhower entered the race in 1952, Mr. Stevenson not only felt he couldn't win, he asked, with his mocking humor, how could a man named Adlai defeat a man called Ike? But he also felt his party shouldn't win. The Democrats had been in power for 20 years. The U.S., he told me many times, would never be secure unless the Republican Party joined in a common, nonpartisan foreign policy. It was, he insisted in private, clearly time for a change, and while he finally agreed to run, not once but twice, his heart wasn't really in it. He ran because he thought it was his duty to discuss the great issues of his time, win or lose.
Governor Cuomo is not a man of the 1950's, but a different man of the 1990's, when winning is widely regarded not only as the main thing but the only thing. The Governor of Illinois sort of enjoyed losing, but not the Governor of New York, who has had his share of adversity in life, and his doubts have not been the same as Mr. Stevenson's.
He does not admire George Bush as Mr. Stevenson admired Mr. Eisenhower. He does not regard a Republican victory in 1992 as desirable but as detestable, and, unlike Mr. Stevenson, he is not inhibited by self-doubt or modesty. There is yet one other major difference between them. When Mr. Stevenson died of a heart attack on a London street, Frank Sayre, Woodrow Wilson's grandson, delivered the eulogy at a memorial service in the Washington Cathedral, and concluded by saying: "He had the courage to fail."
This was true. Mr. Stevenson knew from the beginning of both campaigns that he would lose. He was an even more private person than Mr. Cuomo is, and hated the roguery of politics and the clatter and hypocrisy of the campaigns. But he came to believe that in a democracy, if his party wanted him to run, he did not have the right to stand aside.
Governor Cuomo clearly does not share this conviction. It is not that he doesn't have an argument against the Republicans' record of the last 10 years. He condemns their deficits, their hypocrisy and their scandals with withering contempt. And there's nothing in his record to suggest he would do anything but rejoice at the thought of debating President Bush about the causes and consequences of the recession and even about the causes and consequences of the gulf war.
No doubt he hates the prospect of a long primary election campaign, when he would seem to be neglecting his duties and deficits in Albany and have to answer awkward questions from nosy reporters, who have never been his favorite companions.
But his hesitations are beginning to irritate his party and bore the country, and lately he has been blaming his hesitations on the absence of celestial guidance. For example, the other day he told my colleague Maureen Dowd that unlike Saul on the road to Tarsus, he hadn't received a signal from on high to lead the way into the Promised Land -- a remark that put a burden on the voters and the Lord.
But he did get a signal from the Pennsylvania voters that the poor and middle class didn't like to be out of work with no health insurance, that they didn't like George Bush's America Last priorities and that they weren't very confident about the future. In fact, they are beginning to mock the President's optimistic predictions about the economy and to resent his complaint that he is "tired" of Democratic "nitpicking."
This seems to have changed the Governor's tune if not his mind, and opened up the possibility, not of failure, but of success.
I don't think, however, that Governor Cuomo really feels he has a duty to run, and in that he clearly differs from Governor Stevenson.

HEADLINE: WORLD'S APPETITE FOR U.S. PRODUCTS IS STILL INCREASING

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The appetite for American goods and services remains robust around the globe, a sign that exports are likely to remain a bright spot in the otherwise lackluster American economy.
Japanese newspaper readers want color photos. Venezuelan households want top-loading washers. The residents of Indonesia want cleaner air. And American companies are reaping the benefits. 
 "We're seeing strong export business that is keeping the wolf away from the door," said Milton Glass, chairman of the International Business Center of New England, an organization that represents 400 or so area exporters.
 
Small Portion of G.N.P.
 Exports alone cannot turn a foot-dragging recovery into a fast-paced one, because they account for just one-tenth of the gross national product. But their strength can provide much-needed support.
Forecasters at Paine Webber expect exports of goods and services to grow at an average rate of 6 percent after inflation over the next four quarters, compared with the 4 percent gain of the last four quarters. And indeed, export orders, a good indicator of future sales of merchandise, have been expanding at a annual rate of better than 9 percent so far this year.
American exports have a number of things going for them right now, executives and economists say. For one, even though demand is soft in some large markets, lots of smaller ones are thriving. Business is surging in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong; Mexico is booming after nearly a decade of economic decline. And Canada, the biggest customer of the United States, is shaking off recession.
 
Low Production Costs
 The United States also has some of the lowest production costs in the industrialized world. It has sophisticated equipment, materials and services for sale that happen to be in growing demand, including aircraft, specialty chemicals and engineering services. And American companies are displaying a growing worldliness and savoir-faire.
"U.S. companies have found out how to do business overseas," said Paris Nicolaides, vice president of international business development at the Thermo Electron Corporation, a Waltham, Mass., maker of pollution-control devices and other industrial instruments. "Exporters have room to grow just by becoming more proficient in how to sell, how to distribute, how to speak the language. That's the main reason I am optimistic that exports will rise."
During the summer, the three-year boom in American exports paused, reflecting the lingering effects of recessions in Britain and Canada, as well as slowing growth in Germany and Japan. And despite a pickup in many countries, some exports, like food and farm machinery, seem stuck in the doldrums.
Nonetheless, executives and economists alike are hopeful.
"I think 1992 will be an excellent year," said Richard L. Williams, vice president of international dealer networks at Pitney Bowes Inc. in Stamford, Conn.
The resiliency of American exports reflects several trends.
 
Global Slump Mostly Over
 First, the global slump never got so bad as people feared, and now it seems to be mostly over. In Germany and Japan, both major customers for American aircraft, chemicals, paper and other industrial materials, the economies are slowing but seem likely to skirt outright recession.
Worldwide, economic growth slowed from around 3 percent last year to an estimated 2 percent this year, according to DRI/McGraw-Hill, whose economists expect it to reach 3.5 percent next year.
More important, said Robert Gay, an economist at Morgan Stanley, lots of small economies have continued to expand smartly. American exports to Japan and Europe slowed to 4 percent this year, but exports to lesser-developed countries and newly industrialized countries grew at a 14 percent rate.
Despite a deep recession in Brazil, Latin America is growing again after stagnating during the 1980's. The huge trade deficits that South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong used to run with the United States have all but disappeared. Kuwait is slowly rebuilding, and Saudi Arabia is overhauling its oil production.
The mere fact that lots of countries are getting richer and more sophisticated means that they now want -- and can afford -- American brands, said Stephen M. Peterson, a vice president at Giddings & Lewis. The company, based in Fond Du Lac, Wis., is the nation's biggest maker of machine tools and has lately been helping to automate factories in countries like Israel and Taiwan.
The Weyerhaeuser Corporation, for example, expects to ship a quarter of a million metric tons of high-grade newsprint, suitable for color printing, from Tacoma, Wash., to Tokyo this year. The Whirlpool Corporation says its appliance exports to Venezuela and elsewhere will jump 25 percent in 1991. And the Fluor Corporation, the construction giant, is installing anti-pollution devices in Indonesian oil refineries.
Pitney Bowes is helping financial-services companies in South Korea and Taiwan automate their mailings, in place of subcontractors who have stuffed envelopes manually. "These countries are 20 to 30 years behind the U.S. in the state of the mailing process," Mr. Williams of Pitney Bowes said.
The rapid growth of many Asian nations has strained both their infrastructure and environment. Governments are budgeting bigger sums for major projects, from telephone cables to airport runways to sewage treatment plants, Mr. Gay of Morgan Stanley said. Bechtel Group, the San Francisco engineering and construction company, is building a power plant in Indonesia, a subway system in Taiwan and the $16 billion Hong Kong airport.
And thanks to rising environmental consciousness abroad, the Perkin-Elmer Corporation, a Norwalk, Conn., maker of instruments that measure emissions and residues, has opened service and distribution offices this year in Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea.
 
Canada and Mexico
 The United States is also poised for a big boost closer to home. Canada typically buys as much as Germany and Japan combined. Its steep recession ended with a bang this spring when its economy spurted at a 4.5 percent annual rate.
Mexico, which has piled up a record $8 billion in foreign exchange reserves, has lately grown at an annual rate of more than 5 percent and is in the midst of an investment boom. Imports, two-thirds of which come from the United States, have recently soared at a 14 percent annual rate.
As Mexico embraces freer markets, it has knocked down decades-old trade barriers. The first to benefit, Mr. Gay said, have been United States makers of consumer goods, followed by makers of machinery and other capital equipment. "Just look at the pattern in Mexico and you'll see the pattern for other countries," he said.
Appliance sales are surging in Mexico, said Alun Wilson, director of sales and distibution of the Whirlpool Overseas Corporation, a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Benton Harbor, Mich. Sharp tariff reductions and removal of informal trade barriers turned Venezuela into "a very big growth market this year" for American appliances, he added.
In many nations that are selling off state-owned enterprises to private investors, there is a growing appetite for American services. Exports of construction, design and other services have risen 8 percent from a year ago, and the United States services surplus reached an annual rate of $8 billion last spring.
Fluor, the Irvine, Calif., builder, has received hundreds of millions of dollars of work to spruce up Chile's copper industry, which has attracted major equity investments by foreign multinational companies.
"Since the free elections, there's been a lot more interest in having foreign companies take an interest in Chile," said Vic Medina, vice president for mining and metals at Fluor.
United States exports are also riding the coattails of American manufacturing giants like Du Pont, Procter & Gamble and Chrysler, which are busy setting up overseas plants. Expanding multinationals help increase the sales of everything from American insurance policies and engineering services to construction materials and machinery.
Consider what happens when a chain like Toys "R" Us expands overseas. The company's vice chairman, Michael Goldstein, said it expected to scatter 29 more stores across Europe, Canada and Japan next year, bringing the total abroad to 127.
Whenever Toys "R" Us opens new doors, exports of products like Fisher-Price's Little People and Milton Bradley's board games get a lift.
 
Dollar's Weakness Helps
 One big reason American companies are winning a bigger slice of the export pie, especially in Canada and Europe, is that their products remain bargains. "We're very competitive against Asia and hyper-competitive against Europe," said David Rolley, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
The dollar is still weak, up a mere 1 percent from last year against a basket of trading partners' currencies -- and still 40 percent below its 1985 peak. According to DRI/McGraw Hill, the American share of world exports has risen to 27 percent, up from a low of 19 percent in 1985.
"The most important event in the world economy during the 1980's was surely the boom in U.S. manufacturing exports," said Peter F. Drucker, the management consultant.
But American producers' low costs reflect more than the low dollar. United States inflation, which chips away at competitiveness, has declined, especially at the wholesale level. Lower interest rates have made investing in technology cheaper. Wage increases have been smaller than in other nations. And productivity gains on the factory floor keep coming.
 
U.S. Wages Are Below Europe's
 As a result, unit labor costs -- wages at current exchange rates adjusted for output per hour -- are higher in every major European country than in the United States and about the same in Japan. In the mid-80's, unit labor costs were higher in the United States.
And now, even the enormous gap between the United States and the newly industrialized countries like South Korea and Taiwan has shrunk sharply.
"Customers we've never had before are knocking on our door to source products in the U.S.," said Adrian T. Dillon, vice president at the Eaton Corporation, a Cleveland manufacturer whose products include differentials for cars and trucks made in Sweden by Volvo.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the role of exports in the American economy misstated the number of stores planned abroad by Toys "R" Us. It is 29 this year and 40 in 1992.
