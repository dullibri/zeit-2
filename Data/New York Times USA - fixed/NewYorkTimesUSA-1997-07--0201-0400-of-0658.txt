HEADLINE: David Anderson, 60, Ex-Envoy to Belgrade

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
David Anderson, a United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia in the 1980's, died on July 4 in Berlin. He was 60.
The cause of death was a liver disease, family members said. 
 As Ambassador in Belgrade from 1981 to 1985, his main task was to help Yugoslavia cope with a deepening economic crisis by refinancing international loans.
He was born Jan. 3, 1937, in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, and came to the United States in 1952.
After earning a bachelor of arts degree from Union College in 1958, and a master's degree a year later from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, he joined the State Department. His initial overseas posts included embassies in Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Bamako, Mali; Brussels and Bonn.
Mr. Anderson was a member of the United States delegation that negotiated the four-power Berlin Agreement of 1971 with the Soviets, British and French. The pact reduced cold-war tensions and helped pave the way for the unification of Germany.
After retiring from the Foreign Service in 1985, he was a visiting professor of international relations at Simmons College in Boston and in 1988 was named director of the Aspen Institute in Berlin, bringing together scholars and politicians from East and West.
Survivors include his wife, the former Doris Helen Heitmann of Berlin; two children from his first marriage, Natalie of Florham Park, N.J., and Scott of Silver Spring, Md.; his mother, Janet, of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., a brother, Alexander of Burlington, Vt., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Mourning for North Korea Leader Ends, but Son Is Not Anointed

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 8

 BODY:
North Korea reportedly declared an end today to the official three-year mourning period for its late leader, Kim Il Sung, clearing the way for his son, Kim Jong Il, to assume full power.
But it is still not clear when, or even whether, Kim Jong Il will assume his father's titles as President of the country and head of the Communist Party. 
 Some experts predict that Mr. Kim will delay taking the posts for several months at least, because North Korea is suffering from a severe famine, and now is not a propitious time for a coronation.
North Korean diplomats have insisted that Kim Jong Il, who holds the title of supreme commander of the military, has always been fully in charge of the country since his father died at age 82 on July 8, 1994.
But out of respect for his father, they said, the younger Mr. Kim, who is 55, has held off assuming the formal titles until the three-year mourning period was over.
That time is now. "The mourning period is about to end," Kim Yong Nam, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, said in a speech today at a ceremony marking the third anniversary of Kim Il Sung's death, according to Radiopress, a Tokyo agency that monitors North Korean radio broadcasts.
"At this solemn occasion we restate our pledge from the bottom of our hearts to our father, the Great Leader," the minister was quoted as saying, speaking of Kim Il Sung.
The ceremony in Pyongyang, the capital, was held at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, where Kim Il Sung's body has been preserved. Kim Jong Il was shown on North Korean television attending the ceremony, looking confident but not making a speech.
While those who spoke did not refer to Mr. Kim by any new titles, they pledged loyalty to his "monolithic leadership" as "the successor and incarnation" of his father.
North Korea watchers in Seoul and Tokyo say Mr. Kim might formally assume power on Sept. 9, the anniversary of the establishment of the North Korean Government, or on Oct. 10, the anniversary of the founding of the party.
But they said the inauguration might be delayed until next year if the severe famine worsened, the economy continued to deteriorate or efforts to improve relations with the United States, a key goal of the North Korean Government, did not bear fruit.
There is also some speculation that Mr. Kim might become party chief, the job with the real power in North Korea, but not the head of state, because that job involves too many public appearances for the notoriously reclusive man.
"He doesn't want to appear to the public," said Yu Suk Ryul, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, which is affiliated with the South Korean Foreign Ministry. "He doesn't want to talk to foreigners."
Kim Il Sung ruled with an iron hand and a cult of personality for nearly five decades and groomed his son to succeed him. But Kim Jong Il lacks his father's charisma and credentials as a revolutionary, and there have been some doubts as to how firm his hold on power is. If he does not assume power soon, now that the mourning period is over, those doubts will grow.
"If nothing has happened by the end of October, that's significant," a Western expert said. "It means that they've really got problems and he doesn't feel confident that he could take them on."

Average Pay for College Professors Rises Less Than Inflation Rate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The average salary of college professors increased by 3 percent in the 1996-97 academic year, slightly less than the inflation rate, an annual survey by the American Association of University Professors showed.
The average salary for full-time professors was $59,851 at institutions that grant doctorates, $49,259 at institutions that grant up to a master's degree, $43,650 at baccalaureate institutions and $43,016 at two-year colleges. 
 Linda Bell, a professor of economics at Haverford College in Pennsylvania who is the author of the report, concluded that compensation in the last academic year had been "not so good." Dr. Bell found that average faculty members continuing in their jobs had seen a real increase, compared with the 1995-96 salary, of 0.2 percent, the smallest rate of increase in 15 years. But that increase did not keep pace with inflation, so the average faculty member actually experienced a decrease of 0.3 percent in salary, the report said.

From Milk And Mortar, Help and Hope

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
A SIGN in Francisco De Leon's building warns: "No Trespassing. Tenants and Their Guests Only." Right. Mr. De Leon seldom entertains in his Washington Heights apartment, where he has lived on West 163d Street for 20 years. Drug dealers took over the decrepit building and the one next door years ago, conducting their business and settling their disputes without regard for anyone.
"People, our families, nobody wanted to come here," Mr. De Leon said. "This was no place to visit." 
 He walked over to a living-room window, where a bullet fired from the street ripped through the pane five years ago. The hole is still taped over.
"Sometimes, I did not think that I lived in New York," he said. "What's that place where people are always fighting? Bosnia. They had more peace in Sarajevo."
It was not an exaggeration. The two buildings between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue represented perhaps the most abysmal conditions housing advocates and officials had ever seen. The buildings were falling apart and drug dealers entrenched in empty apartments outnumbered tenants. The city twice issued vacate orders, but Mr. De Leon could not afford to move.
It was a familiar scenario to Harold DeRienzo. In the 1970's, he joined his neighbors on Kelly Street in the Bronx to rescue three orphaned buildings from the wrecking ball. He has since repeated the process with increasing measures of policy know-how and financial savvy. He is now president of the Parodneck Foundation for Self-Help Housing and Community Development, which is helping Mr. De Leon and his neighbors restore their buildings.
IN June, Mr. DeRienzo's group helped the tenants get about $2.8 million in city grants and private loans to begin construction this summer. The tenants -- organized and represented by advocates from the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation -- bought the buildings for $1 from the last in a string of landlords. They are now waiting for the city to waive $500,000 in liens against the buildings for back taxes and unpaid water bills.
"When people who reside in buildings control the buildings, they will survive," Mr. DeRienzo said. "We go to meetings where they face desperate situations with very little hope. But people make it work. Self-help makes it a better city."
Not to mention a healthy one, which is why the foundation began. Sixty years ago, Meyer Parodneck, a Polish immigrant who grew up in poverty on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, formed a milk cooperative to help nourish urban youngsters. He got out of the nonprofit dairy business in the 1960's, to the delight of the large milk companies, which gave him $500,000 in return for agreeing never to compete with them again. Mr. Parodneck used that money to start a foundation that would give small grants and advice to community groups fighting the wave of abandonment that was sweeping poor neighborhoods.
"Having once been poor, that always stayed with him," said Mr. DeRienzo, who joined the foundation in 1982. "I used to sit down and have lunch with him. After he ate his sandwich, he would take his plate and brush off the crumbs into his tea and drink it."
Fittingly, the foundation has made its mark taking buildings others would have cast off and reviving them with gut rehabs and new tenants. Some of that work is accomplished through Community Assisted Tenant Controlled Housing, a citywide project that trains tenants to become the landlords of buildings they have renovated.
THE buildings on West 163d Street present a big challenge, not just because of the drug dealers, whom the police have been targeting. Mr. DeRienzo said that their future, and that of other similarly distressed properties, lies in a partnership among government, banks and nonprofit groups relying on investment, tax exemptions and tenant involvement.
"This project is being pieced together like a house of cards," he said. "You pull one card out and it all falls to the ground."
Although Mr. Parodneck died in 1994, his belief in self-help survives on West 163d Street. Cruz Ortiz, now president of the tenant group that owns the buildings, spoke optimistically about the future. She sat in the same cramped living room where her father suggested two years ago that perhaps she would be better off in a shelter.
"I did not come to this country to be homeless," she said. "I work. I can support myself."
And a few others, too.
"I don't feel like a landlord," she said. "I feel I have a responsibility for a better future for myself and the other tenants."

HEADLINE: Borrowing By Consumers Rose in May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Borrowing by American consumers increased at a slower-than-expected pace in May as banks imposed tougher lending standards and consumers cut back on spending, the Federal Reserve reported today.
The level of consumer credit increased by $3 billion for the month, to $1.224 trillion, after rising by a revised $9.7 billion in April, the Fed said. Previously, the Fed said April borrowing increased by $7.6 billion. Before today's report, analysts had expected an increase of $5.6 billion during May. Consumer credit consists of automotive debt, credit card debt and personal loans, but not real estate loans. 
 Banks and retailers are being more conservative in their lending after personal bankruptcies soared past one million last year. Consumer borrowing increased rapidly in 1995 and early 1996, in part because of aggressive marketing campaigns by credit card issuers.
Fitch Investors Service Inc., a firm that rates debt securities, including notes backed by credit card loans, said on Monday that the number of credit card write-offs in May declined to $842 million from $846 million a month earlier.
The drop in write-offs, when a company concedes that customers will not pay their bills, followed six months of rising delinquency rates. Companies usually wait about 180 days before writing off an account.
Today's Fed report showed that the pace of consumer credit was rising at a 2.9 percent annual rate during May. That was slower than the 9.7 percent pace of borrowing in April.
By category, revolving loans, which include credit card borrowing, rose $700 million in May after rising by $5.4 billion a month earlier. Auto loans decreased by $1.7 billion in May after rising $4.5 billion in April and other types of personal loans rose by $4 billion after falling $100 million a month earlier.
In the last year, credit card use surged to an all-time high. Visa International said this week that total credit and debit card purchases on its payment network rose 23.7 percent, to $1 trillion, from $824 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. Visa issuers increased the number of debit and credit cards 12.8 percent, to 572 million worldwide.

HEADLINE: SHARING IN THE HARVEST;
Urban Living Off the Land

SERIES: An occasional series.

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
YOU are about to enter the fourth dimension of grocery shopping.
Last month, The New York Times bought a $355 share in a program called Threshold Farm Community Supported Agriculture. And over the coming months, as writers for The Living Section cook with the weekly allotment of produce, you may glean the glories of abundance, the satisfaction of supporting a small local farm, the challenge of cooking within the limits of a short East Coast growing season, and the sense of a small town sort of community. 
 Before that, however, the idea of not having everything you want exactly when you want it could shade your perceptions.
Fear of possible deprivation defined my initial foray into a program in which city dwellers commission a local grower to supply them with high-quality produce for a 30-week growing season, and pay in advance. The fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into grain or bean-based dishes for vegetarian meals or used with meat, poultry and fish. In either case, the local pickings determine the dish. Members tend to rethink how they cook and what they cook.
By sharing a farmer's production costs, members aren't "buyers" as much as they are partners in planning crops and budgets and sharing the harvest, along with the vicissitudes of nature.
Like the environmental and health-food movements of yore, farm-to-table programs are loosely organized and fiercely local. There are various conferences, publications and umbrella organizations throughout the country, but small community groups, rather than a central one, establish and support the individual projects.
In the last 12 years, 600 projects have been started in North America. In New York City, six growers supply eight groups, or about 3,000 people, said Sarah Milstein, director of C.S.A. programs for Just Food, a nonprofit group in Manhattan that helps organize farmers and urbanites.
The movement was started by a group of women in Japan 30 years ago and was brought to New England in 1982. "Teikei," meaning "to tie together," is a common word in Japan, and when applied to agriculture it connotes "food with a farmer's face," Ms. Milstein said.
The program's appeal and its steady growth seem to be a confluence of appetite and health concerns, pastoral longings and political leanings. At the Threshold pickup site, Advent Lutheran Church, at 93d Street and Broadway, for instance, virtually all members interviewed supported the Mayoral candidate Ruth Messinger, were opposed to any change in rent-control laws and spoke highly of the virtues of local, organically grown produce.
In fact, the idealism of the shareholders sounded sanctimonious at first. The scuff of Birkenstocks through the church basement reminded me of why I stopped shopping in food co-ops 20 years ago. But even feeling like a cranky Rip Van Winkle, I was trudging a road toward one possible future of farming -- and cooking -- in America.
As thousands of small family farms have been razed for residential and commercial complexes across the country, more and more farmers have begun to market their produce directly to the public to trim costs and increase profits.
A grower selling directly from his farm stand or in a city-operated Greenmarket can make about 30 percent more than one who sells to a wholesale distributor. And C.S.A. farmers rely partly on volunteer labor and have consumers who pay in advance, so they whittle even more from their costs.
"At the stand, you have overhead and labor to consider," said Bill Halsey of Green Thumb Farm in Water Mill, N.Y. His family has operated a roadside stand at its farm for 30 years and sold in the Union Square Greenmarket for four years. "At the Greenmarket, you can sell a whole truckload one week, and then get rain the next and end up driving a full truck home," he said. The cost of business is also lower. "I pay $20 for a space with my C.S.A.," he said. "I paid $200 for my space at the Union Square market."
Community supported agriculture "lets you plan exactly what to plant and what to deliver and cuts about 18 hours from my workweek," he added.
In the last three years, Mr. Halsey has formed buying groups at his farm as well as in Brooklyn and Queens. "I have Sunday off now," he said. "Talk about an improved quality of life!"
But economic imperatives pale beside the ideological drive behind most growers.
"Not even a C.S.A. can pay me minimum wage," said Hugh Williams, who owns the eight-acre Threshold Farm in the Hudson Valley community of Claverack, N.Y. "But it allows me to grow food that is healthy for people and healthy for the planet. It allows me to forge a link between the country and the city. It allows me to live a beautiful, ethical life."
Ms. Milstein said that a farm did not have to be organic to be involved in the program, "but in practice the majority have been organic so far."
"People who buy from a C.S.A. want the kind of clean produce that is difficult to find elsewhere," she added.
In addition to the freedom of growing techniques, the financial security of prepaid shares allows farmers to set their own prices, said Daniel Lass, a professor of resource economics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
"Conventional growers have to accept the price set by large food wholesale buyers," he explained. "Theoretically, C.S.A. growers calculate their annual costs and price their shares accordingly. C.S.A. allows the farmer to concentrate on growing rather than marketing."
Growers stand to make up to 50 percent more than if they sold wholesale. And consumers can save a lot. A 1996 study by Jack P. Cooley and Mr. Lass at the University of Massachusetts found that the food delivered for a $450 share would have cost up to $1,150 in a conventional grocery store, a local food market or an organic food market.
For shareholders, the program amounts to spending time to save money.
The New York Times's share, for instance, cost $11.83 a week for 30 weeks of enough produce to feed two people eating a standard American diet. During the week of June 9, my share would have cost an average of $17.21 from three organic produce markets surveyed in Manhattan.
But I spent half an hour on the subway going to the pickup site and 20 minutes (and $9) for a taxi back to midtown. I also performed two of the required six hours of volunteer work -- which can be done at the farm or the drop-off site.
On our first pickup date, June 10, I received food more suitable for two rabbits than two adults: a bunch of radishes, a bunch of green onions, a head of curly lettuce, two heads of red-leaf lettuce, four sprigs of thyme, four sprigs of dill, a small bunch of sorrel, four cups of baby spinach and two cups of mesclun.
As I packed our first share, I was embarrassed about not bringing my own recycled bag. Others had brought extra used paper bags for people like me; three people reminded me of the ecological importance of supplying my own bags in the future.
I asked how two people could live on lettuce alone.
"The season is off to a slow start," said Donna Garde, one of nine core members of the Threshold group who volunteers up to 10 hours a week. She offered cooking tips and ideas for using the vegetables.
In talking to people who have had a few years of farm-to-table cooking, I found that most supplemented their rations with root vegetables and food they had put away from the previous season while they waited for the season's first vegetables to ripen.
But I was struggling with more than lack of a larder. I was fighting some basic assumptions of modern urban dwelling. The limits I felt were not as much about early local produce; they were about the habits of entitlement.
In two weeks of trying to cook using the local seasonal vegetables, I was more aware of what the farm did not provide than what it did. When one of my colleagues assumed her scheduled pickups, I promptly sped to the more bountiful Balducci's.
But my conversion is not yet out of the question.
On my second pickup, I listened as Peter Mann, who is embarking on his third season, describe his "C.S.A. journey."
"At first it is a chore," he said. "Then it is a challenge. Then it is a new circle of friends. I work at the farm about 10 weekends a year. Sharing the vulnerability of the seasons, the connection with the earth, the weeding, the harvest -- it sounds weird, but its powerful, healing stuff."
Meanwhile, I was mentally adding the price of the cab ride to the cost of the second week's share -- a bunch of spring onions, two heads of green lettuce, two heads of red-oak lettuce, four cups of mixed lettuces, four sprigs each of thyme and dill, four cups of mixed greens for braising -- when Mr. Williams returned from his truck on Broadway, where the meter had expired.
He had a $55 parking ticket. I had had a $9 taxi ride. Together we were paying fines and fares to eat well in a town without pity.
I signed up for the annual potluck supper committee and made plans to spend a weekend weeding at Threshold Farm.
The Living Section will feature occasional articles on cooking with C.S.A. produce. More information on the program is available from Community Supported Agriculture of North America: (413) 528-4374.
 
Little Spring Soup
 Total time: 1/2 hour

 1 bunch radishes, cut wafer thin and chilled

 Spinach and Feta Pizza
 Total time: 30 minutes plus up to 2 hours of rising time

For the crust:
 1 package active dry yeast
 1 cup warm water
 3 to 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for oiling the bowl
 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.
 
For the topping:
 2 cloves garlic, peeled
 1 cup minced green onions
 2 tablespoons olive oil
 1/8 teaspoon chili pepper flakes
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 8 cups spinach
 16 ounces feta cheese.
 
 1. To make the crust, dissolve yeast in the warm water. Add 1 cup of flour and the salt, and mix well. Stir in another cup of flour and stir until the dough becomes sticky.
 2. Dust a work surface with some of the remaining flour and knead the dough, sprinkling in the remaining flour as you knead until the dough no longer feels sticky, 5 to 10 minutes. Lightly oil a large metal bowl, add the dough, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
 3. Punch dough down, knead in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, thyme and black pepper; cover and let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.
 4. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. To make the topping, warm the whole garlic cloves and the minced onion in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Season with the chili pepper flakes and the salt, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, toss, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, about 7 minutes.
 5. Drain the excess moisture from this mixture and chop the spinach, onions and garlic.
 6. Divide the dough in half and roll it out into two 18-inch circles. Brush each disk with a touch of the remaining olive oil.

Spicy Spring Greens
With Chicken
 Total time: 25 minutes plus 40 minutes chilling time

 1 8-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk
 1 tablespoon butter
 2 cloves garlic, peeled
 1 1/2-inch piece of fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped
 2 green onions, minced
 2 heads lettuce, chopped
 2 cups spinach
 2 whole chicken breasts, cut in half
 Salt to taste
 2 teaspoons curry powder
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste.

 1. One hour before cooking, open the can of coconut milk and place in the freezer.
 2. Warm 1/2 of the butter over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger and onions, stir and soften for about 3 minutes. Add lettuce and spinach and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
 3. Pass this mixture through a food processor to make a puree, return to the pan and set aside.
 4. Warm the remaining butter in a saute skillet over high heat. Season the chicken lightly with salt and saute until golden on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn, reduce heat to medium low and cook for 5 more minutes. Sprinkle curry powder over chicken and toss to combine while cooking for 3 to 5 more minutes, until chicken is completely cooked.
 5. Return the spinach to high heat. Use a tablespoon to scoop 1/4 cup of the thick coconut cream from the top of the chilled container; the whey will have settled to the bottom. (The remainder can be stored, covered, in the freezer for up to 2 months.)
 6. Whisk the chilled coconut cream into the spinach. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and top with the chicken breast. Serve with basmati rice on the side, if desired.

HEADLINE: NATO Plus Three

 BODY:
The grand declarations, rippling flags and bright sunshine in Madrid yesterday could not obscure the serious differences within NATO over how far and fast it should grow. Those divisions may ultimately defeat the purpose of expansion, which President Clinton heralded as the creation of a Europe that for the first time is undivided, democratic and at peace.
At American insistence, expansion will initially be limited to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. That restricts membership to the most qualified countries and limits the cost of expansion, which may help make this dubious plan acceptable to the Senate. A two-thirds Senate majority is required to approve the plan. 
 Most of NATO's 16 current members wished to add Romania and Slovenia as well. Weeks of negotiation were required to finesse the problem. In the end, a NATO communique made clear that additional members would be added in the future, and conspicuously noted that Romania and Slovenia were making progress toward admission. But no date for round two was set, and no explicit commitment was given to any country.
While this compromise may be diplomatically elegant, it only delays a potentially enervating membership fight. France, having bowed to the American preference in Madrid, will no doubt insist on Romanian membership next time the question comes up, most likely in 1999. Romania may have historic ties with France, but only last year did it shed the deadening regime that came to power after the fall of Communism. Politically, economically and militarily it is in no shape to join NATO.
If Romania is offered membership in the next round, how can NATO justify denying access to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? They are at the moment at least as democratic as Romania and more vulnerable to any future Russian security threat, the unspoken reason for expanding NATO in the first place. Yet Washington remains wary about adding the Baltic countries because their admission is anathema to Russia. Altogether, 12 countries want to join NATO, including Albania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, which to varying degrees are still suffering from Communist hangovers.
At some point, the addition of new members will weaken the alliance by putting in question the security guarantees that remain NATO's core. Americans, for instance, admire the courage of Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, who survived decades of Soviet rule. It is less clear whether most Americans see the defense of those countries as vital to American security. The case for placing an American nuclear shield over Romania or Slovenia may be even harder to make.
Wherever expansion stops, a new division in Europe will probably develop. Draw the line at Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and the rest of Eastern Europe will be left out. Push it farther south, and Bulgaria may still remain outside. Move it east, and it hits the Russian border. From any such division, economic and political isolation of those left outside is bound to grow.
Absent the cold war with its hard military boundaries, Europe has slowly been moving toward the state of unity and peace that Bill Clinton seeks. Russia, the giant in the East, is today more democratic and less threatening than at any time in its history. Expanding NATO now may well complicate, if not undermine, the transformation of Europe.

HEADLINE: Clause in Rent Law Is Said to Allow Extra Rises for Some Apartments

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
State housing officials said yesterday that a provision of the rent-regulation law signed last month by Gov. George E. Pataki will temporarily allow landlords to raise rents on vacant apartments in New York City more steeply than first expected.
Landlords are allowed under the new law to raise rents by roughly 20 percent on apartments that have been vacated, and the housing officials said that at least until the end of September, they could also apply a 9 percent increase that had previously been permitted under New York City rules. 
 Officials estimated that as many as 30,000 apartments in the city could turn over in the next three months and be affected by the provision.
Tenant advocates immediately disputed the interpretation and warned that landlords who took advantage of it could expose themselves to costly lawsuits.
When the rent bill was passed on June 19 after months of bitter political infighting, tenant advocates and Democratic lawmakers who supported rent protections said they believed that the new increase of roughly 20 percent would replace the smaller increases, set by the city's Rent Guidelines Board.
But since then, landlords' lawyers and officials at the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal have been poring over the complicated language. In late June, groups representing most of the city's landlords began urging their members to add the increases together and to raise rents by either 27 percent or 29 percent, depending on the length of the lease, on vacant apartments.
And yesterday, after an internal memo circulated within the Division of Housing and Community Renewal was made public by tenant advocates, housing officials said that the landlords' interpretation appeared to be correct.
"The law is the law," said Harry Ryttenberg, a spokesman for the housing division. "When landlords call up to our information lines, this is what they're being told."
The memo, dated June 27, states that if a new tenant moves into a vacated apartment and signs a one-year lease, the landlord can raise the rent 27 percent above the old rent. According to the complex formulas under the new law, that essentially means a hike of 18 percent under the new law and the increase of 9 percent set by the city's Rent Guidelines Board last year.
For a two-year lease on a vacant apartment, the increase would be 29 percent -- 20 percent under the new law and 9 percent under the city guidelines. That 9 percent increase expires on Sept. 30, and the board recently voted not to allow an annual vacancy bonus for the next year.
But until the expiration, if an apartment becomes vacant, and the old tenant had paid $1,000 a month for the apartment, the new tenant would pay either $1,270 a month in a one-year lease or $1,290 in a two-year lease. Under a flat 20 percent increase, the monthly rent would be $1,200.
In addition, under the new law, if the previous rent was below $300, a $100 increase can be tacked on. And if the previous tenant had lived in the apartment for more than eight years, another increase could be added, calculated by the number of years the old tenant had remained.
The memo uses this example: a man who had occupied an apartment for 10 years, at $275 a month, vacates it before Sept. 30. A new tenant moves in and signs a one-year lease. The new rent is $275 plus a 27 percent increase, plus an additional six-tenths of one percent for every year the old tenant had lived there. Because the previous tenant had lived in the apartment for more than eight years, another $100 would be added. The new rent would be $465.75.
Billy Easton, executive director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said yesterday that the overlapping increases would mean steep hikes in apartments for the poor and working class. He said that "landlords who do this risk having to pay treble damages" if the practice is struck down in court.
"And the Governor is risking ongoing political fallout if he doesn't move quickly to stop it," Mr. Easton added.
Landlords will almost certainly be sued over the higher increases, but landlord advocacy groups have instructed their members to take the larger increases anyway because they believed the courts would eventually rule in their favor.
"We're telling people to take the increase based on what we think is the clear language of the law," said Dan Margulies, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a group that represents smaller owners. "If they don't take it, and the state eventually rules it is alright, then the lower rent will stand. And it will be too late."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Dip in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned slightly lower in subdued trading yesterday, snapping a four-day rally.
The Treasury's 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to 100 20/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was 6.58 percent, up from Monday's New York close of 6.57 percent. 
 According to GovPx, the bond pricing service, overall activity was light throughout the day. By 3 P.M. the $55.3 billion of securities traded was 22 percent below the average traded on a Tuesday in the third quarter of last year. Bill volume was 45 percent below that average trading last year, while note and bond volume was 10 percent below average trading last year.
With interest rates at five-month lows, a host of borrowers have lined up to take advantage of the low-rate environment. Some $13 billion of debt is expected to come to market this week. Canada, and the Associates Corporation of North America priced a combined $1.5 billion in new debt yesterday.
"There is some supply coming," said Tony Crescenzi, head of government bond trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, "and that is part of what is keeping bonds from gaining."
Wall Street securities firms making up the underwriting group managing bond sales often hedge against possible losses by selling government securities before the new debt issue is sold.
On the support side, bonds are being buoyed by the recent slump in gold prices, which suggests that investors are not overly concerned about inflation. Gold, which hit an 11 1/2-year low on Monday,is often purchased as a hedge against inflation.
Yesterday Canada priced $1 billion of five-year global bonds through underwriters led by the joint lead managers BMO Nesbitt Burns International Ltd., Merrill Lynch International and Salomon Brothers International Ltd. The issue was at a price to yield 6.247 percent, or about 8 basis points more than United States. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
 The Associates Corporation of North America sold $500 million of five-year notes through the joint lead managers Chase Securities Inc. and UBS Securities. Rated Aa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-- by Standard & Poor's, the issue was priced to yield 6.507 percent or about 35 basis points more than a five-year Treasury.
According to some market watchers, future borrowers include the Philip Morris Companies., which is planning to price a $1 billion global bond issue later this week through Merrill Lynch.
Today the Treasury plans to auction $8 billion of its new five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, also known as TIPS. Roseanne C. Briggen, market analyst at MCM Moneywatch in New York, says the inflation-protected securities have been bought mostly by bond funds and pension funds, and since there has not been inflation they have underperformed the rest of the Treasury market.
"The economy is still strong, employment is low and the Fed is on hold," Mrs. Briggen said. "Over time they may prove to be a good buy and provide the hedge against inflation for which they were designed in the first place."
In when-issued trading, the five- year TIPS was offered at a price to yield 3.64 percent, up 10 basis points from Monday. Dealers often raise the rate on a new issue to make it more attractive to investors and lower the chances that they may be left with more inventory than they care to hold.

HEADLINE: Remixing Trade and Diplomacy;
At Commerce Dept., No More Flash a la Ron Brown

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
As Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown was a master at using powerful political symbols. Jetting around the world practicing what he called "commercial diplomacy," he often traveled with an entourage of big-name chief executives and insisted that the Air Force play the role of chauffeur.
"When that plane lands with 'The United States of America' emblazoned on the side," he said just a few months before his death last year on one of those missions, "and the Commerce Secretary emerges with America's top executives, it sends a message that we mean business." 
 William M. Daley, the Commerce Secretary for the last five months, also knows something about symbolism. So when he stepped off an airplane in South America a few weeks ago, he had a lot fewer chief executives with him, and the words on the side of the plane read "American Airlines."
Those contrasting approaches sum up the subtle changes in the Clinton Administration's approach to placing America's economic interests -- particularly the promotion of commercial exports -- at the center of the country's foreign policy agenda. Attuned to the controversies surrounding Mr. Brown's rich brew of business and politics, Mr. Daley has already altered the tone of the Commerce Department's trade missions, setting clear criteria for how companies are chosen and playing down the signing of big deals.
But altering the style of promoting exports abroad is only one example of how Mr. Daley and other Administration officials have tried to redefine commercial diplomacy. Anticipating that the Republicans leading the Congressional hearings on campaign finance that opened today will try to link the financing of the 1996 Presidential campaign to the Administration's trade policy, Mr. Daley has pre-emptively downsized his department.
Ten days ago he announced the layoff of 40 political appointees, and wherever he travels these days, he repeats the mantra that "there is no room for politics in the Commerce Department." It is a strategy meant to insure that should John Huang, the former Commerce Department official turned fund-raiser, end up testifying at the hearings under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution, the department could say that it had already carried out major reforms.
But the ripple effects of Mr. Daley's actions, in the minds of many inside and outside the Commerce Department, are wider than the Administration may have intended. A White House that once sought headlines for promoting American exports is these days often shying away from conspicuous displays of American diplomatic power to win contracts abroad.
Even the definition of commercial diplomacy, a phrase Mr. Brown's aides settled upon because they thought the word "commercial" would keep the State Department from interfering, is undergoing a shift. Speech by speech, Administration officials are putting less emphasis on export promotion and the creation of jobs in America as the goal. Far more often, they talk about using trade initiatives and American investment as ways to promote peace and stability, from Africa to Northern Ireland.
"Export promotion is still a big part of what we do around here," Mr. Daley said in a recent interview. "But we are also trying to show that there is much more that we can accomplish around the world pulling economic levers."
Mr. Daley has received enormous praise within the Administration for defusing a major trouble spot: On Capitol Hill, Republicans are no longer talking about dismantling the Commerce Department. "Bill has one of the most sound political antenna I've ever seen," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, who left a top Commerce Department job recently to become Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
So far, however, Mr. Daley has not laid out the kind of well-articulated trade agenda that characterized Mr. Clinton's first term. And some fear that the Commerce Department is losing the sense of mission it briefly had. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs magazine, Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade during most of Mr. Clinton's first term, noted that the White House's enthusiasm for its prior strategy waned after the campaign investigations "raised a host of questions about whether America's commercial diplomacy, particularly in Asia, was for sale." Mr. Garten, now the dean of the Yale School of Management, wrote that the Administration had "lost its laser-like focus on the importance of foreign markets to the United States."
Mr. Garten's deputy at the Commerce Department, David Rothkopf, now a senior official at Kissinger Associates, the former Secretary of State's consulting firm, is even blunter. "In the way we once knew it, commercial diplomacy is nearly dead," he said.
The White House maintains that its focus on these issues is undiminished. "Commercial diplomacy is not dead because we can't just walk off the field," Mr. Daley insisted, sitting near a photograph of his father, the late Richard J. Daley, the legendary Mayor and political power broker in Chicago. (An older brother, Richard M. Daley, is Chicago's current Mayor.) "We have to conduct this kind of effort because it's clear that Helmut Kohl and Jacques Chirac aren't going to stop."
Nonetheless, some career officials within the Commerce Department say there is an absence of electricity where the center of the action was during the first term. Mr. Brown and Mr. Garten, for example, built what they called a "war room" on the department's fifth floor to coordinate Washington's activities -- from ambassadors to the C.I.A. to the President -- in tracking major building projects around the world and making sure that American businesses won their share.
Mr. Daley eschews the economic warfare analogies -- "the term 'war room' always bugged me," he says -- although he insists that "we are probably being as aggressive as we used to be in our advocacy center." His aides like to point instead to a new "compliance center," set up by Mr. Eizenstat, who says he was "stunned to discover when I arrived at Commerce that we were so busy negotiating trade agreements that we never tracked whether countries were abiding by them." But monitoring old trade accords, Mr. Daley's aides concede, does not make for many flashy headlines.
"What you are seeing is a difference in style between me and Ron," Mr. Daley said. "But times are also different. The American economy is booming. Some of the big projects around the world that we were so eager to get are slowing down a bit now." Moreover, he added, "I'm not sure that American companies need as much Government help to get a foot in the door as they did a few years ago."
The stylistic differences are particularly evident on trade missions. Mr. Brown made much of the pageantry of signing deals. One of his first big missions was to China in 1994, and he repeatedly touted it as leading to $6 billion in deals. But most of those were "memorandums of understanding," and many of the understandings quickly unraveled. The Entergy Corporation, for example, the utility holding company based in New Orleans, signed a $1 billion "understanding" to build a coal-fired power plant in Shanxi Province, along with the Lippo Group of Indonesia, then little known. But by 1995, it was clear that the deal was dead, said Cyril Guerrera, a spokesman for Entergy.
In fact, nearly three years after Mr. Brown's mission, the Commerce Department says only $1.66 billion of those deals actually came to fruition, while $3.2 billion more are officially described as still being "pursued" by American companies.
Acutely aware of that history, Mr. Daley was careful not to overpromise on his recent trip to South America, a much smaller market than China. He treated signing ceremonies as something of a sideshow, focusing instead on longer-range issues during stops in Chile, Brazil and Argentina. That is critical spadework for the Administration, which has lost a lot of credibility in Latin America for its failure so far to persuade Congress to give it the authority to negotiate extensions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, starting with Chile.
The Administration insists it will get that authority this fall, but Canada and Mexico, unwilling to wait, are beginning to strike deals of their own. For example, a separate free trade accord between Canada and Chile went into effect last Sunday.
Instead of taking along big-name chief executives on his South American trade mission, Mr. Daley traveled with lesser-known executives a few notches down the corporate ladder, selected according to a strict new set of criteria. Those rules limit participation to companies with a demonstrated interest in the region to be visited, and the final choices are made by a committee dominated by career officials.
The new rules are intended to avoid one of the big questions that still linger over Mr. Brown despite his death: How did corporate executives, some of whom were big political donors, get aboard the Secretary's plane? Mr. Brown's method of selection remains a mystery. "The list of participants on these trips just appeared from Brown's office," a senior Commerce official said recently.
Nonetheless, reams of documents on that issue made public over the last two years have yet to produce convincing evidence that any executives promised to make campaign donations in return for a seat on a mission.
These days, Mr. Daley is constantly treading a fine line. He has steered clear of any criticism of Mr. Brown. But that criticism is implicit in many of the changes he has made.
The political appointees laid off included several officials in the Secretary's office. Mr. Daley has said he will shrink the total number of posts filled by political appointees throughout the department by roughly 100, to about 250. His aides concede in private that the department became a dumping ground for the White House personnel office, saying that may explain how Mr. Huang, a former senior official of the Lippo Group, the Indonesian conglomerate run by the Riady family, ended up as a Commerce Department official dealing with Taiwan. Mr. Huang left the department for the Democratic National Committee in late 1995, after a meeting with President Clinton that is still a subject of the campaign inquiries.
If Mr. Daley has put out the political fires at the Commerce Department, however, he and the trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright are just beginning to define new goals for the nation's foreign business and trade agenda. Ms. Barshefsky does the best job of the three in articulating long-term goals, but Ms. Albright has said little.
"A lot of this is new ground for Madeleine," one of her colleagues said, "and it's going to take a while for her to get her feet on the ground."
Six months into the second term, however, many issues that fall under the umbrella of commercial diplomacy are still under debate within the White House. No one has ever resolved the question of how deeply the intelligence agencies should get involved in economic espionage, an argument that has raged for several years now.
Nor, among other things, has the White House decided how hard to fight to preserve or reorganize Government agencies that provide low-cost financing for American exporters.
"This is all being revisited," one senior White House official said last week. "But very, very slowly."

Chart: "A Lower Profile"
Stung by controversy over former Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown's practice of mixing politics and business abroad, William Daley, the new head of Commerce, devoted his first trip overseas -- to Latin America in May -- to behind-the-scenes diplomacy. The trip deliberately lacked the high profile trade agreements and corporate contracts that Mr. Brown announced on his first important mission -- to China in August 1994.
 
BILL DALEY'S TRIP TO SOUTH AMERICA, MAY 1997
 
BUSINESS DEALS -- Only $2.1 million contract for a Florida company and a couple of grants totalling $1 million from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency were announced.
 
TRADE DEAL -- None The purpose of the trip was to lay the groundwork for expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement to include the rest of the Americas.
 
WHO WENT -- Mid-level managers of large corporations and chief executives of small companies. Generated little publicity compared with Secretary Brown's trip.
 
RON BROWN'S TRIP TO CHINA, 1994.
 
BUSINESS DEALS -- Projects worth $6.3 billion were announced. Nine of 13 projects have been completed, but three large deals worth $4.2 billion have fallen through if are in limbo.
 
TRADE DEAL -- Secretary Brown signed an agreement with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade Wu Yi to expand United States business investment in China.
 
WHO WENT -- A who's who of American business, including George Fisher, chief executive of Eastman Kodak, and Raymond Smith, chief executive of Bell Atlantic.

HEADLINE: Kenya's Hard Line: President Gambles on Crackdown

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, July 8

 BODY:
By violently crushing pro-democracy demonstrations across Kenya on Monday, President Daniel arap Moi has gambled that opposition leaders seeking to rewrite the nation's Constitution do not have enough popular support to weather a brutal police campaign against them.
He is also wagering that Western powers will not abandon him just because his police tear-gassed and clubbed hundreds of protesters who were demonstrating peacefully to dilute the powers of the presidency and increase civil liberties. 
 Mr. Moi's calculation appears based on the notion that the opposition is too disorganized and splintered along ethnic lines to present a viable alternative to his Government, even if its human-rights record is less than perfect.
And on both counts, he is probably right, political experts and diplomats said today.
On Monday, nine people were killed in clashes at rallies across the nation in the worst political violence since 1991, when a series of similar protests finally persuaded Mr. Moi to end the one-party state and allow multi-party elections.
The police hardly needed to scatter the protesters with such force. After weeks of dire official warnings to citizens not to attend the rallies, the organizers did not draw the huge crowds they had hoped for. Most of the rallies planned in 56 towns across the nation attracted less than a thousand demonstrators.
Abroad, the response to the mayhem was muted. Several Western diplomats issued statements today deploring the violence on both sides and urging the Government to talk to the opposition about its demands.
In Washington, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said that the violence was inspired by Kenya's "failure to take the essential concrete steps to create a free and fair electoral climate."
But no country made mention of more palpable pressure, like cutting off Kenya's lifeline of low-interest loans from the International Monetary Fund. One reason is a fear of taking sides in the elections, which Mr. Moi must call before the end of the year. Mr. Moi says he is willing to appoint a commission to consider amending the Constitution, but not until after the voting.
The streets of Nairobi and other towns returned to normal during the day, but as darkness fell tonight, students clashed with the police near the Nairobi University campus and gunfire was heard.
For most of the day, however, businesses reopened and the roads were full of traffic, despite the heavy presence of paramilitary police officers. Many workers returning to their jobs today said that while they supported the protesters in principle, they were weary of the looting and violence attending the demonstrations.
"It does worry us," Joseph Kwasi, 43, a shop clerk. "We have children at home, and we have to worry about them. The protesters are fighting for their rights, and this is what most Kenyans need, but the problem is, once the violence starts there is no boundary. Anybody can be hurt."
In news conferences today, opposition politicians and human rights advocates vowed to step up their campaign of civil disobedience on Wednesday after a period of mourning for the people who were killed. Police officials, however, said that it was unlikely that demonstrators would turn out in large numbers.
One problem for the opposition is that the violence has alarmed many middle-class Kenyans who might otherwise support them. Each time the police have broken up protests in the last two months, the demonstrators -- their ranks swelled by college students angry about high tuition costs -- have turned quickly to looting shops and stoning cars.
"A lot of people in the middle class are getting, I think, disillusioned with the fact that none of this violence is achieving any of its objectives," Anthony Nzuya, a Nairobi businessman, said. "The way to get these reforms on the table is not through street violence."
Mr. Moi has skillfully exploited these fears, repeatedly portraying the opposition leaders as bent on sowing anarchy and violence. Thus he has neatly sidestepped the fact the police have been brutal.
In addition, there are some cracks within the coalition of churches, human-rights groups and opposition party leaders who are pushing for reforms. While the clergy and human-rights advocates are trying to roll back repressive laws limiting civil liberties, the opposition politicians have another motive. They want to change electoral rules in the Constitution that make it hard for them to win. For instance, one proposed amendment would require a presidential candidate to get a simple majority, or face a run-off election. At present a President can be elected with less than half the vote, as long as he gets a quarter of the vote in five of the country's eight provinces. The provision, added in 1992, served to weaken the two largest ethnic groups, the Kikuyu and the Luo, whose members are crammed into two districts.
Mr. Moi, who comes from a small ethnic group, was able to get only about 38 percent of the popular vote in 1996. He won only because most of the Luo and Kikuyu were split along ethnic lines among three candidates.
Mr. Moi has other enormous advantages the coalition wants to end. He controls the official radio and television broadcasts. The electoral commission, which registers voters, is stacked with his appointees. Security laws left from the British colonial era give him sweeping powers to detain political enemies and break up public meetings and protests.
But these issues do not resonate with the vast majority of Kenyans, who are struggling with a sluggish economy, low wages, high education costs and widespread poverty.
Despite today's calm, the atmosphere remains explosive. If the opposition continues to call marches, and Mr. Moi sticks to his hard line, some diplomats fear a conflagration.
"There are three million people in Nairobi, most of them poor," said one diplomat in Nairobi, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "How many sparks do you need until something gets out of hand?"

HEADLINE: Low Bids on Atlantic City Road Please State

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 8

 BODY:
The developers of a road and tunnel project meant to open the way for new casinos in Atlantic City's marina district received bids on the construction costs today, and New Jersey officials said the bids were in line with their own estimate.
John J. Haley, the State Transportation Commissioner, said the bids proved that the total project could be completed for $330 million, despite warnings from critics that costs could run as high as $500 million. Mr. Haley said the bids were low enough to insure that the state could move ahead promptly with the tunnel project. 
 The state is sharing the total costs with Mirage Resorts, which plans to build three casinos and 7,000 hotel rooms in Atlantic City's marina district over the next two years. The tunnel would provide direct access to that neighborhood from the Atlantic City Expressway, which runs between Atlantic City and Philadelphia.
Donald J. Trump, who owns several casinos in Atlantic City and has repeatedly criticized the state for helping to finance the tunnel, had warned that the cost of the project would run much higher than $330 million.
Mr. Trump has said it was unfair for the state to pay for a tunnel that would serve only visitors to the Mirage casinos, which will be several blocks from the boardwalk, where the city's other casinos are situated. But Mr. Haley said the bid amounts proved that Mr. Trump was wrong. They ranged in price from $190.6 million to $329.7 million and Mr. Haley said the lowest bid matched the state's own calculations.
"This is a giant step in terms of advancing the project," Mr. Haley said in a telephone interview. "The numbers we received today say it can be built within our project budget, and that's really good news."
The Mirage resort is part of a plan to revitalize Atlantic City's economy and transform the city into a major vacation destination. It is expected to create 30,000 jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in casino revenues -- prospects that made the state eager to accept some of the financial burden.
After months of negotiations between Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman and chief executive of Mirage, the two sides decided that the state would pick up about two-thirds of the $330 million bill. Both sides agreed they would not pay more than $330 million, and that any extra costs incurred during the construction would be picked up by the contractor.
The low bid of $190.6 million was submitted by the Yonkers Contracting Company of Yonkers, N.Y. The highest bid, $329.7 million, was submitted by the Schiavone Construction Company of Secaucus, N.J. A third company, the Perini Corporation of Framingham, Mass., set a price of $229.8 million.
Mr. Haley said Mirage and the State Department of Transportation officials would examine the offers and pick a contractor within 30 days.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Trump, who has fought the tunnel plan in court, stressed that the bids covered only construction costs. He predicted that additional expenses -- like the purchase of land near the construction site -- would push the total cost closer to $500 million, an amount he said the state could not afford to pay.
But Mr. Haley insisted that Mr. Trump was wrong.
"I just don't know where he gets his numbers from," Mr. Haley said. "The construction numbers are what we hoped they would be, and I'm more confident than ever that we can deliver this project for the budgeted amount."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
International Paper to Cut Staff by 10%

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
The International Paper Company said yesterday that it would sell $1 billion in assets and cut 9,000 jobs, or more than 10 percent of its work force, as it seeks to improve profitability in an increasingly competitive industry.
The company, which is the world's largest manufacturer of paper and paper products, said that the bulk of its job cuts would come as workers were transferred when International Paper sold some units. 
 It said that more than half of the jobs to be eliminated would come from units already up for sale, and that more cuts would come from the sale of units yet to be identified. A smaller number of jobs are to be lost when production plants are closed. The company added that the cuts would not involve employees at its headquarters in Purchase, N.Y.
The revamping was cheered by investors, who sent the company's shares surging 9.6 percent. The stock, the biggest gainer after Procter & Gamble among stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, rose $4.9375 a share, to $56.125.
To pay for the reorganization, International Paper said it took $535 million in charges before taxes, or $385 million after taxes, against second-quarter earnings. It also took a $150 million pretax charge, or $93 million after taxes, to add to its legal reserve. As a result, the company yesterday posted a loss of $419 million, or $1.39 a share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $99 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Without the charges, the company earned $59 million, or 20 cents a share, exceeding analyst estimates of 15 cents a share.
International Paper's revamping reflects the growing need for paper producers to cut costs to offset price pressures that have been caused in recent years by an industrywide rise in capacity.
"What is happening at International Paper is true of everybody in the paper business," said Sheldon Grodsky, an analyst with Grodsky Associates, a brokerage firm. "The problem in the paper industry is that after about five years of recession, they came out of it for a couple of quarters and prices actually doubled in some grades in a matter of less than a year and immediately went down thereafter. So the industry has been exceedingly cyclical."
In response, International Paper said it would rid itself of any operations that did not contribute to meeting its financial goals. The company, which employs 87,000 people, has 27 mills in the United States and operations in 31 countries.
"We will be divesting or closing operations that no longer meet the company's financial or strategic objectives and utilizing plants and machinery to serve customers more efficiently," John T. Dillon, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
"All of International Paper businesses are expected to meet specific performance objectives, including progress towards achieving an average 12 percent return on investment over a business cycle, having market leadership within their industry and developing technological superiority," Mr. Dillon added. "This improvement plan underscores the sense of urgency required for us to meet these commitments to share owners and customers."
To that end, the company plans to reduce its pulp and uncoated paper capacity by at least 400,000 tons. It expects to shut three production lines at a mill in Erie, Pa., close a mill in Woronoco, Mass., and a pulp operation in Lock Haven, Pa. About 460 workers will lose jobs as a result of those closings.
More than half the staff reduction -- involving about 6,000 employees -- will come from the sale of the company's imaging business facilities in the United States and abroad; its packaging business that makes industrial paper bags, and 175,000 acres of timberland in western Pennsylvania and western New York.
The company said that the moves announced yesterday would contribute to earnings this year and would have a greater impact next year, when most of the actions would be completed.
"There is a lot of room to sell off noncore assets," said Josh Kapp, an analyst with Smith Barney. "Whether it will result in a radically different company tomorrow, I'm not sure that will be the case. It's a step in the right direction. Obviously the market thinks so."

HEADLINE: U.S. Laments Takeover in Cambodia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
After hesitating a day, the United States today condemned Cambodia's Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, for using force to oust a rival from Government, but stopped short of cutting off $42 million in aid to the country.
Instead, the United States is working with Asian allies to coordinate pressure on Mr. Hun Sen to remove his troops from the streets and peacefully resolve the crisis with his opponents. 
 As the major power behind the 1991 Paris peace accords, which ended decades of war in Cambodia, the United States is in a critical position to help develop a consensus that could prevent further bloodshed.
But no one country holds a lever powerful enough to budge Mr. Hun Sen, officials say, and a joint response, which may yet include cutting off aid, would be more effective.
"Our position is that the overthrow of a duly constituted democratic government by military means is unacceptable, and we made that point strongly to the Cambodian Ambassador here and at the United Nations," a senior American official said. "We want to send a message to Hun Sen that we don't accept the legitimacy of what he's done and don't want to see another dictatorship emerge in Cambodia under the fig leaf of a coalition."
Today Mr. Hun Sen's forces began arresting political opponents, one of whom was killed.
The First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, left Cambodia for France last Friday, before two days' fighting in which Mr. Hun Sen claimed full power. The two men had been sharing power uneasily since a 1993 election run by the United Nations.
After saying little about Cambodia's situation on Monday, the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, today expressed "strong opposition to the use of force to change the results of the 1993 election and the use of force by the forces of Hun Sen to effectively rupture the Paris accords of 1991."
But Mr. Burns refused to call the events in Cambodia a "coup," apparently because American law requires the immediate suspension of aid if an elected Government is overthrown.
While defending the right of Prince Ranariddh's party to operate freely in Cambodia, other American officials said it would be unrealistic to require his return to office, given the antipathy between the two men.
One official also said Prince Ranariddh had been "playing with fire" in the days before he left Cambodia by trying to secure the political and military support of the Khmer Rouge, his old allies, against Mr. Hun Sen. Some Khmer Rouge factions have been trying to negotiate their return into the country's political life.
For now, American officials said, they are not yet ready to suspend aid to Cambodia -- as the Japanese have effectively done. Instead Washington is working on a coordinated response with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the United Nations Security Council and co-signers of the 1991 Paris accords -- Japan, India, Canada and Laos. On Thursday Asean members are to consider delaying Cambodia's entry into the group, which was supposed to happen later this month.
Prince Ranariddh is to arrive at the United Nations on Wednesday. Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that the events in Cambodia were regrettable and the United Nations would discuss what to do. State Department officials are to meet Prince Ranariddh here as well.
The United States, after consulting with other countries on Monday, today produced a set of principles on Cambodia: the use of force to overturn the 1993 elections is unacceptable; all Cambodian political parties must be allowed to operate freely, Khmer Rouge leaders should play no political role, free and fair elections should take place as scheduled in 1998 and the principles of the 1991 Paris accords must be upheld.
Human rights organizations, pointing to the organized and extensive round-up of opponents by Mr. Hun Sen's forces, said the American position should be stronger.
"There's the beginnings of a purge, with democrats fleeing for protection to foreign embassies," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch Asia.
He also called for the immediate suspension of American aid. "It's the only effective lever they have over Hun Sen," he said.
But American officials said that is precisely why they want to use it to press Mr. Hun Sen to pull back. For more than a week, including meetings before the fighting broke out, the American Ambassador, Kenneth M. Quinn, had pressed senior Cambodian officials to refrain from using force and breaking commitments undertaken in 1991, the officials said.

HEADLINE: On NATO Coup, Russia's Shadow

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: MADRID, June 7

 BODY:
American officials were busy measuring themselves for cloaks of historical glory in Madrid this afternoon.
"We bridged a chasm in Europe," President Clinton said after NATO leaders had agreed to admit three Eastern European countries as members by 1999. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke of an "irreversible process" of alliance-building. The name of George C. Marshall and his economic recovery plan were much invoked, and there was a lot of talk about healing the wound left behind by Yalta. 
 It remained for Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, a Republican, to utter the merest, tiniest hint that the self-congratulation might prove to have been premature, with the comment that "it's a long road to 1999."
Just where that road will lead, he might have added, is unclear. American diplomacy succeeded, where many thought it would fail, in achieving a common front in support of NATO expansion, in limiting it in the first instance to three countries and in persuading the Russians to go along, however grumpily. In that sense, today was a great day for President Clinton and the alliance, as he said.
But both at home and in Eastern and Western Europe, knotty problems remain that could undermine the stability the President seeks to establish.
In the largest, most profoundly strategic sense, it is not possible to know whether the reshaping of the alliance will make Russia more or less manageable in the decades ahead. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the leading Russian expert in the Administration, strongly supports the expansion policy, but he readily concedes that like NATO itself in its earliest days it represents a gamble.
After World War II, the West's bet -- "the bluff," as a senior American official called it recently -- was that the promise to use nuclear weapons to resist Soviet expansion would obviate the need actually to use them. Today's bet is that the promise of sending British or German or American troops to defend Warsaw or Prague against an unnamed enemy will not only make that unnecessary but will also help to entrench democracy and a free market system in Eastern Europe.
Ms. Albright made precisely that point this evening, arguing that "the most successful alliances are those that do not have to use force."
For their part, the Russians made the obligatory negative noises. However, it is not Russian rhetoric that worries some foreign-policy specialists but the possibility that a strident Russian nationalism, born of pride wounded and nerves frayed as NATO moves closer to Russia's borders, may arise in the next century.
"Enlargement may undermine the very security and stability they are seeking," Prof. Alvin Z. Rubinstein of the University of Pennsylvania wrote in the journal Problems of Post-Communism last month. "NATO expansion could result in a re-polarized Europe; Moscow may question its commitment to nuclear downsizing and cooperation, and Russia might turn away from accommodation with the West."
Nor is it clear that the consensus reached today can be re-created when it comes time to pay for the costs of expanding the alliance. Neither Hungary nor the Czech Republic, for example, is in any position to increase military spending enough to pay for the needed modernization of the two countries' largely obsolete forces. And it is not clear that Western European countries have the political will to increase their spending on NATO at a moment when their economies are not robust.
"It is more likely that British outlays on defense will decline in the years ahead than that they will increase," a minister in Prime Minister Tony Blair's Government said last week. Germany and France, struggling to meet the stringent criteria for European Union monetary union, are no more eager to discuss bigger military budgets. If this persists, it will increase pressure on the United States to spend much more than the $200 million a year now contemplated to reshape existing Western forces and retrain and re-equip Eastern European armies.
That is what happened with the peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
To achieve consensus on admitting only Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, the United States agreed to make a strong commitment in the communique not only to give early consideration to admitting Slovenia and Romania, which Italy and France had wanted to admit in the first round. At a news briefing tonight, Ms. Albright went so far as to pledge that "no European democracy will be excluded because of its position on the map."
That presumably includes not only Slovenia and Romania, but also the Baltic countries, all mentioned by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, and Ukraine. Regardless of the communique, no support for such a sweeping expansion exists at the moment, and the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, gave the impression during a visit to Washington last month that he had no appetite for future NATO membership for either the Baltics or Ukraine. President Jacques Chirac of France has made the same point, and the Russians could be expected to issue more than routine protests over any effort to incorporate into NATO countries with large Russian minorities and with long borders with Russia.
Underlying all of this is considerable European irritation at the United States and a considerable American lack of faith in European capacities.
Lionel Jospin, France's new Socialist Prime Minister, has spoken bitterly in recent days about an American "tendency toward hegemony." Others have not been so blunt, but German and British officials returned from the economic summit meeting in Denver last month expressing distaste for what several of them termed American "triumphalism." The word has quickly become a synonym in editorial-page commentary in Europe for America's lone superpower status.
France remains semi-detached from NATO and insistent that it be given a major command role as a price for integrating its armed forces with the alliance. But no American President in the forseeable future could place American troops under French command (or the command of any European, with the possible exception of the British, with whom the tradition of close American cooperation is a long one). Neither the Pentagon, Congress or the voting public would accept any such thing.
"Without America, NATO doesn't exist," Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy said this week, but he pointedly added, "Europe cannot be denied its views on problems within its own region."
The problem with these complaints, from the American Government's point of view, is that Europe has had trouble getting its act together.
Europe's conspicuous failure to sort out the situation in Bosnia is cited as an example of this problem, and Bosnia may confound the Administration's attempt to persuade the Senate and the American people of the worth of NATO expansion.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who is here as part of a Congressional delegation, said that two problems might bedevil the ratification effort: the question of equitable sharing of the financial burden of expansion, and the future of Bosnia. He added, "Unfortunately at the very moment we will be voting on expansion, we will be debating what next in Bosnia." If the Europeans are not steadfast in Bosnia, he said, "it will be hard to get the votes."
Mr. Clinton said: "We have a ways to go to convince the American people of the momentous importance of decisions we're making here and the need for them to support it. And that is a job that I intend to take on when I get home."

HEADLINE: 3 FORMER MEMBERS OF EASTERN BLOC INVITED INTO NATO

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: MADRID, July 8

 BODY:
Eight years after winning the cold war without firing a shot, NATO extended invitations today to three former adversaries -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- to join the alliance in time for its 50th anniversary in 1999.
"This is a very great day, not only for Europe and the United States, not simply for NATO, but, indeed, for the cause of freedom in the aftermath of the cold war," President Clinton said after the decision was reached this afternoon. 
 Leaders of the three countries expressed gratitude and optimism that NATO membership would help preserve freedom for all of them, though they also want to join the European Union to help develop their market economies and they are unlikely to be admitted to the union in the next five years.
Even NATO, which has been preparing for enlargement since 1994, made its decision only after a vigorous debate today, led by France, about whether the alliance would be better served if Romania and Slovenia were included in the current round of expansion.
Expansion was seen by those who decided it as a historic step across the East-West divide that opened at the end of World War II, offering a framework of security and stability for Central European countries that chose the path of democracy and open markets after Communism collapsed in 1989.
Critics warned that enlargement cast a shadow over the future of relations with Russia, whose President, Boris N. Yeltsin, signed a "Founding Act" on relations with NATO in Paris in May.
"Despite the fact that we have signed a broad, balanced agreement with NATO, we still consider expansion the biggest mistake in Europe since the end of World War II," the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said in Moscow after the allies reached agreement this afternoon. American diplomacy succeeded, where many thought it would fail, in achieving a common front. [News analysis, page A8.]
Enlargement will have to be approved by the United States Senate and the Parliaments of the other NATO members. No major problems are expected in Europe.
Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who was here as chairman of the Senate's NATO observer group, hailed today's decision as "a historic step toward a peaceful, democratic and undivided Europe."
He added that limiting the enlargement to three countries at first would make it easier to control the cost, prospectively a major concern in the debate in the United States over approval of the decision. Congressional leaders at the meeting here predicted approval.
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said in Washington tonight that if a vote was taken now, he thought it would get the necessary two-thirds majority. He added that he also felt that the measure would be approved next spring, although if the situation in Bosnia deteriorated, that might have an adverse effect on the outcome.
Allied leaders expressed confidence that the cost would be manageable but commissioned a detailed study. Clinton Administration estimates have put the cost at $35 billion over 13 years, with the United States share at about $2 billion. But the Congressional Budget Office predicts that total costs may be in the region of $125 billion, with Washington's share up to $19 billion.
Most of the day, the leaders debated about why two more applicants could not be admitted today, joining the Poles, the Hungarians and the Czechs.
Nine countries, including Canada and most of the big Continental European allies, including Germany, leaned toward including Romania and Slovenia as well but gave in to equally vigorous arguments by the United States and Britain for limiting the initial expansion to three.
President Jacques Chirac of France vigorously pleaded the case for including Romania and Slovenia to President Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other leaders this morning.
This afternoon, Mr. Chirac held up agreement on a statement about future expansion until he was satisfied that the two countries would be at the top of the list when NATO leaders met again in Washington in the spring of 1999.
"Let us not risk destroying the cohesion or weakening the credibility of the alliance by excluding today these two countries that meet criteria that we ourselves set," Mr. Chirac pleaded.
But Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair, supported by the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark, held out, and in the end the only consensus was for three new members -- the first since Spain, the host of this week's meeting, joined in 1982.
"NATO is a military alliance, not a political club," Mr. Blair argued, saying that the admission of three new countries more or less simultaneously was "a bold step, not a conservative one."
In the end, prodded by Mr. Chirac, all 16 leaders agreed to a statement that in Mr. Chirac's eyes put Romania and Slovenia on the fast track for inclusion after 1999.
"With regard to the aspiring members, we recognize with great interest and take account of the positive development toward democracy and the rule of law in a number of southeastern European countries, especially Romania and Slovenia," the leaders said. "The alliance recognizes the need to build greater stability, security and regional cooperation in the countries of southeast Europe, and in promoting their increasing integration into the Euro-Atlantic community."
Then, apparently in a gesture toward American insistence on not appearing to condemn the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to remain forever outside the walls of the alliance, the leaders added: "At the same time, we recognize the progress achieved toward greater stability and cooperation by the states in the Baltic region who are also aspiring members."
In all, 12 countries have been seeking to join. The leaders of the three who will be the first to make it were already here today: President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, a jailed dissident during most of the time that his country was a member of the Warsaw Pact; Prime Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary, a leader of his nation during Communism's final years, and President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland.
On Wednesday they and the nine leaders of those who are still waiting -- Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Slovakia, as well as Romania, Slovenia and the Baltic countries -- will meet NATO leaders at their summit talks in a rectangular glass-walled conference hall at the northeastern fringe of Madrid.
Later this week, Mr. Clinton will go to Poland and Romania, while Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will go to the Czech Republic. Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen will visit Hungary and Ukraine, with which the summit leaders plan to sign a cooperation agreement on Wednesday like the one concluded with Russia. Ms. Albright also plans to see Mr. Primakov in St. Petersburg and talk to leaders of the Baltic countries on the way to Prague.
Mr. Yeltsin, invited to today's meeting, decided to stay away and sent a Deputy Prime Minister, V. M. Serov, instead.
But NATO officials said Russia had asked the allies for a first meeting late next week of the permanent joint council set up under the NATO-Russia Founding Act and a foreign ministers' meeting in New York during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September.
The new NATO, like the old, will have to contend with periodic disagreements between Europe and the United States, usually focused on the French, which told the allies today that reorganization of the alliance's military command structure to give more responsibility to Europeans had not gone far enough to suit them.
"Since the reasons behind the creation of the alliance have largely disappeared," Mr. Chirac warned, "our alliance would not durably survive with an unbalanced Euro-American relationship, both in the sharing of power in the military structure and in the political decision-making process."
Indeed, he cited American unwillingness to cede more positions of military command to European officers as the main reason why France was not yet ready to rejoin NATO's integrated military command. The United States has refused a request by Mr. Chirac to cede control of NATO's southern command in Naples to a European officer, who would direct the United States Sixth Fleet in combat operations, as part of the reorganized NATO military structure that leaders approved today.
But Mr. Chirac said that on the whole he was satisfied by today's meeting, which he called "another step in the right direction of constructing a European architecture of defense."
The NATO leaders hailed Spain's decision to do what France would not and join the NATO military structure, even though the key issue of which NATO command would control Spanish territorial waters around the Canary Islands is one of several technical military issues that the allies did not resolve. They hope to do so by the end of the year.
They did not change the ground rules that have kept the 31,000 NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Bosnia from moving more aggressively to apprehend the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and other leaders indicted on war crimes charges by the international tribunal in The Hague.
Instead, they called once again on the local leaders to comply with their obligations under the Dayton peace agreement of 1995, including the requirement to turn over war crimes suspects like Dr. Karadzic and his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.
"The point here is, on Karadzic and Mladic, that there is no statute of limitation on their crimes, and their day will come," Ms. Albright said.

Dow Sets Another Record, Rising by More Than 100
The Dow Jones industrial average hit its 32d record close of the year and its first above 7,900. It surged 103.82 points, or 1.32 percent, to 7,962.31, as investors remained optimistic about corporate profits and a stable economy. Broader market indexes also set records, with the Standard & Poor's 500 rising 6.55 points, to 918.75, and the Nasdaq composite index increasing 14.36 points, to 1,485.10.
 The Dow was bolstered by heavy demand for cyclical issues, like International Paper -- which announced that it planned to cut its work force and sell assets -- as well as Caterpillar and Du Pont. [Page D6.] 

Prices of Treasury securities fell slightly in quiet trading, with the yield on the 30-year bond rising to 6.58 percent from 6.57. [D16.]
 
Motorola Earnings Beat Estimates
Motorola continued its revival, announcing financial results for the second quarter that modestly exceeded analysts' expectations. The company's shares rose strongly in anticipation of the results, which were reported after the close of trading. But another high-technology company trying to regain its financial footing, Advanced Micro Devices, had disappointing earnings. [D4.]
 
Tobacco Deal Is Criticized
Clinton Administration officials reviewing the proposed settlement of tobacco litigation said that it would impose unacceptable limits on the Federal regulation of tobacco products. In the Administration's first extensive public comments on the proposal, officials said that the accord would dilute the F.D.A.'s authority to regulate nicotine and place impossible new burdens on the agency. [A1.]
 
Consumer Debt Up, but More Slowly
Tougher lending standards at banks and cutbacks by consumers pushed borrowing by Americans higher in May, but at a slower-than-expected pace. Consumer credit increased by $3 billion, to $1.224 trillion, after rising by a revised $9.7 billion in April, the Federal Reserve said. [D2.]
 
Coffee Prices Increase
A report by the Agriculture Department, which said a poor coffee crop in Colombia would keep world supplies tight, sent futures prices rising. Gold rebounded slightly after hitting an 11 1/2-year low on Monday. [D5.]
 
Dollar Soars Against the Mark
The dollar rose to a three-and-a-half-year high against the German mark. And the British pound hit a six-year high against the mark on expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates this week. [D5.]
 
Japan's Trade Surplus Up Sharply
Japan's current account surplus more than doubled in May, driven by demand for exports and a drop in consumer spending at home. The surplus rose 154.9 percent, to 906.8 billion yen, or $8.02 billion, though the gain was still smaller than expected. [D13.]
 
Ovitz's Latest Big-Budget Venture
Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood superagent and ousted president of Walt Disney, can call himself a mogul again. So what if the latest movie he was involved in was only a six-minute documentary commissioned to help raise half a billion dollars for a new medical center at his alma mater, U.C.L.A.? [A12.]
 
The Health Cost of Business Travel
Foreign business travel may be hazardous to one's health, a study of World Bank employees strongly suggests. The study found that such travelers filed health insurance claims at a greater rate than stay-at-homes.
Edwin McDowell: Business Travel. [D2.]
 
Hurdles for Spike Lee Ad Venture
Six months after the director Spike Lee joined forces with DDB Needham Worldwide to open a joint-venture agency, their fledgling shop has already accumulated a robust roster of accounts with billings that they estimate at $35 million. But Mr. Lee says that he and his giant partner still confront challenges as they seek business from mainstream marketers.

HEADLINE: MONEY AND POLITICS: THE WITNESS;
For Senators, The Answers Carry a Price

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
John Huang's surprise offer today to testify under a limited grant of immunity about his campaign finance activities presents the Senate Governmental Affairs committee with a dilemma: Should it accept an offer from the central figure in the Democratic fund-raising scandal at the risk of making any future prosecution against him virtually impossible?
And the members of the committee are also asking: Will Mr. Huang's testimony be so compelling that this is an offer worth taking? 
 For several months, Mr. Huang has refused to testify without full immunity, which, if granted, would protect him from criminal prosecution. But, Senator John Glenn, the committee's ranking Democrat, said today that Mr. Huang had agreed on Monday night to testify in return for immunity on several less serious matters. He would, however, waive protection against prosecution on such major issues as whether he violated laws against engaging in economic espionage, acting as an agent of a foreign government and improperly transferring classified information to a foreign government.
In making this offer, Mr. Huang's lawyer is moving into a murky legal area. In criminal cases, partial immunity is frequently granted.
But in this case, if Congress grants immunity for some potential legal violations, prosecutors might find it exceedingly difficult to demonstrate that any charges they bring are based on information independent of his Congressional testimony.
Testimony given under grant of Congressional immunity in the Iran-contra hearings later led to the overturning of the convictions of key witnesses -- Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter -- and set high standards for future prosecutions based on Congressional investigations.
Republican lawyers on the committee and some outside legal experts argued today that selective immunity for Congressional witnesses did not exist. The offer has also raised concerns within the Department of Justice, which has been investigating whether Mr. Huang directed money from illegal foreign sources to the Democratic Party and, if so, whether he was part of a larger effort by the Chinese Government to influence American foreign and economic policy.
Justice Department officials would not discuss the case publicly today, but privately said they were concerned that any grant of immunity for Mr. Huang would hamper their ability to charge him with crimes.
A Justice Department spokesman, Bert Brandenburg, would only say that "so far, the Senate committee has shown an appreciation of the effects of immunity on future prosecutions."
Joseph E. diGenova, a former United States attorney and now a private lawyer, called Mr. Huang's offer "nonsense."
"There is a law of immunity and you can't start fooling around with what he says is immunized and what isn't," he said. "This is a clever and interesting ploy by Mr. Huang's lawyer," he said. "Once an order of immunity is given and Mr. Huang starts talking, nothing he says can be used by a prosecutor."
Alan Baron, the lawyer for the committee Democrats who negotiated the offer with Mr. Huang's lawyer, disagreed. "I feel comfortable the lawyers can craft something. We've got willing people on all sides," he said. Ty Cobb, Mr. Huang's lawyer, concurred.
Democratic members of the committee have balked repeatedly at Republican requests to grant immunity to several minor figures so they would testify against bigger players. To date, full immunity has been given to four witnesses, with Justice Department agreement, and negotiations continue for many others.
The decision to grant immunity to a witness requires a two-thirds vote of the committee.
A spokesman for Democrats on the Governmental Affairs Committee said Mr. Huang's offer to testify without immunity on the major issues showed that he had nothing to hide. "The implication of Mr. Huang's offer is that he is innocent," said Leonard Weiss, Democratic staff director for the committee.
The question facing the Republican majority, one Republican committee staff member said, is simple: How desperate are they for Mr. Huang's testimony?
"The allegations against Mr. Huang are serious," said the staff member, who insisted on anonymity. "Is Huang's testimony worth blindly accepting a deal and taking a prosecutorial pass on everything he's done? If you get six other witnesses to tell you 95 percent of the story, then you might not need the top guy."
Senator Fred Thompson, the committee chairman, said Mr. Huang first should give lawyers an indication of what he would say in return for any immunity grant. At the end of the four-hour hearing yesterday, Senator Thompson directed lawyers to meet with Mr. Huang.
Senator Glenn, too, said he would not commit himself to granting immunity without previewing Mr. Huang's testimony and soliciting the view of the Department of Justice.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is 'Open' to Making the Well-Off Pay More for Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
In a subtle but significant shift, the White House said tonight that President Clinton was open to the idea of requiring affluent elderly people to pay higher Medicare premiums, starting next year.
In the past, Mr. Clinton has said he does not oppose an increase in premiums for high-income elderly people. But until now, he has urged Congress to defer discussion of the idea until this year's budget bill is passed. 
 The version of the budget bill approved by the Senate on June 25 would establish a "means test," imposing higher Medicare premiums on individuals with annual incomes over $50,000 and couples with incomes over $75,000. The House version includes no such provision, but House Republicans have said they might support it if Mr. Clinton sent a clear signal that he would go along.
Gene Sperling, assistant to the President for economic policy, said tonight, "The President is open to a high-income premium increase, but has not made a final decision."
Mr. Sperling said the President wanted to be sure that any move to increase Medicare premiums would not endanger bipartisan support for the budget-balancing bill.
Chris Jennings, a White House aide who coordinates health policy, said the Administration had questions about how the higher premiums would be collected. The regular premium, now $43.80 a month, is deducted from monthly Social Security checks. But Mr. Jennings said that procedure would probably not work for the proposed new premiums. He suggested that the "income-related premiums" should be collected by the Internal Revenue Service through annual income tax returns.
In addition, Mr. Jennings said, Congress would have to provide additional money to the Internal Revenue Service so it could assess and collect Medicare premiums.
Finally, Mr. Jennings said, the increase in premiums must not be so steep that it spurs affluent beneficiaries to drop out of the part of the Medicare program that covers doctors' services. Such defections would leave poorer, less healthy people in the program and could cause a sharp increase in their premiums, he said.
Under the Senate bill, the monthly Medicare premium of $43.80 would quadruple for individuals with annual incomes over $100,000 and for couples with incomes over $125,000.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the higher premiums in the Senate bill would generate $3.9 billion in revenue in the next five years and $19.6 billion in revenue from 1998 through 2007. These figures would be much higher if the premiums were collected by the Internal Revenue Service rather than the Department of Health and Human Services, the budget office said.
Administration officials said that only the Internal Revenue Service had the experience and expertise needed to collect higher premiums.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said that Mr. Clinton "would be willing to look at various ways of addressing progressivity in premiums," meaning higher premiums for higher-income beneficiaries.
But Mr. Daschle said the Administration still "strongly opposes" raising the eligibility age for Medicare. The Senate bill would gradually increase the eligibility age to 67, from 65, over the years 2003 to 2027.
House and the Senate negotiators plan to meet later this week to iron out differences between the two bills.

HEADLINE: New York State's Democrats See Party Adrift and Divided

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Everywhere Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan goes these days, he runs into Democrats who will vote for a Republican for mayor of New York this year. "Everywhere," Mr. Moynihan said, emphasizing each syllable.
Edward I. Koch goes a step further. He said he would vote for Rudolph W. Giuliani for mayor this November and George E. Pataki for governor the next. Mr. Koch, a three-term Democratic Mayor known for the occasional Republican dalliance, is not alone. Many Democrats in New York are saying the same things these days, if not so publicly. 
 At first glance, these defections might be dismissed as a bad but passing moment for the state party, a despondent reaction to what is shaping up as another inauspicious election: in this case, the attempt to prevent Mr. Giuliani from winning a second term.
But they are, in the view of an increasing number of Democrats and Republicans alike, the latest symptoms of a larger phenomenon.
The New York Democratic Party, once the pre-eminent national laboratory for Democratic ideas and candidates, is mired in its deepest rut in a generation, many of its own leaders say. It is bereft of money and high profile elected officials. It is out of power and plagued by such division and lack of party discipline that Democrats like Mr. Moynihan, the state's senior Senator, speak almost wistfully of the days when party bosses controlled who would run and what they would say.
At the heart of the problem is that the state's party, which once set the ideological pace for Democrats across the country, is today described by many members as adrift, struggling to reconcile its liberal traditions with an electorate moving to the middle. Suddenly, political leaders outside New York -- from Chicago to Philadelphia to the White House -- are taking the lead in reshaping the Democratic identity, largely by erasing its image as promoter of activist government and advocate for a welter of constituencies.
By contrast, party members and historians say, New York Democrats have resisted such changes. This week, leaders in Albany are fighting Republican efforts to pare welfare programs to conform to a law signed by a Democratic President. And the tug and pull of constituent groups continues to flare, most recently in the fight for the Manhattan borough president's office between a black city councilwoman, C. Virginia Fields, and a lesbian state assemblywoman, Deborah J. Glick.
"The most prominent figures of the party in New York are still wedded to a kind of liberalism that is rapidly falling into disfavor with Democrats in other parts of the country," said Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University. "There is a kind of rigorous, spirited, very powerful defense of the creations of the liberal past in New York that you just don't see in most other parts of the country. And it makes it very difficult for politicians to emerge who want to push the party in a different direction."
One result is that Republicans boast their strongest political lineup in 30 years: a Governor, a Mayor, an Attorney General and one of two United States Senators. And while there is optimism about defeating Alfonse M. D'Amato in the 1998 Senate race, most Democrats are pessimistic about winning back the mayoralty this year or the governorship the next.
That the state's Democratic Party is in trouble became apparent in 1992, when a divisive primary eased Mr. D'Amato's re-election. Mr. Pataki's victory in 1994 underscored the Democratic deterioration, particularly because Mario M. Cuomo left a party long on debt and division and short on talent and direction.
The current mayoral race has further stoked the anxieties of party members. Instead of being embraced as a hopeful sign of a Democratic resurgence, Ruth W. Messinger, the probable Democratic challenger, has become for many Democrats the latest symptom and symbol of the party's difficulties.
"She's a product of the Democratic Party, which is in disarray, and her campaign reflects that," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of her opponents in the mayoral primary, and himself a symbol for many Democrats of the party's problems.
Ms. Messinger's campaign provides almost weekly evidence of the breakdown in party discipline, with Democrats like Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, considering backing Mr. Giuliani. "It's a mystery to me that we have not been able to coalesce around the candidate and use New York City and this election to begin to rebuild the party," said State Senator Catherine M. Abate of Manhattan.
The squabbling between Ms. Messinger's black and gay supporters over whether she should support a black or a lesbian successor publicly reinforced the image of a party beholden to special interests.
Most of all, though, Ms. Messinger's difficulty in framing a message, something that her aides say she will begin to address with a major speech today, has been cited by many Democrats and academics as the latest sign of the party's most intractable problem: its lack of a clear ideological mission.
Mr. Cuomo, often blamed for the party's ideological torpidity, said: "That's what's wrong with the Democratic Party. It's not money, it's not people, it's ideas. What you need to have in the Democratic Party is a rationale."
What is perhaps most ominous for New York's Democrats is that being out of power makes it that much harder to regain their step. With so few in high office, there is no one to define the party's mission, to help raise money or to provide the government jobs parties need to groom leaders. "We have not produced a generation of serious public people who can get elected to office," Mr. Moynihan said.
 
Don't Count Them Out Just Yet
Politics is cyclical, and it would surely be a mistake to dismiss the Democrats, who outnumber Republicans 5 to 1 in New York City, as moribund. For one, the Democrats' difficulties are at least partly a tribute to Mr. Giuliani's perceived success both as Mayor and at blurring partisan distinctions in the city. Crime is down and segments of the city's economy are thriving, and polling shows that most New Yorkers credit Mr. Giuliani for that. His concentration on such issues has served to erase partisan lines, and a central part of his re-election strategy is to, in effect, make people forget that he is a Republican.
But while Democrats have been thrown off balance by Mr. Giuliani, there are no obvious Republican successors in line to replace him, which means that Republican dominance of New York City may be as term-limited as the Mayor himself. Moreover, a Democrat, rather than Mr. Pataki, might well have succeeded Mr. Cuomo had he recognized his growing unpopularity and not sought re-election.
The State Democratic Party has shown recent signs of vitality by erasing its debt and winning the fight over rent regulations, and creating an issue that it hopes to use against Mr. Pataki next year.
There are also at least a few potentially strong Democratic candidates in the wings, including Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Senator Abate, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Public Advocate Mark J. Green.
"The mayor's race is driving people's perception of the state of the party, but that's New York-centric," said Judith Hope, chairwoman of the State Democratic Party. "I'm satisfied that we're doing a very credible job and we are positioning the Democratic Party so that good candidates for governor and Senate can win."
Jill Alper, the political director of the Democratic National Committee, pointed to the number of Democrats lining up to challenge Mr. D'Amato as evidence that New York's political fortunes are on the rise. "At some point, the party will have a candidate that gives it a message," Ms. Alper said. "I don't think that we're out of the hunt. I think the way to put it is we're in the hunt. It's a matter of time."
Still, these are just a few bright lights in a dark sky. It is equally revealing that by concentrating so aggressively on next year's races, Ms. Hope's party seems to be conceding this year's mayoral contest. And few Democrats are genuinely confident that the party can win back the governor's seat. That point has been underscored by Mr. McCall's continued public agonizing about whether he will challenge Mr. Pataki, and by Mr. Schumer's decision to run for Senate instead of governor.
Even the Democrats' greatest victory this year, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's success in preserving a system of rent regulations, ultimately served to point up the party's resistance to change. Party leaders were defending the status quo, declining to consider new ideas about a system that even many tenants conceded was in need of reform.
"Whether you like rent control or not, here is something that is being consistently repudiated everyplace else in the country," said Professor Brinkley of Columbia. "Even Cambridge, Mass., got rid of rent control."
 
There Were Giants In Those Days
In many ways, the New York Democratic Party is a prisoner of its own history. Any mention of the New York Democratic Party, political scientists note, inevitably conjures up figures like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Mr. Cuomo, Robert F. Wagner and Robert F. Kennedy, all of whom are closely identified with the great liberal programs of the last 60 years.
Many Democrats argue that the party's history is more textured than that. Mr. Moynihan noted that he had been talking for years about the need for the Democrats to move away from unquestioning adherence to potentially flawed social programs.
Mr. Koch was elected Mayor by running deliberately against traditional liberalism, identifying himself with the death penalty and against what he described as wasteful social programs.
That said, it was Mr. Cuomo's elegant oratory -- rather than Mr. Koch's pragmatic governance or Mr. Moynihan's questioning of Democratic orthodoxy -- that captured national attention and came to define the face of New York Democrats.
Mr. Cuomo's power as a speaker was once a cause of celebration for his fellow Democrats. Today, he is often blamed by party leaders for freezing Democrats in ideological place. It was Mr. Cuomo who led the charge in 1992, when Mr. Clinton successfully argued during the Presidential race that to win, the party had to reclaim the middle class from the Republican Party, and that to do that, it had to move to the center.
Mr. Cuomo lost that battle, but New York Democrats have retained their reputation as among the most liberal in the country. That perception was at the heart of the attacks on Democrats in the 1994 gubernatorial and 1992 Senate race, and is already being used against Ms. Messinger by Mr. Giuliani and even by her Democratic opponents.
Ms. Messinger said the characterization of her as locked in her party's past was unfair, though she was unclear about exactly how she intended to expand the party's appeal as her candidacy unfolds. "What I'm focusing on is what we need to do, which is to re-emphasize the issues that unite us, because that's how Democrats define and create a government that works for everybody and not for some people," Ms. Messinger said.
 
Green Tries On A New Set of Stripes
At a fund-raiser in Manhattan the other night, Mark J. Green, the Public Advocate hoping to run against Mr. D'Amato, offered what was for him an unusual description of his political stripes. "Forget ideology," Mr. Green announced. "Forget stereotypes. I'm a practical advocate who cuts red tape and tries to make government smarter and smaller."
In other cities, leaders like Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago have tried to break with Democratic tradition. Mr. Daley, for example, has urged that that private companies take over some city services, and has set performance standards for public teachers and schools. Similarly, Mr. Clinton won election the first time by promising middle-class tax cuts and major reforms in welfare.
But in New York, it is Republicans who lately have framed the political debate, to the obvious frustration of Democrats. "Republicans like Giuliani and Pataki have co-opted our issues," Representative Nita M. Lowey of Westchester said yesterday. "What they have done is blur the differences between the Democratic issues and the Republican issues."
Several academics suggest that because the party was not accustomed to being out of power -- it hasn't been in almost 30 years -- it has been slow to respond to Republican success and provide a detailed alternative to the Republican agenda. Mr. Green's remarks the other night may have been one example of that. Similarly, when Mr. Cuomo was asked what candidates should be talking about, he responded: "Education, education, education."
The Democrat with the most prominent platform right now, Ms. Messinger, has yet to lay out a strong rationale for her candidacy, though her advisers say that is about to change. Several Democrats said that was a window into the difficulties the party faces in trying to reconcile its ideological past with the political reality that is New York today.
Ms. Messinger said she had already begun building a case against Mr. Giuliani and laying out a case for her candidacy.
"Listen to what I'm saying, look at what I'm doing," she said. "Look at what I've done and listen to what I promise to the people of this city: a mayor who makes education the No. 1 priority for the 21st century and knows very specifically how to change what happens in the classroom."
But more than a few Democrats say that Ms. Messinger, like her party, is rolling down a predictable road toward a predictable end. Mr. Koch archly recalled the post-election post-mortems of Democratic elders in recent Novembers.
"I've been to those meetings, where they discuss why did we lose," said the former Mayor.
He paused and laughed. "When Ruth goes down to defeat, there'll be another meeting."

Brokers Like Their Work

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Most out-of-work securities executives want to get back into the industry because they are not skilled enough at anything else and the money is good, a survey by Lee Hecht Harrison, a career services firm in Manhattan, has found.
The survey found that 87 percent of dismissed executives are trying to get another job in the industry. That is more than other industries, in which about a third of the people who lose their jobs look elsewhere. 
 "Some people in this industry don't have the transferable skills necessary to change industries," said George Mauze, general manager at Lee Hecht.
The survey also found that many Wall Street executives do not stay out of work for long.
"Brokerage and securities executives find new positions up to 25 percent faster than those in other industries," Mr. Mauze said, adding that more jobs are available now than in the early 90's.

HEADLINE: Jury Is Sworn in the Cosby Case

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
A jury was sworn in yesterday in the trial of Autumn Jackson, the 22-year-old woman charged with trying to extort money from Bill Cosby by claiming to be his out-of-wedlock daughter, and opening statements are scheduled for today.
Throughout the day, Ms. Jackson sat quietly at the defense table with her two co-defendants, as Judge Barbara S. Jones in United States District Court in Manhattan questioned potential jurors. 
 A computer systems analyst said he used to watch "I Spy," the old television show starring Mr. Cosby; he made the jury. So did an unemployed librarian, a former Air Force sergeant and a Nynex employee.
Afterward, Ms. Jackson's defense lawyer, Robert M. Baum, told reporters that "the issue in this case is the intent of Autumn Jackson."
In court, the defense continued to signal that it planned to show that she honestly believed she was Mr. Cosby's daughter and felt she had a legitimate claim to money.
Earlier in the day, Judge Jones ruled that Ms. Jackson's belief that she was legally entitled to money was not in itself a defense.
Moreover, the judge said, there had been no showing yet that Mr. Cosby had promised her any money or that she had earned any of his money. But the judge said the defense was free to try to show that Ms. Jackson's belief that she had such a claim indicated that she did not intend to extort Mr. Cosby.
The defense has said that what the Government calls extortion was a "lawful negotiation" in return for Ms. Jackson's relinquishing her inheritance claims or other rights as a daughter.
Mr. Baum said in court that Ms. Jackson had gotten legal advice before undertaking the activity that led to her arrest.

Dollar Touches 3 1/2-Year High Vs. Mark but Finishes Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a three-and-a-half-year high against the mark yesterday but later retreated and finished lower, under pressure from a wider Japanese trade surplus and cross-trading between the mark and other European currencies.
European currency dealings were driven in large part by heightened expectations of a rise in British interest rates. The Bank of England was widely expected to raise its base lending rate to 6.75 percent and possibly 7 percent from 6.50 percent today. 
 But some traders bet on an even bigger increase after The Financial Times of London suggested in an editorial yesterday that "a full percentage point jump might be better."
News early in the day that Japan's trade surplus more than doubled in May also hurt the dollar. But the dollar was confined to narrow movements, largely as the result of trading between European currencies and the relative lack of other news.
"We're sitting here with our hands folded," said Ben Strauss, a senior currency trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York. "The markets are awaiting the British rate news."
Mark weakness against the pound and the Swiss franc indirectly helped the dollar reach an intraday high of 1.7656 marks, the strongest since February 1994, before it retreated to settle at 1.7599 marks in New York, down from 1.7613 marks on Tuesday. The dollar settled at 112.77 yen, down from 112.87 yen Tuesday.
The pound strengthened to a six-year high of 2.9775 marks but settled lower against the dollar at $1.6880, down from $1.6886.
The main event affecting the dollar was the news from Japan that the surplus in Japan's broadest measure of trade, which measures merchandise, services, tourism and investments, totaled 906.8 billion yen ($8.02 billion) in May, up 154.9 percent from May 1996.
It was the second consecutive monthly increase and underscored apprehension in the foreign-exchange market that the United States might seek to push the yen higher against the dollar. A more expensive yen would make Japanese goods and services more expensive abroad and narrow the trade imbalance.

Crude Oil Falls on a Report That Inventories Are Rising

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil fell after an industry group said United States inventories swelled 1.5 percent last week as imports rose and demand from refiners declined.
On other markets, copper dropped for a fourth day, reaching a four-month low, and corn rose. 
 United States crude oil inventories rose by 4.70 million barrels, to 322.7 million barrels in the week ended July 4, the American Petroleum Institute said after trading yesterday. Most analysts expected crude stocks to fall.
Crude imports have flooded the market in recent weeks, overcoming robust demand for gasoline during the vacation season.
"Prices are retreating because of the supply increases versus demand in crude," said George Gaspar, managing director of petroleum research at Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
Crude oil for August delivery fell 27 cents, to $19.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. August gasoline slid 0.69 cent, to 58.23 cents a gallon.
Copper slumped to a four-month low as a seasonal drop in demand allowed stockpiles to increase.
Demand for copper is falling in North America as the summer progresses and factories close or reduce output. Inventories have grown 11 percent since June 20, snapping four months of declines.
"The rise in stocks has not been gargantuan, but it comes after a period of prolonged draw-downs," said Michael Sones, a copper analyst at Banque Paribas in London. "Market sentiment has changed with the seasonal slowdown."
Copper for September delivery fell 2.55 cents, to $1.025 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest since Feb. 3.
Corn jumped over concern that a heat wave forecast for the Midwest could harm development of the fall crop. Corn for December delivery, the first contract after the harvest, rose 7.5 cents, to $2.3725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Last week, the Department of Agriculture rated 75 percent of the United States corn crop in good-to-excellent condition. That was lower than many traders' expectations for an 80 percent rating, but up from 74 percent a week earlier.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Living Dangerously

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
Pound for pound, Indonesia has to be the least understood country in the world. With 200 million people, it is the globe's fourth-largest nation and by far the largest Muslim country -- triple the population of Iran. It takes the same time to fly across the 17,000 islands and 300 different ethnic groups that make up Indonesia as it does to fly across the U.S. But ask most Americans about Indonesia and only three things are likely to come to mind: Bali, East Timor and "The Year of Living Dangerously," starring Mel Gibson.
The U.S. looms somewhat larger in Indonesia. The U.S. Congress has been one of the main forces pressing for improved rights for Indonesian workers, as well as for the much-brutalized people of East Timor. Human rights activists here say the U.S. spotlight has been crucial in keeping Indonesia's leaders focused on addressing abuses, even if progress is sporadic and at a snail's pace. 
 But in the wake of recent moves by Congress to block the sale of nine F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia and to freeze the training of Indonesian military officers in America -- because of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor -- Indonesians are beginning to fear that something new is going on: America is going from criticizing them for certain abuses to turning Indonesia into a pariah state -- another Burma, China, Iraq or Iran.
If that's where Congress is heading, it would be both wrong and stupid. Indonesia is too complex to be a pariah. It has probably the best macroeconomic management of any developing nation, along with mind-boggling corruption; it has political repression along with a tolerance for hundreds of independent nongovernmental human rights groups and a press that is unafraid to write about abuses; it has occasional church burnings, but the most popular Muslim leader in the country sent his daughter to study in Israel. As one banned newspaper editor here remarked to me: "The Indonesian Government is a police state about six hours a day. The other 18 hours you can negotiate with it, bribe it, ignore it or go around it." And strategically, Indonesia is the keystone of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), which is the main counterweight to China and Japan in this region. Turning Indonesia into a pariah will produce a nationalist backlash here among the good guys, let alone the bad. Listen to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
"What we had hoped," Mr. Alatas told me, "was that public opinion would not forget Indonesia's constructive role in world affairs. We are not a pariah country that is looking inward or that deserves to be hit on one issue only. Yes, we have an issue, we have East Timor, but that's a complex issue with a long history that we are trying to resolve. We are a huge society in continual growth. It is not an easy country to govern and we have come very far.
"We are not causing the world problems because we have dreams of becoming a nuclear power," added Mr. Alatas. "We don't believe in that. Economically, we have been at the forefront of the North-South dialogue, but with a very rational voice. We are the biggest Islamic population, but we are not an Islamic state. Take all of these factors and I think, humbly, we don't deserve to be put into a corner and to say, 'You are a pariah nation and we must clobber you all the time because of East Timor.'
"You can criticize us about human rights; no country is beyond criticism on human rights," continued Mr. Alatas. "We would prefer that you don't criticize us by shouting from the roofs, but that you sit down and as a friend say: 'Look, we don't like the way you do things. You better change because you're getting in trouble.' But why link it to such things as IMET?"
IMET stands for International Military Educational Training. It is a program under which the Pentagon trains selected foreign military officers, in both military matters and human rights. After the 1991 Dili massacre in East Timor, IMET for Indonesian officers was suspended.
"Indonesia is a friend of the U.S., not an enemy," insisted Mr. Alatas. "It is important not to make it an opponent. Because an Indonesia that is feeling unjustifiably pushed around, an Indonesia that feels that Indonesia-bashing is going on, reaches a point where it says, 'Well, O.K., we've done what we can. If that is not understood then we'll just shrug our shoulders and continue on.' "

Inflation Outlook Lifts Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday, bolstered by investor optimism that inflation would not soon accelerate. But that same sentiment weakened demand at an auction of new five-year inflation-protected securities.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 7/32, to 100 27/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.56 percent, from 6.58 percent on Tuesday, and was the lowest since 6.54 percent on Feb. 18. 
 There was some profit taking to pull the market off its highs, said Kim Rupert, an economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco. "But, by and large, players seem to be waiting as they believe prices can move higher with 6.50 percent targeted on the long bonds," she said.
With no current threat of inflation on the horizon, market participants had expected the Treasury's $8 billion auction of new five-year inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, to meet with soft demand. The Government has already sold $15 billion of 10-year inflation-linked securities and some traders say that investors have not been pleased with their performance.
Securities dealers preparing for yesterday's auction of the new five-year securities sent the yield up 15 basis points in when-issued trading over two days. Dealers often raise yields in advance of an auction to make them more attractive to investors. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The five-year TIPS were awarded yesterday at a high yield of 3.744 percent, but retail demand was not overwhelming.
Analysts said that the Treasury market gained somewhat on relief that the auction was out of the way.
Over all, said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "a combination of slack second-quarter economic growth, decelerating inflation, a steady monetary policy and notable progress in lowering the budget deficit has produced a significant rally in the bond market.
"And while many market observers feel that there is little in the near term that could upset this apple cart," he continued, "stronger economic growth during the third quarter, coupled with a flattening of the trend rate of inflation, could certainly produce some skittishness in bondland in the not too distant future.
"Indeed, judging from recent measures of buoyant consumer psychology, a rebound in retail sales should soon be forthcoming on the heels of the recent three successive monthly declines," Mr. Fine said. "In similar fashion, the deceleration in inflation is not likely to continue much longer in that the drag from declining energy prices has largely run its course."
A heavy corporate calendar yesterday also limited gains later. The Philip Morris Companies yesterday began selling $1 billion of global bonds due in 2005, with terms to be announced today through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch International.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of five-year inflation-protected securities:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Art museums stretch scarce marketing dollars with carefully targeted publicity campaigns.

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
WHILE giant consumer-products companies routinely spend millions of dollars on campaigns, the nation's most prestigious art museums are lucky these days to find several hundred thousand dollars to advertise their grandest exhibitions.
So museums in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and everywhere have spearheaded a new trend, making their scarce resources go farther in innovative ways, including highly targeted newspaper, magazine and radio advertising. 
 Consider, for starters, the Art Institute of Chicago, which has designed a complex, multilayered campaign to draw museum-goers to its next mega-exhibition, "Renoir's Portraits: Impressions of an Age." The first major Renoir portrait retrospective, it features 65 works and is scheduled to open Oct. 21.
"We're hoping to attract 600,000 people to this show," said Eileen Harakal, executive director for public affairs for the museum, "so we're doing more, earlier, this time than with previous exhibitions."
Rejecting the notion of a last-minute advertising blitz this fall, the Art Institute began its campaign in April, six months before opening day. The museum first advertised in "Cultural Chicago," an insert created by the Illinois Bureau of Tourism that went to 250,000 American Express card holders and appeared in magazines such as Food & Wine and Travel & Leisure.
At the same time, the Art Institute focused on two million readers of small newspapers in the Midwest.
Then, last month, the museum took out full-page ads in The Chicago Tribune and other newspapers. Now, through July, ads will appear in local newspapers like The Chicago Reader, in national magazines like The New Yorker and on Chicago radio stations. In September, just before the show opens, national and local campaigns will return.
Officials of the Art Institute declined to discuss spending, but experts on institutional marketing budgets said the campaign could not have been accomplished for less than $300,000.
Another institution, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has become the first museum to use focused ethnic marketing to publicize recent hit shows like "The Glory of Byzantium" and "Splendors of Imperial China." "We're doing very targeted metropolitan area advertising," said Harold Holzer, vice president for communications at the Met.
"Museums have had to become more sophisticated about marketing themselves, because they must make maximum use of scarce resources," Mr. Holzer added.
Generally those resources come mostly from the limited marketing budgets of the nonprofits, which have been augmented, in the case of the Art Institute, by Ameritech, and at the Metropolitan by companies like Alpha Banking Group, GTE and Texaco. At the American Museum of Natural History, Merrill Lynch was the advertising sponsor for last year's presentation of Leonardo da Vinci's scientific manuscript known as the Codex Leicester.
And in addition to arranging for highly selective newspaper, magazine and radio advertising, the Metropolitan has reached out to nontraditional marketing venues. "We have become ubiquitous on hotel videos," Mr. Holzer said, explaining that the museum has bought commercial time on tourist-oriented video programming shown in more than 100 hotels in Manhattan.
To reinforce the video message, the Met has invited more than 100 hotel concierges to the museum to explain the institution's coming events, and to load them up with brochures for tourists.
Increasingly the Met, the Art Institute and other nonprofit institutions are using discount programs for their ad pages in national magazines. These bargain-basement opportunities arise when major advertisers make expensive regional buys, leaving ad pages unfilled in other areas.
When that happens, many magazines offer the surplus space at a discount. The museums are now able to aim their ads so precisely that they can make buys as specific as a single ZIP code. Such ads have appeared in magazines from Bon Appetit and House Beautiful to Business Week, Time and U.S. News & World Report.
Such advertising "might cost $16,000 to $24,000, which is affordable for nonprofit institutions," said Michael LaPlaca, co-founder of LaPlaca Cohen Advertising in New York, which designed the Art Institute's Renoir campaign and represents the Metropolitan. "This is much more efficient than spending a lot more for scattershot advertising in other media."
The payoff for all of this increasingly sophisticated advertising is hardly theoretical: It amounts to millions of tourist dollars for museums and their cities. "Cultural tourism is becoming more important, and museums are more aware that people will travel to see a great art show," Ms. Harakal said.
Last summer, for example, Philadelphia benefited from the "Cezanne" show. The immensely popular exhibition of 170 works by the Impressionist master attracted 700,000 visitors to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and generated $60 million in revenue at hotels, restaurants, shops and local transportation.
Chicago has benefited from cultural tourism as well. In the summer of 1995, the Art Institute attracted 965,000 visitors to its retrospective, "Claude Monet: 1840-1926," and the museum's winter 1996 show, "Degas: Beyond Impressionism," attracted 480,000 visitors, even though it was not on view during the height of the tourist season.
The volume record holder, however, is the Metropolitan Museum in New York, where the "Splendors of Imperial China" exhibition last year attracted 426,757 visitors during a two-month run, the highest daily attendance of any museum show in the world in 1996, according to a study by The Economist.
The lesson of these spectacular successes is plain. "We're becoming more attuned to our audience," Ms. Harakal said, "and we're learning exactly where it comes from."

HEADLINE: Cry for Cambodia

 BODY:
The last thing Cambodia needed was the armed overthrow of its democratically elected Government. It had just begun to recover from a catastrophic quarter-century that included American bombing raids, the annihilation of one-seventh of its population during four years of Khmer Rouge rule, a Vietnamese invasion and a civil war. Now it faces new convulsions and executions and a likely withdrawal of most international aid.
Washington is still searching for a diplomatic euphemism to describe this week's military ouster of Cambodia's First Prime Minister, Norodom Ranariddh, by his coalition partner and longtime rival, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. Simply calling it a coup would bring an automatic suspension of American aid to the country. The Clinton Administration fears such instant disengagement would reduce rather than increase United States leverage. 
 Whatever label Washington applies, Mr. Hun Sen's bloody seizure of power is an affront to democracy and a violation of the 1991 Paris peace agreement that ended the Cambodian civil war. Most of all it is a disaster for Cambodia. If Washington cannot get the coup leaders to back down, it should suspend American aid and work to persuade other countries to do the same. Japan, a major aid donor, has already cut off its assistance.
Mr. Hun Sen's actions came after Prince Ranariddh had begun making overtures to dissident leaders of the Khmer Rouge. Given the Khmer Rouge's responsibility for the death of more than a million Cambodians two decades ago, those overtures were cause for concern. But sending tanks against Prince Ranariddh's supporters and murdering leaders of his political party are not a legitimate response.
Despite its tragic history, current political infighting and serious corruption problems, Cambodia has recently been showing a surprisingly vital economy. Its citizens, long traumatized by war and dictatorship, had begun openly expressing political views, educating themselves on human rights issues and turning to newspapers increasingly willing to challenge Government behavior. Washington should be resolute in opposing Mr. Hun Sen's outrageous coup by making clear that unless he restores the elected Government he faces costly international isolation.

HEADLINE: Two Financiers To Form No. 1 Investment Bank in Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 9

 BODY:
Combining Western financial expertise with Russian political and economic power, two of the nation's most influential financiers have joined forces to establish Russia's largest investment bank.
The new company will merge the Renaissance Capital Group with the International Company for Finance and Investment, which is now Russia's fifth-largest bank. 
 The merger will also formalize the alliance between Boris Jordan, the ambitious 31-year-old American who founded Renaissance Capital, and Vladimir O. Potanin, the 37-year-old former head of Uneximbank, the parent company of the Russian bank.
For Russia's leaders, eagerly awaiting the country's long-delayed economic turnaround, the announcement of the merger is an important sign that at least some Russian bankers believe there is real money to be made by investing at home.
"Russia needed a Russian-controlled international investment and merchant bank," said A. Robert Towbin, who is the managing director of Unterberg Harris, an American investment bank and brokerage firm, and the former president of the Russian-American Enterprise Fund, which was established by the United States Government to encourage the development of Russia's market economy.
"The image in the West is that Russia is the place of flight capital," Mr. Towbin added. "This says to the world that there are Russians with equity capital who are investing in Russia."
Indeed, the announcement comes at a critical time in Russia's economic development. After six years of economic decline, inflation has been brought under control. Economic reformers occupy top slots in the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. The Moscow stock exchange has soared.
Still, the economy has yet to show sustained growth. Key reforms of the tax system, housing and agriculture have yet to be carried out. Much of Russian industry has yet to be restructured. Direct investment in Russian companies is anemic.
The new bank, MFK Renaissance, will have equity capital of $400 million. It will manage more than $1 billion in funds and will have total assets of more than $2 billion. The bank plans to employ about 600 people.
Mr. Jordan will serve as president and chief executive. Mr. Potanin will become the chairman. Each side will own 50 percent. The merger is expected to be formally completed within six months.
The relationship between Mr. Jordan and Mr. Potanin goes back several years, when Mr. Potanin helped Mr. Jordan get his big start. Mr. Jordan, grandson of a Russian immigrant, was sent to Russia in 1992 by the CS First Boston Corporation. He left that company in 1994, along with other investment bankers and traders, to establish Renaissance Capital.
Mr. Potanin's Uneximbank provided important start-up capital and acquired a minority stake in Renaissance Capital.
"They were the only people we found that thought the way we did, were transparent enough and were of the generation we wanted to be associated with in Russia," Mr. Jordan recalled in an interview.
Uneximbank's effectiveness in restructuring former Soviet enterprises remains a matter of considerable debate among economists here. But there is no doubt about Mr. Potanin's ability to wheel and deal his way to the top of Russia's new financial elite.
A graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Mr. Potanin worked at the Foreign Trade Ministry at the start of his career. As president of Uneximbank, he pioneered the "loans for share" privatization arrangement in which powerful banks lent money to the Russian Government in exchange for shares of some of the country's most valuable assets. Mr. Potanin became a first deputy prime minister last year but returned to Uneximbank after one of many Cabinet shake-ups.
Today, Uneximbank is the custodian of 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, which produces one-fourth of the world's nickel. Uneximbank also owns 85 percent of Sidanko, Russia's fourth-largest oil producer, and it is trying to put together a bid for a 25 percent share of RAO Svyazinvest, the huge Russian telecommunications company.
Russia's investment community abounds in skeptics, who say Mr. Jordan was driven to the merger out of fear that he was losing his competitive edge or out of pressure from the powerful Uneximbank. Others challenge Mr. Potanin's business acumen.
"They are trying to gain muscle with closer collaboration with Potanin," Anders Aslund, an expert on the Russian economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of Renaissance Capital. "I am skeptical of Potanin as a business manager."
Mr. Potanin, for his part, insisted that MFK Renaissance would help attract investment to ailing Russian companies and facilitate their restructuring. And he said that Renaissance Capital's Russian coloration would ease the merger.
"It is not a 100 percent foreign firm," he said. "There is Russian participation in Renaissance. And let's not forget that Boris Jordan is Russian even through he is an American citizen."
For his part, Mr. Jordan said that MFK Renaissance now needs to find new clients within Russia. "You have to build a business that has a large domestic client basis," he said, so that it can help direct "domestic flows to domestic corporations and international flows to domestic corporations."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The split over punitive awards in getting the bad guys.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IN last month's proposed tobacco settlement, cigarette manufacturers apparently got what they coveted most: immunity from punitive damages. And while anti-tobacco groups are now at each other's throats over whether they exacted a sufficient price in return, everyone agrees that the potential for sky-high punitive damage awards in individual injury suits immensely strengthened their bargaining power. "It's the lever that brought the tobacco industry to the table," said Michael Pertchuk, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission who now heads the Advocacy Institute in Washington, a nonprofit group closely linked to the anti-smoking coalition.
This is not the first time the specter of unbounded and unpredictable awards has driven corporate defendants to settle, or that legislation was needed to ratify a settlement. "The structure is very close to the lead paint agreement in Maryland," noted Donald Gifford, dean of the University of Maryland Law School, who represented Maryland in the negotiations in that case, in which landlords accepted responsibility for compensating victims and financing a lead paint cleanup program in return for protection from future individual suits. 
 But specialists in business law are deeply divided over the role that unpredictable damages awards in general and punitive damages in particular should play in civil justice. Trial lawyers and many consumer groups argue that punitive awards can stop the bad guys when compensatory damages alone are insufficient. "It's the appropriate response in a capitalist society," said Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, the consumer lobbying group.
By contrast, conservative legal scholars view punitive damages as the enemy of rational judgment, forcing defendants to settle claims without regard to the merits. "To play the game, you have to bet the corporation." warned Michael Horowitz, the director of the Hudson Institute's Project for Civil Justice Reform.
Start with some basics. The primary goals of damage awards in injury suits are deterrence and compensation. At least in theory, parting with cash induces defendants to exercise greater care and makes victims whole.
But what if a manufacturer of shoddy products knew the risks and decided it was cheaper to pay off the occasional claim? Damages in excess of compensation might be needed to change the pattern.
In recent decades, noted Lester Brickman at Yeshiva University's Cardozo Law School, economists have refined this logic. If an intentional injury or fraud is unlikely to be detected -- say, the use of substandard concrete in bridge construction -- some multiple of actual damages is needed to achieve the "optimal" level of deterrence.
The catch is that punishments meted out by courts may not fit the crime. In a now-famous case -- the first punitive damage case to be overturned by the Supreme Court -- a rural Alabama jury awarded $4 million to the owner of a BMW whose paint job had been retouched before sale. Less frivolously, courts have nailed auto makers with multimillion-dollar damages in injury cases with the intent of forcing them to build safer cars. "National policy on auto safety shouldn't be set by six randomly selected jurors in Georgia," Mr. Brickman argued.
But some scholars think the issue has been blown out of proportion. Theodore Eisenberg at the Cornell Law School, who analyzed punitive damages in the country's 45 largest counties, found that they were rarely awarded in cases that did not involve egregious, intentional injury. And when they were awarded, the sums were typically a reasonable multiple of compensatory damages.
George Priest at the Yale Law School is not persuaded. "Punitive damages are not a serious problem in most states," he acknowledged, because trial judges and appellate courts adequately discipline jury awards. But he said, "there are severe problems in a few pockets" -- notably Alabama and West Texas.
Even occasional excesses, moreover, may have a large impact on corporate behavior. While the Supreme Court did vote 5 to 4 to throw out the judgment against BMW because, in the words of Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the award was "grossly excessive," Mr. Horowitz of the Hudson Institute argued that "the law remains wildly undeveloped." And for better or worse, defendants with deep pockets often cut their losses.
In Maryland, landlords faced awesome potential liability from lead paint damages. And in 1994, after losing a handful of individual suits, they agreed to settle. The deal satisfied no one completely. But it beat decades of litigation in which "a few children and their lawyers would get full compensation," Mr. Gifford said.
Manufacturers have long fought for limits on punitive damages in product liability cases, and would have gotten them last year if President Clinton had not vetoed Federal legislation. But populist water runs deep in America. And many still see the potential for huge damage awards as a check on corporate power. Big Tobacco's willingness to pay $300 billion-plus in compensation rather than risk continuing the fight in court is likely to reinforce that view.

HEADLINE: Dow, Hit by Program Sales, Slides 119.88

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market plunged yesterday in a frenzied session marked by heavy program trading.
The late afternoon bout of computer-driven selling helped undermine a session that many Wall Street analysts thought would carry the Dow Jones industrial average above the 8,000-point level for the first time. 
 Instead, the Dow -- which had closed at 7,962.31 on Tuesday -- rose as high as 7,990.58 in early trading, before surrendering to afternoon losses. At the end of trading, the Dow was down 119.88 points, or 1.51 percent, to 7,842.43. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.21 points, or 1.22 percent, to close at 907.54.
The selloff, which had the Dow falling by 167 points in late trading, came on a day when there was little economic news.
Analysts said that investors might have been affected by reports of a large asset allocation shift at several large brokerage houses. That move, they said, may have touched off additional selling, and upset a market that has been prone to huge momentum swings.
"So much of our market is based on momentum," Edward Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities, said. "So when several firms changed their asset allocation models, that created some selling into an early rally."
Morgan Stanley was one of the investment houses said to be involved in the large asset allocation trading. But officials there declined to comment.
Other analysts said that the market downturn was created by investors keen to take profits, or perhaps by those who had grown worried about a market that had seen the Dow soar 25 percent since mid-April, when it began climbing after a monthlong downturn.
"What you saw was a classic bull market correction after an extended run-up in which the news couldn't get any better," Charles Pradilla, an analyst at Cowen & Company, said. "There are some portfolio managers who look around and say: 'That's a huge move. What can get better?' "
Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn., tracked 13 large programs yesterday, including one that sold a basket of about 390 S.& P. stocks just after 2:45 P.M., when the Dow began sinking.
"It was a very volatile, up-and- down day," said Jeffrey Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi, noting that there were seven "buy" programs and six "sell" programs. "The last hour was heavily impacted by program trades."
In recent months, fears of inflation have eased on reports of a decelerating economy and inaction on the part of the Federal Reserve policy makers, who in March had raised the target on short-term interest rates.
With earnings prospects strong and the economy robust, investors have sent the Dow and other stock indexes to record after record close with the kind of momentum that some thought could send the Dow above 8,000 in a year when few on Wall Street expected it to reach 7,000.
But with the Dow up about 22 percent in just over six months this year, some analysts are worried that the market is getting ahead of itself. Huge price swings have added to the concerns, even though many analysts point out that with the Dow near 8,000, a move of 100 points is a smaller change in terms of percentage.
"We made a run at the 8,000 level and we failed," Joseph Yurman, a managing director at Robertson Stephens, said from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. "I've seen this happen hundreds of times with a historical number. And 100 points is just a normal thing -- it's handled very easily down here on the floor."
For the Dow, it was the 21st session this year in which the blue-chip average had a move of 100 points or more. Prior to this year, there had been just 15.
"We have to acclimate ourselves that we're near 8,000, not at 4,000, where we were a few years ago," Mr. Pradilla said.
Although the Dow and S.& P. 500 had sizable losses, declines in the broader market were not as severe.
On the Big Board, there were 1,725 losing issues and 1,145 advancing issues. Volume was heavy at 592 million shares.
Technology issues fared much better yesterday, with the Nasdaq composite index setting a record for the fifth consecutive session.
The Nasdaq rose 1.53 points, to 1,486.63, helped by shares of computer companies after Motorola -- which is traded on the Big Board -- reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday.
Shares of Motorola rose 3 1/2, to 86; Intel gained 3, to 152 5/8; 3Com rose 2 9/16, to 52 5/8, and Ascend Communications rose 2 3/8, to 48 1/2.
Wells Fargo, which warned investors about weak second-quarter earnings, fell 18 3/8, to 260 5/8. Drug and financial stocks were weak yesterday.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 26 lost ground yesterday, led by J. P. Morgan, down 3 1/8, to 106 3/8, and Merck, which lost 2 3/4, to 101 3/16. I.B.M., however, rose 7/16, to 96 3/16 -- a 52-week high.

HEADLINE: THE NATO SUMMIT;
In Clinton's Words: 'Building Lines of Partnership and Bridges to the Future'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's opening statement at a news conference yesterday on the NATO summit meeting, and from his exchange with reporters, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription company:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
This was a unique conference. There have been conferences of great powers in Europe many times before, but today, with our meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, we had 44 nations -- big and small, new democracies and established ones -- meeting to chart a common future of freedom and security -- not large powers writing the destiny of small ones without regard to the impact of their decisions on ordinary citizens, but nations dismantling blocs of power, building lines of partnership and bridges to the future. 
 Many tongues were spoken at our table today, but the language was the same, the language of democracy in the pursuit of a common dream of a Europe, undivided, free and at peace.
NATO is at the heart of that vision. What happened here this week represents a lot of work over the last 3 1/2 years. Yesterday we made NATO stronger and ready to meet challenges of a new century by further streamlining its command structure and giving Europe a greater security role within NATO. Then, in a historic turning point, we extended invitations to new members for the first time since Spain joined NATO 15 years ago. And we opened the door to other members in the future.
Today we strengthened our ties to NATO's Partners for Peace and continued to reach out to new ones with the agreement with Ukraine. Together with the historic NATO-Russia Founding Act in Paris this spring, we now see a new and broader and deeper alliance.
Let me say as an American I was very pleased to be joined by a bipartisan delegation of our Congress from both houses, and very pleased that Senator Roth was the spokesperson for the parliamentarians from all the NATO countries yesterday supporting our expansion decisions.
Next year I will ask the United States Senate to ratify changes to the treaty governing NATO so that we can bring in the new members by the 50th anniversary of NATO in 1999. I hope this week and the publicity it has received back home in America will help to stimulate discussion and debate among the American people about this historic decision. And I hope that when the American people hear the arguments, they, too, will strongly support the enlargement of NATO.
This is going to make all of us stronger and more secure. The new allies will help us to better defend the territory of members and reduce the chances that any of the territory will be violated. Bringing in new members will help to lock in the gains of democracy in those countries, and the free market gains they are already achieving. The example of these new members will help to encourage others to aspire to membership and to continue their democratic reform and their efforts to settle disputes with their neighbors.
Finally, it will help to erase the artificial line drawn across Europe by Stalin after World War II. NATO enlargement, however, will not be cost or risk free. No important decision ever is. But for the American people, clearly, the costs will be far less in lives and money to expand the bounds of democracy and security than it would be if we had to involve our people in another conflict in Europe. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. Mr. President, Radovan Karadzic continues to stir up trouble in Bosnia to the point of endangering the new President there and the democratically elected Government. Do you think that NATO peacekeepers should aggressively pursue him? Would you favor some kind of paramilitary operation to apprehend him?
A. First, let me say, we support Mrs. Plavsic and what she's trying to do. We oppose the unconstitutional efforts to restrict her authority. We appreciate the fact that, even though we don't agree on everything, she has stated her adherence to the Dayton accords and is trying to follow them.
And second, we believe that Mr. Karadzic and all the other indicted people who have been accused of war crimes should be arrested and subject to trial.
Third, in terms of the S.F.O.R. members themselves, clearly our mandate is to arrest people who have been accused of war crimes and turn them over for trial if that can be done in the course of fulfilling our other duties and if the commanders on the ground believe the risk is appropriate. As to whether anything beyond that could or should be done, I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time. . . .
Q. French President Chirac earlier today suggested that France is not going to spend any money to expand NATO. He said that the new members should pay the bill themselves, which raises two interesting questions. If France isn't going to spend any money to expand NATO, why should the United States taxpayers be forced to spend what probably would be $2 billion over the next decade or so to expand NATO?
And the second related question is, these new countries are relatively poor and have limited hard currency. Why should they -- why should the United States and the other NATO allies be encouraging them now to spend their limited resources for high-tech weaponry, which may be good for U.S. and European defense contractors, but probably could be used more effectively to develop their own economic infrastructure, especially at a time when you yourself say there is no serious external threat to these countries?
A. Well, first of all, the weapons they would have to buy would be conditioned, more than anything else, on what kinds of missions they believe they will be called upon to undertake.
If they, for example, are sending their troops to Bosnia, if there is some future of Bosnia or some other peacekeeping role, as NATO troops, we would want them to be as well-armed as possible to protect themselves. . . .
Secondly, one of the things that I believe that I noted at this meeting was that there had not been a great deal of work done in many countries about what the costs were. I think some people in the United States have grossly overestimated the costs of NATO expansion.
I do believe that the nations involved should pay most of the cost themselves. But it's not just a question of that. There will be joint training to be done, just like there is in Partnership for Peace. But it will conducted at a higher level. There will be joint planning to be done. . . .
Q. Mr. President, NATO expansion has critics in the United States, and not only on the grounds of cost. Some say it risks isolating Russia or weakening and diluting the Western alliance. Do you feel the need to launch a public-relations campaign in the United States on behalf of this initiative? And if so, what will you do?
A. Well, I think a lot of our campaign has already begun, because of the widespread awareness at home. Because all of you are here and telling them at home what we just did, I think that a lot of the work has begun. But I do think, yes, that we all have a job to do, as Senator Roth said yesterday. But I and our Administration have a job to do with the American people and with the United States Congress.
I disagree that we are isolating Russia. You can only believe that we're isolating Russia if you believe that the great power territorial politics of the 20th century will dominate the 21st century, and if you believe that NATO is inherently antagonistic to Russia's interests and that Russia inherently will have to try to exercise greater territorial domination in the next few years than it has in the last two. I dispute that.
I believe that enlightened self-interest, as well as shared values, will compel countries to define their greatness in more constructive ways, and the threats that we will share, that will be genuine threats to our security, will compel us to cooperate in more constructive ways. . . .
Q. [Unintelligible] And will the Ukrainian-NATO charter give any guarantees of security for Ukraine?
A. I think it enhances the security of Ukraine just as I believe the NATO-Russia agreement enhances Russia's security and enhances NATO's, because it commits us to cooperation rather than conflict.
In terms of what we would do in the Black Sea, let's note one thing, that Ukraine and Russia have recently agreed to settle their differences, which is a huge, positive thing from our point of view.
To us, that was our biggest concern in the Black Sea was the argument between Ukraine and Russia. And we're gratified that there's been an agreement that will resolve it when it's implemented. And in terms of what we do with our exercises, that depends upon what we think the appropriate thing is under the circumstances. And I have no evidence at the time which would cause me to change my position.
Q. Mr. President, you had a meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma today. What did you say to him? And what do you think about the state of economic reform in the country, which was the point of your concern recently?
A. Well, first of all, I congratulated him on the agreement, President Kuchma, on the agreement between the United States and NATO. Secondly, I reaffirmed our determination, which was stated again at Denver, to help Ukraine deal with the closure of Chernobyl and develop reasonable alternative sources of energy.
The third thing I did was to urge him to continue to support economic reform. This is the most difficult thing of all, because when a country goes from a Communist economy to a free market economy, almost always there's a period in which things are actually harder for ordinary citizens. And the voters may vote out the reformers. And it's a difficult thing.
But in the end, which doesn't take very long, the economy grows much more. And I told President Kuchma that if he could find a way to support the reforms and enact them in this year, that I would do everything I could to see that the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development supported Ukraine to minimize the problems for the people in Ukraine and to speed up the day when the economy will genuinely be growing again.

HEADLINE: U.S. Job Machine Absorbing Fresh Workers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
The hailstorm that did so much damage to roofs here a little more than a year ago pulled Antonio Rodriguez into the labor force. Kneeling on the lawn in front of a white clapboard home recently, he cut strips of asphalt shingles while four other young men lugged the shingles up a ladder and nailed them in place. Soon after, the team moved on to the next damaged roof.
Mr. Rodriguez, traveling from Mexico, settled here five years ago, but making a living came hard. Stints as a day laborer alternated with longer periods of idleness in which he rarely even looked for a job. "My friends offered me work sometimes," he said. And then the hailstorm, and the prospering Kentucky economy, brought Mr. Rodriguez full blast into the labor force. 
 About 18 months ago, the American labor force, which is everyone working or actively seeking work, began to grow at a rapidly accelerating rate. By early this year, it was expanding at nearly twice the rate of other years in the 1990's, although in recent months the growth has eased a bit. What's more, the labor force is continuing to grow considerably faster than the working-age population.
The result is that about four million more workers have been fed into a growing economy since the start of 1996. Hispanic people are the biggest contingent, but younger women and men over 55 also figure prominently among the new entrants.
Many are being pulled into the labor force by employers who are offering better pay than the minimum wage and -- with the unemployment rate hovering at 5 percent or below -- are less choosy than they once were about whom they hire. Mostly the new people are entering at relatively low pay, like Mr. Rodriguez, who is earning $50 a day.
Indeed, companies are recruiting among those ignored in the past: mothers at home with their children, older men who had retired or had been laid off, students, immigrants, people with criminal records. State officials here who help former prisoners get jobs say companies now reject fewer convicted felons. And tens of thousands of welfare recipients are being pushed off the rolls and into work by changes in the Federal welfare system.
"There is a huge and chronic reserve of working-age people in this country," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, "and when conditions are right, or they are pushed, they come into the labor force. That is happening now."
One of the big national economic issues is how long the American labor force, now numbering 129.4 million workers and 6.8 million people actively seeking work, can continue growing at this faster rate. During the 1980's, similarly strong labor-force growth started shortly after the recovery began and lasted for five years, helping to keep the economy expanding without the inflation that can result from labor shortages. This time, except for a brief spike in 1992 as the nation came out of recession, the above-normal labor-force growth only kicked in during the fifth year of recovery, and could continue to the end of the century.
"Millions of people are out there willing to enter the labor force without bidding up wages very much," said Alan Krueger, a Princeton labor economist. "This implies that the unemployment rate can remain low without the inflation that usually accompanies low unemployment."
Much of the labor force growth is in Eastern states, with their big concentrations of immigrants and people on welfare, and in prospering Southern states like Kentucky that are producing many new jobs. As workers shift from one sector to another in pursuit of better jobs, new workers move in to fill the empty slots. Often they are Hispanic people like Mr. Rodriguez, who have accounted for 28 percent of the labor force growth in the last 18 months, and are clearly among the nation's most mobile workers these days.
In Kentucky, for example, new auto plants -- particularly Toyota's sprawling factory in Georgetown 75 miles east of here -- have attracted networks of parts suppliers in recent years, offering thousands of new jobs at $10 an hour or more. They have hired many people who have shifted to the new factory work from lower-paying jobs in construction and tobacco fields. Hispanic people, drawn to the state in the last decade, have led the way in replacing them.
"It happened gradually, but one day you wake up and you notice," said James F. Thompson, a regional administrator for Kentucky's Department of Employment Services.
Mr. Rodriguez had come here to visit a friend from his hometown of Guanajuato. The friend stayed and Mr. Rodriguez did, too, in time marrying an American and applying for legal status. And as jobs have opened up in construction, steady work has made Louisville his home.
For the nation as a whole, the Labor Department counts 67 million working-age people -- 16 and older -- neither holding jobs nor seeking them. Most are out of the work force willingly: as students, retired people, mothers with young children and older women who rarely worked outside the home. Many are now being drawn in, while others find themselves forced to enter.
From this pool, Nadirah El-Amin made the transition in June. Ms. El-Amin, 43, and 16 other black women on welfare, graduated in late June from a 13-week course at the Y.W.C.A. in Manhattan where the women were taught the latest office computer software. The goal is to land office jobs that pay enough (at least $23,000 a year) to get by in New York without too much privation.
By graduation, only five had been offered such work, but the rest, including Ms. El-Amin, began an anxious search for jobs before they are forced off welfare in August and into whatever minimum-wage work they can grab. "I am putting on my happy face to look for a job," said Ms. El-Amin, who has a year of college and last worked as a salaried school aide in the early 1990's -- taking a $4,000 buyout in 1994 as an alternative to layoff. "If I don't find an office job soon," she said, "this training won't be worth beans."
Men over 55 are also entering, or more precisely re-entering, the labor force in unusual numbers. Jobs are now easier for older people to find, particularly in such physically less demanding work as security guards, clerks, stadium ushers and cashiers.
Sometimes they go head to head with the young, as Thomas Ball, a 70-year-old former appliance repairman, has done here in Louisville. Hoping to earn extra money to pay expenses on his car, which he uses for Red Cross volunteer work, Mr. Ball applied to United Parcel Service last fall for a Christmas season job at its huge distribution center here. He did not get the seasonal job, but in early January U.P.S., short-staffed, hired him as a permanent part-timer, earning $8 an hour on a 2:45 A.M. to 7 A.M. shift.
Mr. Ball was delighted by what he viewed as recognition of his youthful vigor. "The younger people might outlift me on a dead lift," he said, referring to U.P.S.'s loosely enforced requirement that each employee have the strength and agility to lift 70-pound boxes. "But at the end of four or five hours, I'm still working steadily and they aren't."
Edward Nelson, 47, also sees his situation as unusual. He is a regular at Labor Ready, a nationwide temporary help agency that opened a storefront recruiting office in Louisville last year near a public housing project. Across the country, temp agencies are playing big roles in drawing people into the labor force, and Labor Ready is in the thick of this process, its storefront sign here announcing, in colored block letters, that there is work "today" for anyone who walks through the door.
That is not quite true. From the two dozen men and women who gather at 6 A.M., Corry E. Branson, the office manager, makes his selections of people to go out as a plumber's helper, or to touch up rust spots on cars at an auction lot, or as a laborer at a mall construction site. Some he ignores, judging them too listless or unreliable. Others in whom he has confidence fare well, including Mr. Nelson. For a month now, he has gone each morning to Anita Spring Water, where he packs bottled water, earning $6 an hour.
He is surprised at Mr. Branson's trust. "They don't know at Anita that I have a criminal record, not unless they asked Corry, and they haven't," said Mr. Nelson, who finished a three-year prison term in March, for stealing $2,000 from an office safe to finance, he says, a new life after getting a divorce.
Corry Branson sees the felony as a nonissue. "You do a good job and your past won't haunt you," he said. "We don't ask about criminal records unless the customer asks, and they don't ask these days."
United Parcel Service, in its quest, operates several notches up the ladder of potential jobholders waiting in the wings. With 14,000 employees in Kentucky, it is the state's largest employer. Like most American companies, U.P.S. says its full-time jobs, those that pay upward of $25,000 a year, with health insurance, are relatively easy to fill, very often through promotions. Part-timers are the hard part. U.P.S. operates its largest distribution center at the airport here, sorting and shipping packages on 170 flights a day. That effort absorbs 7,500 part-time employes. How the company finds people to fill these jobs -- using standard corporate tactics -- helps to explain why the labor force is growing so fast today.
College students once held 70 percent of the U.P.S. jobs, which start at $8 an hour. Their youthful strength and flexible schedules made them favorites. "If you had 10 people lined up for 10 jobs, and 9 were students, you picked the 9 students first," said Patrick O'Leary, U.P.S.'s work force planning manager.
Now U.P.S. has fewer than 4 college students in any 10-person lineup. With an unemployment rate of only 4 percent in the Louisville area -- similar to the 5 percent or less nationally in recent months -- the students find work elsewhere, just when the company has added 500 part-time jobs. So Mr. O'Leary's people are out recruiting full blast, even running job fairs in parking lots and hiring biplane pilots to drag help wanted signs across the sky.
The U.P.S. distribution center increasingly accommodates young mothers like Dawn Overall, 26, whose children are 6 and 3. To get such women back to work, U.P.S. offers them a choice of schedules. Ms. Overall, who re-entered the labor force at U.P.S. in late 1995, is about to move from days to a four-hour night shift, having decided to work while her children sleep.
"I came here to prove a point to my husband, who thought I couldn't do this work; I was too prissy," said Ms. Overall, who, as she spoke, heaved boxes from a conveyor belt into a plastic and aluminum shipping caisson that would later be loaded on a plane. "But now I don't want to work anymore and he is making me. He insists on the money. We are building a house."
But for all the hiring problems of a company like U.P.S., Kentucky still harbors tens of thousands of people outside the labor force who resist re-entry. Most live 100 miles away, in the rural counties of Eastern Kentucky, where coal fields once offered employment. Rather than travel far from home, they survive on support payments and by scrounging, neither working nor searching for work.
To lure these people, the state government has organized a recruiting effort, particularly on behalf of the new auto parts suppliers. Ted A. Beebe, a field office manager for Kentucky's Department of Employment Services, is part of this effort, often working with local ministers.
"We recruited seven people last month for one auto parts company," Mr. Beebe said. "They had to commute two hours each way, and after two weeks four stopped coming. Two, however, are still there, working."

Graphs: "New Workers: Who and Where"
Recent growth in the labor force has not come evenly across the spectrum of workers and regions. Young women, people near retirement age and Hispanic people have increased their rates of participation faster than most other groups. Participation rates have been rising on the coasts and falling in most other areas. (The participation rate is the number of people working or looking for work as a percentage of the total population.) Graph shows change in the labor force participation rate for various groups, from December 1995 to May 1997. It also shows the change in the labor force participation rate in nine U.S. regions, from May 1996 to May 1997. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)(pg. D5)

HEADLINE: Judge Upholds Law Making Gender-Motivated Crime a Civil-Rights Violation

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
A Federal judge in Tennessee has "quite reluctantly" upheld the constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 in the case of a Knoxville woman accusing the wealthy and prominent man she is divorcing of violating her civil rights by beating and raping her during their marriage.
The decision was the latest in a series of closely watched rulings on the constitutionality of the Federal law that made crimes motivated by gender a violation of civil rights. Two earlier decisions also upheld the constitutionality of the law's civil provisions, while another found the law was an unconstitutional Federal intrusion into state matters. The question is widely expected to make its way to the Supreme Court, where the reach of Federal authority has become a deeply divisive issue. 
 "The court must note its extreme discomfort with the sweeping nature" of the Violence Against Women Act, Judge James H. Jarvis, of the Eastern District of Tennessee, wrote in the decision issued late Tuesday in Laurel Knuckles Seaton v. Kenneth Marshall Seaton. "While there is no doubt that violence against women is a serious matter in our society, this particular remedy created by Congress, because of its extreme overbreadth, opens the doors of the Federal courts to parties seeking leverage in settlements rather than true justice."
Nevertheless, Judge Jarvis found, the law passed muster under the commerce clause of the Constitution. Under well-established legal precedent, he found, the court was limited, in its review, to determining whether "a rational basis" existed for Congress to conclude that violence against women sufficiently affects interstate commerce to allow the Federal Government to invoke its regulatory authority.
At the same time, he added, "this court must again express its deep concern that the Act will effectively allow domestic relations litigation to permeate the Federal courts."
He refused to accept Federal jurisdiction over various accusations made under state law against Mr. Seaton.
Under Federal law, Ms. Seaton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Mr. Seaton of $40 million to $87 million, said her lawyer, Norman A. Pattis.
"His trial will speak to the nation of what men can do to women," Mr. Pattis said. "Where do most acts of gender-motivated violence occur? They occur in the context of a marriage."
Mr. Seaton, whose lawyers declined to comment, is the president and owner of KMS Enterprises, with holdings that include Family Inns of America, a motel chain in nine states; a cable television station; a weekly newspaper, and Christian Ministries Inc. In court papers, he denied all accusations.
According to the complaint, Ms. Seaton, a lawyer from a prominent legal family in Kentucky, met Mr. Seaton on a blind date in late 1991, and married him on Valentine's Day 1992, in an abrupt nighttime ceremony performed, she said, after he "fraudulently obtained" her signature on a prenuptial agreement.
When her father died, the complaint says, Mr. Seaton forced her to leave a family gathering after his funeral, in what became a pattern of isolating her. She says he forced her to give up her law practice, and she became increasingly depressed as he abused and humiliated her.
The case is similar in some respects to Doe v. Doe, the Connecticut case that was the basis last year of the first Federal District Court ruling on the constitutionality of the Federal law. The plaintiff said her husband had repeatedly threatened to kill her and had beaten her and forced her to be a "slave."
Her husband's lawyers argued that the civil rights provision was "an open and sweeping invitation to the Federal Government" to interfere in almost any area.
Two years ago, in United States v. Lopez, the Supreme Court ruled that a Federal law banning the possession of guns near schools exceeded Federal authority to regulate interstate commerce, the first such ruling since the New Deal.
But unlike the gun law, the anti-violence law was passed after four years of Congressional hearings on the pervasive impact of gender-based violence on the economy, the judges in both the Doe and Seaton cases noted. The hearings included states' assessments that their judicial systems were not protecting female victims of such crimes. Congress found "that gender-based crimes and fear of gender-based crimes restrict movement, reduce employment opportunities, increase health expenditures, and reduce consumer expending, all of which affect interstate commerce and the national economy," and that about half of rape victims lost their jobs or were forced to quit after the crime.
Judge Jarvis concluded that "Congress was hardly unreasonable in creating a civil rights remedy to correct such deficiencies."
His decision joins an opinion issued on June 23 by Mark W. Bennett, a Federal district judge in Iowa, that also upheld the law, and took jurisdiction of its state claims.
In that case, Jane Doe v. the Rev. Gerald Hartz, a woman sued a priest at St. Lawrence Church in Carroll, Iowa, accusing him of groping and kissing her when she arrived at the church for evening Mass. The suit also named the church, the bishop and diocesan officials as defendants, charging that they knew Father Hartz had a problem with sexual abuse. Besides damages, the suit seeks an injunction preventing the priest's assignment to parish work.
Father Hartz, 62, who denied the accusations, was later charged with improperly touching a 13-year-old girl at St. Lawrence Catholic School. Those charges were dropped after he resigned as a parish priest and the complaint was withdrawn.
Both Judges Bennett and Jarvis rejected the reasoning of Judge Jackson L. Kiser, chief judge for the Western District of Virginia, who found the law unconstitutional in Brzonkala v. Virginia Tech, the case of a Virginia Polytechnic Institute student who accused two football players of raping her. That decision is on appeal to the Fourth Circuit.

HEADLINE: 13 Arrests in Sting at Police-Run Auto Shop

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
It was a new auto repair shop in Brooklyn and its owners openly suggested to several of their customers that they were willing to do anything to make money.
But the owners were undercover investigators with two goals: to disrupt the Gambino family's activities in Brooklyn and to expose any police corruption in tow-truck operations. 
 After a 17-month investigation, law enforcement officials said yesterday that the sting had led to the arrest of 13 people linked to a Gambino crew on charges including loan sharking, illegal gambling, auto insurance fraud and trafficking in marijuana and bootleg cigarettes.
The authorities also said they found no evidence of police misconduct. The Police Department uses a computerized rotation system for calling tow-truck operators to remove disabled vehicles, and the officials said they were concerned that police officers might be taking bribes and allowing vehicles to be towed out of turn.
The officials said the undercover investigators showed up at more than 70 auto accidents without authorization and asked officers for permission to tow disabled vehicles. All 100 officers passed the integrity tests by ordering the unauthorized operators to leave.
Towing is a highly competitive business in New York City and a company can charge more than $100 for towing and storing a vehicle and then seek to do the repair work.
"This investigation exposed the corrupt activities of organized crime in our community," said the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, "and demonstrated, at the same time, that police officers are doing their duty with honesty and integrity."
In January 1996, the District Attorney's office began Operation Tip Tow by opening Shop Right Collision at 80 Georgia Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Four investigators from the District Attorney's office and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Division, the unit that investigates police corruption, acted as owners and managers of the shop. Three of the investigators had experience in auto repairs and the agents hired two employees who were unaware of the sting.
"They let it be known that they were hustlers," said Dennis R. Hawkins, Deputy District Attorney in Brooklyn, "and would engage in a variety of activities, including illegal gambling, working on stolen cars and insurance frauds."
Mr. Hawkins said the investigators were approached by people who said they were connected to a Gambino gang known as the Canarsie Crew. According to the charges, a defendant, Jack L. Slofkiss, 61, told the investigators that he handled loan-sharking activities for the Canarsie Crew's capo, Nicholas Corozzo.
Mr. Slofkiss was arrested on state charges of usury, accused of lending $6,000 with an annual interest rate of 260 percent. In an unrelated case, Mr. Slofkiss was indicted in January on Federal racketeering charges.
Law enforcement officials said Mr. Corozzo had been designated last year to succeed John Gotti as the Gambino boss, but the promotion was sidetracked when he was indicted in December and in January in racketeering cases.
The repair and tow shop was closed in May with a business loss of about $75,000. "It was worth the cost," Mr. Hawkins said. "It gave us a look into the midlevel workings of organized crime."

HEADLINE: Hearing on Flight 800 Crash Will Consider Cause and Compensation

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Nearly a year after 230 people died in the explosion of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, the House Aviation subcommittee plans a hearing Thursday to determine why the cause has not been found and what can be done to improve safety until that happens.
The committee will also explore whether Congress should countermand a Supreme Court decision that puts damage awards in crashes like this one under the control of a 77-year-old law written to help the widows of shipwrecked sailors. 
 The law, the Death on the High Seas Act, allows for "economic damages," like the loss of the wages of a breadwinner, but not for loss of companionship, for pain and suffering, or for punitive damages. Relatives of several passengers will testify that the statute needs to be changed.
As the July 17 anniversary of the explosion approaches, officials at two Federal agencies have been busy describing their efforts to solve the mystery and their disagreements with each other over how to proceed.
One agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates air crashes, has called for changes in fueling procedures to reduce the risk of explosions. Investigators say they believe an explosion in the main fuel tank made Flight 800 crash, although they still cannot say why. The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates airline safety, will explain why it has been cool to the recommendations.
The safety board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had disagreed earlier in the investigation, but the F.B.I. has since assumed a much smaller role. The F.B.I. has recently said that it is now less likely that the plane was brought down by a "criminal act," in the form of a bomb or missile.
The safety board is expected to announce that it will hold a full-scale hearing scheduled to begin Dec. 8 and last six days. The board usually holds such hearings near the scene of the crash, but this one will be in Baltimore, because hotel rooms and hearing space are easier to come by there during the holidays.
James E. Hall, the board chairman, and Bernard S. Loeb, the chief aviation safety engineer, will also describe the work the board has done, including retrieving more than 95 percent of the Boeing 747 from the water off Long Island.
The board has also begun flying a nearly identical plane, leased from Evergreen Airways, to determine when conditions are present that could support an explosion.
The Aviation subcommittee, chaired by Representative John J. Duncan Jr. of Tennessee, is considering a bill on the applicability of the Death on the High Seas Act. Representative Joseph M. McDade, a Republican from Pennsylvania, has introduced an airline disaster relief bill that would allow families to sue under the same rules that apply to crashes on land. Mr. McDade's district includes Montoursville, Pa.; among the passengers on the plane were students from the Montoursville High School French club. Under the high seas law, Mr. McDade said, compensation for the teen-agers' deaths would be minimal, because they were not breadwinners.
If the plane had crashed on land or within three miles of shore, the families could sue for "noneconomic damages," like the loss of loving relationships, or pain and suffering. The high seas law applies in this crash because of a Supreme Court ruling in January 1996 in connection with the crash of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983.

Sheik Vows to Guide Qatar From Coup to Democracy
After toppling his father two years ago, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani of Qatar has called for municipal elections by the end of the year and said he expected that women would be allowed to vote. The moves are unprecedented in the Gulf region and reflect Sheik Hamad's cautious determination to avoid violence by dissidents. A8
 
Purge Worsens in Cambodia
Forces loyal to First Prime Minister Hun Sen arrested scores of opposition officials as they continued their purge against rivals. Soldiers openly ridiculing "human rights" seized the opportunity to settle private disputes as pessimism spread across the country. A6 

Cambodia's representative to the United Nations asked governments around the world not to recognize what he called the new military junta in Phnom Penh. A7
 
Kenyan Police Club Students
Riot policemen moved to close the University of Nairobi in Kenya, clubbing students and forcing them to flee. At least 20 were reported injured, and one was in a coma. Students had earlier marched to the morgue to collect bodies of colleagues they heard had been killed by police squelching a pro-democracy protest on Monday. President Danial arap Moi has refused to discuss electoral reform until after elections, which he must call before the end of the year. A3
 
Marine Warns of Saudi Stalkers
President Clinton's choice to be the new commander of forces deployed in the Persian Gulf, Lieut. Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marine Corps, told a Senate committee that he believed United States troops in Saudi Arabia were being regularly watched by terrorist groups. He said increased vigilance had already thwarted some planned attacks, but declined to be specific. A12
 
Dollars, Centimes Worry NATO
President Clinton and leaders of other NATO countries discussed the cost of the alliance's eastward expansion. Estimates have varied widely but NATO military and political experts said they would produce a definitive estimate by the end of the year. President Jacques Chirac of France said his country did not expect its contributions to rise at all, but warned against rocketing costs because of arms companies plying new and aspiring members with overly sophisticated weapons. A partnership charter between NATO and Ukraine was also signed. A14
 
West Bank Bomb Wounds Two
Two Israeli border guards were wounded near the West Bank town of Nablus when a remote-controlled bomb exploded next to their vehicle, military sources said. The guards were escorting a bus carrying students from a Jewish religious institute through an Israeli-controlled sector of the West Bank. Fire bombs were thrown and shots fired at Jewish settlers in and around Hebron.

Reno Likely to Oppose Senate Immunity for Huang
Senators investigating campaign finance abuses announced that they had learned that Attorney General Janet Reno would object if the investigating committee offered immunity from prosecution to John Huang, whose money-raising practices are at the heart of the inquiry. For that and other reasons, many Senators expressed serious reservations about granting Mr. Huang immunity, raising new doubts that he would ever appear to testify. A1
 
President Clinton played down his role in the hiring of Mr. Huang by the Democratic National Committee for a crucial fund-raising position, saying he would have "referred virtually anyone's name to the party" who had volunteered to raise money for the campaign. B8
 
Members of the House's inquiry into campaign finance openly argued over the investigation's increasing focus on the activities of former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell, an area of inquiry that Democrats say has little to do with campaign fund-raising abuses. B9
 
Senate Stops Base Closings
The Senate voted overwhelmingly to delay the next two rounds of closings at military bases until the Government can study the economic effect of past and future shutdowns, casting doubt on the future of the entire closing process. The Senate ignored the wishes of President Clinton and military leaders who argued that the base closings were needed to pare the Defense Department budget and allow military officials to shift funds from base operations to weapons systems.

TV Ratings Deal Reached
Negotiators for the television industry and family advocacy groups reached an agreement on expanding the industry's six-month-old ratings system to include code letters for violence, sexual content and foul language, ending more than a year of contentiousness on the subject. A1
 
Fight Expected on Arts
A group of Republicans opposed to their leaders' attempt to dismantle the National Endowment for the Arts vowed to join Democrats in a floor fight to save the agency. The dispute sets up what could become one of the most raucous debates of the 105th Congress and creates new political problems for an already weakened Speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is struggling to hold his fractious majority together.

Gas Station Owner Indicted
Shortly after Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa arrived in the United States some 15 years ago, he began to build an empire of gas stations that would earn him a fortune.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
With World Selloff in Gold, Stocks and Funds Suffer, Too

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
For gold investors, these are hardly the best of times.
With the price of gold near a 12-year low, gold-mining companies are struggling with high production costs, gold stocks are depressed and mutual funds that invest in gold miners are all but crying uncle. 
 "If this isn't the most pessimistic period for gold, it's pretty close to it," said Harry Bingham, a manager of institutional gold portfolios at Van Eck Associates. "In this kind of environment, gold shares go down faster than the price of gold."
But the sharp plunge in the price of gold, and of gold shares, could be coming to an end, some analysts argue, simply because it has descended to such bargain levels that it may be poised for a revival. The price of gold fell to $319 an ounce on Monday, the lowest level since December 1985. Yesterday, after a small rebound on Tuesday, gold for August delivery fell $2.10, to $318.90, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"We've seen these kinds of capitulations before, and they've always been buying opportunities," said Vahid Fathi of ABN-Amro in Chicago. Several other analysts also believe that the decline in gold prices has been exaggerated.
But the damage has been enormous. From early in 1996, the price of gold has plunged 24 percent.
Gold stocks have suffered similar losses. The shares of the Barrick Gold Corporation, the largest North American producer, have fallen 26 percent this year.
And since January, the average gold mutual fund is down 28 percent. While the Dow Jones industrial average soared 16.5 percent in its biggest second-quarter gain since 1938, gold funds dominated the list of the 10 worst-performing mutual funds.
The U.S. Global Gold Fund, for instance, lost 22.2 percent of its value in the second quarter.
Analysts attribute the devaluing of gold to a number of factors, including the easing of inflation jitters. Traditionally, gold has been regarded as a "safe harbor" investment in times of inflation; with prices tame, the allure of gold has diminished.
Investors were also alarmed by the scandal involving Bre-X Minerals, a Canadian company whose purported Indonesian gold strike had sent its shares soaring, only to plunge when the site was found to contain nothing worth mining. The scandal contributed to the slide in gold stocks and funds.
Most recently, there have been widespread fears that central banks are prepared to sell large portions of their gold reserves. After the Australian central bank said last Thursday that it had sold 167 metric tons and bought United States, German and Japanese Government bonds, gold prices plummeted.
Many investors who had used gold funds as insurance against a stock market downturn have begun to pull their money out. At the start of the year, gold funds had $7.9 billion in total assets. But losses and net redemptions have reduced that to $6.2 billion, according to AMG Data Services.
Some other analysts, taking the contrarian view, see opportunity in such pessimism, expecting that gold can only go up at this point. "Investor sentiment has been so negative," said Leanne Baker of Salomon Brothers. "I mean how much more negative can it get?" She said she did not expect a "wild rally" in gold shares, but added that she did view this as a good time to buy.
On Tuesday morning, in a call to clients, she told them that the selloff in gold shares had been overdone. Because the cost of mining gold is already very high, she said, depressed prices make the mining uneconomical, and as a result, some gold producers may have to shut down, limiting the supply of gold and eventually lifting prices.
Analysts said that the speculation that central banks would sell some of their stocks was also exaggerated, pointing to a pledge by South Africa, which said yesterday that it would not sell reserves. Furthermore, demand for products that use gold, like jewelry, remains strong.
But while Ms. Baker and other analysts expect a turnaround in prices, they say that investors ought to remain cautious and selective, focusing on companies with the soundest operations.
Some cited Barrick Gold of Toronto, which has fared better than most, in part by hedging against a drop in gold prices by locking in sales around $420 an ounce.
Peter Munk, Barrick's chairman, called the selloff in gold shares a knee-jerk reaction to the slide in the commodity price.
But he also said that the difficulties would breed a Darwinian consolidation in the industry, much like an earlier shakeout in the steel industry. "There is going to be a period of rapid consolidation," he said. "And it will end with a couple of really good producers."
Even before such a consolidation, however, the stage may be set for a recovery. "Typically, gold is a metal you want to focus on when everyone hates it," Ms. Baker of Salomon said. "And this is just that time."

HEADLINE: World Gets Plea to Act On Cambodia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 9

 BODY:
Cambodia's United Nations representative asked all governments today not to recognize what he called the "military junta" in Phnom Penh, but to consider imposing economic sanctions on the country, which relies on aid for more than 60 percent of its budget.
The representative, Prince Sisowath Sirirath, was outlining the strategy of Cambodia's deposed First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He said at a news conference here that Hun Sen, the Second Prime Minister, who seized power over the weekend, was in "flagrant violation" of Cambodian laws and international agreements. 
 He said Cambodia's Foreign Minister, who is loyal to Prince Ranariddh, would ask an emergency meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Thursday to reject Phnom Penh's application for membership until the elected Government has been restored.
[Just before Asean opened its meeting on Thursday, the Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary, Domingo Siazon, said to journalists, "Everything related to Cambodia will be discussed, including membership," Agence France-Presse reported.]
At the United Nations today, Prince Sirirath tried to make the case for renewed international intervention in Cambodia, where the United Nations spent more than $2 billion in 1992-93 to set up a democratic government. It may be very difficult to engender much interest in spending more money there.
Prince Ranariddh planned to arrive in New York tonight. He plans to meet on Thursday with Secretary General Kofi Annan and the presidents of the Security Council and General Assembly before going on to Washington to meet with members of Congress and State Department officials.
Prince Sirirath said armed royalist party followers of Prince Ranariddh were in hiding and plotting to capture the Cambodian city of Battambang, near the Thai border, to establish a center of resistance. Envoys abroad are lobbying for international pressure on Mr. Hun Sen, a Communist and former Khmer Rouge regional commander who led a Vietnamese-occupation government in Cambodia before the 1993 election.
When Mr. Hun Sen lost that election to Prince Ranariddh and threatened a coup, a "two-headed" prime ministership was proposed to avoid violence. The United Nations official in charge of Cambodia during that period was Yasushi Akashi of Japan, who was criticized for encouraging the formation of the coalition and then leaving considerable military and police power in Communist hands and at the disposal of Mr. Hun Sen. This week Mr. Annan told diplomats that he was thinking of sending Mr. Akashi back to Cambodia.
Prince Sirirath is under some pressure from Hun Sen supporters in his mission here, as are diplomats in other embassies around the world, including Washington. His deputy, Ouch Borith, has circulated a statement by Mr. Hun Sen blaming Prince Ranariddh for creating the crisis by negotiating with a faction of the Khmer Rouge in the hope of gaining its support before elections scheduled for May 1998.
Prince Sirirath said today that these accusations were odd, since Mr. Hun Sen had won over Ieng Sary, a Khmer Rouge leader, and several thousands of his followers last year through a promise of amnesty for Mr. Ieng Sary and those talks were not considered illegal or treasonous. That is the charge now leveled at Prince Ranariddh and his party, Funcinpec, an acronym for the name, in French, of the royalist organization called the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral and Cooperative Cambodia.
"You cannot call the Prince a traitor," Prince Sirirath said.
Prince Sirirath and Prince Ranariddh, the son of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, are from different branches of the royal family.
An American analyst of Cambodia, who asked not to be identified because some of his colleagues are in the country and could be endangered, said that Mr. Hun Sen's explosive reaction to Prince Ranariddh's talks with another Khmer Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan, may reflect problems that Mr. Hun Sen is facing within his own Cambodia People's Party, where he has come under criticism for high-handedness. A return of more Khmer Rouge leaders and guerrillas to the political mix could split Mr. Hun Sen's leftist following, this analyst said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a powerful appeal for those who distrust Vietnam, Mr. Hun Sen's former patron. Mr. Hun Sen will be under international pressure to "kiss and make up" with Prince Ranariddh, the analyst said, but added that this would be very hard for the former Communist leader to do.

HEADLINE: President Gives Nudge To Deal on Budget Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
With a new push from President Clinton, House and Senate negotiators meet on Thursday in the first of many sessions intended to wrap up agreement this month on legislation to balance the Federal budget and help preserve Medicare for millions of baby boomers.
Then on Friday, lawmakers from the two chambers will start ironing out their differences on a tax bill, which was described today by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, as "probably the single most important piece of legislation" in this Congress. 
 Congressional leaders said they hoped to send final versions of both bills to Mr. Clinton by early August.
The tax bill has provoked a fierce ideological struggle as Republicans and Democrats argue over the proper distribution of tax cuts to wealthy people, middle-income families and the working poor.
The two parties agree on a surprisingly large number of provisions in the budget bill, which would make the biggest changes in Medicare since the health insurance program for the elderly was created in 1965. But President Clinton and Congress disagree on many of the details, and lobbyists will swarm outside the rooms where lawmakers from the two chambers negotiate.
The budget and tax measures, though packaged as separate bills, are politically interrelated. Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: "Republicans won't send the spending bill to the President unless they have an assurance that he will sign the tax bill. The tax-cut locomotive is pulling this train, as far as Congress is concerned."
One of the biggest issues in dispute is whether to charge higher Medicare premiums for elderly people with higher incomes, as the Government would do under the budget bill passed by the Senate last month.
At a news conference in Spain, where he was attending a NATO conference, Mr. Clinton confirmed today that he might support such a change -- not as part of some future effort to address Medicare's long-term financial problems but as part of this year's budget bill.
"I have never been opposed to means-testing Medicare," he said. His comment may embolden House Republicans to join senators of both parties in support of a means test.
But Mr. Clinton said he opposed another provision of the Senate bill, which would gradually increase the age of eligibility for Medicare to 67, from 65, over the years 2003 to 2027.
R. Bruce Josten, senior vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, denounced this proposal today, saying it would impose hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs on employers that provide health benefits to retirees.
The final push to balance the budget comes against the backdrop of a strong economy generating so much tax revenue that the Federal deficit will fall sharply, even without action by Congress.
President Clinton predicted in February that the deficit for the current fiscal year would be $126 billion. In May, when he and Congressional leaders agreed on a plan to balance the budget, they assumed that this year's deficit would be $67 billion. Now Administration officials say the robust economy may push the figure below $50 billion.
But economists said some of the strength of the economy and of the stock market was a response to the bipartisan commitment to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Interest rates are relatively low and markets are vibrant, in part, because investors believe that the Government's fiscal condition is good and is improving, the economists said.
Mr. Daschle said the forecasts of lower deficits would not reduce pressure on Congress to balance the budget.
"Now that the end is in sight," the Senator said, "it may even have enhanced the pressure to finish the job. We can't let up now."
Here is a summary of the many important issues on which the House and the Senate disagree:
CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE The House set aside $16 billion to provide health care or health insurance for half of the nation's 10 million uninsured children in the next five years. The Senate set aside $24 billion, stipulated that states must use the money for insurance and guaranteed comprehensive benefits, including hearing and vision services and mental health care in most cases.
Governors strongly prefer the House version, saying it would enable them to cover more children because the average cost for each child would be lower. But the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Defense Fund favor the Senate bill.
President Clinton supports a 20-cent increase in the cigarette tax, which is now 24 cents a pack. But unlike the Senate, he would devote all the new revenue to children's health insurance. His proposals would provide a total of $31 billion for coverage of children in the next five years.
MEDICAID FOR DISABLED CHILDREN The House would allow states to provide Medicaid for 30,000 disabled children who will soon lose Supplemental Security Income benefits under the 1996 welfare law. The Senate version of the budget bill includes no such provision.
Mr. Clinton says that House and Senate negotiators should require states to provide Medicaid to these children. He says that such coverage is required under the bipartisan budget agreement.
NEW MEDICARE OPTIONS The House and Senate versions of the budget bill would both increase the health insurance options available to elderly people in all parts of the country. In theory, they could enroll in the standard Medicare program, in health maintenance organizations or in health plans owned and operated by doctors and hospitals.
On both sides of the Capitol, lawmakers want to reduce huge geographical variations in Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s in different parts of the country. The Senate measure is more generous to health plans in rural areas, but over the next five years, it would freeze or even reduce Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s in some big cities like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.
The Administration and the managed care industry say the Senate bill would force many H.M.O.'s to cut back coverage of prescription drugs and other benefits.
Under current law, Medicare beneficiaries dissatisfied with an H.M.O. may drop out of the health plan and enroll in the standard fee-for-service program with just one month's notice. Under the House bill, elderly people could eventually be locked into an H.M.O. for nine months at a time. The Administration prefers the Senate bill.
TAXES The Administration is pressing for changes that it says would shift some benefits of the tax cuts away from the wealthy. For example, the White House wants to make more low-income working families eligible for the $500-a-child tax credit. It also wants to limit the cut in capital gains taxes, imposed on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets.
Studies by the Treasury Department found that about two-thirds of the benefits of the House and Senate measures would go to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. But Republicans say that the tax cuts should be concentrated on those people who pay most of the taxes, and that their plan is not skewed to the wealthy in any case.
Because of Mr. Clinton's veiled threats to veto the tax legislation if it is not changed, Republican leaders have agreed to give the Administration a seat at the table.

Venture Capital Meeting

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
More than 400 people attended the first day of the two-day New York City Venture Capital Conference yesterday to hear business pitches, discuss trends in venture capital financing and mull the state of New York's new-media industry.
The attendance eclipsed the two-day total from last year's inaugural conference, which had 280 delegates. There has been a growing interest in New York as a hub of new-media and Internet-related companies: for example, the amount of money invested in New York City software, electronics and multimedia companies jumped 125 percent, to $111.3 million in 1996 from $49.5 million in 1995, according to a survey conducted earlier this year by Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting and consulting firm. 
 The conference had been proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, one of the conference's organizers. And Mr. Giuliani opened the proceedings with a speech telling the delegates that New York had become much more friendly to business under his leadership.
Other sponsors were Coopers & Lybrand, the Prospect Street Investment Management Company, Strategic Research Institute and Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. The conference continues today at the New York Hilton in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Senate, in a Rebuff to Clinton, Votes to Delay Base Closings

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Casting doubt on the future of the military base-closing process, the Senate voted overwhelmingly tonight to delay the next two rounds of closings until the Government could study the economic effects of past and future shutdowns.
By voting as it did, the Senate ignored the wishes of President Clinton and military leaders who have argued that the closings -- of bases still to be determined -- were central to their efforts to pare the Defense Department budget and allow military officials to shift money from base operations to weapons systems. 
 Some members of Congress saw the lopsided 66-to-33 vote as an ominous sign that legislators were no longer willing to endure the political pain for themselves and the economic pain for their constituents that the base closings have sometimes caused.
The vote was also an expression of the doubts among many lawmakers that the closings were achieving the kinds of savings that the Pentagon and the White House had projected.
The Senate took its stand by approving an amendment blocking the Defense Department from conducting two more rounds of base closings that were scheduled for 1999 and 2001.
Clearly hoping to win the support of many of his colleagues, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, distributed a state-by-state list just before the vote of military installations that might be shutdown in either of the next two rounds.
"I just want to ask my colleagues, whether they be from California or Connecticut or Georgia or Minnesota or my own state or any other state, take a look at what is on this list," Mr. Lott said from the floor of the Senate.
"Think of what you have already been through, and think of the impact it would have on the military if some of these facilities should be threatened once again with being closed. Do you want that?"
The amendment, which is part of the military authorization bill for 1998 that the Senate began debating on Monday, would not save those bases that had previously been approved for closing.
The House of Representatives, on June 25, took what amounted to the same action when it passed its version of the military bill, which also excluded authorization for future base closings.
The Clinton Administration had lobbied for the base closings and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had backed the idea, too, saying that it would free billions of dollars in savings that could go toward improving weapons systems.
An amendment sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, would have authorized the 1999 and 2001 base closings.
But that plan was derailed by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who with the backing of the Senate's top leadership -- Mr. Lott and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader -- successfully offered a substitute amendment that blocked the action.
But the opponents in the Senate of the next round of base closings cited a recent Government Accounting Office report that concluded that the Defense Department "cannot provide accurate information on actual savings."
Using that as the basis of his argument, Mr. Dorgan proposed that the next scheduled base closings be delayed until the Pentagon had time to develop "accounting techniques" to accurately measure the costs and savings from previous and future rounds of base closings.
The Pentagon is also instructed to prepare a report, which must be reviewed by both the Government Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office and submitted to Congress.
The amendment set no specific date for completion of that work, only specifying that the Pentagon must submit its report to Congress "in a timely manner" so that the lawmakers will have adequate time to consider whether to authorize a round of base closings in 2001.
Base closings have been a highly politicized issue since Congress created the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, and both sides in the debate today focused on that fact.
"It's always difficult to close bases,"Senator Levin said. "But we've made a politically tough decision even tougher."
But Senator Lott argued that the base-closing process was flawed from the start.
"I have always been opposed to this approach," he said just before the vote. "It is one more example of Congress not being able to deal with the tough issues of what we need in terms of facilities in this country and passing the tough decisions off to others, in this case the commission."
A spokesman for the Defense Department said Defense Secretary William S. Cohen was disappointed with today's vote.
"The Secretary believes we must cut unneeded bases if we are to have the funds for modernization of weapons systems in the coming years," said the spokesman, Capt. Michael Doubleday. "We will continue to work with the Congress on this extremely important issue."
Mr. Levin said several factors worked against the Administration and supporters of base closings, including President Clinton's own political posturing on the issue.
Under the base-closing procedure, the President must either accept or reject the full list of targeted sites. He cannot modify the list.
But in 1995, the year before his re-election bid, Mr. Clinton tried to reverse the expected loss of thousands of jobs from the base closings ordered for two large Air Force maintenance centers in California and Texas, both states rich in electoral votes.
Mr. Clinton proposed a plan to save the jobs -- at Kelly Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif., and McClellan Air Force Base in San Antonio -- by converting them to private sector jobs under a program known as "privatization in place."
"That's not privatization in place," Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican majority whip and Mr. Lott's second-in-command, railed today. "That's electoral politics. It's a real shame that he introduced electoral politics in the base closure process." 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 12, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about a Senate vote to delay military base closings transposed the locations of two bases in some copies. Kelly Air Force Base is in San Antonio; McClellan Air Force Base is in Sacramento, Calif.

HEADLINE: $25 and Under

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
For anybody wearied by the heavy, gloppy fare served at many Chinese takeout mills, Wu Liang Ye may reawaken the dormant appreciation of Chinese food.
Wu Liang Ye is part of a restaurant chain in China with three branches in Manhattan: this one on East 86th Street, another at 338 Lexington Avenue near 39th Street and the third at 36 West 48th Street. Each is slightly different in menu and atmosphere, but all specialize in lively, robust and even delicate Sichuan dishes that are notable for their freshness and meticulous preparation. 
 Cold noodles with spicy sesame sauce is one of those signature Sichuan dishes that New Yorkers fell in love with before it degenerated into a tasteless takeout disaster, prepared hours in advance and kept refrigerated in its container until given away as an enticement. Wu Liang Ye's version ($3.25) offers an opportunity to retaste this dish; the noodles firm, not gummy, the sauce nutty and sweet, not cloying, and spicy enough to set the mouth aglow. It's like tasting farm-fresh eggs after years of the store-bought variety.
Incidentally, Wu Liang Ye is not blind to the economics of home delivery; it has a takeout menu, complete with cold noodle incentives. I can't say how the food tastes at home, but the restaurant has not allowed the takeout market to govern its dining room.
The noodles set the tone for other dishes. Sliced conch with spicy red oil ($5.95) is delicious but unusual. The conch is firm and chewy, almost the texture of pig's ears, but nutty and appealing. A fragrant broth with chunks of firm, white fish, tiny white mushrooms and pickled cabbage ($6.95) is filling enough to be a meal itself.
I tried four kinds of dumpling; each was excellent. Crystal seafood and asparagus ($3.75) is a lovely combination, cool and savory, served in a little triangular packet. Crystal shrimp dumplings ($3.95), as fragile as roses, go perfectly with the soy-and-vinegar dipping sauce. Steamed pork dumplings in red-hot oil ($2.95) are as delicate as daisies folded in half, while steamed seafood dumplings ($4.50) are light and thin skinned.
The stars of the main courses are shredded tea-smoked duck with ginger ($13.25), offering a marvelous contrast between the lively ginger and the slightly smoky, dry meat and crisp skin, and double-cooked fresh bacon in chili sauce ($7.95), slices of reddish pork resembling Canadian bacon that have been both simmered and braised, offering another contrast between the rich pork and the peppery sauce. Bean curd with spicy sauce ($6.95) is a huge bowl of food, the cubes of tofu served in a sauce full of caramelized garlic, ginger, minced pork and pepper. Not every dish was so inspiring. Chicken with garlic sauce ($7.50) was well prepared but routinely flavored.
Service is swift and pleasant. The dining room itself is plain, with a mirror around the circumference serving as the main decoration. That's O.K. The focus here is food, and it certainly beats sitting at home eating starch and grease from cartons.

HEADLINE: Still a Race for Mayor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Contrary to Gail Collins's conclusion that I want to "concede the mayor's race" (Editorial Notebook, July 10), my opinion, often stated, is that the mayor's race will narrow dramatically after the September primary and that the Democratic nominee has a very good chance to win. 
 Ruth Messinger is only 10 points behind Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in current polls, about where Mr. Giuliani was at this time in the 1993 contest with Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The facts are compelling. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 30,000 more unemployed New Yorkers today than a year ago, and our unemployment rate is now twice the national average. The quality of public education has deteriorated while school violence has escalated. This is the real record of Mr. Giuliani, which the upcoming campaign will reveal.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germans Back a Strong Mark, And Dollar Is Mostly Weaker

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly weaker yesterday after top Bundesbank officials surprised the currency market by calling for a strong mark and Britain's central bank increased interest rates.
The remarks by Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, and Franz-Christoph Zeitler, a member of the central bank's policy-making council, caught traders off guard because they had expected the mark to continue weakening. Many scrambled to buy the currency afterward. 
 The mark had been hitting a series of three-and-a-half-year lows against the dollar and six-year lows against the pound for the last few weeks, with no signs of discontent from the Bundesbank.
"The Bundesbank's been real quiet," said John McCarthy, senior vice president for foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. "So this caught the market a little bit by surprise. It certainly took the steam out of the dollar for the time being."
The Bank of England's decision to raise its base lending rate by a quarter percentage point, to 6.75 percent, had been widely expected and initially caused a flurry of pound selling by traders who wanted to secure profits from the currency's strength.
But the pound quickly strengthened again on speculation that the British central bank was likely to raise rates in a gradual series of small increases to thwart inflationary pressure in Britain's economy.
The dollar traded as low as 1.7461 marks before settling at 1.7515 marks in New York, down from 1.7599 marks Wednesday. The pound rose to $1.6886 from $1.6880.
The mark's strength against the yen indirectly helped the dollar end higher against the Japanese currency. The dollar traded at 113.18 yen in New York, up from 112.77 yen.
The comments by Mr. Tietmeyer and Mr. Zeitler at a Bundesbank conference in Aschau, Germany, quickly overshadowed the Bank of England's interest rate decision.
Mr. Tietmeyer stressed what he called the importance of mark strength leading up to Europe's monetary union in January 1999.
Mr. Zeitler reiterated the Bundesbank's desire for a strong mark and said the dollar's recovery from postwar lows against the mark two years ago had been corrected.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Shoot Up

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
The number of American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits shot up by 40,000 last week to the highest level in more than a year. Much of the increase may have been caused by the closing of automobile plants for annual retooling, a Labor Department official said today. New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 377,000, highest since 403,000 in the week that ended on March 30, 1996. The jump was the largest since a 44,000 advance in the week that ended on March 23, 1996. Many analysts had expected a rise of only 2,000. The four-week average of new weekly jobless claims rose 9,500, to 348,500.

HEADLINE: Salinas: Plenty of Smoke, No Smoking Gun

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
More than a year after Carlos Salinas de Gortari left Mexico's presidency, a secret Central Intelligence Agency report assured American officials that there was no hard evidence linking him to the scandals that had soiled his administration.
"We do not at this time have a 'smoking gun' that implicates former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in influence-peddling and graft," the document began. 
 But in its next breath, the C.I.A. assessment, dated Dec. 27, 1995, raised serious doubts about the integrity of the Harvard-trained economist whom Washington had once hailed as the beacon of a new political generation in Latin America.
"Circumstances and fragmentary reporting strongly suggest such involvement," the report continued, referring to Mr. Salinas's possible participation as President in the corrupt activities of his relatives and aides.
Caution in such appraisals is nothing new. But in recent years, as the character of Mexican politicians become an important issue in Washington, American officials say reports on the subject have often raised ambiguity to an art form.
The C.I.A. report, a copy of which was made available to a reporter, includes some intriguing allegations. But even in its details, the document underscores the limited effort American intelligence officers seem to have made to sort out such accusations.
The former Mexican President has never been charged with any crime and denies knowing anything of the misdeeds with which his elder brother has been charged.
Mr. Salinas did not return telephone calls today.
The C.I.A. report does not delve into those issues in detail. Rather, it synthesizes what several American officials described as a typical mix of assertions by confidential informants and circumstantial evidence.
"A very few intelligence reports, from sources of varying reliability, link former President Salinas to illegal activities, although none ties him directly to narcotics trafficking," the document states. "Salinas's hands-on approach to governing during his tenure as President makes it unlikely that he had no knowledge of his brother's affairs or the shady dealings of other close associates."
The report goes on to recount a series of charges:
*An informant of "undetermined reliability" had reported that before the sale of Government-owned banks by Mr. Salinas's administration in 1990, Raul Salinas and other members of the President's family used inside information to invest heavily in financial instruments that later jumped in value.
*During the race leading up the election of his successor in 1994, Carlos Salinas pressured the campaign of his own party's candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, "into hiring Ana Paola Gerard -- who was widely rumored to be his mistress -- at an exorbitant salary."
*An investigation into "alleged narcotics links of former Agriculture Secretary Carlos Hank Gonzalez highlighted a relationship, which Zedillo's investigators felt cast suspicion upon the former administration, between Hank, Carlos Salinas and another prominent family suspected of laundering drug money." The report attributes the information to the intelligence service of another foreign government.
When such charges reached the C.I.A. is unclear. But there is little indication that American intelligence officers made much of an effort to determine their veracity.
By the time that agency officials compiled the report, for example, the relationship between Carlos Salinas and Ms. Gerard was more than a rumor. Ms. Gerard, 36, a former presidential aide, was about to give birth to Mr. Salinas's daughter.

HEADLINE: When Electricity Goes Private;
Deregulation May Change New York Power Authority

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y.
Just four miles downstream from the oohs and aahs of Horseshoe Falls is a man-made wonder that never draws a throng of tourists -- the Robert Moses Niagara hydroelectric power plant.
Every second, 253,000 cubic feet of water are delivered to the plant by giant tunnels. The water then plunges hundreds of feet through 13 conduits, spinning giant turbines that turn out 2,400 megawatts of electricity in peak periods -- about 10 percent of New York's total. 
 As spectacular as it is, the Niagara plant is only one piece of an intricate network of plants and transmission lines operated by the New York Power Authority, a wonder in its own right that dates back to the Depression era. By the early 1950's, the public agency was generating and delivering low-cost electricity across the state. Today, it provides crucial relief to companies struggling to stay in business and helps scores of municipal electric systems keep their costs down. In New York City, for example, the authority supplies the power for most public buildings, street lights and the subways.
Now, though, as the state's utility industry braces for deregulation, a debate is breaking out over the agency's role -- whether it should change or whether the power authority should have a role at all.
It is a debate being played out, too, at similar agencies in many states and at such huge Federal power systems as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Bonneville Power Administration in Oregon. The issue, in short, is what should become of government-owned utilities in an era when free markets are all the rage.
In New York, private utility companies want the role of the power authority -- the biggest such agency in any state -- to change radically. When deregulation opens the state's doors to outside utility companies, possibly as early as next year, and consumers get to pick among suppliers, market forces will come into play for the first time. A continued large role for the power authority, which supplies a fourth of the electricity in the state and owns 35 percent of the high-voltage transmission lines, would only distort that market, the utilities contend. They point to the artificially low rates the agency provides and the advantages it enjoys, including low-cost financing and an exemption from taxes.
But others, including many who work for companies that get their power from the agency, say it will always be needed to keep parts of the state's economic landscape from withering.
"If it weren't for the authority, this wouldn't be here," said Mark Young, the director of energy for Praxair, a producer of industrial gases, walking recently through one of the company's plants in a decaying industrial area along the Niagara River.
Praxair uses vast amounts of electricity, which it gets from the power authority for a fraction of what private utilities charge. The low-cost power has helped Praxair keep 1,500 jobs in the area, Mr. Young said.
Gov. George E. Pataki, the State Legislature and the New York Public Service Commission are just starting to grapple with the particulars of the authority's future. It is clearly going to be a daunting job.
The goal is to find the right fit for the huge and largely independent agency in what will be a remarkably different industry. New York's seven privately owned utilities, which until now have been restricted to their own corners of the state, will soon be able to do business in other parts of New York and in other states. At the same time, utilities and hundreds of other energy marketers will be pouring in from out of state.
Making things particularly complicated is the fact that the power authority sells and delivers electricity to three upstate utilities even as it competes with them for customers. The three -- Niagara Mohawk Power, New York State Electric and Gas and Rochester Gas and Electric -- resell the power without a profit to some rural customers.
"Sorting out the various roles that the authority has played as supplier, competitor, regulator and partner is a very complex and intricate process," said Gary J. Lavine, senior vice president of legal and corporate relations at Niagara Mohawk.
Beyond these roles, politicians have often called upon the authority during energy emergencies. For example, it helped to shore up the finances of Con Edison in the mid-1970's by acquiring and completing two plants.
As regulators, politicians and the utilities struggle to find common ground regarding the agency's fate, difficult questions about the deregulation process are being exposed, and delays in the transition to full competition appear to be very likely.
"It's going to be very difficult to create a level playing field," said John F. O'Mara, the chairman of the Public Service Commission, which will oversee the transition.
"There are speed bumps that are going to be tough," added Clarence D. Rappleyea, the power authority's chairman and chief executive.
The debate has already made for strange bedfellows in Albany.
Some powerful Republicans, who generally call for shrinking government, want to make sure that the agency's role as a catalyst for economic development is protected. Many of the agency's biggest such efforts have been upstate, a largely Republican stronghold.
For their part, some Democrats, who usually oppose privatization, want large parts of the agency to be sold off, using the proceeds of perhaps $2 billion to help utilities get out from under certain high overhead costs and lead eventually to reduced rates for residential customers.
Various scenarios have arisen.
Because the authority already owns a third of the state's transmission system, it has argued that it would be a natural candidate to take over the rest, a position that has won some support from Republicans.
In running the system, the agency would make sure that any party wanting to sell or buy power would have fair and open access to the transmission grid, Mr. Rappleyea said. But to operate the grid as a neutral party, the authority would have to spin off its generating plants, some industry experts said.
Besides the hydroelectric marvel near Niagara Falls, these include two nuclear plants: the James A. FitzPatrick, on Lake Ontario near Oswego, and Indian Point 3, in northern Westchester County. The properties, especially the Niagara plant, would presumably be attractive to big new players coming into the state, including the Enron Corporation of Houston and the Southern Company of Atlanta.
But Mr. Rappleyea and Mr. O'Mara, both appointees of Governor Pataki, say that it makes little sense to sell off plants that produce some of the lowest-cost power in the state when the goal of deregulation is to reduce rates. The Niagara plant is so valuable to economic development, Mr. O'Mara contends, that a separate public agency should be created to keep it in the state's hands.
Others are not sure that the authority -- or a version of it -- can remain a force under deregulation.
"It's awfully hard to figure out how the authority participates in what is supposed to be a fully competitive market," said Harvey Shapiro, the president of the Energy Association of New York State, the trade and lobbying group for the state's private utilities. "You really can't have a tax-subsidized entity as a competitor."
Larry Shapiro, the senior lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, said that if the private utilities were forced to truly compete, and rates were reduced for all customers, then the agency's role could be sharply cut back.
"The way to make this take place is largely by dismantling the power authority," he added.
For now, at least, the authority certainly has an edge. Niagara Mohawk, for instance, charges the average industrial customer 9.1 cents a kilowatt-hour. The power authority charges 4 cents or less a kilowatt-hour to its newer customers, who qualify for assistance by showing they are in danger of closing a plant or cutting back sharply and who guarantee to keep a certain number of jobs. But those who signed on years ago, under statutory provisions for cheap power for certain industries, are paying just a little more than a penny.
Those numbers explain why the agency is attractive to consumers and distressing to utilities.
Both sides of this two-edged sword became evident in a recent conflict between the authority and Niagara Mohawk, which has seen many of its industrial customers leave its system to lower their rates.
Caught in the middle was Patrick Lemaire, whose family has built an empire of paper mills in Canada. Mr. Lemaire has spent the last 10 years and $35 million from his parent company, Cascades Inc. of Quebec, to revive a mill here in one of the buildings that used to house mills of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation. As recently as the 1950's, 38,000 workers were employed in those buildings and the nearby operations of other companies.
But rising labor costs, taxes and electric rates resulted in wide-scale closings and cutbacks. Only 6,800 workers remain in the area, which is littered with crumbling buildings.
In this grim landscape, Mr. Lemaire's Cascades Niagara Falls Inc. has been one of the few signs of revival. His mill, which makes cardboard from recycled materials, employs 140 people.
A downturn in demand several years ago, however, forced Mr. Lemaire to find ways to cut costs, particularly of electricity.
Mr. Lemaire tried without success to get relief from Niagara Mohawk. Eventually, the company was accepted as a new customer of the power authority. Mr. Lemaire, who was under pressure from the parent company to consider closing the mill and had already laid off 30 workers, agreed to invest $10 million in the business in return for lower rates.
But then Niagara Mohawk decided to make a stand, refusing to deliver the agency's cheaper power to the mill. It also threatened to cut off 36 other plants in the area that were being supplied by the agency.
The power authority was taking away too many major customers, Niagara Mohawk complained, citing an eroding revenue base that was threatening its solvency.
Under the prodding of Governor Pataki and Mr. O'Mara, the two sides reached a compromise. Niagara Mohawk agreed to deliver the cheaper electricity, and the authority promised to make up some of the revenue lost by the utility if more companies quit its system.
Mr. Lemaire is counting on the cheap power for years to come.
"The millions we were giving away for expensive power," he said, "we're putting back in the mill."

The New York Power Authority, a favorite tool of governors, is at the center of a debate over deregulating the state's electric industry. Politicians are loath to dismantle the agency, whose low-cost power attracts and retains industry. But utilities contend it will have an unfair advantage and must be reshaped. Patrick Lemaire, above, almost closed his mill in Niagara Falls, N.Y. But the state provided cheap electricity to keep the plant open. (Wayne Scarberry for The New York Times); From Franklin D. Roosevelt, in car, with original board members, to Nelson A. Rockefeller, above center, to George E. Pataki, right, with current chairman Clarence D. Rappleyea, New York governors have used the power authority to score political points. (New York Power Authority photographs (Rockefeller, Roosevelt, Pataki))(pg. D1)

HEADLINE: An Unfettered Internet? Keep Dreaming

BYLINE: By Eli M. Noam; Eli M. Noam is professor of finance and economics at the Columbia Business School and director of its Institute for Tele-Information.

DATELINE: CARMEL, N.Y.

 BODY:
These have been heady days in Washington for that marvelous medium, the Internet. First, the Supreme Court, in Reno v. A.C.L.U., struck down restrictions on indecent content, overturning a law passed virtually unanimously by Congress.
The Clinton Administration had strongly supported those restrictions. But only a week after the Justices ruled, a White House group led by Ira Magaziner issued an equally vigorous opinion that advocated a largely hands-off policy by Government regarding business conducted on the Internet. 
 Is there any consistency here? In a way, yes. Both Administration positions play to the gallery. And just as the defense of regulated morality on the Internet, though popular, proved to be a failure, so will the call for unregulated Internet commerce fail.
This is not because of meddlesome bureaucrats, but because the Internet will become too successful to be treated differently from the rest of society and the rest of the economy. Since the Internet has moved from techie preserve to office park, shopping mall and entertainment arcade, it is sheer fantasy to expect that it will be left a libertarian island in a world full of jealous competitors and conflicting public objectives.
The Internet is not the only priority in any country. The United States, for example, has long worried about crime, Communism and children. That has led it to seek regulatory rules on pornography and encryption, and the wiring of schools for the Internet championed by Vice President Al Gore.
Similarly, Bavaria cares about hate speech and public morality, and sets rules accordingly. For the French, language and culture are the priorities, and Internet services originating in the country must be in French. Singapore worries about order. And so on.
We may disagree with these concerns, but don't we have our own? Most of the White House paper tells state and foreign governments, not Washington, to mend their ways.
For all the rhetoric of an Internet "free trade zone," will the United States readily accept an Internet that includes Thai child pornography, Albanian tele-doctors, Cayman Island tax dodges, Monaco gambling, Nigerian blue sky stock schemes, Cuban mail-order catalogues? Or, for that matter, American violators of privacy, purveyors of junk E-mail or "self-regulating" price-fixers? Unlikely. And other countries will feel the same on matters they care about.
Thus, for better or worse, each society will apply its accumulated wisdom, misconceptions, preferences and interest group muscle to the rules governing transactions over the Internet. And these rules will not be very different from those applied to the rest of society.
It is easy to engage in generalized anti-government rhetoric but hard to remain consistent. The Internet industry, too, has been selective in its libertarianism at home.
It liked subsidies from the Pentagon and National Science Foundation that created the Internet in the first place, and the N.S.F. money that is helping to develop the next-generation Internet II. It fought for regulated cheap access to phone networks. It supports subsidies for school and library Internet access. It exhorts the Federal Government to carry a big stick internationally to protect its software against pirates. Most of this makes sense, but it is not exactly the free market.
Internet enthusiasts have a fallback hope: "You cannot regulate the Internet." The idea is that clever kids can always find a way to run electronic circles around any restriction, so why even try to regulate? The fallacy is to focus on the electronic bits, which indeed are very hard to control.
Communications are a matter not just of signals but of people, institutions and physical hardware; the arm of the law can reach them. A government will go after static and physical elements if it cannot reach mobile or intangible ones.
For example, instead of taxing transactions over the Internet, which will prove difficult and inefficient, a government might tax the physical delivery -- a "U.P.S. tax." Instead of controlling information, it might mandate hardware to do so, like the V-chip in television sets.
It seems that the new medium is like an inkblot test, an electronic blob into which all project their own fantasies, hopes and fears. Traditionalists find the dark forces of degeneracy. Libertarians detect the heavy hand of government. Leftists discover the sharing community, devoid of the material avarice of private business. Internationalists expect the global village.
This kind of dreaming is common for new and fundamental technology, and it is usually wrong. The reality will be more mundane: the Internet will be enormously important, but it will not create a new regulatory system. It's nice to dream of it as a global force of liberation, but it may also have the unintended opposite effect, if more controls are levied on people and property instead of on transactions and information.
The White House, commendably, says all the right things. But if we watch what it does to its own sacred cows, not what it tells others to do, we should not expect a deregulatory revolution.

HEADLINE: NATO Action Reflects Shift In Tactics

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Planning began weeks ago for the British military operation that led to the arrest of a Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspect and the killing of another, marking an important shift in NATO strategy, prompted in part by the new British Labor Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, American and British officials said.
Today's action, executed under NATO command and with American logistical and intelligence support, follows a year of adamant opposition by United States officials to the use of NATO troops to pursue war-crimes suspects. It is a sign of the new aggressiveness in carrying out the mandate of the troops in Bosnia that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright insisted on, despite the Pentagon's reluctance. 
 Both Mr. Blair and President Clinton approved today's operation. British officials said the arrests "were the first ones, but not the last ones." One of the two men, Simo Drljaca, was killed after he fired a pistol at a British soldier.
But today's actions also represented another important change, officials said. Previously, NATO commanders have been reluctant to put their forces at risk by moving to arrest indicted war criminals, some of whom are heavily guarded.
But the British, who first deployed troops in Bosnia five years ago, have been more willing than most countries to take strong action. Britain, the second-largest contributor to the peacekeeping force -- the United States has 7,800 troops -- brought in special forces to reinforce its 5,300 peacekeepers.
Today's action might not have occurred if Gen. George Joulwan, overall NATO commander, were not leaving his post, senior NATO officials in Brussels said today. His successor, Gen. Wesley Clark, the chief military aide to the Bosnia peace negotiations, was officially sworn in today in Stuttgart.
General Joulwan has been adamantly opposed to the idea of peacekeepers trying to arrest war criminals. Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by contrast, said on Wednesday: "For the Dayton Agreement to have a good chance, the international community will have to come to grips with the necessity of bringing war criminals to justice in The Hague."
He promised to "make every day count" before American troops are scheduled to withdraw from Bosnia in July 1998.
Officials said planning for today's operation began in earnest shortly after Britain and the United States both reviewed their Bosnia policies in May, and allied Governments began discussing how to arrest at least some war criminals, fearing that the whole effort in Bosnia could founder otherwise.
Both of the men who were sought today had been indicted secretly in March by the war-crimes tribunal.
While American officials insisted that today's operation represented no change in the formal mandate of NATO-led troops, they also said that Mr. Clinton's language on the issue had hardened on Wednesday in his news conference in Madrid.
"Our mandate is to arrest people who have been accused of war crimes and turn them over for trial," Mr. Clinton said, "if that can be done in the course of fulfilling our other duties and if commanders on the ground believe the risk is appropriate."
One senior American official said, "That is a more robust statement and this is a more robust action today. The authority has always been there in the mandate, but the willingness to exercise it has changed."
A senior British official said: "There is a deep commitment, certainly, in the new British Government, to bring these people to justice."
But senior American officials admitted that the sealed indictments do not address the question of how to arrest the most prominent, infamous and public targets like the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, and the military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.
An American official said that today's action, coupled with efforts to isolate the parties diplomatically and economically, would increase pressure on other suspects.
While there seems to be no immediate plan or intention to seize more prominent suspects, the Clinton Administration hopes political leaders in the Serbian republic within Bosnia will turn over suspects and, more generally, cooperate with the Dayton accords, the official said.
"What it's doing is putting the bad guys on the run," the official said.
Mr. Clinton was alerted on Wednesday while in Madrid that the arrests might happen today, and he and his aides were contacted on Air Force One by General Shalikashvili to tell them what had occurred.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Report To Congress Nafta Benefits Are Modest

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Four years after a bitterly divisive debate over how a free-trade pact with Mexico and Canada would affect American workers, the Clinton Administration will report to Congress on Friday that the North American Free Trade Agreement has so far generated modest benefits for the United States.
The report provides ammunition to both supporters and critics of the trade pact, and is unlikely to defuse the coming debate over the Administration's plan to extend free trade throughout the hemisphere. 
 "The facts point to only one conclusion: Nafta hasn't measured up," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House and one of the most insistent critics of the agreement. "Before we proceed with further trade negotiations we need to insure that trade results in real progress for the broadest cross section of people."
The Administration report, the White House's first formal assessment of the trade agreement since it went into effect in January 1994, said exporters in many industries like textiles, transportation equipment and electronics had benefited from the reduction in Mexican tariffs and that the direct benefits to the American economy would mount over time.
The report said that the pact stimulated greater exports to Mexico, despite the deep financial crisis that engulfed Mexico in 1995 and turned a small American trade surplus with the country into a deficit that reached $17.5 billion last year.
The pact also increased United States exports to Canada during the last three years, the report said, although the trade deficit with Canada doubled from 1993 to 1996, to $21.7 billion, because of a surge of imports from that country.
But the Administration, which fought hard for approval of the pact despite strong opposition from labor unions, environmentalists and other Democratic constituencies, found only sketchy evidence that the agreement had helped American workers.
The Administration said studies it commissioned suggested that 90,000 to 160,000 American jobs relied on increased exports to Mexico that have come as a result of the pact.
The report did not provide -- or even try to provide -- a precise accounting of how many American jobs might have been lost as companies moved manufacturing to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages there. Official said there were largely unsolvable problems in generating an accurate estimate of job losses. But the report said the number of people whose jobs were lost to Canada or Mexico was probably somewhere between 32,000, the number of those who applied for unemployment and retraining benefits under Government programs for workers displaced by changing trade patterns with those countries and nearly 100,000, those who were certified by the Government as eligible for those programs, which often cover workers not directly affected by Nafta.
While the Administration reiterated its long-held position that export-oriented jobs paid better than the national average for production workers, the report did not directly address whether the new jobs were better paying than those lost as companies shifted employment to take advantage of the new trade rules.
The trade agreement "has made a modest positive contribution to the U.S. economy in terms of net exports, G.D.P., employment and investment," said the report, which the Administration is required to submit to Congress.
While upbeat about the long-term outlook for the trade pact, the Administration report largely avoided the kinds of sweeping claims made on its behalf in 1993 when President Clinton rallied support over the intense opposition of critics who contended that free trade with Mexico would send jobs streaming south of the border. Supporters argued at the time that the agreement would create hundreds of thousands of jobs even after accounting for jobs lost; critics said the effect would be precisely the reverse.
The Administration's conclusions are largely in line with those of the last major study of Nafta, issued last year by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles. The U.C.L.A. study found that the trade pact's effect on employment in the United States was probably a "moderately positive number."
But critics of Nafta, including unions, industries subject to greater competition and environmental watchdogs, continue to argue that the pact has been harmful to American interests and that it is a flawed model for the Administration's plans to extend free-trade agreements throughout the hemisphere.
"Wages and living standards have seen downward pressure in all three countries, and workers' rights and bargaining power have been weakened," said a report issued recently by a coalition of opponents of the pact.
"For the average citizen of any of the three signatory countries, Nafta has been a failure," said the opponents' study, which was compiled in anticipation of the Administration's report by groups including the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute, the International Labor Rights Fund, Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch and the Sierra Club.
The Administration said a study commissioned from DRI/McGraw Hill, the economic consulting firm, found that exports to Mexico from the United States last year were $12 billion higher than they would have been without Nafta, after factoring out the effects of the Mexican economic crisis of 1995. The corresponding increase in imports from Mexico because of the trade pact was $5 billion, the study found.
The Administration also cited a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas that found a $7 billion increase in American exports attributable to Nafta, and a $4 billion increase in imports.
The report said that based on figures from the first four months of the year, Mexico would likely pass Japan to become the nation's No. 2 trading partner, behind Canada.
The report said tariff reductions and other market-opening steps would be phased in over the next 12 years, so it might be too early to assess the accord's full impact.
It said that the short-run effect was to increase United States gross domestic product by $13 billion last year, a small amount in an $8 trillion economy. Gains could increase to $40 billion a year in the long run, it said.

Makers of Oil-Drilling Gear Agree to a Combination
Reading & Bates and Falcon Drilling, two of the world's largest suppliers of oil drilling rigs and other equipment, said that they were merging in a stock deal. 
 Reading & Bates said the merger would create the world's largest fleet of ships that drill for oil in deep water, and the deal comes as demand for such ships is surging amid discoveries of large fields of oil in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico. The new company would have a market value of $5 billion. [Page D16.]
 
Fund Assets Top $4 Trillion
Assets in stock, bond and money market mutual funds topped $4 trillion in June for the first time. About $18 billion in new cash flowed into stock funds, and for the first six months of the year a total of $111 billion was added to such funds. Market Place. [D4.]
 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.33 points, closing at 7,886.76, as investors continued to buy on dips in prices after Wednesday's plunge of 119.88 points. [D5.]
 
Treasury securities were little changed. The yield on the 30-year bond remained at 6.56 percent. [D14.]
 
Markdowns Lift Retailers' Sales
The arrival of a heat wave lifted apparel sales and helped retailers report strong sales for June. The results, however, were achieved in part because of heavy discounting after a weak spring. [D2.]
 
J. P. Morgan Earnings Lower
Lower revenue from bond trading cut quarterly earnings at J. P. Morgan by 15 percent, but revenues rose 1.7 percent. At First Union, the big commercial bank in Charlotte, N.C., growth in fee income at the capital markets group sent profit up 11 percent. [D2.]
 
Compaq Profit Up, but Stock Falls
Compaq reported earnings that beat estimates, and announced the first in what it said would be a series of price cuts. But apparently the results were not strong enough: The stock fell after its recent run-up. [D2.]
 
Diet Centers Reconsider Drugs
Some diet centers that had hoped that prescription diet pills would provide a quick fix for their sagging sales are reconsidering their positions on dispensing the medications after a combination of two such drugs was linked to a rare heart ailment. [D2.]
 
Supercomputer Controls Rejected
The Senate rejected a proposal to tighten control of the sale of supercomputers to China and Russia and instead voted for further study. There has been lively debate over the issue because of disclosures that Chinese and Russian nuclear weapon facilities have acquired American supercomputers without Federal licenses. [A9.]
 
Screening Out Sex and Violence
Starting in October, the most extensive system yet to alert television viewers to violent or sexual content will be in place, and a year or so later, watchers will be able to buy sets that at the touch of a button can screen out any shows deemed objectionable. [A1.]
 
Rate Cuts Seen at Niagara Mohawk
Customers of Niagara Mohawk Power, the New York State electric utility, could have reduced rates by early next year as a result of an agreement the utility reached that allows it to renegotiate its high-cost contracts for electricity with most of its independent power producers. [B5.]
 
Tapes May Have Been Altered
Parts of tape recordings in a Texaco race discrimination case may have been erased, Federal prosecutors said. [D2.]
 
Palladium Down as Supply Grows
Palladium prices fell 4 percent after Russian exports resumed for the first time this year, ending an impasse that depleted stockpiles and sent prices to 17-year highs. [D11.]

'77 Blackout: The Heart Of Darkness

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
MANY New Yorkers, possibly most by now, are too young or too new in town to remember the night when the light went out in the soul of the city. It was 20 years ago this weekend, a time when some were getting ready to say Kaddish for New York. What else do you do before burying someone except recite the Jewish prayer for the dead?
On the night of July 13, 1977, the power failed across the city for the second time in 12 years. The two blackouts, however, could not have been more different. The one in November 1965 is recalled with affection, a gentle moment when New Yorkers lived up to their self-image as a tribe that makes triumphs of adversity. 
 July 1977 was the heart of darkness.
Within minutes, ordinary people who had been sitting on stoops turned into raging mobs in one neighborhood after another, from Tremont Avenue in the Bronx to Jamaica, Queens. They looted hundreds of stores, carting off anything they could grab with two hands. They set fires. For the devastated Bushwick section of Brooklyn, this was but a prelude to weeks of repeated arson. The craziness was so widespread that 4,000 people were arrested in the blackout, which lasted 25 hours in some areas.
It was a summer when it truly looked as though New York might have had it. A deranged serial killer known as Son of Sam filled people with terror. A fiscal crisis tore away relentlessly at city services. And now rioters, warped by greed and unfocused anger, were ripping apart their own neighborhoods.
"We are without God now," a priest told worshipers at the time at St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church in Bushwick.
THE aim here, though, is not to journey down a dark branch of memory lane, but to celebrate New York's remarkable ability to restore its soul.
As terrible as that summer was, the city did not die. In many respects it is now far stronger, the result of political will, beneficial immigration and raw grit on the part of veteran residents. Just as obviously, big problems have not disappeared. And given stubborn poverty and an unemployment rate that is twice the national rate, who can say that New York is more than a flick of a Con Edison switch from fresh chaos?
Bushwick is a good place to see both the grimness and the hope.
No one will mistake that northern Brooklyn enclave for paradise. Easily one-third of its 100,000 people are on welfare, or at least they were before the new Federal law began hacking away at the rolls. Drugs are a persistent problem, as is unemployment. Shuttered stores, boarded-up apartment windows and garbage-strewn lots testify to the failure of Broadway, Bushwick's main commercial street, to bounce back fully.
"It just hasn't recouped from that blackout," said Eli Bey, a construction worker. "It's taken 20 years for businesses to start up again."
STILL, new businesses are there, like the discount store and a Dunkin' Donuts that went up a few months ago on Broadway, near Lexington Avenue.
Though many of them are still unoccupied, new two-family houses dot nearby Grove, Menahan and Bleecker Streets. Hope Gardens, a Housing Authority apartment complex built alongside old wood-frame row houses, is distinctive for its three-story buildings and is regarded by many as a gem of low-density development. Plans are on the boards for dozens more apartments, variously financed by private builders, the city and the office of the Brooklyn Borough President.
In the 1970's, Bushwick lost 45,000 residents and more than 10,000 housing units. That hemorrhaging has been stopped and partly reversed. The local police precinct headquarters, the 83d, reports that major crimes are down by 40 percent in the last two years.
Msgr. John Powis, the pastor at St. Barbara's for the last eight years, can see the changes, both on the street and from his pulpit. Where 20 years ago the church typically drew 200 worshipers on a Sunday, it now boasts of 1,400. "It's like a proclamation that life can triumph over death," Monsignor Powis said.
Earl Tipton, a letter carrier who lives in Bushwick and delivers its mail, sees attitudes changing, with people increasingly convinced that poverty, however deplorable, is no excuse for rioting. "They're not just thinking about themselves," he said on his route the other day. "They're thinking about their kids and teaching them how to be better people."
So are the bad days banished forever? For all his hopefulness, even Mr. Tipton will not go that far. "If the lights go out," he said with a sigh, "it could be 1977 all over again."

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Renews Drive To Ban Sampling for Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Undaunted by an embarrassing retreat last month, House Republicans revived their effort to ban statistical sampling in the 2000 census today, asserting that the method was an effort by the Clinton Administration to increase the political strength of traditional Democratic voters like blacks and Hispanic Americans.
"Statistical guessing is nothing more than a risky scheme that is ripe for political tampering," said Representative Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, using what has become his party's favorite term for sampling. Mr. Hastert heads the House Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Census Bureau. 
 Statistical sampling allows conclusions to be drawn about a large population without actually contacting each person. It is widely used in public opinion polls, marketing surveys and sociological research, and is used by the Census Bureau to estimate figures like the country's unemployment rate. But the bureau's proposal to use the method for the first time to gauge the country's population and, therefore, to apportion Congressional seats has raised a storm of political and legal fights.
The opening shot in the renewed fight over the issue came today when a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee voted to provide the bureau with the $100 million that it needs to finance its normal operations in the next fiscal year, but said none could be spent on sampling.
The subcommittee also voted to prohibit the bureau from spending an additional $282 million that has been appropriated to prepare for the 2000 census until Congress determines what method will be used: an actual head count, or a head count supplemented by sampling.
The total appropriation of $382 million is $27 million more than the Census Bureau has requested. Republican leaders said the additional money should allow the bureau to prepare to conduct a count without sampling.
"What I am trying to say to the Administration is that if you can convince the people's representatives here in the Congress that sampling is the best way to go, the money's there for that," said Representative Harold Rogers, the Kentucky Republican who heads the subcommittee. "If you can't convince the peoples' representatives that that's the best way to go, the money's there for an actual count."
The fight is essentially a reprise of a seemingly arcane issue, but one that has enormous political ramifications. At issue is the Census Bureau's proposal to try to count as many of the country's households as possible through traditional methods like mailed forms, telephone interviews and door-to-door visits. The bureau wants to then count a fraction of the remainder and use that figure to extrapolate for the total population.
Republicans have belittled the method, saying it could subject the census to political manipulation, even though it has been endorsed by outside experts, like the members of the National Academy of Science.
A subtext of the fight over sampling is the fear among some Republican political strategists that it will increase the numbers, and therefore the political strength, of rural residents, blacks, Hispanic Americans and the poor -- groups that for the most part tend to vote Democratic.
Last month, House and Senate leaders attached an amendment banning sampling to a $8.4 billion spending bill that included money to help victims of flooding in California and the Midwest. But the Republicans were forced to withdraw the amendment after President Clinton vetoed the measure and publicly accused them of tying up disaster relief with an extraneous political issue.

HEADLINE: Clinton Cheers Exultant Poles, And Vice Versa

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WARSAW, July 10

 BODY:
Nearly eight years after the fall of Communism, President Clinton celebrated Poland's new ties to the NATO military alliance today, telling a jubilant, flag-waving crowd, "Poland is coming home."
Thousands of people poured into the cobblestoned Castle Square and side streets to catch a glimpse of the American President a day after the conclusion of a NATO summit meeting in Madrid where the Western alliance -- founded to counter the Soviet threat -- invited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join its ranks. 
 "Now Poland is joining NATO," Mr. Clinton called out as the sun broke through early evening clouds to illuminate the waving Polish and Americans flags and a large banner proclaiming, "Thank you America."
"Poland is taking its place in the community of democracies," Mr. Clinton said, a translator relaying his words to the crowd, which broke out repeatedly in delayed applause. "Never again will your fate be decided by others. Never again will the birthright of freedom be denied you. Poland is coming home."
Mr. Clinton's triumphant tour through Warsaw carried enormous emotional resonance in a city where the walls remain pockmarked with bullets, the scars deliberately left untouched as a reminder of the Nazi occupation.
Flanked by Russia and Germany, and overrun repeatedly throughout its history, Poland was invaded from the east and from the west in 1939, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a secret pact dismembering the nation.
At Yalta in 1945, in what Poles have long considered the ultimate betrayal by the West, the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain divided Europe into Western and Soviet spheres of influence, putting Poland under Moscow's domination.
"Fifty years ago what we see before us was a sea of ruins," said Aleksander Kwasniewski, the Polish President, himself a former Communist, who spoke before Mr. Clinton's address and who had campaigned hard for Poland's inclusion in NATO. "Before Polish wounds even began to heal, the Iron Curtain fell down, isolating our country."
Mr. Clinton, looking ahead, said, "Now we come here to celebrate history's most precious gift -- a second chance."
It was the end of the cold war and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire that led NATO to open its doors to create an expanded framework of security and stability for Central European countries that chose the path of democracy and open markets.
And in the streets along Mr. Clinton's motorcade route were signs of just how much Poland has changed since 1989 when a Solidarity activist, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, formed the country's first non-Communist Government in more than 40 years.
Now the Stalin-era Palace of Culture and Science shares the Warsaw skyline with a Marriott hotel, an IKEA furniture store and bright signs advertising Fiat, Sony and Hyundai. The motorcade passed by fast-food restaurants like Burger King and McDonald's and English-language billboards.
The throngs in Castle Square gave a special whoop of welcome for Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, whose family fled Czechoslovakia when the Communists took power. They cheered as Mr. Clinton ended his address with shouts of "Sto lat!" the traditional Polish toast that means "May you live 100 years." And they cheered again as hundreds of red, white and blue helium balloons were released into the sky.
One appeal from Mr. Clinton, however, drew no applause at all: his call for Poland "to reach out to all of your neighbors, to the East as well as to the West, including the people of Russia."
"You must continue to build in tolerance what others destroyed in hate," Mr. Clinton said.
The NATO alliance has gone out of its way to portray its expansion eastward into the former Warsaw Pact nations as no threat to Russia, saying it is intended to bring stability to Europe in a period when the East-West divide no longer exists. NATO has signed a separate charter with Russia to bring it closer to the alliance and calm its fears of the expansion.
But some of Mr. Clinton's listeners had no doubt that they considered NATO to be insurance against the possibility of a resurgent Russia. Artur Ceran, a 40-year-old economist, was trying to explain how his country would benefit from joining NATO, when Anna Sienkiewicz, 65, a retired engineer, interrupted him to state her view succinctly. "We are farther from the Kremlin," she said. "That's the benefit."
For others it represented inclusion in the West. "I'm happy that we joined NATO -- our first step toward Western culture after 50 years of Communists," said Slavamir Kowzan, 35, who was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the American flag. "Everybody's proud right now to be here at this historic moment."
Poland chose to use the day to showcase figures from the military who will be working with their Western counterparts. Mr. Clinton descended from Air Force One to be greeted by an honor guard of Polish troops who served as part of United Nations forces in Haiti and Bosnia.
At Castle Square he was welcomed by a young Polish officer who studied at the United States Air Force Academy and by Boleslaw Kukielka, a veteran of World War II who fought in an American tank against the Germans as a member of the Polish II Corps.
"We share 200 years of military tradition of fighting for freedom," he told the President.
Before Mr. Clinton spoke, he was welcomed by a beaming Mr. Kwasniewski to the Presidential Palace, the building where the Warsaw Pact was formally created in 1955 and where in 1989 the Communists and Solidarity opposition held the round-table talks that brought Poland back to democracy. Mr. Clinton later attended a dinner in his honor at the palace.
American officials said the two Presidents discussed the progress of Poland's economy, the new Constitution that is being adopted and the tasks that lie ahead for Poland as it modernizes its 230,000-strong armed forces to make them compatible with NATO forces.
Mr. Kwasniewski also made a gracious gesture of national reconciliation, paying tribute at Castle Square to all those he said had furthered the cause of NATO membership for Poland, including Mr. Mazowiecki and Lech Walesa, the Solidarity founder who became the first popularly elected President of Poland in 1990. Mr. Kwasniewski defeated Mr. Walesa in 1995.
Mr. Walesa was sitting in a place of honor in the front row of the audience in Castle Square. He spoke briefly to Mr. Clinton and at one point embraced Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat of Polish descent who was traveling with the President.
Mr. Clinton, who is to travel to Romania on Friday, vowed to the crowds that NATO's expansion would continue. "Other nations are counting on you to show the contributions new members can make," he said. "You did not walk through NATO's door to see it shut behind you. That door will stay open."

HEADLINE: MISREADING MEXICO: How Washington Stumbled -- A special report.;
Mexico and Drugs: Was U.S. Napping?

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 10

 BODY:
Early last year, a handful of senior American officials in Washington received an alarming secret intelligence report on Mexico. It was on its face, officials said, the sort of document that can force policy makers to change the way they think about a country or a region.
In a matter of just weeks, the National Security Agency reported, Mexican drug traffickers had laundered some $6 billion in illicit profits through their country's financial system. The spy agency based its conclusion on an elaborate surveillance of the contacts between drug gangs and their business associates. 
 Almost immediately, State Department officials delivered an angry protest to the Mexican Ambassador over the apparently vast breach in his country's defenses against drug trafficking.
Then, however, American officials' outrage gave way to chagrin.
The agency, they realized, was asserting that Mexico had taken in a flood of dollars nearly equal to its entire foreign investment that year without any discernible impact on its economy. "It just couldn't have happened," one official said. And he added, "You have to ask: 'Which reports am I supposed to believe?' "
An examination by The New York Times, based on scores of interviews and a review of classified documents, indicates that the agency's discredited assessment was by no means an isolated lapse in the annals of United States intelligence on drugs and corruption in Mexico.
Rather, as the United States weighed momentous decisions about Mexico in the 1990's -- from the North American Free Trade Agreement to the $12.5-billion bailout of the Mexican economy after a currency crisis -- American policy makers were blindsided by some important developments, misinformed about others and inattentive to many more.
After insisting for years that Mexican corruption was an old affliction being cured by a new generation of political leaders, senior American officials have begun to acknowledge that the growing power and influence of Mexico's drug traffickers have led to a law-enforcement crisis so deep that it threatens the stability of a country that shares almost 2,000 miles of border with the United States.
Yet a good deal of the information upon which that conclusion is based had languished in the files of American law-enforcement agents and intelligence officers for years, officials said. Only rarely did such intelligence command the time of senior policy makers.
Even less frequently did it prompt them to take any action. "A lot of this information has been out there, in the bowels of the system," said Donald F. Ferrarone, who, before his recent retirement as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's field office in Houston, oversaw investigations that dealt closely with the political protection of Mexican drug traffickers. "But it has been ignored, because people don't want to believe it, the extent and degree of corruption."
Allegations over almost two years of drug-related corruption in the inner circle of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari have forced American officials to rethink the issue. The governing party's loss of control of the lower house of Congress in mid-term elections last week now raises the possibility that Mexican legislators will examine more closely than the ever the misdeeds of the ruling elite.
In recent weeks, senior Clinton Administration officials have begun to plot a wholesale reorganization of the Federal Government's drug-intelligence apparatus. Officials said the overhaul will seek to pool some information that is now tightly held by different agencies, disseminate important material more quickly, and thin out a vast intelligence bureaucracy in which different offices perform similar work.
But many officials argued that the failures of American intelligence on Mexico are even deeper and more serious than policy makers have acknowledged. And the problems, by all accounts, have been as much ones of demand as of supply.
Law-enforcement agents who worked in and on Mexico while Mr. Salinas was a prized ally of the United States said they were often discouraged by political pressure to keep the drug issue from jeopardizing improvements in the economic relationship between the two countries. At crucial moments, they asserted, intelligence struggled with policy and policy won.
For their part, many officials in Washington said they could not help but grow skeptical of the intelligence after being deluged with vague, uncorroborated informants' reports and analysis that was either so thin on evidence or so carefully hedged as to be of little use.
At the height of such problems, during the American debate over the free-trade accord that was approved in November, 1993, Mexico's strategic importance to the United States came into focus as never before. The personal reputations and political strength of Mexican leaders became central questions of American foreign policy.
Yet in the case of Mr. Salinas's influential elder brother, Raul, American investigators did little more than file away allegations that he was not only taking kickbacks on government contracts but cutting deals with cocaine traffickers, officials familiar with the reports said. Drug-enforcement agents said they dropped an inquiry into telephone calls by drug traffickers to the Mexican President's offices after they had trouble figuring out whom the traffickers had called.
American officials so thoroughly failed to share information on Carlos Salinas's Deputy Attorney General, Mario Ruiz Massieu, that three different agencies raised questions about his conduct without ever hearing of Customs Service reports that suitcase after suitcase of cash had been deposited in Mr. Ruiz Massieu's account in a Texas bank.
Nearly a year after Mr. Salinas left the presidency, a secret Central Intelligence Agency assessment of his own reported misconduct argued that at the least, his hands-on governing style made it "unlikely that he had no knowledge of his brother's affairs or the shady dealings of other close associates."
But while a fuller understanding of the drug traffickers' penetration of Mexican politics may await the outcome of criminal investigations that now extend from San Diego to Switzerland, the revelations of wrongdoing have already contributed to a reordering of United States policy.
In a recent interview, the newly departed American Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, recalled his arrival here four years ago. His priorities were to manage trade, promote investment and push for more democratic politics. Then, the list began to change.
"The majority of my time," he said in May, as he prepared to leave the country, "is now spent on administration-of-justice issues, corruption and narcotics trafficking."

The Background
The Old Priorities: Trade and Politics
As Carlos Salinas took office at the end of 1988, the perspective of United States officials could hardly have been more different.
The Drug Enforcement Agency and the C.I.A. had traced a growing traffic in drugs through Mexico since the mid-1980's, when the United States began to increase pressure on Colombian smuggling routes through the Caribbean. But through the early 1990's, officials said, American experts remained convinced that Mexican traffickers had nothing close to the financial clout or political influence of their Colombian partners.
American officials also drew a sharp distinction between the young, American-trained technocrats whom Mr. Salinas brought to power and the more experienced, conservative -- and corrupt -- politicians whom he appointed in areas like law enforcement, national security and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
At the start of his six-year term, Mr. Salinas seemed to attack drug trafficking with a new zeal. Having been told by the Bush Administration that the problem could obstruct closer economic ties, Mr. Salinas ordered the seizure of more drug shipments, the eradication of more drug crops, and the capture of a powerful drug trafficker, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo.
John D. Negroponte, the United States Ambassador to Mexico from 1989 to 1993, gave voice to the prevailing optimism.
In a confidential memorandum to law-enforcement officials at the embassy, Mr. Negroponte hailed Mr. Salinas's early steps as "clear proof that Mexico is interested in meaningful cooperation with the United States to reduce this flow of drugs."
In a recent interview, he recalled: "I don't think we ever doubted Salinas's personal integrity. He was a very disciplined guy. He always wore that Casio sports watch. He worked like hell."
Several law-enforcement officials who served at the embassy were more skeptical. But they said they also had trouble making their case when the drug problem, like other sources of friction between the two countries, was supposed to be "managed" so as not to threaten growing investment and trade.
As United States law enforcement officials had untangled a Mexican cover-up of the 1985 assassination of an American drug-enforcement agent, Enrique S. Camarena, many became convinced that drug corruption reached the highest levels of the Mexican Government. They believed that unless that system was dismantled, drug interdiction efforts were condemned to futility.
Now, American agents were being told to simply do the best they could.
"There was a sense that Mexico was a place that we were just going to have to deal with in the shape that it was in," said Matthew J. Maher, a veteran of the Camarena investigation who served as the Drug Enforcement Administration's international-operations chief until 1994. "The only questions you asked were whom you could deal with and how far you could go. It was a matter of finding a path through the minefield."
Moves toward the trade agreement increased contacts between the two Governments geometrically. But that only reinforced Washington's belief that a new political day had dawned in Mexico.
"Every American official who came through there met with the Mexicans involved with Nafta," Mr. Negroponte said. "That was the prism through which the American Government was looking at the Mexican Government. We certainly felt that the reformers were in the ascendancy."
Those bright, English-speaking officials seemed to sustain an American faith: that the more Mexico opened up to competition, the more its Government would have to scale back its economic role -- and the less chance Mexican officials would have to demand bribes in return for waiving rules or awarding contracts.
Drugs figured little in the equation. But just as Mr. Salinas embraced a trade deal with the United States, the scope of Mexican trafficking began to change as well.
Colombian cocaine producers had already made Mexico their main route to the thriving American market. Then Mexican traffickers, who had been working for fees of $1,000 or $2,000 for every kilogram of cocaine they smuggled, began to demand their cut in kind.
The economics were simple: by taking their payment in cocaine and greatly expanding their distribution network, especially in the western United States, the Mexicans began to increase their profits between 5 and 10 times, officials said. And as the value of their smuggling routes rose, so did their payments for protection to politicians, judges, prosecutors and the police.
New trade regulations began opening the already porous border even more. But drug-intelligence officials said it would still take several years before the implications of this change -- and the threat it posed to Mexican security -- were fully grasped by American policy makers.

The Warnings
Little Response To Early Reports
While Carlos Salinas was being celebrated in Washington and on Wall Street as the man who might lead Mexico into the developed world, American officials began hearing a very different picture of his inner circle from a source they knew well.
In 1991, a Mexican Federal police commander who had carried out sensitive operations for both Salinas brothers came forward with some startling, specific allegations. The commander, Guillermo Gonzalez Calderoni, spoke to officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a United States Attorney's office in Texas. And he told of drug payoffs and dirty political tricks at the highest levels of Government.
By 1993 at the latest, American officials said, Mr. Gonzalez Calderoni had told them that Luis Medrano, a close associate of one of Mexico's biggest drug traffickers, had told him of paying Raul Salinas two years earlier to help their trafficking group acquire two seaports that the Government was planning to sell to private investors.
American officials who dealt with the case said Mr. Gonzalez Calderoni's claims were strongly debated within Federal law-enforcement agencies because he was widely thought to have had his own corrupt ties to Mr. Medrano's boss, Juan Garcia Abrego, and because Mexico had unsuccessfully sought his extradition.
None of what Mr. Gonzalez Calderoni had to say fit readily into any active drug investigations, the officials said. None of it, without further confirmation, was enough to open a new inquiry into drug-related corruption. So in the end, they said, his reports were simply filed away.
"I don't think he was ever looked at as being a serious witness in corruption cases," one former official familiar with the debriefings said. "Back in 1993, it was very unpopular to say anything against Mexico, basically because of Nafta. Who was going to go and do a direct investigation against the President's brother? You just put it away, and it goes into the batter."
 
The Information
Charges Abounded; Evidence Was Scanty
Eventually, Mr. Gonzalez Calderoni's allegations circulated throughout the Government. The C.I.A., in particular, viewed him as a less than compelling source. One official said he came to personify, one official says, "the difficulty of getting hard, reasonably credible information on these kinds of allegations."
Several other knowledgeable officials put the C.I.A.'s struggle with Mexican corruption in a different light. Throughout the first half of the decade, they said, the agency that is supposed to be the primary source of information for American policy makers about internal workings of foreign governments spent relatively little time trying to verify the sort of charges that people like Mr. Gonzalez Calderoni made.
The C.I.A. station in Mexico City has generally been the agency's most important in Latin America. But former American intelligence officials said that during the latter half of the cold war -- when the city was a hub of Soviet espionage, a crucial base for Cuban agents and the common sanctuary for leftist Central American guerrilla groups -- turning a blind eye to the drug-related corruption in the Mexican internal-security apparatus was often a condition for securing its assistance.
The quid pro quo became evident as early as 1982, after Federal prosecutors in San Diego indicted the chief of Mexico's internal-security force on charges of helping to run a huge car-theft ring. The prosecutors promptly received a cable from the United States Embassy in Mexico City telling them to desist; the Mexican official, Miguel Nazar Haro, was an "essential contact" of the C.I.A. station there. Mr. Nazar Haro remains a fugitive from prosecution in the United States and his whereabouts are unknown.
Mexico is one of two dozen foreign nations where the agency is authorized by a 1986 Presidential decision directive to conduct covert anti-drug operations, intelligence officials said. One official said it is also among the handful of nations where the C.I.A. has even broader authority under a top-secret appendix to the Presidential order.
Yet until recently, several officials said, C.I.A. officers in Mexico have been far less active against the drug and corruption problems than their counterparts in Colombia, who trained elite anti-drug forces and guided operations against the leaders of the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels.
"In Colombia, you had the agency pushing and clamoring and trying to get in on it," said a retired American official who worked in both countries. "In Mexico, you had to go down there and try to get them jump-started. They were not focused on drugs. And a lot of the D.E.A. guys there didn't want them involved anyway."
Mexico has also been something of a stepchild to the secret coordinating group that has orchestrated the increasingly cooperative efforts of United States law-enforcement, intelligence and military agencies in the Andes, officials said.
The existence of the panel, called the Linear Committee, has not been previously disclosed. But officials describe it as an unusually successful collaboration directed by the C.I.A.'s Counternarcotics Center and the Drug Enforcement Administration to find weak points in the linear chain of cocaine production and distribution.
Until late 1995, several officials who have sat in on its deliberations said, the Linear Committee's priorities were very much in the Andes. Only after most of the main Cali cartel leaders had surrendered or been arrested did it turn more intently to the major Mexican traffickers.
Some officials said that shift has already shown some results. Last year, the committee helped coordinate the pursuit of Jose Luis Pereira, the principal contact between the jailed Cali cocaine baron Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela and a powerful Mexican drug trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, whom Mexican officials confirmed today had died after plastic surgery last week to change his appearance.
Mr. Pereira, a Bolivian known by the code name Jota, was captured by the Mexican Army after a lengthy surveillance of his safe houses by the C.I.A., officials said. He was then deported home on a plane that stopped in Miami, where Federal agents were waiting for him. He pleaded not guilty and is now standing trial on Federal drug charges.
 
The Blind Spot
Signs of Trouble Got Little Attention
United States officials explain some of the lapses of intelligence efforts in Mexico by noting that probably nowhere else abroad do American officials deal with a more complicated mesh of economic interests, national-security concerns, law-enforcement problems and domestic political considerations.
But many officials also attributed some of the shortcomings to a chronic inattention by American policy makers.
In the months surrounding the agreement's approval in November 1993, officials said, few policy makers even noted reports by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicating that a shadowy armed group appeared to be active in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.
Similarly, though some finance and intelligence officials were concerned in late 1994 about the overvaluation of Mexico's peso, C.I.A. analysts decided not to issue a warning about the problem just a few days before the currency collapsed, according to intelligence officials. At the State Department, copies of an intelligence report titled "A Peso Problem" sat mostly unread on the shelves.
"We have had, historically, a great deal of information from down there, but nobody wanted to look at it, because they didn't know what to do," said former Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat who was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence until the end of 1994.
"They were afraid of how bad it might be, and how they would be able to justify the economic policies,"said Mr. DeConcini, who, at his own request, received regular briefings on Mexico from the C.I.A.
Senior officials who dealt with Mexico under the Bush and Clinton Administrations said it was far easier to get the National Security Adviser or Secretary of State to focus on a short-term problem like Haiti's elections than to devote 20 minutes to a question of Mexico's long-term stability.
In early 1995, for instance, a powerful group of Deputy Secretaries ordered a far-reaching assessment of Mexico's turmoil and its implications for American policy. It was typical, officials said, that this effort was eventually forgotten, and the study never completed.
Nor have United States officials had much success in acting to stop Mexican corruption, even in the rare instances when they have had information they considered solid enough to act on.
One such case, in 1992, began when American drug-enforcement agents in El Paso raided the home of a mid-level cocaine trafficker and happened upon a fascinating video cassette.
Several officials who saw it said the tape showed the trafficker, his wife or girlfriend and several associates cheerfully shooting off automatic weapons with a friend in military fatigues. The friend turned out to be a Mexican Army general, Javier Escobedo.
When the video cassette reached the United States Embassy in Mexico City, Mr. Negroponte, the Ambassador, saw it as an unusual opportunity and he immediately delivered a copy to Mexico's Defense Minister.
After being confronted with the evidence by his superiors, however, General Escobedo chose neither to turn informant nor face a court martial. Instead, the officials said, he drove to the grave of his father, who had also been an army general, and shot himself to death.
The circumstances of his suicide were never disclosed.
 
The Alarm
Growing Turmoil South of the Border
In the fall of 1994, as Washington's Mexico specialists tried to make sense of a guerrilla uprising, a tumultuous presidential election campaign and the assassination of two major ruling-party political figures, many of them began to take the corruption problem more seriously.
So did many Mexicans. Ernesto Zedillo, who was elected President that August, pledged to clean up the country's judicial system, and Mr. Jones, the Ambassador, offered information that he said might help the new Government keep out corurupt officials.
Diplomats at the embassy saw the exchange of information as a unique opportunity to deal with the problem. But by the way it was handled, the episode seemed to demonstrate American ambivalence about the issue once again.
Mr. Jones asked several of the embassy's senior law-enforcement and intelligence officials to draw up a list of current and former Mexican officials who they thought should have no place in the upper ranks of an honest new regime.
The list they produced -- a copy of which was obtained by a reporter and confirmed in its contents by three knowledgeable American officials -- catalogues a much wider presumption of corruption at the senior levels of the Salinas Administration than United States officials have ever acknowledged publicly.
Among its 18 names are those of a former Interior Minister, a former Defense Secretary, and a former Attorney General; three officials who had been in charge of anti-drug efforts, Mr. Salinas's former national security chief and his former drug intelligence chief. It also includes several veterans of the Federal Security Directorate, the state-security force that collaborated closely with the C.I.A. until it was disbanded in 1985.
Those officials who could be contacted by a reporter uniformly denied having ever done anything wrong and said they had no idea that they had been included on the American blacklist.
In any case, United States officials did not press the point. Mr. Jones sent the list without first clearing the action with the State Department or White House. He later described it as a mere "exchange of information." A second list of about 30 lower-ranking Mexicans, against whom the embassy officials felt they had weaker evidence, was never sent at all.
A senior American official said at the time that the list had been a great success because none of those it named were allowed into Mr. Zedillo's Government.
But that does not appear to be true. Among those on the list is Wilfredo Robledo, a senior operations official at Mexico's national-security agency, the Center for Investigations and National Security. Mexican officials who work with Mr. Robledo said he remains on the job and in good standing.
Officials at the center and the Interior Ministry, which controls the center, did not respond to telephone calls asking for comment.
 
The Bureaucracy
American Agencies Locked in Turf Battles
American law-enforcement and intelligence officials said one of their basic problems in understanding the growing political influence of Mexican drug traffickers stemmed from the failure of government agencies to share information.
While law-enforcement agents are building their cases, their practice is to guard what they know as closely as possible. After it comes out in court, they say, they generally have little time to try to evaluate the strategic significance of the information they have gathered.
C.I.A. analysts who want to borrow such files often have to go to another agency's offices to read them. Often as not, policy makers are the last to find out what law enforcement officials already know.
"There is an impenetrable firewall," one State Department official said, "between what U.S. attorneys are doing and what the policy side of the house knows."
Rarely, however, has the system appeared so uncommunicative as in the case of Mr. Ruiz Massieu, a Deputy Attorney General who was both a close aide to Carlos Salinas and a brother of a leading politician said to have been killed on the orders of Raul Salinas.
American officials began to suspect Mr. Ruiz Massieu of corruption after Mr. Garcia Abrego, the trafficker, escaped just ahead of a 1993 raid to which he was apparently tipped off.
That December, Mr. Ruiz Masseiu opened a bank account in Houston. A few months later, his closest aide began arriving there with suitcases and boxes stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.
Customs agents in Texas recorded shipments that would eventually leave more than $9 million in the bank. But even after a suspicious bank officer called them to inquire about the money, Customs officials said, the agents did not investigate further.
"Their sense was that there was something wrong there," the head of the Customs Service's financial investigations division, Alan Doody, said of the agents in Houston. "But the realization came pretty quickly that this guy was part of the ruling elite. There was a whiff that something wasn't right. But in order to do something about it, you need more than a whiff."
In Mexico City and Washington, other American law-enforcement officials were getting more. Some informants told of large gifts to Mr. Ruiz Massieu and his wife. Others described a huge smuggling case in which Mr. Ruiz Massieu and his deputy exonerated corrupt Mexican police agents. The success of Mexican anti-drug operations plummetted.
Even then, officials said, Customs, F.B.I. and drug-enforcement officials shared little information about the case. Senior officials in Washington and Mexico learned of Mr. Ruiz Massieu's Texas deposits only after he was arrested at Newark International Airport as he tried to flee to Europe in March 1995.
When word of Mr. Ruiz Massieu's fortune reached the American Embassy in Mexico City, Mr. Jones assembled law-enforcement and intelligence officers in "the bubble," a secure room adjoining his office. He asked what evidence they might contribute to the case on Mr. Ruiz Massieu's apparent corruption.
"All of our great minds said they didn't have any evidence against him," one official at the meeting recalled.
 
The Mexicans
Political Rivals Traded Graft Charges
In explaining their belated apprehension of the traffickers' connections to the Salinas Administration, law-enforcement and intelligence officials make an insistent point: Mexican political tradition dictates absolute loyalty until a president steps down. The airing of corruption allegations almost always comes later.
Mr. Zedillo appeared to underscore that point as he began his term. Within little more than three months after he took office, Raul Salinas was arrested on murder charges, Mario Ruiz Massieu was accused of taking bribes from drug traffickers, and Carlos Salinas was forced into exile, his reputation in shreds.
As Mexico was being rocked by those tremors, American officials took inventory of the corruption allegations they had against leading members of the Mexican elite.
Perhaps the most comprehensive such search was ordered by senior law-enforcement officials in March 1995, as Republicans in Congress fought Mr. Clinton's plan to rescue the Mexican economy.
The review turned up all kinds of accusations, officials said, none of them entirely convincing.
"There was just no smoking gun," said Robert Nieves, who joined the search as the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief of international operations. "That doesn't mean that it wasn't meaningful. But you couldn't go to court with that information."
How deeply American agencies dug into such matters is unclear. Several officials who read much of the C.I.A.'s reporting on Mexican corruption between 1992 and 1995 said the reports rarely indicated that intelligence officers had done any significant investigation of the claims of their informants.
United States law-enforcement officials who were stationed in Mexico City said they had little choice but to look skeptically at the allegations they heard.
Within the Mexican police and security apparatus, they said, leaking negative information about one's political enemies to American officials was a basic weapon of bureaucratic struggle.
"Now, all of that information is almost 100 percent," said a former law-enforcement official who processed some of the most explosive accusations against Mexican officials, politicians and businessmen. "But at the time, we had to ask ourselves, 'Is it possible that it goes this high up?' We were afraid to write it up sometimes because we thought people would say we were crazy."
 
The Fiasco
A General's Arrest Humiliates U.S.
More recently, even as events in Mexico have forced the Clinton Administration to reassess drug trafficking and corruption here,, American intelligence efforts have continued to run into problems. The fall last February of Mexico's drug-enforcement chief was a case in point.
The official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested on charges of working for Mr. Carillo Fuentes, the powerful cocaine trafficker who apparently died last week at a Mexico City clinic. Eight days earlier, the bald, rock-jawed Mexican officer had stood at attention in Washington as the White House drug-policy chief, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, described him as "an honest man and a no-nonsense field commander."
As commander of a five-state military region that has its headquarters in the western city of Guadalajara, General Gutierrez Rebollo had been credited with the capture of one major cocaine trafficker in 1995, the arrest of another last August and the seizure of a plane loaded with millions of dollars in drug profits in between. The prevailing view, said a White House official who reviewed background information about the general from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, was that he was "a soldier's soldier."
That no other army commander had taken remotely so much initiative in the fight against drug trafficking did not stir much doubt among experts who assessed his appointment for the two intelligence agencies and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Rather, according to several officials familiar with their reports and briefings, the intelligence analysts appeared to take their main cues from American drug-enforcement agents stationed in Guadalajara. The agents, who had dealt with the general on several cases, thought he was all business.
Some of the analysts did note that General Gutierrez Rebollo had managed to avoid the regular rotations to which other commanders were subjected. But officials said that their reports and briefings raised no particular alarm that he had remained for more than six years in Guadalajara, the Beirut of Mexico's drug underworld.
It is an established pattern of Mexican corruption that successful police commanders sell protection to one trafficking group while attacking others. But it went unnoticed among drug-intelligence analysts, officials said, that General Gutierrez Rebollo had been vigorously attacking the Tijuana-based drug gang run by the Arellano Felix brothers while virtually ignoring their rival, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.
Had United States officials queried senior Mexican law-enforcement officials, they might have confirmed that the general had balked at turning over suspected associates of the Arellano Felix gang whom his officers had captured, tortured and held incommunicado.
Had they asked officials in Guadalajara, they would have heard about serious allegations of misconduct against a close aide whom General Gutierrez Rebollo had placed as head of the state police. After the state government dismissed the aide, the general hired him back as chief of investigations at Mexico's drug enforcement agency.
"He was showing results," said one American official who dealt with General Gutierrez Rebollo. "His methods were overlooked."
By the time of his arrest in February, American drug enforcement officials had heard from several informants who questioned the general's honesty. The reports were not vigorously pursued, officials said.
Since the Gutierrez Rebollo episode, officials said, the C.I.A. has instituted a new system to warn of such problems.
Every biography the agency's analysts produce on a Mexican official now includes a caveat: just because no negative information has turned up does not mean that the official can necessarily be trusted.
 
The Solutions
Structural Changes Encounter Resistance
By late 1995, the new Director of Central Intelligence, John M. Deutch, was sufficiently dissatisfied with the agency's reporting on Mexico that he ordered intelligence officers and analysts to redouble their efforts.
Mr. Deutch, who lived briefly in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca as a boy, took over the post with the Clinton Administration still feeling the sting of Congressional and public anger over the peso crisis. Officials said he included Mexico for the first time on the list of strategic priorities for the C.I.A. He asked his officers to focus on the stability of Mr. Zedillo's Government and the threats it faced from both drug corruption and guerrillas.
Nearly two years later, the White House's drug-policy chief, General McCaffrey, suggested that the problems of intelligence on Mexico are still far from solved.
Fresh from his own embarrassment with the fall of General Gutierrez Rebollo, General McCaffrey said in an interview that he has begun an effort to create "a newly defined architecture" for the myriad agencies that collect information to support anti-drug efforts.
General McCaffrey said the goal of the redesign will be to establish new "roles and missions and a hierarchy" for such agencies as the Drug-Enforcement Administration's El Paso Intelligence Center, the C.I.A.'s Counternarcotics Center in Langley, Va., the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network outside Washington, and the National Drug Intelligence Center in Johnstown, Pa.
"We need to make sure that this extraordinary amount of information that we've got supports real-world people involved in drug interdiction better than it does now," he said.
General McCaffrey said he had briefed the Secretaries of State, Defense, Justice and Treasury on the idea, described it to the Congressional intelligence committees, and gotten the acting Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, to join him in leading a study group that is to design a new structure by this fall.
But other officials said there is already strong opposition to the idea, particularly in the Justice and Treasury Departments. Some officials in those agencies said they were concerned about protecting sensitive or confidential information, such as the details of continuing investigations or income-tax returns. Other officials said that to pool any of their information would be to cede power.
"Call me when it happens," one senior official said. "Something like that might work in the military, but those guys don't fight like they do in Washington."

Chart: "The Trail of Drug Corruption"
As Mexico's drug trade boomed, American officials received repeated warnings of high-level corruption among Mexican law-enforcement officials and politicians.
 
Dec. 1, 1988 -- Carlos Salinas de Gortari takes office as Mexico's President and promises to attack drug trafficking with renewed zeal.
 
January 1990 -- A Federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicts the former Mexican federal police chief and 18 others in the kidnapping, torture and murder of an American anti-drug agent, Enrique S. Camarena, in Guadalajara in 1985.
 
Fall 1991 -- A Mexican police commander, Guillermo Gonzalez Calderoni, begins a series of confidential interviews in which he tells American officials that high-level Mexicans, including the President's elder brother, Raul Salinas, are involved in drug-related corruption. After a long debate, American officials file the allegations away without further investigation.
 
November 1991 -- Mexican soldiers, apparently protecting a drug flight, gun down seven federal police agents who chase the traffickers with American radar assistance to a remote airstrip in the eastern state of Veracruz. Despite the evidence of military collusion with the traffickers, the United States Ambassador, John D. Negroponte, initially describes the incident "a regrettable accident."
 
April 1992 -- Mr. Salinas's Comptroller General, Mara Elena Vazquez Nava, tells the President of allegations that his elder brother, Raul, is involved in corrupt business activities. At the President's apparent insistence, Raul Salinas gives up his Government post and briefly leaves the country to take a research position at the University of California at San Diego.
 
March 1993 -- A convicted Mexican cocaine smuggler, Magdalena Ruiz Pelayo, begins offering testimony to American prosecutors. She claims that Mr. Salinas's father, for whom she says she once worked, has ties to drug traffickers.
 
Aug. 26, 1993 -- A top associate of one of Mexico's biggest cocaine traffickers, Juan Garcia Abrego, tells F.B.I. officials in Houston that his organization paid huge bribes to a Deputy Attorney General in charge of anti-drug efforts under Mr. Salinas, Javier Coello Trejo, and other senior Mexican law-enforcement officials.
 
Nov. 8, 1993 -- Mexican intelligence officers intercept telephone calls that reveal a relationship between Mr. Salinas's Communications and Transportation Minister, Emilio Gamboa Patron, and a woman under investigation as an associate of Mr. Garcia Abrego. Mr. Gamboa says the woman was a friend of his but denies any association with Mr. Garcia Abrego. The woman is also found to have carried on a long affair with Mr. Salinas's chief of staff, Jose Cordoba Montoya, but is never charged with wrongdoing.
 
Aug. 4, 1994 -- A Mexican federal police commander takes delivery of some eight tons of cocaine from a converted passenger jet that lands near the northern mining town of Sombrerete. The Deputy Attorney General in charge of anti-drug programs, Mario Ruiz Massieu, supervises an investigation that uncovers no wrongdoing.
 
Dec. 1, 1995 -- Ernesto Zedillo takes office as President, vowing to clean up Mexico's law-enforcement apparatus. Before his inauguration, an American diplomat gives his transition team a list of 18 current and former Mexican officials viewed as corrupt by the United States Embassy.
 
Feb. 28, 1995 -- Raul Salinas de Gortari is arrested on charges of having plotted the murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, his former brother-in-law and the brother of the deputy attorney general. Raul Salinas is later found to have stashed more than $120 million in foreign bank accounts under a false name, with Citibank transferring much of the money. Carlos Salinas subsequently leaves Mexico and goes into exile.
 
PUB-DATE: March 3, 1995
 
July 1996 -- Along with Magdalena Ruiz Pelayo, another convicted drug trafficker, Marco Enrique Torres, agrees to testify about drug payments made to Raul Salinas.
 
Feb. 6, 1997 -- General Gutierrez Rebollo, Mexico's newly appointed drug enforcement chief, is arrested in Mexico City and later charged with having secretly worked for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a powerful drug trafficker who was reported dead on July 5. (pg. A11)

Bonds Little Changed Before Price Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, as investors awaited a report on producer prices for new clues on inflation.
Investors were also hesitant to buy in the wake of the market's eight-day rally. 
 "We've gone too far too fast," said Tom Seay, who oversees about $750 million of bonds at the Lexington Management Corporation in Saddle Brook, N.J.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32 , to 100 27/32 , leaving the yield unchanged at 6.56 percent. Short maturities also showed little change. The yield on the two-year note remained at 5.88 percent.
Today's report on producer prices is expected to show that prices paid to factories, farms and other producers were unchanged in June after falling in May. Such data would reinforce the view that inflation continues to be tame.
"Inflation expectations have come down fairly significantly," said David Resler, an economist at Nomura Securities.
But if the report shows any unexpected strength in prices, bonds could fall sharply, analysts said. Investors are also awaiting reports next week on consumer prices and retail sales for more hints about inflation and consumer spending.
Traders took little comfort from a report yesterday showing a bigger- than-expected increase in jobless claims, since much of the gain was attributable to temporary midseason layoffs in the auto industry, economists said. Claims jumped by 40,000 last week to 377,000.
"It's a quirky number," said Van Siler, head of trading at Sanwa Securities (USA). "The economy is not weak enough to support this kind of one-week increase and the market took it that way."
Bonds were bound to pause, given the recent run-up in prices, he said. "We already have a lot of good news built into this market -- and it will take extraordinary good news" to drive it higher, he said. "The market is so far ahead of itself that it's going to be hard to sustain these levels."
Bonds came under some pressure as buyers were attracted by a flood of new corporate debt. Some $2 billion in corporate bonds were sold yesterday, led by a $1 billion global bond issue from the Philip Morris Companies.
Philip Morris sold the eight-year global notes, which are securities that are sold simultaneously in the United States, Europe and Asia, at a price to yield 7.052 percent -- or 81 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than a 10-year Treasury note.
The Philip Morris bonds are rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 12, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the previous day's trading in the credit markets misstated the difference in yields between an eight-year global note issued by the Philip Morris Companies and the 10-year Treasury note. The yield on the Philip Morris notes was 79 basis points higher when the notes were issued on Thursday, not 81 basis points. (A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.)

HEADLINE: China Isn't Lawbreaker in Campaign Scandal

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Not So Fast on Immunity" (editorial, July 9): The suggestion that confirmation of Chinese efforts to influence American elections should affect relations with China is misguided. It is naive to believe that China is the only country attempting to influence United States policies. In one form or another, I suspect that every major country recognizes America's economic power and, through lobbyists, contributions or other means, tries to affect policy. 
 Can we be indignant about Chinese activity when the United States, overtly or covertly, had done the same thing with dozens of countries to satisfy its foreign policy needs?
If laws were broken in the 1996 election, it is not China that broke them but Democrats and Republicans who accepted money and used it illegally. If laws were broken, prosecutors should determine this and not politicians who have motives beyond their efforts to find the truth.
Ultimately, campaign abuses and finance reform are phony issues. The millions that campaigns raise are spent mostly on 30- or 60-second television commercials. If voters cast their votes not on the basis of the candidates' records, but instead on the 30-second commercials between "Seinfeld" and "Suddenly Susan," then we deserve what we get.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark, Aided in Part by Strong Pound

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to its highest level against the mark in five and a half years yesterday, buoyed indirectly by a sharp rise in the British pound against the mark.
The pound, which failed to get much mileage out of the Bank of England's decision to raise official British interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, soared above 3 marks yesterday, its highest since October 1990.
 
 The pound was supported by an article in The Times of London that suggested the currency could rise as high as 3.30 marks, last seen in January 1989, and by expectations of higher British interest rates.
 "The idea of further rate hikes in the U.K. is making sterling an extremely bullish currency," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York. "And the dollar is getting a lot of help against the mark from the rise in sterling."
 The dollar settled in New York at 1.7744 marks, its high for the day and strongest level since December 1991, up 1.3 percent from its 1.7515-mark rate yesterday and up 15.1 percent for the year. The dollar also rose to 114.02 yen, from 113.18 yen. The pound climbed to $1.6946 from $1.6886 -- the highest level against the dollar since Jan. 9.
The weakness in the mark came even after Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said yesterday that the country's total public sector deficit would fall to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, allowing Germany to meet criteria for the single currency, the euro. But analysts remain skeptical of Germany's ability to insure a strong euro.
 Comparatively robust growth in Britain and the United States, along with expectations that the mark will be replaced by a weak euro, has fueled active buying of pounds and dollars for marks.
 The Producer Price Index in the United States declined by one-tenth of 1 percent in June. The benign inflation data bolstered stocks and bonds.
"The U.S. economy just looks too good to be true, especially when you hold it up against what's going on in Germany with its high unemployment," said Ben Strauss of Bank Julius Baer. "From everything we're seeing, it looks like the euro will be a very weak currency."

HEADLINE: Clinton Makes Also-Ran Feel Like Winner

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, July 11

 BODY:
President Clinton came to Romania today to console a nation he had blocked from joining NATO in its first round of expansion. But it turned out that he did not have to work very hard.
Despite dashing Romania's hopes, Mr. Clinton received a rapturous welcome from tens of thousands of buoyant Romanians longing for a boost into the prosperity and security of the West. 
 In University Square, where demonstrators protested the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, and where students were killed by rampaging miners in 1990, the mood was like a rollicking party as people stood for hours in the sun for a glimpse of the first American President to visit here since Gerald R. Ford in 1975.
When President Emil Constantinescu appeared with Mr. Clinton and pulled his hand up in a victory salute, the joyous throngs waved their arms aloft in exultation, as if at a rock concert. Even the first chords of the American national anthem brought a sea of hands raised in a victory sign.
Mr. Clinton, clearly delighted, said: "I am proud to be the first American President to visit a free Romania. I am proud to stand in University Square, where so many have sacrificed for freedom."
He promised that Romania's time to join the Western military alliance would come if the country continued on the path of political and economic change.
"I welcome Romania's deep desire to contribute even more fully to Europe's security and strength," Mr. Clinton said. "I welcome your desire to join NATO. I want that too -- for Europe, for America and for you. And I say to you today: Stay the course, and Romania will cross that milestone."
The seven-month-old Romanian Government -- the first to be led by political figures with no ties to the ex-Communists since 1989, when Mr. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed -- had campaigned extensively for inclusion in NATO. France in particular had taken up Romania's cause.
But at the insistence of President Clinton, only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were invited to join now. The best Romania achieved at the NATO summit meeting in Madrid this week was special mention, along with Slovenia, as an aspiring member.
But many in the crowd said they knew their nation's aspirations had been a long shot. And after years of suffering under Mr. Ceausescu, of experiencing the violent revolution of 1989 and then seeing a Communist successor hang on until last year, they were content to cling to Mr. Clinton's visit as a sign that something better was to come.
"Clin-ton! Clin-ton!" the thousands cheered deliriously, at other moments erupting in chants of "NA-TO! NA-TO!" with more gusto than the crowd that gathered to see Mr. Clinton on Thursday in Warsaw to celebrate Poland's new ties with the alliance.
"I like Americans because they are strong," said Corina Panait, 19, "because they have power in their economy and their politics. I hope that power can be given to us."
Anca Dobrian, 32, said she believed that "Americans will keep their word" and accept Romania into NATO in several years. She said she wanted Romania to join the alliance as much for economic reasons as for security. "I think this will be a guarantee of Western investment," she said.
The United States blocked Romania from joining because it has only been since the election last year of Mr. Constantinescu, a former geology professor, that the former Communist country has truly stepped onto the path of reforms followed by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and American officials say it is too early to determine that the embrace of democracy and market economics is irreversible.
But today Mr. Clinton told the crowds, "Romania is one of the strongest candidates, and if you stay the course and manifest the love of liberty we all see here today, there can be no stronger candidates."
If Mr. Constantinescu is disappointed, he did not show it. He used Mr. Clinton's appearance to rally Romanians for the push toward a market economy, calling the President's presence "one more proof that our country, reborn by sacrifice, now has strong and truthful friends."
Promising market reforms, he said, "We are not going to stop, because the vast majority of the Romanian people wants to live in a stable and prosperous country."
Mr. Clinton underscored the same message. "In the short term, I know there are costs to this market reform," he said, "but in the long term the rewards are far greater."
Romania's break with Communism was the most violent of the 1989 rebellions in the former Soviet bloc. Security forces opened fire on demonstrators in Timisoara, leaving hundreds to be buried in mass graves. Here in Bucharest, troops shot demonstrators near the site of today's jubilation.
As he came into the square, Mr. Clinton bowed his head and lingered a moment where white stone crosses mark the deaths. And when he was leaving, he was presented with a blue yellow and red flag of Romania with a gaping hole in its center where the Communist crest once was. To cheers, Mr. Clinton unfurled it. Then he plunged into the crowds campaign-style and Romanians scrambled to clutch his hand.

HEADLINE: Cambodia: Quandary for Diplomats

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, July 11

 BODY:
As foreign governments began to cut their aid programs to Cambodia as punishment for the coup carried out last weekend by Hun Sen, embassies here received a surprising letter today from Parliament.
To help repair the damage caused by the fighting, the letter read, "We appeal to you to give us humanitarian assistance, either financial or material." 
 It was an extraordinary plea, coming just days after a power grab that appeared to spell the end of the democratic government and liberal society that the same countries had joined to foster here four years ago at the cost of $2 billion.
"This is insulting now," a European diplomat said. "They've destroyed everything and now they are asking us, 'Can you pay for it?' I wonder if any embassy will be crazy enough to send anything."
That choice may be easy. Much more difficult is the decision that now faces the international community over how to respond in the longer term to the ouster by Mr. Hun Sen of his rival and Co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
In two days of heavy fighting, Mr. Hun Sen's troops defeated soldiers loyal to Prince Ranariddh, who was abroad at the time. Now Mr. Hun Sen says Prince Ranariddh will be arrested if he returns home, and the Prince is appealing to foreign governments to support his right to his elected office.
"It's a real quandary how to play this," another diplomat said. The coup is a fait accompli, he said, and there is virtually no realistic possibility of the Prince's resuming his political role in Cambodia.
"It's very difficult to see a satisfactory, principled solution that is also beneficial to the people of Cambodia," the diplomat said.
The problem, he said, is how to avoid endorsing the coup while finding a way to foster the most democratic and least repressive future for the country.
A consensus has already emerged that the first step is to condemn and to punish, to underscore the world's refusal to accept the overthrow of a leader chosen in 1993 by an election arranged and paid for by the United Nations.
Already, the United States, Japan and Germany have announced the suspension of aid programs, and Australia is considering a similar move. The United States, other countries and the United Nations have made strong statements of concern.
In Washington today, Prince Ranariddh met members of Congress and State Department officials to ask for an indefinite suspension of American aid to his country beyond the 30 days announced on Thursday.
The Prince also promised that if he regained authority, he would not bring the Khmer Rouge into Government, telling Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering, "I have nothing to do with the Khmer Rouge, and I will not bring them into positions of power," according to the department spokesman, Nicholas Burns.
Asked if the United States believed Prince Ranariddh's pledge, Mr. Burns replied, "What means more than words is deeds."
What the State Department calls Prince Ranariddh's flirtation with the Khmer Rouge has been a problem for Washington as it seeks to support diplomatic efforts to end the crisis in Cambodia.
Later, at a news conference here, Prince Ranariddh said: "I don't have any interest in flirting with the Khmer Rouge. I do not need the Khmer Rouge. We do not need to negotiate with them any more."
In a gesture of no confidence, the United States, Australia and a number of Asian and European countries are evacuating many of their citizens, and the United States Embassy is moving to reduce its staff from 61 people to 20.
But if Cambodia is to be helped from sliding into civil war or coming under the grip of a repressive dictatorship, the next steps are more delicate.
How is the world, which has made such an investment in Cambodian democracy, to continue to uphold its ideals without pushing Mr. Hun Sen into a corner by treating him as a pariah?
One diplomat responded with a series of questions of his own.
"How long can the international community continue to support Ranariddh's right to his elected position?" he said. "If we continue to support Ranariddh, how will that benefit Cambodia? But if we do not support him, it seems an explicit acknowledgment of the failure of the international intervention in Cambodia."
He added, "We are in a bit of a pickle at the moment."
Several diplomats made the point that the heroes and villains here were far from clear-cut. The coup was the culmination of months of infighting and military buildup on both sides during which scant attention was paid to the business of government.
Most of the country's budget -- nearly half of which comes from international donations -- was drained away by corruption and the creation of personal armies.
"Both Prime Ministers must take responsibility for failing the nation," a diplomat said. "You have to ask the question: Did either of them really care about the people as they proceeded with their grandstanding and sniping at each other and jostling for position?"
There seems to be little enthusiasm among diplomats here for the economic sanctions that have been proposed by some politicians abroad.
Already the economy is beginning to suffer from the abrupt halt in tourism and the closing -- whether temporary or long-term -- of the foreign enterprises that began to bring employment to a nation made up largely of subsistence farmers.
The shutdown of several garment factories on the western outskirts of the city has already cost the jobs of some 6,000 people, mostly young women who have become the economic support of their families.
With its Government barely functioning, Cambodia has become inordinately dependent on foreign aid programs, from orphanages to legal aid centers to irrigation projects.
Though these programs provide a lifeline for many Cambodians, governments may be reluctant to keep them going.
"Quite frankly," the European diplomat said, "I think it will be difficult to persuade governments to keep pouring good money after bad."

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumption Tax Won't Increase Savings

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bruce Bartlett's assertion that the low saving rate in the United States could be increased by enacting a Federal tax on consumption (Op-Ed, July 6), while seemingly sound theoretically, is at odds with what data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show would be the case. 
 Studies of the O.E.C.D. countries -- most of which rely heavily on consumption taxes -- indicate that there is no relationship between a country's saving rate and the extent to which it uses consumption taxes. Moreover, these studies also show that changes in the use of consumption taxes by those countries bear no relationship to changes in their saving rates.
However, the studies do show that the more a country relies on consumption taxes to raise revenue, the higher that country's government spending tends to be -- a relationship that I would think Mr. Bartlett and Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would find quite disturbing.

HEADLINE: William Welch, Cardiologist And Radio Host, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Dr. William J. Welch, who practiced internal medicine and cardiology for many years in New York City and who was the former host of a radio advice program, died on Thursday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
The cause was lung cancer, his family said. 
 While Dr. Welch remained up to date with medical developments and was an associate of leading doctors in New York City, he took an old-fashioned approach to his practice, even going on middle-of-the-night house calls.
From 1955 to 1981, when he retired, he was in private practice in New York City, after five years in Princeton, N.J. Among his patients were the clarinetist Benny Goodman, the painter Ben Shahn, the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and Mayor Robert F. Wagner.
Besides maintaining his practice, Dr. Welch, who was affiliated with Doctors Hospital, was an associate professor of clinical medicine at New York University Medical Center. In the 1960's, he was medical director of the New York Cardiac Center in Yonkers, and from 1967 to 1969, he was president of the New York Heart Association.
In the 1950's and 60's, Dr. Welch wrote "Dr. Welch Says," a syndicated newspaper column on medical issues, and conducted "Ask Dr. Welch," a call-in radio program.
In an autobiography, "What Happened in Between: A Doctor's Story" (Braziller, 1972), he wrote of the enduring importance of house calls in an era when many physicians would contend that "instrumental medicine can only be instituted in a setting that corresponds to modern technology."
He said: "Even a doctor who is a wizard cannot always be sure, from the message he receives, how sick the patient is. He only knows that there is trouble at the other end of the phone, a human being in distress. If it is not crystal clear that the difficulty can be resolved or deferred -- both from the human as well as the economic consideration -- it can best be settled by a house call."
In later life, Dr. Welch helped create the Emily Davie and Joseph S. Kornfeld Foundation, which focuses on medicine and human dignity, particularly at the end of life. Dr. Welch was also instrumental in the founding of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia.
William Welch was born on Sept. 12, 1911, in Eau Claire, Wis., where he grew up. He graduated from Yale College in 1933 and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in 1942.
He is survived by his wife, Louise Michel Welch, his daughter, Anne-Louise Jacquemin, and his stepdaughter, Martha Welch de Llosa, all of Manhattan; his stepson, Dr. Richard S. Crampton of Charlottesville, Va., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Producer Report Sends Treasury Prices Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to its lowest level in more than seven months after the Government reported that prices at the producer level fell for a record sixth consecutive month.
A rise in the dollar in foreign-exchange markets also bolstered Treasury prices yesterday. A stronger dollar means that dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities become more attractive to foreign investors. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to 101 10/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.52 percent, from 6.56 percent on Thursday and the lowest since 6.49 percent on Dec. 9, 1996.
Bonds gained after the Labor Department reported that its Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of 1 percent in June. The decline in the index was led by a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent in food prices, as prices of almost every major food product fell.
Excluding food, prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent because of an increase of seven-tenths of a percent in energy prices, which were led by a 1.8 percent gain in natural gas prices.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said, "The six straight months of declines left the P.P.I. one-tenth of 1 percent below the level of a year ago, a remarkable turnaround from the end of 1996, when the P.P.I. was running about 3 percent."
"The drop in food prices can work as a double-edged sword," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. "While holding down inflation, it frees up purchasing power for other goods and services that are more closely related to economic activity."
Mr. Palash noted that excluding food and energy, inflation at the manufacturers' level was modest, rising one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
Next week, the market turns its attention to reports on retail sales on Tuesday and consumer prices on Wednesday.
Mr. Palash said the modest trend was likely to be seen in the June Consumer Price Index. He forecast that it would be up one-tenth of a percent over all, and up two-tenths of a percent at the core.
"The better purchasing power should show up in the June retail sales, up five-tenths of a percent over all," he said.
Given the outlook for low inflation, even a strong retail sales report is unlikely to do much damage to the market, analysts said.
"The Fed apparently is tolerating faster growth and low unemployment as long as inflation stays low," Mr. Palash said, "so from where we are now a rate hike in August looks unlikely."

HEADLINE: Cities, Once on Fiscal Ropes, Rebound Strongly

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: HUNTSVILLE, Ala., July 9

 BODY:
Six years ago, municipal officials in Huntsville, as in most other American cities, were spending cheerless days trying to suture a budget that was gushing red ink. The shiny new police cars authorized in the 1990-91 budget? Gone. The parks improvements and new garbage trucks? Same story. The new computers, street sweepers and expanded bus routes? Maybe next year.
These days, by contrast, the problem at Huntsville City Hall is how to spend a $5 million midyear surplus in the city's $90 million general fund budget. Just outside the building, meanwhile, a new art museum, paid for in part with city money, is rising on a corner. A new history museum is being built on another. The city just finished expanding its convention center. It has opened three new fire stations. Roads are being widened and repaved. And despite the spending spree, the city has more than doubled the size of its reserve fund. 
 The fiscal revival here mirrors that in other cities, large and small, all around the country. Just a few years after cities were devastated by a vicious nationwide recession and deep cuts in state and Federal aid, many local governments have recovered quite nicely thanks to strong economic growth and conservative fiscal practices.
In an annual survey released this week by the National League of Cities, more than two-thirds of 338 responding cities reported that they would be better able to meet their financial needs in the current fiscal year than in the previous one. It was the fifth consecutive year that the percentage had increased.
Perhaps most significant, the study found that cities seemed to be learning the painful lessons taught by the last two recessions and the demise of Federal and state revenue sharing. Rather than spending all of the bounty produced by the current recovery, cities are salting away a significant share to prepare for the next downturn. According to the study, the average city in 1996 held reserves equal to 16 percent of its annual spending, up from 10 percent in 1992.
"They're getting smart," said Michael A. Pagano, the political scientist from Miami University in Ohio who compiled the report for the National League of Cities. "They really have come to an understanding that they're out there on their own for the most part."
Although the recovery is far from universal -- it is strongest in the South and weakest in the Northeast -- the survey found many indicators of improving fiscal health. In general, it concluded that more cities were now taking steps to increase spending than to raise revenue.
Fifty-six percent of the cities responding to the survey said they had increased spending on capital projects this fiscal year, while 55 percent said they had increased the rate of growth in spending on operations -- running the government and providing city services.
"We see a continuing trend of cities having the ability to meet their financial needs and in many cases provide additional services," said Mark Schwartz, a City Council member in Oklahoma City and the president of the National League of Cities. "During the recession, we were mowing the parks in Oklahoma City every eight weeks, which was just terrible. Now we're doing it as often as every other week."
Only 12 percent of cities cut capital spending this year, and only 9 percent reduced the rate of growth in spending on operations. In 1992, when city budgets were bearing the worst effects of the recession, 61 percent of cities reduced capital spending and 72 percent cut their operating budgets.
The study found that more than a third of cities -- 36 percent -- increased the size of their work forces this year and more than a fourth -- 29 percent -- increased the level of city services. Only 16 percent of cities cut their work forces and only 4 percent reduced city services. In 1991, 38 percent of cities reduced employment and 18 percent reduced services.
At the same time, the percentage of cities taking new steps to raise revenue -- like increasing taxes or fees -- has dropped to the lowest level in 10 years, the study found. This year, 21 percent of cities raised property tax rates, compared with 38 percent in 1991. Thirty-two percent of cities increased fees and other charges this year, compared with 78 percent in 1991.
Here in Huntsville, home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal, the economy softened modestly in the early 1990's because of the national economic downturn and cuts in military spending.
Now this north Alabama city of 172,000 is experiencing something of a boom in the high technology and electronics industries. Unemployment, which was 4.8 percent in 1991, is hovering just above 2 percent, and median family income jumped to $50,200 last year from $41,100 in 1991. Sales tax receipts, which account for half of city revenues, are up more than 7 percent over last year.
The new money will enable city workers to cut the grass on highway medians 12 times this year, up from 3 times last year. New communications towers built last year have eliminated gaps in the radio system used by the police, firefighters and emergency technicians. Ground was just broken on a new public safety building, and the police have started new programs that provide anti-drug education in the schools and more beat officers in low-income neighborhoods.
"I feel like the city is as sound as it's ever been from an economic standpoint," said Mayor Loretta P. Spencer, who took office last year in the midst of the good times.
Although New York City was not included in the National League of Cities survey, Randy Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations, said tax revenues in 1997 had exceeded projections by $1 billion, largely because of "an exceptional year on Wall Street."
The revenue bonanza contributed to a surplus of $1.3 billion in the city's $33.4 billion budget for the year that ended on June 30. City officials hope to use the money this fiscal year to close future shortfalls, increase spending for schools and law enforcement, and pay for tax cuts, Mr. Mastro said.
Los Angeles, by contrast, continues to see modest declines in tax revenues, said Richard Alatorre, chairman of the City Council's budget committee. Mr. Alatorre said his city's recovery was just beginning, largely because Southern California had been so hurt by the loss of thousands of high-paying aerospace jobs.
Los Angeles, which still has a hiring freeze in city jobs, has eliminated 3,000 such jobs in three years. Many city departments have cut their budgets by at least 5 percent, leading to neglect in many city parks and reductions in programs for inner-city children, Mr. Alatorre said.
Despite the relative health of most city budgets, many municipal officials said they continued to suffer from reductions in state and Federal aid. They are wary of the trickle-down effect of Federal cuts in welfare, and of possible cuts to come in Medicare and Social Security. They also said they still had broad needs for improvements in law enforcement, education and infrastructure.
But bond rating firms are encouraged that, despite those needs, cities have had the discipline to increase their reserve funds. Moody's Investors Service is now raising ratings on general obligation bonds four times more often than it is lowering them. During the recession, the reverse was true.
"We're seeing a very healthy level of surplus," said George W. Leung, managing director of public finance for Moody's. "It reflects six straight years of economic health after the recession. And they are being more prudent in their budget practices."

HEADLINE: National Baptist Leader Denies Misconduct Accusations

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., July 11

 BODY:
Henry J. Lyons, the Baptist leader, and his wife, Deborah, presented a united front today as he denied the accusations of adultery and financial impropriety that have swirled around him since Mrs. Lyons was arrested in connection with the fire set to the lavish home her husband owned with another woman.
At a news conference at the church that he has led for 26 years, Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church, Mr. Lyons denied having an extramarital relationship or using any money from the denomination or his church to secure a loan on the $700,000 house he bought last year. 
 He co-owns both the house and a 1987 Rolls-Royce with Bernice V. Edwards, 40, the National Baptist Convention's public relations director for corporate affairs, whom he described today as "a close friend of my family for several years and a business partner of mine."
Surrounded by his wife, their three adult children, National Baptist Convention officials and pastors from his and other local churches, Mr. Lyons, 55, refused to answer questions, promising "a detailed report" only to his congregation at a closed meeting tonight and to the Convention's board of directors at a meeting next week at the denomination headquarters in Nashville.
Mr. Lyons is also president of the largest black denomination in the county, the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.
He portrayed himself as a victim of slander and lashed out at reporters for begrudging him the opportunity to live well.
"I'm proud I've enjoyed some financial success," he said, his remarks punctuated by applause and a chorus of "amens" from more than 100 church members. "What are you trying to imply? That blacks in this country cannot be successful?"
The United States Attorney's Office in Tampa said this week that in 1991, Mr. Lyons was investigated for Federal bank fraud but was not charged because he agreed to serve one year of probation under a pretrial diversion program and to pay $85,000 in restitution to a bank. Ms. Edwards was convicted in 1994 of conspiring to embezzle about $60,000 in Federal money from an alternative school that she directed in Milwaukee, a crime for which she completed probation and paid restitution.
Mr. Lyons's private life was not publicly scrutinized until last Sunday, when the house that he co-owned with Ms. Edwards was set on fire, sustaining about $30,000 in damages. Pinellas County Sheriff's Department officials said Mrs. Lyons, 49, confessed to the crime, saying that she accidentally discovered the home's existence and became upset when she found her husband's clothing and belongings inside.
Although Mrs. Lyons has since recanted, the incident started a barrage of publicity about the Lyonses' spending on homes, cars and other property. Mr. Lyons, who was in Africa on church-related business with Ms. Edwards when the fire was set, returned here last Thursday. Today, he said the house was used as a corporate guesthouse to receive national and international church visitors "in a private setting."
"I categorically deny that Miss Bernice Edwards and I were carrying on an affair," he said. "There are no hidden secrets between my wife and myself."
The controversy tarnishes the reputation of a prominent church leader known for his fiery preaching, successful fund-raising, political clout and advocacy of mentoring programs and economic self-sufficiency. President Clinton spoke at the Convention's annual gathering in Orlando last year, and the First Lady has spoken at Mr. Lyons's church.
But those hearing his remarks today expressed mixed feelings about the pastor. Some said they would withhold judgment until he explained himself, while others viewed him skeptically.
"I heard a lot of evading," said Mary Calloway, 57, a private schoolteacher who said her family attends Bethel Metropolitan occasionally. "If he doesn't share that house, why are his clothes there? Why isn't his wife's name on the deed?"
Mr. Lyons, whose term as Convention president does not expire until 1999, seemed confident that he could weather the storm. "As the head of my family and head of this church and president of the National Baptist Convention, I'll continue to work to raise standards for African-American people," he said.
Mr. Lyons said his most immediate concern was the healing of his family and dealing with the criminal charges against Mrs. Lyons, who has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of arson and burglary for entering the house without permission. Today, Mrs. Lyons stood by his side, sometimes looking at him intently, at other times listening to his words with eyes closed and nodding.
Some of those present urged forgiveness. "We all fall short of the glory of God," said Karen O'Neal, a nurse. "God didn't say that a pastor can't make money."

HEADLINE: Union Plan Sees Buyouts Saving Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
New York City's largest union of hospital workers has proposed an innovative deal that would use at least $100 million from its pension plan to offer early retirement incentives for older workers as a means of guaranteeing job security for younger ones.
The union, 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, has made the proposal to Mount Sinai, Columbia-Presbyterian and 28 other nonprofit hospitals because it fears the city's financially squeezed hospitals will make large-scale layoffs when its current contract expires next June 30. 
 "There is no need to lay off the health-care workers who are presently working," said Dennis Rivera, 1199's president. "Our polls show that 10 to 15 percent of our members are either going to retire in the next three years or can be encouraged to retire early, and if that happens we should be able to provide job security to the remaining workers."
The older workers would be offered a lump sum payment of $20,000 to retire early.
Bruce McIver, president of the League of Voluntary Hospitals, the hospitals' bargaining group, appeared receptive to the idea and did not immediately reject it. But he said the hospitals were still studying the proposal and he did not have a "clear sense of how this thing will go."
"The union's big concern is the expiration of the employment security provisions on June 30," he said "But everything in this world has a price."
Mr. McIver said he wanted to make sure the proposal did not take too much money out of the pension plan, forcing the hospitals to contribute more. He emphasized that the union's proposal needed management approval because the pension plan is jointly managed by the hospitals and the union.
The union's current four-year contract gives unusually strong anti-layoff protections to all employees hired before September 1992.
Mr. Rivera, whose union represents 36,000 nurses aides, food workers and others at the 30 hospitals, said health-care experts have said those institutions need to reduce their work force by 5,000 to 10,000 employees to survive in an era when the rise of managed care is squeezing hospitals.
He predicted that 4,000 to 5,000 workers would take advantage of the plan and that that, along with attrition, would make further layoffs unnecessary.
But Mr. McIver said, "This proposal would obviously minimize the need for layoffs to a certain degree, but I don't think it could prevent layoffs."
When 1199 negotiated the current contract three years ago, it agreed to a far smaller version of the same plan, taking $10 million from the pension fund to finance 500 early retirements. In that agreement, the union allowed the hospitals to reduce their contributions to an employee benefits plan because it included millions of dollars of excess contributions.
Harold Loeb of Buck Consultants, a specialist in employee benefit plans, said many companies use pension plan surpluses to encourage employees to take early retirement by offering them more generous pension benefits.
But Mr. Loeb said it was much rarer for companies and unions to agree to take money from overfunded pension plans and use that to finance lump-sum payments as incentives for early retirement.
According to Mr. Rivera, his plan would include more incentives than a $20,000 lump sum. It would provide health insurance for those who take early retirement and, for those who retire early, it would shorten the number of years needed to qualify for a full pension.
Mr. Rivera said, "We have the eighth-largest institutional pension fund in the country, and we want to use it to eliminate the pressure on the hospitals to lay off people. In return, we'll have better morale in the institutions and greater job security for those who remain."
His union is widely respected for negotiating innovative contracts, like the current one in which the workers won strong job security in exchange for a one-year wage freeze and a cut in the hospitals' contributions to their benefit plans.
That contract states that for workers hired before September 1992, there could be layoffs only if hospitals close. If a hospital says layoffs are needed because of poor fiscal conditions, a council of labor and management representatives is to negotiate any layoffs.
Mr. Rivera said he was also pressing the hospitals to extend the same solid job protections to workers hired after September 1992. Under the current contract, workers hired after that date can be laid off, but if they lose their jobs, they are entitled to supplementary unemployment benefits, health insurance and free job retraining. In addition, they are promised the first jobs when positions become available at hospitals covered by the contract.
As part of the deal, the union also wants the hospitals to agree to a plan in which thousands of workers in the hospitals' fastest growing segment -- walk-in clinics -- would join the union.
In an unusual move, the union has prepared a glossy brochure arguing that it is important to negotiate a new contract long before the current one expires. It says that the union has to take further steps to protect job security in light of hospital mergers, shorter hospital stays, the rise of managed care organizations and cuts in Medicaid and Medicare.
"Our worst fears have come to be reality with recent developments," says the brochure, which seeks to mobilize the workers to fight for continued job security.
Mr. Rivera said he hopes to negotiate a new contract by the end of this month, but Mr. McIver said there was no need to set a deadline so long before the current contract expires.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Drop Again; Inflation, for Now, Has Died

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Prices paid by producers fell for a record sixth consecutive month, the Government reported today, in the strongest sign yet that inflation has virtually disappeared from the American industrial landscape.
Despite a robust economy, little if any inflation was visible anywhere in the production pipeline, with raw materials, partly processed materials and finished goods all fetching prices lower in June than they did a year earlier. It was one of the few times in the 50-year history of the Producer Price Index that inflation had been so thoroughly subdued and particularly remarkable because the unemployment rate is only 5 percent, close to its lowest levels in a quarter century. In the past, inflation has generally disappeared among manufacturers and other producers only during recessions or when the economy has been especially weak. 
 Perhaps because it was simply a further extension of recent trends, the report generated only a muted response in the financial markets. Interest rates on long-term bonds retreated slightly while the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.06 points to climb back over the 7,900 mark.
Moreover, many experts believe the economy will rebound during the second half of the year, which might cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates just to be sure that inflation remains subdued.
"It is time to call in Sherlock Holmes, for we now have the case of the missing inflation," said Joel L. Naroff, a senior economist in Philadelphia for the First Union Bank. "If anyone can find it, it has to be Holmes -- for the Bureau of Labor Statistics has completely lost the scent." Some economists called the absence of inflation a long-overdue payoff for years of painful corporate downsizing and restructuring that cost many people their jobs.
"There's been this enormous structural change as firms continue to cut costs while profits are high -- and that's never happened before," said James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago-NBD. "We've become the most competitive economy in the world."
A variety of forces account for the utter lack of industrial inflation at a time when the economy has been growing at such a healthy clip, economists said. Among them are the inroads made by cheap foreign goods, low labor costs, a stronger dollar and the falling price of oil. Above all, though, they point to corporate revamping, driven by an increasingly competitive marketplace and unrelenting pressure on corporate executives to deliver better results to shareholders.
These pressures have forced managers to continue to pursue increased efficiency, requiring a lot of investment in new machinery and technology that has helped raise the nation's industrial capacity and prevented strong demand from creating the bottlenecks and supply squeezes that in the past often led to higher prices. Even though the economy is in its seventh year of uninterrupted growth, American industry operated in May at 83.7 percent of capacity, well below the 85 percent level often associated with price pressures.
While consumer prices continue to advance at a slow pace, most of that increase is coming from the service sector, where such forces are not as pronounced.
Given the difficulty of raising prices of most goods, the economy appears to be able to operate at a lower level of unemployment without producing higher inflation.
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Nationsbanc Capital Markets in New York, has been one of those who expected inflation to remain under control and now, he says, "more and more people are becoming convinced that you can have healthy growth without generating inflation."
And labor costs, which account for more than two-thirds of the average company's outlays, are not being driven up by the tight labor market because improved productivity has neutralized such pressure.
Rather than passing on higher costs, companies try to preserve profits by holding the line on wages and benefits while seeking a larger share of their markets, doing so typically by raising output and charging attractively low prices.
"For the foreseeable future, inflation is dead," said Paul Huard, senior vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
In June, according to today's report, the Producer Price Index for finished goods edged down one-tenth of 1 percent to bring the drop for the first half of the year to an annual rate of 3.4 percent. This reversed an equal increase in the second half of 1996.
An increase in the price of energy, the first this year, roughly offset a decline in food, with "core" finished goods that exclude these volatile items up one-tenth of 1 percent.
Mystifying some analysts, the price of computers climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in June, a category that has long been one of the biggest sources of price restraints. But that was clearly an aberration. For the last 12 months, computer prices dropped 21.5 percent, the report showed. Other industries that have produced significant year-over-year price declines include the paper industry and oil refining.
Other sizable annual declines included 22.3 percent for fresh fruits and melons, 17.2 percent for eggs. 4.9 percent for dairy products, 5.9 percent for gasoline, 2.3 percent for household appliances, 2.4 percent for autos and 3 percent for heavy trucks.
Among the larger increases were 30.4 percent for roasted coffee, 4.2 percent for machinery used in oil and gas fields, 4.8 percent for beef and veal and 3.6 percent for tobacco products.
Goods at the intermediate stage of production, like a bolt of cloth or sack of flour, were unchanged during June and four-tenths of 1 percent lower over the latest 12 months.
Nondurable items, like paperboard, used in factories showed no overall change. However, durables used in manufacturing, like refined copper, rose three-tenths of 1 percent and rose more than twice as much in the first half of the year as they fell in the second half of 1996.
As for raw materials, officially called crude goods, their decline was 3.3 percent for June and 5.4 percent over the latest 12 months. Crude items other than food and energy advanced four-tenths of 1 percent last month.

A Promoter of Democracy Stirs Up Authoritarians
George Soros's foundations have lavished vast sums on promoting democracy in the former Communist world. His operation in Belarus has been suspended because of hostility from President Aleksandr Lukashenko, but Mr. Soros has vowed not to back down. 1
 
Romanians Cheer Clinton
President Clinton was greeted warmly by Romanians despite having blocked their country from joining NATO in the first round of expansion. He vowed that they would join the military alliance if they continued reforms initiated by President Emil Constaninescu, with whom he appeared in Bucharest. 3
 
A Senate Signal on Bosnia
The Senate approved a military authorization bill that sent a clear signal that it wants ground troops out of Bosnia by June 30, as President Clinton has promised. But unlike the House, the Senate did not cut off aid for the peacekeeping mission. In Bosnia, security for the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, and other senior officials was increased to protect them from any further attempts by NATO troops to arrest those charged with war crimes. 3
 
5 Shot in West Belfast
Unidentified men in a Catholic section of Belfast shot two police officers and three British army soldiers on patrol. The wounded were taken to hospitals but were not gravely hurt, the police said. The Irish Republican Army did not claim responsibility for the shooting, which came a day after Protestant Orange Order officials agreed not to stage their patriotic marches in Catholic areas. 3
 
Rwanda Undermines Kabila
Rwandan officials have taken credit not just for supporting but for planning and directing the insurrection that ousted the dictator Mobutu See Seko from the giant neighboring country formerly known as Zaire. The claims were surprising because Rwanda was not expected to undermine the political position of Laurent Kabila, who is now President of the country he renamed Congo. Mr. Kabila's critics have often described him as a puppet of Rwanda. 5
 
Cambodia Seeks More Aid
The United States and several other nations suspended aid to Cambodia, but their embassies in Phnom Penh received requests from the new de facto government of Hun Sen for financial help. Despite an international consensus to condemn Mr. Hun Sen's coup, diplomats considered it a fait accompli and lamented the apparent failure of a $2 billion effort to foster democracy. 5
 
Sierra Leone Under Pressure
The Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies suspended Sierra Leone's membership until the junta that seized power in May is replaced by an elected government. The civilian President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, fled the country after a coup led by Maj. Johnny Paul Koromah. (Reuters)

House Ends All Arts Funds, Threatening Interior Bill
A day after voting to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts, the House stripped the agency of its remaining $10 million to cover shutdown costs. That vote and another on limiting road-building subsidies for logging companies raised fears among some House members that the Interior Department spending bill, which includes the arts endowment, would become hostage to disgruntled factions. 1

No Ruling on Huang Immunity
A testy, three-hour meeting between lawyers for John Huang, the central figure in the Democratic fund-raising scandal, and lawyers for the Senate committee investigating campaign finance abuses ended with Republican and Democratic counsels clashing over whether Mr. Huang should be granted immunity to testify. No decision was made. 1

Revival in Nation's Cities
Local governments have apparently recovered from nationwide recession and deep cuts in state and Federal aid thanks to strong economic growth and conservative fiscal practices. In an annual survey released this week by the National League of Cities, more than two-thirds of 338 responding cities reported that they would be better able to meet their financial needs in the current fiscal year than in the previous one. 1
 
New Spinal Surgery Tried
Researchers in Florida performed the nation's first transplant of fetal tissue into a person with a spinal cord injury, an effort that they hope will pioneer a new approach to arresting and possibly reversing disability. 9

Court Bars Term Limits
The Massachusetts Supreme Court struck down the state's term limits law barring politicians from seeking re-election after two terms in office. The court unanimously ruled that the law, which was enacted by voters in a 1994 referendum, was unconstitutional. 6

Gephardt Urges Investment
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, pushing for an economic policy distinct from the Clinton Administration's and one he could banner as a Presidential candidate, said in an interview that he is comfortable with the budget being in only "rough balance" because the nation's top priority should be investment and growth. 8

Union Offers Plan to Expand Job Security to All Workers
New York City's largest union of hospital workers has proposed an innovative deal that would use at least $100 million from its pension plan to offer early retirement incentives for older workers as a means of guaranteeing job security for younger workers. 23

Hotel Executive Sentenced
A former executive of the ITT Sheraton Corporation was sentenced to 15 months in prison for taking "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in kickbacks from a produce wholesaler, according to Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The executive, Richard Nicoletti, a 46-year-old Queens resident, was responsible for buying fruits and vegetables for several hotels in New York and New Jersey that are owned by ITT Sheraton, including the St. Regis in Manhattan. 25

Donald J. Trump said he had decided to sell one of his Atlantic City casinos. Mr. Trump, whose company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, owns 3 of the 12 casinos in Atlantic City, predicted that he could sell Trump Plaza for as much as $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Faults Effort To Balance the Budget

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Pushing for an economic policy distinct from the Clinton Administration's and one he could banner as a Presidential candidate, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, says it is all right if the budget is only in "rough balance" because the nation's top priority should be investment and growth.
In an interview this week, Mr. Gephardt belittled what he described as the obsession of the Administration and the Republicans with a budget that is strictly in balance, the goal of negotiations now taking place. To help pay for the public investment that Mr. Gephardt considers essential to achieve more robust growth, he would endorse a budget deficit ranging up to 1 percent of the gross domestic product, the total value of what the nation produces in a year. 
 The deficit for the current fiscal year is already below that level, thanks in large measure to a humming economy that has generated more tax revenue than anticipated. A slowdown in the coming months would raise the deficit again. So will rising Medicare costs. In those situations, Mr. Gephardt would invoke his 1 percent guideline, rather than balance the budget with cutbacks in spending that he considers essential if the economy is to grow as fast as it did before 1973.
"I am not sitting here advocating let's go back to $300 billion deficits, or 5 percent of G.D.P. or 3 percent," he said. "That is not a good idea. But on the other hand, what we can't do is get into this idea that if we are not at absolute, utter, strict balance each and every year, the sky is going to fall in."
The interview represented a fresh attempt by Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat serving his 11th term in Congress, to position himself against Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000. "I want this to be the Democratic economic policy alternative," Mr. Gephardt said of his proposals -- not only for the Presidential election but for the Congressional elections next year as well.
He called for public investment on a greater scale than the Administration advocates. And he proposed diverting some of the gasoline tax from its present purpose, reducing the deficit, to a new function, making payments on state and municipal bonds that finance public investment. The bonds would pay for public investment, and the gasoline money, totaling $7 billion a year, would be used to repay the bonds. The repayments would support about $70 billion in bond issues. President Clinton also favors tax policy to finance public investment. The President's college tax credit is in this vein.
Mr. Gephardt has gradually stepped up his effort to separate his positions from those of the Administration. He had previously taken issue with the White House on welfare changes, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the China trade policy, which he termed insufficiently tough. And he voted against the budget resolution, the broad outline negotiated by Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders in recent months, calling it unjust -- although he joined Mr. Gore on Thursday in opposing Republican tax proposals.
But Mr. Gephardt's new stand on the deficit was a clear departure from the Administration's public position, which is to balance the budget to the dollar by 2002.
"I think getting people to understand rough balance is important," Mr. Gephardt said. "In other words, getting people to understand this issue in terms of percent of G.D.P. rather than strict balance. Your personal budget is not in strict balance. You borrow money to buy a house, to buy a car, to buy an appliance, to buy a camera, to buy a lot of things that you think are important to your family and its success."
The governments of all the major industrial nations except the United States use a percentage of their gross domestic product in judging whether their budgets are out of hand. Most consider them sufficiently in balance if their deficits are less than 2 or 3 percent of the G.D.P. The thinking is that an economy can grow enough -- produce enough additional wealth -- to pay this deficit, just as a salary increase makes a family's home mortgage or its credit card debts easier to pay.
But in the current effort in Washington to pass legislation that would balance the budget to the dollar, neither the Administration nor anyone in the Republican-controlled Congress has invoked the G.D.P. standard as a legitimate alternative. Still, many economists quietly favor this standard, including some of Mr. Clinton's advisers.
Given the nation's current $7.8 trillion economy, Mr. Gephardt's 1 percent deficit ceiling would be $78 billion, slightly above the projected deficit of $67 billion for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30. By Mr. Gephardt's new standard, then, the budget is already in balance.
In the interview, Mr. Gephardt called for a broad array of public investments -- in education, health care, child care, infrastructure -- all intended to increase the nation's productivity and thus the growth of the economy to at least 3 percent a year and perhaps as much as 3.5 percent. That would be well above the 2.1 percent annual average that has prevailed in the 1990's.
Administration officials also call for greater economic growth, but they see Mr. Gephardt's leap to 3 percent or more as wishful thinking. They share with him the view that the right set of investments, chiefly in education, and the right sort of corporate practices can raise productivity and growth, but not by as much as Mr. Gephardt has in mind.
Productivity is a measure of how much a worker, with modern tools and machinery, can produce in an hour. The more each produces, the greater the nation's overall economic growth. For decades the economy grew at more than 3 percent a year, on average, and then the rate fell back to less than 2.5 percent in 1973, when productivity faltered. The Administration embraces this lower growth figure in all its calculations, taking the view that while 3 percent or 3.5 percent growth might be possible in the future, getting there will come very slowly.
Whatever the future holds, between now and the next Presidential election the upper limits of economic growth should be tested, Mr. Gephardt said. The economy can be pushed in this period to 3 percent growth without causing the inflation rate to rise, he added. But getting to 3 percent means putting pressure on the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates beyond their current levels, Mr. Gephardt argues. The Administration avoids pressuring the Fed.

HEADLINE: Greenport's Rough Rider;
Bold Mayor Forces Change (Even on the Willing)

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: GREENPORT, N.Y.

 BODY:
This tiny port on Peconic Bay has been kind of quiet since the wild bootlegging days of Prohibition came to a close. That is, until David E. Kapell, a former professional bass guitarist with a taste for Panama hats, was elected Mayor in 1994.
First Mayor Kapell, 48, disbanded the eight-member village Police Department. Then he abolished the village court and sold the local water utility, all to slash the village budget by 35 percent and local property taxes by 50 percent. And, in an effort to make Greenport more attractive to young families, he is remaking the village waterfront with a 3.4-acre park complete with a marina, amphitheater and carousel. 
 Mr. Kapell's energy rarely flags, especially when he does not get his way. After an effort to deny a pension to the village's volunteer firefighters failed, Mr. Kapell accused several firefighters of exploding fireworks and screaming anti-Semitic slurs outside his house. No one was charged, despite his call for an investigation, a rare defeat.
"I break all the village political rules in the book," Mr. Kapell said in an interview. "You drop the bomb and wait for the fallout."
With his mixture of charm and ruthlessness, Mr. Kapell has broken the mold of past Greenport mayors, who presided passively over a decaying economy while waiting for Albany or Washington to do something. But opponents -- and even some supporters -- wonder whether Mr. Kapell's take-no-prisoners attitude means the loss of a brand of consensus politics pleasing to neighborly villagers who would rather trade fish stories than punches. And several former and current village officials accuse him of using his office to benefit his real estate business and friends and of spreading rumors about his opponents to bring them to heel.
"David has really done a good job as Mayor," said Thomas Wickham, former supervisor of the Long Island Town of Southold, which includes Greenport within its jurisdiction. "But he will stop at nothing to promote his interests: concocting sex scandals and lawsuits, hounding and harassing people with phone calls at home, anything against people who are not 100 percent supportive."
A registered Republican who ran for Mayor on an independent party ticket whose name he says he cannot remember, Mr. Kapell is a hard man to pin down ideologically. He looks to Ross Perot as a model for shaking up the political system, and he admires Lincoln for his moral strength. He says he has no ambition for higher office. But he does have a foreign policy. He found a town in Romania, the Black Sea port of Mangalia, willing to exchange students with Greenport and provide cobblestones for the waterfront project in return for an old ambulance. He says he eventually wants to bring Romanian cognac-making skills -- cognac is the Mayor's favorite drink -- to the nearby East End wineries to expand profits and create jobs.
Nevertheless, even some of his supporters say Mr. Kapell's tactics are pretty rough for a port of only 2,100 full-time residents, plus another 1,000 or so weekenders.
"He's a Rudy Giuliani type," said Walter Gezari, president of a Greenport manufacturing firm and key supporter of Mayor Kapell. "If some neck needs to be stepped on, Dave will crush it and chop it off immediately."
Troy Gustavson, the executive editor and co-publisher of The Suffolk Times, a weekly newspaper, said that Mr. Kapell had personally called him late in 1996 to suggest that the paper consider an article on a possible extramarital affair of two members of the village board of trustees who opposed his waterfront plan. The two trustees went to the paper to deny the rumor, Mr. Gustavson said, and an article never ran.
Asked about the incident, Mr. Kapell said, "I'm not going to comment on that." In a separate interview, he said: "They say I'm bull-headed and a little Napoleon. In a small town, things get personal, and I regret that."
Much about David Kapell's life is unconventional. His father, the acclaimed classical concert pianist William Kapell, died in a plane crash when David was only 4. He grew up in Manhattan, never finished college and played bass in various rock and blues bands in his 20's. After going through what he described as an "emotional nadir and catharsis," which he refused to detail, he gave up his music career to work as a dishwasher and eventually managed several restaurants.
In 1977, Mr. Kapell and his wife, Eileen, the daughter of his Manhattan apartment building's superintendent, moved to Greenport, where he entered village government as a planner and eventually opened a real estate and antiques business. He first ran for mayor in 1994 to fill out the term of a predecessor who had resigned after a police scandal, in which one officer was charged with tipping off drug dealers and another was found having sex with a girlfriend on the police chief's desk.
Mr. Kapell pressed for a village vote to disband the force, and after the referendum succeeded, sued the town of Southold to provide Greenport with extra police protection. In 1995, Mr. Kapell ran unopposed for a full four-year term.
With his ever-present hat or cap and soft smile, Mr. Kapell cuts an avuncular figure with the public. Walking between his real estate office and the village hall, Mr. Kapell greeted everyone he passed by name, chatted with a teen-ager from a troubled home he says he has tried to guide, and even waved politely to a woman he described as the village's one streetwalker.
Once he reached village hall, however, Mr. Kapell's charm turned muscular. At a meeting with several state officials visiting to discuss a new drainage project, he dropped the startling suggestion that he might build a wall across a state road that runs through the village if Albany didn't begin to maintain it better.
Mr. Kapell concedes his original motivation for entering politics was partly personal: His real estate business was not doing well, and he thought shaking up the local government would improve the village's economy. But his critics say he has overstepped the line between self-interest and village concerns.
Barbara E. Heaney, a village trustee, said Mr. Kapell has been promoting a change in zoning regulations to permit the conversion of empty space over storefronts into artist lofts so the Vitale Building, a property he manages in Greenport, can be divided up for more rental space.
In response, Mr. Kapell said, "I support the initiative and will continue to support it and if it helps the Vitale Building, hallelujah!" But he added, "I don't place my personal interests over the interests of the community."
Mr. Kapell's detractors also say he has opposed proposals to include commercial properties on his waterfront project because of his friendship with E. M. Kontakosta, the owner of several major storefronts across from the new park. But Mr. Kapell said a pristine park without stores would beautify the village, and do far more for the local economy.
"The last thing Greenport needs is more stores, because you'll just have more vacancies," Mr. Kapell said.
Mr. Kapell said he had not had any business relationship with Mr. Kontakosta for 15 years, and he denied that any of his decisions as Mayor were made for his gain or the gain of friends. He conceded that real estate prices do go up when he does a good job. But he added that for the $17,000 a year he earns as Mayor, he has been forced to spend an inordinate amount of time on village business and given up a lot of business to preclude conflicts of interest.
"If you are afraid of alienating people you can't be in a leadership position," Mr. Kapell said. "You're bound to ruffle feathers when you make change, but I'm ready for reconciliation with anybody, anytime."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
A Strong Dollar Spurs Travel

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; STEVE LOHR is a business-news reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
IF you want to save money, stay home. If you venture out, the best travel values for the money are likely to be found in the world's most efficient consumer economy, the United States.
Still, pocketbook parochialism has certainly not deterred Americans from traveling abroad in record numbers. The Commerce Department estimates that Americans will make 54 million trips abroad this year, continuing the increase of recent years. Sheer wanderlust may play a part, but the numbers are rising mainly because more people can afford it -- courtesy of the healthy American economy. 
 But the continued strength of the American dollar has helped as well. Travel experts agree that changes in a currency's value over the course of several months, or even a year, do not usually have much effect on travelers. But a steady rise in the value of the dollar over a couple of years, they say, is noticeable.
That is the situation today in many countries. The dollar is worth roughly 20 percent more than it was two years ago in most European countries including Germany, France and Switzerland, according to the research department of American Express.
There are exceptions. In Britain, the most popular European destination for Americans, the dollar is worth no more than it was two years ago. In Turkey, by contrast, the dollar buys more than three times as many Turkish liras as it did in the summer of 1995.
In some countries, the longer-term trend is most important. In Italy, for example, the dollar is worth about 10 percent more than it was a year ago, not such a big move. But the dollar has risen 60 percent against the Italian lira since the fall of 1992.
"Italy has fallen off the list of expensive places to go," observed James V. Cammisa Jr., a travel analyst in Miami.
Yet taking an even longer view, a decade or more, today's dollar looks pretty feeble. At recent exchange rates, the dollar purchased 113 Japanese yen, 1.73 German marks and 5.84 French francs, and those are solid gains over the rates two years ago of 85 yen, 1.40 marks and 4.92 francs. Then again, the recent dollar rates are far below the levels reached in the mid-1980's. In 1985, the dollar purchased 262 yen, 3.45 marks and 10 francs.
 
Cheaper Sushi
So Japan, for example, has not dropped off the list of expensive places to go, despite the dollar's 33 percent rise against the yen in the last two years.
But because Japan has a negligible inflation rate, the stronger dollar translates into greater purchasing power for travelers. The sushi lunch in the small restaurant in the Tsukiji district, famous for its fish market, will cost in yen roughly what it did two years ago -- making it cheaper for the American whose dollars buy a third more yen than in 1995.
In a country with high inflation, like Turkey, the dollar's gains do not translate into proportionately lower prices for American tourists. A Turkish carpet is cheaper for Americans than it was two years ago but not at the fire-sale discount suggested by the huge swing in the dollar rate, from 43,200 liras two years ago to 145,600 liras recently.
And a stronger dollar means little to American travelers in countries that are "dollarized," meaning that many prices and hotel rates, especially for tourists, are either formally or informally set in dollars. Among others, China, parts of Latin American and the former Soviet bloc, even Israel, fit that category.
So where are the attractive prices apt to be found? Mainly in business establishments that compete for local customers instead of tourists.
Local restaurants, for example. Ed Perkins, the editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, a monthly newsletter, recently visited Germany, Italy and Czechoslovakia. "The hotel rates were still pretty high," Mr. Perkins said. "But the dining costs were remarkably modest compared with a couple of years ago."
Arthur Frommer, publisher of 167 guidebooks and long a champion of affordable overseas travel, says the stronger dollar makes this a particularly good time to go to Europe. "The southern tier European nations of Italy, Spain, Portugal and most of all Turkey have become especially good values," said Mr. Frommer."
At an Italian trattoria, he says, a good meal -- a pasta, small meat course, vegetables, fruit for dessert and a glass of wine -- need not cost more than $15 or so. To save on lodging, he favors guest houses, small hotels and bed-and-breakfasts. "The places with elevators, big lobbies and bathrooms in most rooms are going to cost you more."
Foreign cities, he adds, are much like New York or other big American cities. Prices range from extravagant to bargain basement. Breakfast at hotel restaurants in Manhattan can easily cost more than $10 but, as Mr. Frommer notes, the West Side drugstore counter he favors offers eggs, coffee and toast for $1.89: "There is a budget life abroad just as there is in the United States."
 
Avoiding Fees
Tourists, of course, are charged more than the so-called interbank rates published daily in major newspapers. These rates are set by foreign exchange dealers on bank trading floors; they buy and sell millions of dollars worth of pounds, marks and yen with each telephone call.
The goal for travelers is to get as close to the interbank rate as possible. First, put as much of your overseas spending on credit cards as possible. American Express, Mastercard and Visa, for example, usually charge card holders just 1 percent or so more than the interbank rate when foreign purchases are translated back into dollars on monthly statements.
Second, be careful in dealing with local currency shops abroad. These exchange bureaus routinely have signs offering what seem to be extremely attractive rates, but the advertised rates are often the "sell" rates, meaning the amount of local currency you need to buy dollars when converting your leftover francs into dollars as you head home. The "buy" rate -- or the amount of local currency you can buy with a dollar -- is much less favorable. Also, make sure to ask about added-on fees for transactions.
Bank cards used in automated teller machines in America increasingly work in major banks overseas, especially Europe and Mexico. "If you haven't traveled in the last year, you'll be surprised at how easily American bank cards work in much of Europe," noted Mr. Perkins of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
The rate on ATM machines is similar to those on credit cards -- 1 percent or so above the interbank rate -- but ask about fees. There is usually also a fee of $3 or so for each transaction. To minimize the fees, it makes sense to use one's ATM card for fewer, larger transactions.
One practice to avoid, if possible, is using credit cards to get cash advances overseas, says Rob Rosenblatt, a vice president of American Express. Cash advances abroad combine three charges -- the surcharge above the interbank rate, the transaction fee and the financing charge on the loan, which is what a cash advance is.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
How a Proto-SoHo Thrived in Old New York

BYLINE: By Holland Cotter 

DATELINE: SOUTHHAMPTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
IT'S A RULE OF THUMB IN commercial real estate: location is everything. And that consideration has been very much on the mind of the New York art world in the last few years, as galleries move from SoHo to Chelsea, from Prince Street to Grand, wondering where the center of economic gravity will fall.
But similar concerns were at work in the 19th century, too. Antebellum New York wasn't exactly an art town, yet. The dense infrastructure of museums, galleries, dealers and publications in place today was still far in the future. Artists lived here and there around the city. And when it came to promoting and selling their wares, they were pretty much on their own. 
 But when America's first art movement, the Hudson River School, took off, a Manhattan businessman named James Boorman Johnston had an idea. He bought a plot of land on the north side of 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Greenwich Village and hired a smart young architect (Richard Morris Hunt) to design a building devoted entirely to the business of art.
Johnston's groundbreaking venture, a kind of proto-SoHo under one roof, has been the stuff of art historical footnotes up to now. But this summer it is taking center stage on Long Island at the Parrish Art Museum here. "The Tenth Street Studio Building: Artist-Entrepreneurs From the Hudson River School to the American Impressionists," a cornucopia of a show of some 50 paintings and nearly 100 vintage photographs, documents and artifacts, is on view at the museum through Aug. 10.
When the Studio Building opened in 1858, it was the place for ambitious American artists to set up shop and be seen. Its inaugural roster of renting tenants included such competitive luminaries as Frederic Edwin Church, Sanford Gifford, Martin Johnson Heade and Emanuel Leutze. The bullish Albert Bierstadt and the temperamental Winslow Homer were soon to follow.
At the time, the romantic notion of a "brotherhood of artists" was still in the air, and the building, with more than a score of studios, was conceived as a combination think-tank, exhibition space and fraternity house. Meals were served on the premises; social interchange was fluid. Residents visited each other's studios regularly, offering professional critiques and gossip. And, in an era when American art was charged with both aspirations and tensions surrounding its spiritual and political goals, the atmosphere of intellectual ferment must have been strong.
Such abstract concepts are only obliquely touched on at the Parrish, however. The show's curator, Annette Blaugrund, the new director of the National Academy of Design (where "The Tenth Street Studio Building" will open on Aug. 21), has other, more material things on her mind: namely, the Studio Building's function as a well-oiled marketing tool.
The basic story can be found right there in Hunt's floor plan. The individual studios were arranged around a high-ceilinged central hall in which all the residents could exhibit fresh-from-the-easel paintings in a continuously rotating group show. This display let artists try out new ideas on an audience of their peers. But more important, it gave New York's rising class of merchant art collectors the opportunity to do some comparison-shopping at a glance.
In fact, access to the Tenth Street Studio Building's exhibition hall and studios was shrewdly regulated. Open houses were organized and advertised; the artists themselves dropped personal notes to promising clientele.
Such handwritten invitations, along with newspaper illustrations of receptions, are among the ephemera gathered at the Parrish. And Ms. Blaugrund has supplemented them with other related materials -- engraved advertisements for the city's few auction houses and art galleries, self-published catalogues and brochures -- to give an artist's-eye view of Manhattan more than a century ago.
THEN AS NOW, THE ART world was in constant flux. Certain Studio Building tenants -- Bierstadt, Church -- made it big and moved to the country; others faded into obscurity. And with the Gilded Age of the 1880's, a different, more theatrical style of salesmanship developed.
The trend is crystallized in the figure of William Merritt Chase, who moved into the building in 1878. Chase was cast in the mold of a celebrity artist right from the start. As a painter, he had dazzling if facile gifts, but his real selling point was his personality: urbane, ambitious, intent upon clearing out a space for himself wherever he went.
That's literally what he did at the Studio Building. He commandeered the central exhibition hall, which had once been a communal showcase, and turned it into his own studio, fitting it out with a Moorish-style tent, copies of works by Velazquez and Hals, a pileup of exotic tchotchkes, and pots of palms, ferns and peacock feathers.
The Parrish has a special link to Chase -- he lived and taught on Long Island -- and the show catches something of his extravagant, grandstanding spirit. Under the eye of the interior designer John Christensen, one of the museum's galleries has been transformed into a meticulously cluttered, although miniature, evocation of Chase's digs, hung with a dozen or so of his own paintings of his studio interior.
One or two of these adroitly brushed works are among the liveliest pieces in the exhibition. Among the other highlights are one of Heade's signature paintings of orchids and hummingbirds, a modest-size South American mountainscape by Church, and a charming Worthington Whittredge image of a single tall window looking out on the Hudson River. (All three works are on loan from the New-York Historical Society.)
But "The Tenth Street Studio Building" isn't a masterpiece show and doesn't pretend to be. Many of the paintings, while technically polished, are only mildly inspired, confirming that a century ago, as now, art in New York was a mix of the good, the bad and the opportunistic.
In the latter category falls the work of John George Brown, a Studio Building resident whose genre pictures of New York street urchins -- Norman Rockwell creations before the fact -- were geared to wealthy collectors who prided themselves on being self-made men. One might also include here James Carroll Beckwith's promotional portrait of Chase himself as a self-confident dandy in spats and a chic, full-length fur coat.
Whatever one thinks of Chase, he was the last real star produced by the Studio Building, which survived into the 20th century and finally fell to the wrecking ball in 1956. (An apartment building, at 45 West 10th Street, now occupies the site.) By the time of the demolition, of course, many other art communities had sprung up: in Greenwich Village itself, in Lower Manhattan, on the Lower East Side. And they continue to appear, from Chelsea to Williamsburg.
Whether history will remember the building's artists primarily for the how-and-why of their commerce, or for the aesthetic ideas they generated, only time will tell. Ms. Blaugrund's show takes the narrower focus: it concentrates on art's unexalted economic bottom line, but turns it into an engagingly detailed, all-American story in which past and present share some turf.

 A Reinterpretation.

 SHADOW SHOGUNS
 The Rise and Fall of Japan's
 Postwar Political Machine.
 By Jacob M. Schlesinger.

 During the century since Lafcadio Hearn published "Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation," three generations of Americans -- scholars, journalists and public officials -- have tried their hands at describing and explaining Japan's singular nation-society to their countrymen. These two books are the latest. Written by knowledgeable journalists, they offer fresh and valuable insights into a country that most Americans -- rather like wintertime climbers to the summit of Mount Fuji -- seem to find ever more misty the closer they get to it. And in content and message, the two are interestingly complementary.
"Japan: A Reinterpretation" is the more ambitious -- and a stimulating, provocative book it is. No bit of academic microhistory this. Patrick Smith paints with an extremely broad brush. From the spirited prologue to the very useful bibliography in the back, the author, who ran the International Herald Tribune's Tokyo bureau, has set out to show us the real Japan, as distinct from "the Orientalist 'Japan' Americans conceived after the war" and "still read about in our newspapers."
Smith's reinterpretation centers on events since 1945. His objective is to rebut "the intellectual chicanery" of what is commonly termed the Chrysanthemum Club -- a group of American scholars who, in Smith's words, are "uncritical apologists for Japan," writers who have deliberately smudged over the realities of a troubled, questing country. In its place they have substituted a contrived and sanitized "paradigm" of a democratic, hard-working and pro-Western Japan, one that has amply justified the hopes of its successful postwar American occupiers. Edwin O. Reischauer, a longtime Harvard professor and for six years the United States Ambassador to Japan, is singled out as the club leader. A product of America's World War II "victory culture," as Smith describes it, Reischauer offered a "modernization theory" that Smith denounces for presenting an image of "contented conformity" in Japan that is totally at variance with the facts.
By contrast, Smith finds a Japan with its "political and social systems . . . in turmoil," its people struggling to re-create themselves by altering the relationship between repressed individuals and the "enveloping web" of duties and obligations that makes their society so group oriented. Here he holds that the American connection with Japan has proved not a help but a hindrance. The trouble began, in his view, when the American occupation ceased its efforts to democratize Japan in favor of a "reverse course" that sacrificed long-term political reform in the interests of building up economic Japan as a subservient cold war ally. The result was the emergence of a single-minded "Japan Inc., the name we gave to the obsessed nation we created."
Far from pushing any real Japanese democracy -- Smith repeatedly tells us there is no such thing -- the MacArthur occupation put back in place much the same arrogant bureaucratic establishment that had managed the Pacific war. Thus American power insured that "the enduring desire of ordinary Japanese for individual autonomy" would remain unsatisfied.
There is some justice to this criticism. Yet I find it hyperbolic to say there is no democracy in Japan. By whatever standards -- universal suffrage, rule of law, basic human rights included -- Japan's modern democracy is a fact. Its processes just happen to be different from ours. There are pluses and minuses on both sides.
There is no doubt, however, that the Japanese, still reeling from the collapse of their inflated "bubble economy," are now gripped by a widespread cultural and political malaise. A long-suffering public is beginning to complain. In a sweeping tour of contemporary Japan, Smith shows us a society of studious role-players ("every Japanese wears a mask"), a people whose sedulously fostered group loyalties conceal deep loneliness. He has a good reporter's eye. He obviously developed a wide acquaintanceship among Japan's political leaders, business people and cosmopolitan intelligentsia. Unlike most Japanologists, who concentrate with boring intensity on economics, Smith gives the reader a really interesting look at Japan's writers and educators. He presents a cultural dimension normally neglected.
Inevitably, the usual suspects are rounded up -- the sarariman (salaryman) literally dying from overwork, the neglected modern woman, the corrupt politicians and bureaucrats, the everyday people (and leaders) suffering from amae, or dependency syndrome. All are treated with understanding. Newer aspects of Japan are also highlighted. Following the work of the Australian scholar Gavin McCormack, Smith underlines the failings of the "construction state," where lavish, generally corrupt and dubiously useful public works projects once primed the economic pump. And he shows how the bonds of corporate loyalty, once the wonder of American business-school professors, are now loosening.
Smith summarizes recent Japanese disclosures to demonstrate that Emperor Hirohito, far from being a helpless figurehead, actively prosecuted Japan's aggressive war. He could have been tried as a war criminal, had the American occupation not actively intervened, in the interest of what it termed "stability," to hold him publicly blameless. Here is one area where Chrysanthemum Club scholars indeed helped whitewash history. Smith, on the other hand, can go overboard in the interests of revisionism. To imply that Hirohito's expertise in marine biology gave rise to the germ-warfare excesses of the Imperial Army's ghastly Unit 731 in China is, by any standard, a little much.
Which brings me to an inescapable keredomo, the "but" or "however" with which Japanese like to preface critical reservations. In his eagerness to argue that "American scholarship was . . . thoroughly in the service of official ideology," Smith plays a bit fast and loose with history himself. He incorrectly dismisses the Meiji achievement, a real cultural revolution, as merely a "transition" from one absolutism to another. The American occupation, which modern Japanese commentators still refer to, after Meiji, as Japan's Second Opening, he sees as equally a failure. Hardly so. The reverse course set in Washington in the late 1940's checked some but by no means all of the occupation's democratic reforms. In any case, no country can be continually reformed by military occupation; by 1951 it was time to go.
Nor did the reverse course render Japanese unions of today "more or less useless," as Smith maintains. (Modern American unions have got into much the same fix without the benefit of anybody's occupation.) The fact is that the reforms in labor law effected by the occupation are to this day a guarantee of labor rights in Japan. As to Japanese labor's powerlessness after 1947, I didn't really get that sense in the 1970's when, as the chief executive of a Japanese company, I was blockaded in my office for long hours -- along with thousands of Japanese company presidents in similar situations -- by union demonstrators whose gains in wages and security guarantees through that decade were without comparison anywhere in the world.
Reischauer was indeed, as Smith observes, preoccupied with Marxists -- and he was right to be. Scholarly opinion in Japan in the 1960's, as well as much of the country's labor leadership, was dominated by a crusty bunch of high-button-shoe Marxists. And Americans -- scholars, diplomats and journalists alike -- were dominated by a cold war mentality. That is to say, we thought the Soviets were out to destroy us. We lacked the "enlightened" attitude of the ever-skeptical post-cold-war 90's. As an ambassador and a scholar, Reischauer did America and Japan good service. If he erred on the side of the establishment -- and he often did -- I would prefer his measured explanations to the wild cries of some of our current revisionists.
But enough of criticism. I may not share Patrick Smith's optimism about the abilities of younger Japanese to re-create themselves. I certainly do share his concern about the need for a new, honest Japanese nationalism to replace the internationalist me-too mentality of a tired political leadership. And Smith is right to denounce the perpetuation of an outmoded Japanese-American security relationship. It does a disservice to both countries. In sum, Smith's 1997 reinterpretation of Japan may be a good bit rougher than Lafcadio Hearn's turn-of-the-century original, but it is knowledgeable and thought-provoking.
Jacob M. Schlesinger, who worked in The Wall Street Journal's Tokyo bureau from 1989 to 1994, takes a much narrower focus in "Shadow Shoguns," and his book has perhaps a heavier impact on the reader for that. As he describes it, "this is the story of Japan Inc. as political machine. It chronicles the political culture of a nation obsessed with economic advancement and the distortions to democracy and capitalism that accompanied what the world called Japan's economic 'miracle.' It is about the ambitions of colorful, domineering politicians -- the dynasty of machine bosses known as 'shadow shoguns' -- who skillfully rigged the seemingly faceless, selfless system for their own gain."
Washington lobbyists, Moscow mafiosi and Beijing party bosses stand back. Even Mobutu Sese Seko might be a bit envious. Here is the longest running big-time political sleaze serial of the past quarter-century.
Schlesinger's book makes a point of contrasting omote Nippon, the "front Japan" of the dynamic high-tech metropolitan belt along the Pacific coast, with ura Nippon, the "back-country" of underdeveloped farms and villages along the historically neglected Japan Sea to the west. He personalizes the contrast, beginning with the story of Kakuei Tanaka, the country boy from the western prefecture of Niigata, who parlayed the heavy support of local ura Nippon voters into control of a behind-the-scenes network of political payoffs and cronyism that took Tokyo and the rest of "front Japan" by storm. The Tanaka machine dominated Japanese politics totally, from its leader's selection as Prime Minister in 1972 until the majority Liberal Democrats finally lost an election in 1993.
Unlike most postwar Japanese prime ministers, relatively suave bureaucratic products of the Tokyo University law faculty, Tanaka ("Kaku-san") was rough, tough and very obviously commercial. He went straight from high school into the contracting business, where he proved an alert and ruthless competitor. From there it was an easy jump into politics. He turned the stored resentment of his ura Nippon constituents into big votes -- and they never deserted him. Schlesinger quite justly calls him "Japan's first true, successful populist." Swimming in the muddy waters of construction industry politics -- and getting richer by the day -- he speedily became one of the decision makers in the majority Liberal Democratic Party. Fast-moving and a quick study -- he was called "the computerized bulldozer" -- he smashed the more sedately corrupt politics of his elders when he became Prime Minister.
In office he was fluent and forceful (I can vouch that an hourlong interview with him felt like being run over by a verbal truck), and he set forth an ambitious plan to "remodel the Japanese archipelago" by moving a good part of Japan's industry and work force from the overcrowded Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya area to the back country. The plan proved immensely popular but fatally flawed -- since Tanaka's contractor friends had private information about what was to be built and where. Meanwhile the corruption spread. Ultimately one of his scams went international. The 1974 Lockheed bribery scandal forced Tanaka from office and ultimately got him a jail sentence (which, thanks to long appeals and illness, he never served).
The most extraordinary thing about Tanaka, however, was his resilience. For more than a decade after his public disgrace, he virtually ran the Liberal Democrats -- and hence the Government. As skillful in behind-the-scenes politicking as he had been on center stage, he employed his brazen "money-power politics" to link business, bureaucrats and politicians (even from the opposition parties) in a self-serving alliance.
Yet by 1987 a weak and ailing Tanaka was shoved aside by his three closest supporters in the party -- Shin Kanemaru, Noboru Takeshita and Ichiro Ozawa. Running the old Tanaka faction in his name, they kept power through ever more sophisticated varieties of influence-peddling. (Japan's largest contractor, for example, the Shimizu Corporation, kept no fewer than 57 of Japan's leading politicians on its annual subsidy list.) Why did the long-suffering Japanese public put up with the machine? The answer, Schlesinger tells us, lay in two popular articles of faith -- a belief in continually escalating prosperity and a commitment to the nation's isolation from any large, troubling international decisions, thanks to American protection.
In the end, conditions forced both these perspectives to unravel. At the same time, scandals surfaced that were simply too big to be ignored. Takeshita, who became Prime Minister in 1987, had to resign under fire in 1989. (He was arguably the worst of Japan's postwar prime ministers, which is saying a lot.) Kanemaru, the crude but wily "don" who succeeded Tanaka as Japan's behind-the-scenes king maker, was arrested for tax evasion in 1992, after investigators found a huge supply of unexplained cash (gold bars included) in his possession. Ozawa, for his part, turned reformer. It was he who finally toppled the Liberal Democrats from total power. Schlesinger calls him "a kind of Japanese Gorbachev."
This is a book that was waiting to be written, and not only has Jacob Schlesinger done it, but he has also produced a fine job of political reporting. Like Patrick Smith, he is rather optimistic about Japan's future. A new electoral system, adopted under reform pressure, will ultimately end the old unhealthy scaffolding of party factions. For now the cozy world of bureaucracy-business-politics crookery is in pieces. It would be hard to put anything like Tanaka & Company together again. Yet the story of this warped political genius and his clever machine henchmen holds lessons for us all. American readers should not dismiss it as remote or exotic. For despite all the cultural differences, the political problems of this equally technologized, equally media-saturated and equally morally riven society are very close to our own.

 CHARACTERS
 ON THE LOOSE
 Stories.
 By Janet Kauffman.
 142 pp. St. Paul:
Graywolf Press. Paper, $12.95. 
 It is a curious paradox that while the 1980's are generally recalled as a time of excess, the literary manner most often associated with the period is minimalism -- curt fictional bulletins from the ordinary world, delivered in clipped and affectless prose. While Janet Kauffman's two earlier collections, "Places in the World a Woman Could Walk" and "Obscene Gestures for Women," belonged to this mode, they were distinguished by their stringent wit and their clear-eyed feminism. And while much minimalist writing felt forced and evasive, Kauffman's careful, unadorned style seemed to fit the world of struggling farm families she wrote about. Her best stories managed, with remarkable economy, to be at once funny and haunting.
 Raised on a tobacco farm in Pennsylvania and for many years a farmer herself, Kauffman is now pushing her work in more experimental directions. "Maybe because I'm farming less," she notes on the back cover of "Characters on the Loose," her latest collection, "I think I'm farming language more." But this time her efforts have produced a meager harvest.
 The root of the problem is evident in the jacket copy that follows her observation: "In this collection," we are told, "language, like ground, occupies physical space. For Kauffman, this is in many ways a feminist claiming of territory." But in what ways? Authors are entitled to theorize about their own work, but in too many of these stories Kauffman presses a none-too-precise theoretical agenda at the expense of narrative technique.
 There is, for example, the story called "Signed Away," which asks, "If you think about Emily Dickinson biking the new trail, well, would she do it?" (Insert the word "just" and this might be a treatment for a highbrow Nike commercial.) The answer seems to be that she would, and that the experience would go like this: "On the way out of town, she has words with herself. She letters, she says. A litter the language. Born with. What portion of me. Riding the Ordovician folds. Wheel and while. Time before tock." A litter indeed.
 Granted, most of the stories don't approach this level of syntactic meltdown. "Nightmares for Everybody," "Girl Games" and "Eureka in Toledo, Weather Permitting" seem rambling and anecdotal at first, as they present mildly eccentric characters held together by loose familial and affective bonds and caught up in the rhythms of lower-middle-class Midwestern life. But in each Kauffman twists quotidian reality a few degrees to reveal unspoken depths of intensity and emotion. And then there are two stories -- "Unhoused, Among the Trunks of Trees" and "What Lies Ahead," placed together for maximum effect -- in which the placid surface of daily life yields suddenly and inexorably to horror, disclosing a world both utterly real and absolutely mysterious.
 Unfortunately, much of the rest of "Characters on the Loose," when it is not gratingly self-conscious, feels slack and diffuse. The book's central, longest and most ambitious entry manages to be all these at once: "26 Acts in 26 Letters" is best described as an effort in literal pornography -- it describes sexual acts performed by the letters of the alphabet. There are illustrations (recalling a manual of typography), though they don't really correspond to the acts described, which exploit the curves, openings and appendages of the characters.
 The point seems to be to drive home the two meanings of the book's title: since both the people in stories and the letters out of which they are made are called characters, the idea of characters "on the loose" conjures a vision of language and its creatures liberated and at play. But like most puns, this one becomes less interesting the more you think about it.
 Loosed from the bonds of narrative precision, psychological insight or social observation, the characters in many of these stories become mere names, whose only purpose seems to be to occupy space on the page. Since Kauffman is a writer so clearly gifted with the capacity for precision, insight and observation, this is especially disappointing.

THE GREAT LOBSTER WAR
 By Ron Formisano.
 University of Massachusetts,
 cloth, $35; paper, $14.95. 
 In 1956, some 4,000 of Maine's lobster fishermen decided to stage a "tie-up" -- that is, they refused to fish -- in protest of a 5-cent reduction in the dockside price, to 30 cents a pound, offered for their catch. They formed the Maine Lobsterman's Association and tried to persuade the rest of the state's estimated 5,000 full- and part-time lobstermen to help break the price-fixing policies of the dockside fish dealers' cartel. What could have passed as a tiny tempest in a lobster pot became a wonderful waste of time and tax money when the dealers, hearing of threats of violence against lobstermen who continued to fish, complained to the Justice Department, which then indicted the dealers as well as the association and its crusty founder, Leslie C. Dyer, and charged them with violating antitrust laws. After describing the tangled economic, cultural and family ties binding dealers and lobstermen, Ron Formisano, a University of Florida history professor, supplies a play-by-play analysis of the often hilarious trial, in which sly, taciturn lobstermen blithely flummoxed four furiously dedicated Federal prosecutors -- one of whom couldn't stand the sight of a lobster. Though a jury of equally taciturn Maine landlubbers convicted Dyer and the association, the Government refused to set punishment, choosing instead to extract its pound of fish from the dealers. In his strident and jargon-filled analysis, Formisano tries to wrest far more significance from this courtroom circus than it's worth: despite improvements in fishing technology and the establishment of a few fishing collectives, the dealers still set prices and lobstermen have little choice but to take what they can get. Still, this often charming David-and-Goliath tale is useful for its refutation of the myth of the ruggedly independent Yankee lobsterman, who is revealed here as one more victim of a captive market.

HEADLINE: Land of the Cineplex, Home of the Cassette

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

 BODY:
AMERICANS ARE WATCHING MOVIES ANY way they can, in theaters or at home, by VCR, cable or satellite dish. Most people prefer to take in a movie without leaving the house, and they're getting only cozier and cozier with that notion. At the same time, if a film is strong enough, people are turning out in large numbers at the multiplex. And with the continuous flood of movies out there, they know they had better hurry before most are whisked off the big screen and reformatted to fit their television sets.
They're so swamped with cinematic "product," in fact, that they might be forgiven for not fully recalling everything they see. "The one with the guy who makes stupid faces," was how Gene F., a 66-year-old retiree from Norfolk, Va., referred to "Liar Liar" with Jim Carrey. 
 Gene was among 1,347 people who responded to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll on America's movie-watching habits. The results are as fragmented as the population is diverse. Indeed, the multiplicity of choices and tastes in viewing behavior helps explain the escalating competition among movie-industry players -- from studio heads and theater exhibitors to video, cable and satellite operators, all elbowing for position.
This summer, theater attendance is up or down depending on the movie, but the overarching impression one gets from the poll is that in a country where some people are as familiar with movie grosses as with their grocery bills, watching movies has become something of a national pastime. Asked how many films they had watched during the preceding month, respondents frequently said they had watched several in theaters and several more on video and cable. "I go to all kinds, doesn't matter," said William Lee, 27, from Coronado, Calif. Discharged this week from the Navy, he was one of several dozen people interviewed afterward, some on the condition that their full names not be used. "I like the crowds, watching with others," he said. Mr. Lee also frequently rents videos, but Mike Nordstrom, a 48-year-old teacher from Farmington, N.M., watches movies only on video, to the tune of seven tapes or more a month. "We get what we need to get out of a film on a small screen," he said. Meanwhile, Jim Knight, 34, from Scranton, Pa., says he rarely goes to theaters, seldom rents videos and waits for most everything on premium cable. Counting his children, he said, he and his family watch at least three movies a day.
Mr. Nordstrom and Mr. Knight's viewing habits underscore a homeward tilt to movie watching. The poll found that 64 percent of Americans prefer watching movies at home. Sixty-five percent of the respondents had rented at least one video in the preceding month, and 16 percent had rented seven tapes or more. Eighty-two percent had seen at least one movie on "regular," or noncable, television in that time, and 22 percent had seen seven or more.
Richard T., 53, from Wallingford, Conn., said he went to the movies twice in the previous month but rented seven or more videos. "My home system is as good as a theater," he explained.
He'd get an argument, of course, from the 31 percent who said they preferred going to a theater. Susan Hughes, a homemaker in her 30's from Atlanta, rents videos but prefers theaters for mysteries and comedies. "It's the crowds, the atmosphere," she said. "If something's funnier to them, it's funnier to me." Patricia W., a 52-year-old grandmother from Frederick, Md., took the family to the theater revivals of all three "Star Wars" films earlier this year. "It's the magnificence of the large screen," she said. And for Gene from Virginia, theatergoing is a "social thing"; he goes with his golfing buddies. "We don't see a movie just because it's the hot one," he said. "We go to the movies just to go to the movies."
Though they may be in the minority, theatergoers are still in very large company. In 1996, in fact, there were 1.34 billion theater admissions, the largest since 1959. But homebodies are everywhere. Judy Thorburn, 56, from Portland, Ore., said she never went to theaters or video stores but watched a dozen movies a month via her satellite dish and borrowed tapes from her daughter, who collected them.
Home or theater -- the dichotomy kicks up dust all along the movie distribution trail. "Theaters will never be supplanted by home entertainment, but clearly the home is growing at a pace theater will never be able to maintain," said Bill Sondheim, president of Polygram Video.
 
Catch Them Now, Catch Them Later
Studios obviously want people to see movies in theaters, but they'll settle for later. Ideally, they'll catch them at both the megaplex and at home, maybe even several times for the same movie. But the timing has the movie business on edge. Theater people are worried that movies are going to video too quickly. The once-standard lag time of about six months from theater opening to video release has shrunk to an average of 5 months and 23 days. Video, in turn, which typically gets exclusive use of movies for 30 to 60 days, is worried that films are moving to cable pay-per-view too quickly.
Facing waits of as long as six months, premium cable channels, the last stop, are worried that movies aren't moving fast enough.
Video is particularly worried about losing its head start over pay-per-view. Studio video divisions bring in three times the revenues of their theatrical counterparts, helping bail out many a hugely expensive box-office flop. Still, rentals are down from the mid-1980's, when the VCR was relatively new and people raced home with armloads of cassettes as if they had struck gold at Sutter Creek. This year, too, dealers complain that poor movies aren't helping the rental market.
Nevertheless, "for a great night with the family, there's no place like home," argues a commercial from Blockbuster, the nation's largest video chain. Unless it's the multiplex.
"No matter how magical the technology, people don't want to be umbilically connected to an electronic box seven nights a week," said Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, the studios' trade organization. Mr. Valenti is a theater man himself. "When my kids were younger, we had everything in my home, but, hell, they wanted to go out and see a movie."
Home viewing, however, gets points for practicality. "It's a matter of consumers' disposable time and income," said Michael Karaffa, executive vice president of New Line Home Video. "All of video's fundamental principles of the 80's still hold: convenience, low cost."
In the Times poll, which was conducted in the spring and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, 59 percent of respondents said they hadn't been to a theater during the month. Twenty percent of them said tickets were too expensive. (The national average admission is $4.41, said William Kartozian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, though prices in cities like New York can climb to $9.) Three percent said there was no theater nearby. Twenty-two percent said they had no time, and 11 percent said they had no interest.
Only 10 percent said they didn't like the movies -- too violent, too much sex, too trashy. Richard, from Connecticut, said he wasn't impressed with what he had seen recently: "Dumb. No plot lines anymore." Ms. Hughes from Georgia said she was reading more and seeing fewer movies. "They just aren't as interesting as they used to be," she explained.
In the main, though, respondents were positive about what they were seeing. "The state of the art is excellent," said Patricia from Maryland. "Acting is better. The sound is beautiful."
 
Now You See It, Now You Don't
One problem for theater people is that there just may be too many movies, especially during the summer and the holidays. If a film doesn't succeed immediately, it is yanked off the screen to make way for the next movie, which yields to the next, and so on. That irked some respondents. "It takes a while to build an audience, but they come and go so quickly," said Deidre Lee, 53, from Austin, Tex.
Blame the economics. "Production and marketing costs are so high on the theatrical end, we have to move up our cash flows," said one studio executive. That's one way of saying that a movie is going nowhere in theaters, so to have any hope of recouping the $70 million it took to make and promote it, it's necessary to get it into video stores fast before people forget all about it.
Now there is a new wrinkle to the rush to video. Consumers increasingly want to buy and not just rent the biggest movies -- an "Independence Day," say -- which they can then watch more than once. To make the most of that inclination, the megahits are released to theaters in late spring and early summer to strike the mother lode at the megaplex and then be ready for sale during the holidays. In these special cases, the theater-to-video window has been narrowed to between four and five months.
Renters have always played a waiting game for movies, but these days faster exits from theaters are raising expectations even further, creating a circular effect: since audiences know a movie will be on videotape shortly, they have less reason to run to a theater to see it, and with turnout at the theaters thus dampened, the movie's exit to video is hastened all the more.
Some respondents said they routinely waited for "smaller" movies. Ms. Hughes said she automatically waited for certain kinds of films. "Romances, the sappy stuff, particularly if it's going to a tear-jerker," she explained.
Every now and then a good movie falls by the wayside in theaters because the sheer glut of new films makes it impossible for people to see everything they would like to. Video people habitually mention "The Shawshank Redemption," a 1994 prison drama, as a classic example of a movie that didn't get the theater run it deserved -- even though the film was nominated for an Oscar as best picture. Later on it caught fire at home, where it had a chance to build good word-of-mouth.
 
No Matter What, Theaters Are Crucial
Still, a movie's theater run generally remains the bellwether of its success later on in other formats. "If a movie doesn't work theatrically, it won't work in other markets," said William Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment. "The tendency now is that if you didn't see it in a theater, you're not going to seek it out on video or TV unless that movie is a fairly successful one that you hadn't heard about and that by the time you got there, it was gone," he said.
Some respondents to the poll would argue with that statement. At home, where the rental tab can be less than half that at the megaplex, viewers take chances. "If it looks like it's not going to be that good in theaters, I'll rent it," said Troy G., 24, from Evanston, Ill. So does Richard, from Connecticut. "I like the flops," he said. "Like that one about water," he said. ("Waterworld.")
Pound for pound, there may be no more amenable movie watcher than Ms. Lee from Texas, who said she watches just about everything (four movies in theaters and four on video during the poll month). She made it her business, for example, to go to the theater to see "Secrets and Lies," "Shine" "Sling Blade" and the other smaller films nominated for the bigger Oscars this year. That's more than can be said for the many members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who watched nominated films on videotape.
Ms. Lee, who has a 19-inch television screen, said she preferred to see "more substantial" films in theaters. " 'The English Patient' wouldn't look good on a small screen," she said.
Of course, much solid dramatic fare plays well on video, too. "We were delighted by the small films recently," said Mr. Nordstrom, the videophile from New Mexico. He and his wife planned to see the Oscar films and other more esoteric movies. "We avoided the whole Jane Austen thing, but the Shakespeare stuff we'll watch, like the Richard one with Ian McKellen," he said.
Most respondents said they went to theaters for "big" action and dramatic films with elaborate special effects that couldn't be replicated at home. "People don't have 10-foot wall screens," Mr. Valenti noted.
Still, home screens are getting larger. Nineteen percent of the poll's respondents said they had screens larger than 30 inches, and many who didn't said they had plans to upgrade. The impending arrival of digital and high-definition television also brightens the home vista considerably.
 
Dishes Are Offering Even Bigger Helpings
Another lift comes from satellite services. Ten percent of the poll respondents said they owned a dish. Now, in some five million homes, satellite services like DirecTV, Primestar and Echo Star are touted as the hot new way to take one's movies, though there is evidence that subscribers aren't watching as many as it was thought they might. Satellite operators talk about eventually serving up hundreds of movies on hundreds of channels. Industry analysts say that that size offering won't come about until satellite use becomes more widespread.
Whether by satellite, cable or other means, such plenitude is euphemistically referred to as "near video on demand." If one can't order up any movie, there is still more than enough choice to satisfy the average viewer. Last month a cable service in the New York area said it was planning to offer 1,000 movies. Subscribers have heard promises like that before, but even the talk makes video dealers nervous.
"If I had a larger choice, I would definitely stop going to the store," said Patricia, from Maryland. Video, however, is countering with a new technology of its own: the digital video disk, the five-inch CD with a movie on it that propels the quality of sound and image far beyond the videocassette.
"They just want everybody to go out and buy a new system," said Heather Murphy, a 25-year-old Eugene, Ore., woman. No argument there, for sure.

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
MANY of the barren patches that still remain on New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront are beginning to fill up with housing as a second wave of construction rolls across the 18-mile shoreline.
In this redevelopment effort, which began 18 months ago and is now gaining momentum, developers are trying to capitalize on an improving residential market and what they say is a pent-up demand for housing at the water's edge. 
 Work is under way or will soon begin on projects totaling 2,682 units, most of them luxury rentals, according to the ACI Real Estate Group in Jersey City. And hundreds more are in various stages of planning for the riverfront, where 20,672 units could be built.
For riverfront towns, some of which missed out on the last building cycle, the hope is that the activity will or spur the revival of their stretch of the Hudson's west shore.
"The riverfront is coming back," said ACI's president, Robert P. Antonicello, adding that it has not yet regained its image a decade ago as the "gold coast" when several projects, some quite grand, were progressing. Though not all were realized 3,500 residences, mostly condominiums, were built before the recession hit and construction slowed to a snail's pace through 1995.
Not only are the new projects mostly rentals -- for which financing is more readily available than for for-sale housing, experts say -- but they are smaller in scale. Many are in Jersey City, including two rental towers totaling 786 units at Newport, the huge mixed-use center. And developers of two recently completed and fully leased rental projects in the city are or soon will be developing additional riverfront rental buildings.
But the activity has spread to other Hudson County towns. In West New York work has begun on The Landings, a 276-unit rental, and will soon begin on Jacob's Ferry, a 464-unit town-house condominium, the only for-sale project announced so far in this wave of development.
In Hoboken, work is to start on 196 rentals. And the city also expects to name a developer in the next month for the residential portion of the project it plans on the waterfront land its owns. That portion calls for up to 522 residences.
The wave of development has also has moved into Edgewater in Bergen County where 430 residences are under way, including the 266-rental River Club project, and an equal number of units are planned.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said that the riverfront's rebound was "benefiting from the stable job growth and economy of the state, which is in its 62d month of recovery." In addition, he said, there was a ripple effect from Manhattan's strong housing market and improving image.
Today's waterfront is also more accessible thanks to road and transportation improvements that have been or are being made. Construction began in April on the first half of the 20.5-mile light-rail system that will run from Bayonne to Ridgefield Park. The line, according to New Jersey Transit, overseer of the state's mass transit system, will improve property values by 10 to 30 percent and spur more development.
THE initial 10-mile light-rail stretch, from Bayonne to Jersey City, will not be completed until 1999. Still, developers say it will enhance the marketability of their projects.
So will the new ferry terminal in Weehawken that will be linked to the rail line. Construction is expected to start in the fall of 1998 on the project, which is being developed by the local Arcorp Properties, owned by Arthur E. Imperatore. Its subsidiary, New York Waterway, runs the existing terminal and operates five trans-Hudson ferries and plans to operate a sixth.
William Becker, a housing consultant in Teaneck, said the waterfront could absorb about 1,000 rentals a year for the next three years. After that there could be an oversupply, he said, adding that by then the market could support more for-sale riverfront housing.
The rental vacancy rate hovers between 1 to 2 percent, said Mr. Antonicello of AC!, and rents have risen. On average, the rent for a typical 1,000-square-foot, 2-bedroom apartment is $1,750 a month, up $200 from a year before. he said.
Those factors, developers said, gave them the confidence to move ahead. The pace of production is steady but not aggressive for the demand on both sides of the river, "keeping the market from stumbling," said Allen F. Goldman. He is a vice president at the Applied Companies of Hoboken, which alone or with partners is involved in three riverfront projects, including Port Liberte in Jersey City, made up of condominium apartments. .
Evidence of the market's strength is the pace of leasing at the company's second building at Portside in Jersey City. The project (its first 229-unit building is leased) was revived from the 80's and is the first of the new developments.
Since leasing began three weeks ago at the nearly completed second building, 132 of its 295 studio to three-bedroom units have been leased. Rents for the apartments, ranging from 571 to 2,036 square feet of space, are $1,115 to $3,550, 8 percent more than those in the first building, Mr. Goldman said.
Leasing also is under way at the 340-unit rental the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, is building at Newport. Deposits have been taken on 102 of the studio to 2-bedroom apartments, which range in size from 520 to 1,500 square feet, but can be combined. Rents range from $950 to $2,800.
"Manhattan is the magnet and it is drawing increasing attention to the Hudson's west bank," said Richard S. LeFrak, the company's president. Banking on that the company started work on a second building with 446 units, to be similar in size and price to the ones in the first building.
This time around, analysts and developers agree, the demand from professionals who work in Manhattan or in the millions of square feet of riverfront office towers will continue and increase as Manhattan rents rise. They are the riverfront's "bread and butter," said Jeffrey B. Albert, vice president at Avalon Properties, based in Wilton, Conn., with offices in Princeton. Mr. Albert added that the influx of people from Manhattan, is expected to stay steady at 15 to 20 percent.
HIS company just finished leasing Avalon Cove, a 504-unit mid-rise project just south of Newport. The 1- to 3-bedroom apartments, including penthouses, rented for $1,110 to $4,550, the highest rents achieved so far. Avalon is planning an adjacent 269-unit building, which it will lease at comparable rents.
Those are the renters Applied also expects to draw to the Shipyard, the 1,165-unit project with a park at its core that the company is planning on 45 acres at the northern end of the waterfront in Hoboken. Mr. Goldman said construction will begin in September on the first 196 units, including 26 loft-like apartments.
Rents for the 1- and 2-bedroom units, ranging in size from 820 to 1,200 square feet, will be $1,450 to $1,950, he said.
Some developers expect to draw new faces. "People who work in northwestern New Jersey also will make the reverse east- west commute since little luxury rentals are being built in that sector of the state," said Marshall B. Tycher, president of the Roseland Property Company of Roseland.
His company is dividing the 100 waterfront acres it owns in West New York, where 4,000 units could rise, into parcels to develop itself and sell to other builders. Roseland is developing the first five-acre parcel into 276 one- and two-bedroom rentals, which are scheduled for completion by the fall of 1998.
Others say more empty-nesters from the suburbs, families and affulent immigrants will also be drawn to the riverfront and that some will be ready to buy. That is what the state's largest developer, K. Hovnanian Enterpises of Red Bank, is betting on for its first riverfront project.
In the next two months the company will start 464 for-sale town houses on 20 acres in West New York that it bought from Roseland. The 2- and 3-bedroom units, each with a garage, will have 1,240 to 2,300 square feet. Prices at Jacob's Ferry are expected to start in the low $200,000 range, said Gabriel Pasquale, senior marketing and sales adviser for the company's Northeast region.
"With rents going up the market is prime for for-sale housing," he said, adding that the vision in 1986 of what the waterfront "was supposed to be is now coming to fruition."

HEADLINE: Not a Lot of Crime but There's an Officer on the Beat

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
MOST people who live in the coastal enclave of Rowayton like to think of their village, bounded on the west by the Five Mile River and on the south by Long Island Sound, as an independent entity. And why not? After all, Rowayton has its own post office, fire station, library, school, banks, churches, restaurants, beach, marinas and Civil War-era cannon. It even decides how some tax money is allocated.
Despite all these things, Rowayton is not an independent community. It is a village within the City of Norwalk. And that arrangement occasionally becomes rancorous, as it did a few years ago when a group of Rowaytonites began a secessionist movement because of their anger over a city revaluation they contended would disproportionately raise their property taxes. Like other secessionist moves in the state in recent years, the Rowayton effort died aborning. 
 "That was a waste of energy, and all it did was create ill feeling," said Randall Avery, the chairman of the Sixth Taxing District, which allocates tax monies to the library, the Rowayton Civic Center, the volunteer fire station and Bayley Beach, which is solely for Rowaytonites. "But we still feel that there is a disproportionate return of tax money to Rowayton considering how much we pay in taxes to the city."
Now, though, Rowayton, which has a population of 5,000, has some balm in the form of its own police officer, albeit for only part of each day. The officer is Joseph Jensen, himself a Rowaytonite and member of the Norwalk Police Department, who since May 1 has been assigned to Rowayton as part of the department's community policing initiative.
The announcement that Mr. Jensen was being transferred from South Norwalk, which has the highest crime rate in the city, quite a bit of it violent, to Rowayton, which has very little crime, raised some eyebrows. The Norwalk newspaper, The Hour, said in an editorial that the move appeared to be a ploy by the Mayor, Frank J. Esposito, to curry favor with Rowayton voters during an election year.
Specifically, the editorial said, "That seems to be the only clear explanation for him agreeing to move a police officer to one of the city's wealthiest, safest enclaves. Rowayton has so little crime Barney Fyfe's crime-fighting skills would not be challenged. Putting an officer on such quiet streets cannot be the intent of community policing, unless City hall believes that, next to South Norwalk, Rowayton has the city's most significant crime problems."
Both the Mayor and the Norwalk Police Chief, Harry W. Rilling, scoffed at The Hour's criticism. "They're missing the point," said Mr. Esposito, a Republican who is seeking a sixth two-year term this year. "We've said for some time now that our goal was to extend our community policing program from South Norwalk throughout the city. And Rowayton seemed like an ideal place to start because it has a business center and we've been having some problems there."
Mr. Esposito was alluding to complaints from some residents about an increase in the number of trucks trying to circumvent traffic on Interstate 95 by driving along Route 136 which extends from Martin Luther King Boulevard in South Norwalk through a residential area of Rowayton and into the heart of the village.
"That's one of the reasons we picked Rowayton," Mr. Esposito said. "And, besides that, there have been more housebreaks in outer areas of the city."
But neither the Police Department nor any Rowayton civic leaders or residents interviewed felt there had been any upsurge in crime in Rowayton, which has the flavor of a Cape Cod village.
"The crime rate in Rowayton is relatively low," Chief Rilling said. "But, because it's a self-contained community, we felt that it was a natural place to expand community policing. And in doing so we did not reduce our commitment to South Norwalk, where, at any given time, we have between 10 and 15 officers on duty. What we're trying to do where is improve the quality of life for people throughout the city of Norwalk."
There has been no criticism from civic leaders in South Norwalk. "We can't say we'll be underserved by the transfer of the officer," said Robert Burgess, the executive director of Norwalk Economic Opportunity Now, an agency based in South Norwalk that is supported by the city, state and Federal governments. "We always welcome having more community police officers in South Norwalk," Mr. Burgess said, "but we're not going to say that other areas shouldn't have them, too."
Until Officer Jensen was assigned to Rowayton on a regular basis, the community was essentially patrolled by police radio cars that also covered a part of South Norwalk. As a result, townspeople rarely got to know the police officers who went in and out of the village, usually without getting out of their radio cars.
"It's going to be different with Officer Jensen," Chief Rilling said. "Not only will he make himself known in the community by getting out and talking to people, but he'll also attend community meetings and other functions where he thinks his presence can help establish a better relationship. He'll also set his own hours. And at times, if he feels it's necessary, he will work in plainclothes in his own car, rather than a radio car."
Though he appears to have spent most of his time in his radio car to date, Officer Jensen has made his presence known in the Rowayton Avenue business district.
"He has stopped in now and then," said Louis Froelich, a former chief of the Rowayton volunteer fire company in his hardware store, which is among a cluster of small shops on the avenue. "It's a good feeling, knowing he's around."
A few doors away, Carla Mortelliti, the owner of Carla's Flower Box, said that there had been two attempted break-ins at her shop in the last year, but that her burglar alarm frightened away the would-be intruders. "A lot of people think this is just a sleepy little town where there's no crime, but it sometimes happens," Ms. Mortelliti said.
Next door, Mike Czegledi, the proprietor of Midway Cleaners, also welcomed having a police officer in town. "This is not exactly a high-crime area, but we still need protection," Mr. Czegledi said.
Mr. Avery, the Taxing District chairman, said that he and some other Rowayton residents had asked that a police officer be assigned to the village for some time. "There was a rash of commercial break-ins in 1995 and the speeding along Route 136 is terrible from about 7 to 9 in the morning," Mr. Avery said. "Having an officer here on a regular basis is bound to help."
The police and residents of Rowayton who were interviewed said that most of the crime in the village involved break-ins, or attempted break-ins, in homes and commercial establishments and thefts from sail boats and yachts tied up at boatyards and marinas on the Five Mile River.
To combat the boat thefts in particular, marina and boatyard owners have at times hired off-duty police officers and security guards.
Indeed, Chief Rilling said that Officer Jensen has worked as a security guard in Rowayton while off-duty in past years. "He really knows the community and its people, so we think he's perfect for the job," the Chief said.
Some merchants along Rowayton Avenue said they have yet to meet, or even see, Officer Jensen. But his presence has been felt, at least by some motorists.
"I've been told that a lot more citations have been given out since he got here," said John Cagnina, the chairman of the Rowayton Civic Association's land use committee. "That seems to indicate that he's getting out of his car and walking around. That's good, because having a community police officer is the closest thing to the concept of the old cop on the beat."
Mr. Jensen said he has given out dozens of moving violation tickets along with scores of written and verbal warnings to truck drivers and other motorists speeding on Route 136 and on Wilson Avenue, where through trucks are not allowed. And his quick response to a 911 call from a merchant on Rowayton Avenue led to two arrests last month.
"A lady, who had cashed a bad check for $400 the day before, came back in the store to try to cash another check the next day," said Vinny Taliercio, the owner of the Rowayton Market, which is in the heart of the village. "I immediately called 911 and they radioed Officer Jensen who got to the store in a couple of minutes and arrested the woman and a guy waiting outside in a car."
Officer Jensen smiled at the recollection. "Actually, I got there a minute after I got the call," he said.
Mr. Jensen, who has been a Norwalk officer for 14 years, occasionally works a 3 to 11 shift -- "That way I get to know what's going on a little better." -- also recently arrested a young man for narcotics possession in the rear of the Rowayton School. "By working different hours, people who might be inclined to cause trouble never know when I might come around," he said.

BOISE NOISE

 BODY:
One byproduct of New York City's plunging crime rate was a proposed economic-development ad campaign comparing New York's per capita crime rate to that of relatively tiny Boise, Idaho. New York's lower rate excited the Martin Agency, the Richmond, Va., company that won the account in 1996. A mock-up for its $12 million campaign showed a tough New York businessmen with a line announcing that his city's safety rates right up there . . . with Boise. Alas, focus groups didn't buy it, perhaps sensing that per head comparisons don't always mean much. New York had 984 homicides in 1996; Boise had 1. The idea, and the Martin Agency, were quietly rubbed out.

New on the QE2: Your Broadway Debut

BYLINE: By Ray Cormier 

 BODY:
The Queen Elizabeth 2 is offering a chance for passengers to be in the show on a trans-Atlantic crossing this fall.
The cruise, called Broadway Goes to Sea, sails from New York on Oct. 13 and arrives in Southampton, England, Oct. 19. In between, passengers can observe Broadway professionals rehearsing a musical, and even audition for and play a few small parts. The cruise will culminate with a performance in the ship's 532-seat theater. 
 Which show will be staged and what parts may be available for passengers will depend on the professional cast, said Edward Strauss, the musical coordinator for the Broadway revival of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." Mr. Strauss will be leading the music on the cruise.
Among the Broadway veterans scheduled to participate are Faith Prince (Miss Adelaide in "Guys and Dolls"), Lewis J. Stadlen (Senex in "Forum") and Mark Linn-Baker (Hysterium in "Forum").
The cruise package, $3,399 to $18,449, includes a cocktail party with the stars at Sardi's, tickets to two musicals (one in New York and one in London) and economy-class air fare back to the United States.

HEADLINE: Surviving, Thriving in Camden

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
THE phone inside the trailer is ringing. Dave Moto snakes an arm in the window and picks it up. "Good afternoon," he says smoothly, "Kea'Boos Enterprises." It is his erstwhile security guard, who has been missing for four days, along with Mr. Moto's wallet. She wants to know what's going on.
"Nothing," he says. "Not a damn thing." He tells her she cannot have her job back and slams the phone down. 
 The new night watch, Denise Williams, who has been napping in the trailer, emerges. "I told you, soon as she got broke, she'd be back," Ms. Williams says.
Mr. Moto fumes, but only for a minute. It's not as if this is a shocking turn of events. He has been through 100 employees since he moved his bottomless inventory of refrigerators, televisions, acrylic landscapes, torque wrenches, truck tires, stuffed animals and lawn mowers in every possible state of repair into a cavernous defunct factory in East Camden. He's been burglarized 15 times in 18 months.
Last year, the landlord fell afoul of the fire code, and the city shut off the water and electricity, so now the lights in Camden's biggest used-stuff store brighten and dim in concert with surges of deafening gas generators (Mr. Moto is on his sixth generator, the first five having been stolen). No heat in winter. No air-conditioner in summer, except the ones he sells.
Still, he has worked his way to the top of Camden's junk heap, first running one stall in the flea market around the corner, then two, then five, then seven, then moving into the football-field-size former Diversified Foam plant. His business, which on any given day also involves cleaning office buildings, fixing cars and installing sewer drains, feeds his extended family, some of whose members are also his employees, and it is growing. "There's no telling how far you can go if you keep investing your money back in it," he says.
Just about everything you read about Camden, national symbol for urban decay, is true. It is indeed the poorest city in the state and one of the poorest in the nation, ravaged by drugs and crime, its citizens and woefully inept municipal government vastly dependent on state and Federal handouts, its once mighty manufacturing base all but vaporized, its row house neighborhoods punctuated by long, silent stretches where vacant shells and empty lots outnumber inhabited homes.
But what you read about Camden, a city of 85,000 people without a mall, a movie theater or even a bowling alley, tends to ignore the fact that life and community and commerce persist and even, sometimes, thrive, in numerous forms, however makeshift or marginalized. People work and worship and play with their kids, hang out with friends, go to the park. There are neighborhoods that are actually pleasant, and even in the rougher districts, many people (though not most) stay because they want to. For better or worse, it's home.
 
A Desolate Strip, A Hopeful Barber
After six months of searching, Rich Colon has been reunited with his barber.
"I didn't get my hair cut till I saw him again," said Mr. Colon, 27, resplendent in the barber's leopard-skin chair cape on a recent Saturday morning. "I was a bad case."
The barber, who identified himself only as Ron -- he said there were still a few details to sort out before he was ready to publicize his shop -- grinned as he put a few finishing buzzes on Mr. Colon's Caesar (shaved sides, square lines, very short bangs). Ron had been working for a barber on the other side of town, in East Camden. Then he seemed to vanish, but last month he took over a vacant barber shop on Broadway, much closer to Mr. Colon's South Camden home.
The shop, an agreeable old two-chair parlor with white wooden counters and brown, patterned linoleum, is on a typically desolate stretch of what was once Camden's main drag, across from an empty lot and catty-corner from four abandoned buildings. On the plus side, Ron said, he is the only barber for blocks around, and the storefronts on either side of him are occupied, by a pharmacy and a doctor. "I like the atmosphere here," he said.
Not that there aren't problems. "A guy got killed last week, right across the street," he said. "They tried to rob him, then they shot him in the head and ran him over. I haven't had any trouble, but after closing hours, you try to get out of here fast."
Ron, 28, plans to move above the shop with his wife and baby daughter to "They tried to rob him, then they shot him in the head and ran him over. I haven't had any trouble, but after closing hours, you try to get out of here fast."
Ron, 28, plans to move above the shop with his wife and baby daughter to be near his business, "in case anything happens."
"It's like anywhere you go," he said. "You got to keep your eyes open."
Outside a public school half a mile away, a dazzling peacock of a woman in a blue headdress and gold cat's-eye glasses sees her two white-robed daughters off to karate class. The woman, Nzinga House, is a seamstress, and she is modeling one of her own outfits, a festive blue-and-white print with lavender ruffles that seems two parts African princess and one part Southern belle.
"I get a lot of positive comments," said Ms. House, 33, who works out of her living room. "I just wish I had a lot of positive cash flow to go with it. But my people only want to wear their own clothing in February" -- Black History Month. "I've got to get them unbrainwashed."
She likes the karate class because, for at least a few hours a week, she doesn't have to worry about what her daughters are wearing. "Most of the clothes kids wear now is that hoochie-coochie stuff," she said. "I want them to look like girls, not little sexy-women. Like I'll show them a J. C. Penney catalogue and they'll say, 'Mom can you make that?' and I do but I make it lower."
The class, taught by Beauford Sloane El, a custodian at the school and a fourth-degree black belt, is as much about discipline and respect for self and others as learning how to throw or block a punch. The 30-odd students (among them Mr. Colon's 5-year-old son) end every sentence with "sir" and recite the Five Codes of Tang Soo Do by heart: "Be loyal to your leader, obedience to parents, honor friendship, always finish what you start, choose sense of honor."
Most of the kids stay focused, but Khiara and Djenne House, 8 and 7, respectively, spend most of the class looking around, slacking off and trying to draw the attention of Mr. El, a big-bellied man with a rumbling voice. Eventually he walks over to Djenne, pushes her shoulders down and places her hand on her ankle. She beams.
"Huuuuhhh, hah!" he shouts. "Reach! Grab! Anything you do, you do your best!"
Gears shift abruptly.
"Wuk, Yah! Meditate!" he yells, a spiritual drill sergeant. The students fall to silent contemplation.
 
'I Want Them to See That We Care'
Small things count. Every morning, Aida Pagan pours water across the sidewalk in front of her house and brushes it clean with a broom. "You have to do this," she said. "Otherwise, it just gets terrible. I like to see everything nice and clean, because I live here, my kids live here and I want them to see that we care. It's that obvious."
Ms. Pagan's house, immaculately whitewashed and dressed in two shades of green trim, is one of the showpieces of North Camden, just about the only neighborhood in the city where the perennial promises of renewal seem to be coming true. When she and her husband, a contractor, bought it in 1990 for about $5,000, it was like most of the houses in North Camden after the 1973 riots: a torched shell. "You would stand in the basement and you had a skylight," she said. "You could see floor after floor."
Not only did their friends back in Philadelphia think they were crazy for trying to fix it up, their new neighbors did too. But they took a chance -- not that they were reckless: Ms. Pagan's husband, Michael Datil, encased the front of the house in nearly a foot of concrete to keep out stray bullets -- and they have stayed long enough to see their block turn around.
Around the corner on State Street, two long blocks of mansard-roofed row houses once known as Lawyers Row have been reclaimed, largely through the efforts of community groups like the North Camden Land Trust. The trust has bought and fixed up over 100 units of affordable housing, 76 of which are occupied by families who are building up equity in a sort of lease-to-own arrangement for $285 a month.
Dion Wiles, a foreman for the company doing most of the renovation and a fledgling homeowner himself thanks to the land trust, said, "It's a slow process, but for anyone who had seen this part of Camden 10 years ago, it's just been dramatic. It's a flip, the total opposite." Like many residents of State Street, Mr. Wiles said he had no intention of moving away. (For homeowners, Camden's property values provide another compelling reason to stay put. "You can put $70,000 into fixing up a house and it's worth $40,000 the day you open it," said Daniel Joyce, community outreach director for Guadalupe Family Services, a nonprofit group based in North Camden.)
The two blocks of State Street that have been renovated are practically idyllic, with old-style street lamps and newly planted trees. On one porch, a woman gave two small children a bath with a watering can as they sat in a tiny wading pool. Down the block, James Lee McCain, a retired farm laborer, sat on his porch and watched kids play in the pink-and-blue jungle gym across the street.
"I do love this place," Mr. McCain, 53, said as smells of peanut butter sandwiches and marijuana smoke mingled and drifted over from neighboring porches. "There's so much to see."
 
A Place of Their Own: Frijoles and Quesadillas
Still of the afternoon. A 3-year-old girl and her mother sit in a bright Mexican restaurant on Federal Street in East Camden, the city's most ethnically mixed neighborhood. The girl, Jennifer Cruz, won't touch her taco. She goes to the counter, climbs up on a stool, reaches into the candy jar and pulls out a lollipop shaped like a roast chicken and heavily dusted with chili powder. "No!" Jennifer's mother, Minerva, cries. Too late.
"All she likes is hot stuff."
A man who appears to be retarded walks in, pats the big barrel-shaped jug of papaya water on the counter and brays like a donkey. The co-owner, Marcela Zapata, smiles and pours him a glass.
Business, say Mrs. Zapata and her husband, Eloy, has been only O.K. since they opened Mexico Lindo a year ago. Mrs. Zapata's cooking -- fragrant bowls of frijoles charros, a rich bean-and-bacon soup, fresh mushroom and spinach quesadillas, several varieties of homemade salsa -- is definitely not the problem. Nor is the location, a relatively stable shopping strip near the edge of the city, a few blocks from Route 130. The name of the city is.
"I give out flyers in the suburbs," said Mr. Zapata, 45, who was a police officer in Mexico City and a construction worker here before starting the restaurant. "Cherry Hill, Pennsauken. People are interested, but as soon as they hear Camden, they say, oh, no, Camden, crime, drugs, you know."
Even so, and even though they spend nearly every waking hour in the restaurant -- 13 or 14 hours a day, seven days a week -- it has been worth it. "In a factory, you're not working for anything," said Mrs. Zapata, 32, who made brakes in Glassboro before this. "This is working for the future, for my kids. This is mine."
A Camden teacher, Maria Kulp, comes in to celebrate the last day of school on her way home to Willingboro. There is no authentic Mexican food in Willingboro, says Mrs. Kulp, who comes from Guadalajara.
"Rico, rico, rico," she says, digging into a ham, avocado, jalapenh.
Mrs. Zapata chats up her customer."Are you married, senora?" Mrs. Zapata asks. Yes, she replies.
"You should bring your husband here."
Around the block, at a Vietnamese restaurant called Kim Do, Huyen Tran, 8, and her mother, Sen Tran, are celebrating the third grader's appearance on the honor roll. Huyen, pretty, chubby and shy, dips her spring rolls into a big bowl of peanut sauce and slurps a sweet drink made with beans and coconut milk.
"When we first got to this country I moved to Trenton, but I didn't like it," Sen Tran said. "I moved here because there are more people from my country" -- somewhere between 1,000 and 4,000, depending on whom you ask -- "and if my kids don't understand something in school they can ask a friend, O.K., what's this mean in Vietnamese. They can learn from each other."
Though parents in Camden lament that there is nothing there for their children to do, the gradual decay of the city -- much of it now has the overgrown feel of a small old Southern town -- provides endless recreational opportunities for resourceful youngsters. Two blocks in from Route 30 in East Camden, 11-year-old Rafael Flores and his friends drove Go Karts and dirt bikes around the tire-strewn parking lot of an abandoned bus depot.
"We had these tires set up in a track but people drive cars over it and mess it all up," he said. It did not seem to make much difference.
"I like Camden just the way it is," Rafael said. "I don't care what people say. We can play here and the cops don't ever bug us."
 
Before You Criticize, Come Spend a Day
Citizens of Camden are acutely aware of the city's reputation in the outside world, and they can be understandably defensive.
"People can't say nothing about Camden unless they've been here," said Ms. Pagan's 16-year-old son, Luis. "They can say it's bad or they can say it's good. The only way they're gonna find out is to just spend one day in Camden and see how it is."
Gloria Lyons, Plan Coordinator for Save Our Waterfront, an offshoot of the North Camden Land Trust, still holds on to a 1992 Time magazine article, "Who Could Live Here?" that portrayed Camden as a place beyond saving: "Many American cities have sinkholes that are just as run-down, burned out, crime ridden and drug infested," the article said. "The difference is that this describes all of Camden, not just part of it."
"That story gave no hope," Ms. Lyons said. "Any young person that was beginning to shape their lives and get some kind of direction as to what they wanted to do after high school, this killed it. The only good thing a completely negative article like that does is that it probably helps generate more support from foundations. But it does nothing for the morale of those of us who are working, who do have half a brain."
In 1995, when the city broke its record for murders (58, for a murder rate more than quadruple New York City's that year), the papers and television tracked each killing as if it were the latest jump in the stock market.
"It was like people were rooting it on," said Juan Aguilar, a 23-year-old Web site designer in New Brunswick who grew up in Camden and is trying to open a branch office of his company here. "It was really, really weird."
Being a white person in Camden -- there are about 12,000 -- means always having to explain yourself to friends who live outside the city.
"When I tell people I live in Camden there's always a pregnant pause," said Bill Schwarzman, a 67-year-old insurance underwriter who has lived on a tree-lined block in the far reaches of East Camden, almost in Pennsauken, since 1989.
"Always a pregnant pause. People say, do you have any white people in your neighborhood? I say, yeah, but I live in Camden. There are Hispanic people on my block. There are black people on my block. There are Jews -- O.K., there are Jew," he said, referring to himself. "And Catholics, and all different kinds of people, but we all get along."
 
Street Bazaar On Broadway
Down on Broadway, outside the bus station, business is so slow that even the hustlers get hustled. A man in a blue tank top approaches the table where Oumar Le is selling sunglasses and bootleg cassettes and makes him an offer.
"I'm talking about a substantial opportunity," the man says. "I'm talking about a thousand dollars a month part time." He's talking about delivering the Philadelphia Inquirer. Although the man buys a pair of mirrored shades and leaves a three-dollar tip, Mr. Le is noncommittal.
"I don't understand English, so how can I sell newspapers," he says, in French, after the man drives off. Mr. Le, who is from Senegal, recently relocated his stand from Brooklyn at the recommendation of relatives who live in Camden. Ca va? he is asked.
"Ca va peu," he says, "and I don't know why. I'll give it two more weeks and if it doesn't pick up I'm leaving."
A few minutes later another man comes by, flicks his wrist and unfurls a cascade of flavored condoms. "I got grape, root beer, strawberry." The vendors, sitting under a tree next to the Vietnamese fruit salad cart, politely decline.
"We're all married," says Abdul Zbabir, who sells bootleg Tommy Hilfiger T-shirts. "If I use a condom with my wife, she'll say where were you last night and make me go sleep on the couch for two weeks. Sleep on the couch and go to Cooper Hospital in the morning. And get me a receipt."
Back at Kea'Boos, a dodgy-looking is trying to sell Dave Moto a matching pair of rugs. They are about the size of bath mats and look suspiciously mass-produced, but he insists they are real Oriental rugs, worth $80 apiece. He'll take $20 for both.
"What am I gonna sell them for if I pay $10 for a rug like that?" Mr. Moto says. After several minutes of haggling, the man settles for $11.
No transaction is too small for Mr. Moto, 38, now in his fourth year in the junk business. A former maintenance man for Best Western Motels, Mr. Moto (the name is indeed Japanese; he is of black, Irish, Japanese and American Indian descent) got his start as a laborer at the 15-stall flea market around the side of the building he now occupies. Soon he graduated to fixing lawn mowers for one of the vendors.
After he saved some money, he opened a bike repair shop at the flea market. Early on, an old junkman named Zack gave him some priceless advice. " 'Dave,' he said, 'if you want to be successful in this business, all you have to do is invest $100 a day in it.' That's what I did, every day. Buy more product, more stuff. And if I made $500 one day, I spent $300 back." Soon he had three stalls. A friend got him a job doing demolition on a big building and Mr. Moto was told he could take home anything he could carry.
He hauled away cabinets, washing machines, dryers. He rented warehouse space and sold appliances out of it. When the motel where his wife, Ida, was head of housekeeping upgraded its decor, Mr. Moto got the contract to haul the old furniture out.
"I sold all my appliances to a guy for $5,000 and moved in everything from the motel. A guy came into the flea market looking for beds. I said not only beds, I have furniture and everything, a whole warehouse complete. He paid me $10,000, hauled everything away and I didn't have to touch nothing."
In December 1995, he opened Kea'Boos, named for his 14-year-old daughter, Kakia, and his 13-year-old son, David Jr., better known as Boo. The store has provided an endless series of challenges, but nothing a skilled junkman cannot handle.
"There used to be a stairwell in back that went up to the second floor, and the thieves used to get up on there and kick the windows out and cut through," Mr. Moto said. "So I bought a welding torch and I burned the steps off and scrapped the steel to buy the wood to cover the windows."
No steady source of electricity means no computer, which means no way to keep track of what's in stock. Which can cause problems in a big room where all the merchandise other than the big-ticket items -- rows of washing machines, heaps of toilets and sinks, a pile of mattresses leaning against the wall like a string of dominoes caught in mid-fall -- appears to be filed under "miscellaneous."
In the front corner of the store, within a few square feet and in no discernible order, were a set of pylons, an inflatable Christmas tree, a fluorescent lamp with its bulbs painted red, Snuggles the fabric softener bear pinned under a leaning heap of strollers, a pink baby doll caught under half a lawn mower and several empty heart-shaped Russell Stover candy boxes.
"If somebody comes in and asks for something, we know if we've bought it before," he said, "but often times we can't find it."
On the whole, though, business is pretty good. "You never get rich," he said, "but it's better than being out on the corner. "
The operation is very much a family affair. Mr. Moto has set up a brother with two of his old stalls in the flea market and another brother and Mrs. Moto help run the big store. Boo, when he's not repairing engines or hammering together a working bicycle chain out of the parts of several defective ones, runs an Italian ice stand.
On a recent Saturday, Boo tore into the parking lot in Rafael Flores's Go Kart, which he had just bought for $150. He said it was worth $700. "The back rim is bent, and it needed a chain, and the carburetor needs fixed," he said. "But I can fix it."
 
A Preacher's Call To Self Esteem
Sunday means church, for just about everyone. At St. Joseph's Pro-Cathedral, about 300 worshipers attend the 10 A.M. Vietnamese mass, sandwiched between the 8:30 English mass and the 11:30 Spanish mass.
In a spare, dingy apartment in South Camden, a worn 32-year-old woman struggling against the H.I.V. virus , on-and-off drug addiction and the disintegration of her family, considers her options.
It is the day of the Puerto Rican parade, and she wants to go, but she is afraid she will start drinking or maybe worse. So she walks over to Antioch Baptist Church, a fortress-like black church across the street from a housing project.
The preacher, Anthony Gardner, seems to speak directly to her.
"We are by no means our faults!" Mr. Gardner thunders to a chorus of amens. "I don't care if you have experienced in your own life drugs and alcohol, the Lord has a purpose for you."
Mr. Gardner, a superhero-like figure in a white cape with yellow trim, struts and bobs like a prizefighter, sweat pouring down his face, horizontal folds in the back of his neck tightening.
"You are more than what the television says about you," he says. "You are more than what the newspapers write about you. I'm more than what society says I am. I'm more than what the police department says I am. I'm more, I'm more, I'm more!"
Afterward, the woman is one of a half-dozen people in the church who come to re-commit their lives to Jesus.
"I'm just asking everyone to just please help me and pray with me," she says in a small voice. "I'm really missing my children a lot. I'm not with them now, my parents have my children. I have to stay clean, I need the power to just stay clean and strong." She is escorted to a side room and offered counseling and information on treatment programs.
"I'm going to go home and cook something to eat," she says as she leaves. "I have a roommate, she's there, I just want to go home and let her know what happened in church today."
Across town, Ms. Pagan and Mr. Datil are having some relatives over for a post-parade game of dominoes and a few beers. Four or five years ago, Mr. Datil says, he did not feel safe enough to set up the domino table on the sidewalk. "Now it's calmed down a lot," he says.
He points out his wife's father, in front of his house across the street, and her sister and brother-in-law. "The best security is family," he says. "Everybody watching your toes."
Two little girls chase each other down the block with water guns.
"They shouldn't be running in the street like that," he says, and lays down another tile.

HEADLINE: Rental Fever: Temperature Drops -- a Bit

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY'S free-market rental fever of a year ago, fueled by tales of 30 percent increases, bidding wars, broken promises and C.I.A.-like credit checks -- many of them true -- has abated. A bit.
It's not that rents have plummeted or demand has slackened, as they did during the real estate recession of the early 90's. But a broad-brush portrait of the rental scene would have to be painted in varied shades, with red-hot spots for certain niches of the market, and cooler hues for others. 
 In Manhattan, surveys compiled by leading residential rental brokers -- subject to the caveat that their samples are limited to their own deals in their favored income sectors, mostly at the high end of the market -- display a spectrum of rent fluctuations. The borough has benefited from a burst of new construction and conversion of office space, helping, in part, to temper the rental frenzy. So most of the price shifts over the last year were in the range of 3 to 5 percent increases, depending on the type and location of the apartment, sprinkled with decreases of 2 to 5 percent in certain categories. But there were also some extremes -- a 34.1 percent leap, for example, in the price of a one-bedroom apartment in the posh precincts between Park and Fifth Avenues.
In the other boroughs, according to impressions offered by community-based brokers, rents have edged up in lock step -- with rates in more affluent neighborhoods like brownstone Brooklyn an incremental level below Manhattan -- to the point where would-be renters in working-class communities clamor for any decent two-bedroom apartment going for less than $1,000 a month. In poor neighborhoods, where all that the free market will bear are prices just below or barely above regulated rents, construction of new apartments remains severely constrained and, as a result, vacancies are scarce and hundreds of thousands of people pay more than half their income for rent.
An unusual opportunity to scan the rental landscape was offered recently by the release of Census Bureau statistics compiled for New York City's 1996 Housing and Vacancy Survey, a voluminous report that will serve as the statistical foundation for city housing policy until the next study is completed in three years. Among a host of other kinds of data, the survey sampled unregulated rents throughout the city.
Using those statistics, researchers at the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law calculated the median, or midpoint, of all rents in 1996 for each of the five boroughs and in 49 smaller areas, and then compared them to median rents compiled for the 1993 Housing and Vacancy Survey.
Although the rents surveyed last year are, by definition, not quite up to date and the breakdowns by apartment size can be skewed (by inadequate samples and by some survey subjects either declining to disclose or understating their rents), the data offer a generalized view of the direction of free-market rents over the last three years, particularly since the recession of the early 1990's.
According to the N.Y.U. calculations, the median unregulated rent for apartments of all sizes in Manhattan, both above and below 96th Street, rose 17.3 percent, from $1,000 in 1993 to $1,173 in 1996. In Brooklyn, the median unregulated rent rose 8.7 percent, from $575 in 1993 to $625 last year.
Median rents for all sizes of apartments in the Bronx rose from $600 in 1993 to $650 in 1996, an 8.33 percent increase. In Queens, the increase was 7.69 percent, from $650 in 1993 to $700 in 1996. And on Staten Island, the jump was 7.83 percent, from $575 to $620.
The comparison of median rents by apartment size throughout the city shows a wide, if not surprising, range of change over the three years -- from a drop of 5.88 percent for a studio in the Bronx (from $425 to $400) to a whopping 66.67 percent increase (from $1,200 to $2,000) for a three-bedroom in Manhattan. A seemingly counterintuitive finding that two-bedroom apartments in Manhattan dropped 10 percent (from $1,500 to $1,350) was largely attributable, the N.Y.U. researchers said, to a decline in median rents above 96th Street.
In the last 12 months, the churning of the rental market has played out against a backdrop of political posturing and fierce infighting over the future of rent regulation, which, after all the turmoil, was left relatively unscathed by the State Legislature. Of the 2,027,000 apartments in New York City, 1,123,000 are regulated by the state or the city and 576,000 are unregulated.
The regulation debate had some effect on the free market, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "There was some warehousing of apartments by landlords in anticipation of potential deregulation," Dr. Wachter said, citing anecdotal reports. "This may be why we haven't seen big gains, even though the stock market is going strong."
The vagaries of the market have been visited upon Larry and Denise Shapiro -- he an architect, she a television marketing and licensing executive. With their sublease on Madison Avenue expiring, the Shapiros at first considered buying an apartment, but decided that sales prices were too inflated at this time and would come down in a few years. So, over the last four months, they looked at somewhere between 50 and 75 rental apartments, usually with their 5-year-old son, Reed, in tow.
"We set a ceiling of $4,000 a month, which we thought was very high," Mrs. Shapiro said.
Most agents, Mr. Shapiro said, "told us, 'For just a thousand dollars more, or two, we can find just what you want.' "
What the Shapiros wanted was a large "classic six" -- a three-bedroom or a two-bedroom with a maid's room -- to accommodate their Steinway grand, their dining-room table, Mr. Shapiro's great-grandmother's partners' desk (the kind that seats two people facing each other) and a very sizable sofa.
"At the beginning, they told us don't worry, there would be plenty of apartments available in our price range," Mrs. Shapiro said. "Then we started to get nervous. I was amazed at how many agents would not listen to our needs. After giving them very specific details about our search -- classic six, west of Lex, prewar, prime lease -- they would come back to us with white-brick buildings on Second or First, or sublets of co-ops."
"And they came back with things that were $5,000, $6,000 even $8,000," Mr. Shapiro said.
Eventually, the Shapiros found something close to what they wanted. And by the end of this month, they will move into a large, prewar classic six (a bit out of their preferred location) on East 96th Street.
"I have to say we feel lucky to get the apartment with the specs we wanted," Mrs. Shapiro said.
"And for what's considered an affordable rent these days," Mr. Shapiro said. The rent: $3,800 a month, or $200 lower than the original ceiling.
The Shapiros will, however, have to cut that big sofa in half to get it through the door.
Observers of the city's real estate market often see a dichotomy between Manhattan -- powered by the surging financial markets -- and the other boroughs. As the Wharton School's Dr. Wachter pointed out: "The stock market last year obviously had an incredible year. The real estate market moved in a similar way, though not quite as dramatically. So, given the huge increases of last year, this has been a year of slight retrenchment. But I think this is a bit of a breather, just a breather."
At the same time, as Arthur Margon, acting director of the Real Estate Institute at New York University, said: "The strength of the economy is not uniform, so there are significant parts of the population that are not enjoying the economic growth of the past couple of years. And in neighborhoods where those people are looking for housing, the market rent can't go up very much because the potential tenants don't have the increases in income to support it."
But the market might also be seen as a malleable whole with potent forces exerting varying degrees of pressure at any given moment.
Certainly, a force in the market has been the record profits on Wall Street, and, more specifically, the jump from $6.1 billion to $8.1 billion in year-end bonuses paid to financial workers in 1995 and then in 1996.
The big profits on Wall Street, along with momentum in the national and regional economy, have spurred increased employment in the city, said John L. Weiting, the regional commissioner for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the 12-month period ending June 1, the city added 51,000 jobs in the private sector, a larger gain than the 44,000 recorded in the prior 12-month period. "A lot of the increases have come in business and management services, in entertainment," Commissioner Weiting said, "and we're still seeing increases in health services."
The so-called FIRE sector -- finance, insurance and real estate -- also saw an employment increase, of about 6,000 jobs, in the last year, "and that reversed a decline in the prior 12 months," Mr. Weiting added.
Another factor in housing demand was increasing population. There were sharp declines in New York City's population between 1960 and 1980. But between 1980 and 1990, according to the Census Bureau, the city's population grew 3.5 percent, from 7,071,639 to 7,322,564. And the influx -- largely attributable to the city's immigration explosion -- has continued during the 90's.
According to City Planning Department statistics, based on Immigration and Naturalization Service data, 1.25 million immigrants have settled in the city since 1982, with the rate rising in recent years. During the 1980's, about 86,000 immigrants settled in the city each year; that increased to 112,598 in the first half of the 90's.
At the same time, while showing some improvement, housing vacancies remain low. According to the Housing and Vacancy Survey, the number of vacant apartments in the city rose from 70,345 in 1993 to 81,256 last year. That constitutes an increase in the vacancy rate from 3.44 percent to 4.01 percent, with 5 percent the statutory level for declaration of an official housing emergency -- a condition that has existed since the end of World War II.
And while housing construction did increase last year, it was nowhere near the 40,000 new units that some scholars contend are needed to replenish the city's stock each year. According to the Planning Department, building permits for the construction of 8,632 units were issued in the city in 1996 -- a significant increase over 1995, when 5,135 permits were issued, and certainly an improvement over the 4,466 permits in 1994, the city's worst year for housing starts in a decade.
"It's encouraging to see that the numbers are beginning to show real improvement and, hopefully, that trend will continue and even accelerate," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission.
Citing the 40,000-unit-a-year goal as "extremely ambitious and, frankly, not realistic," Mr. Rose nevertheless agreed that the 4,466 units started in 1994 constituted "a very serious situation, not just in terms of supply at the given moment, but also in the long-term health of the city's housing stock."
"A major goal of this administration has been to spur new production," Mr. Rose said, "and we'd like to get over 10,000 units a year. In fact, we're already beginning to see, especially in Manhattan, production that will affect the marketplace." Forty percent of the new housing in the city last year was in Manhattan.
AND so, even if the housing market is viewed as a whole, the dichotomy between housing activity in Manhattan and the other boroughs does exist.
According to "Housing Conditions and Problems in New York City," a study by Michael Schill and Benjamin Scafidi of the N.Y.U. Law School's Real Estate Center, 27 percent -- or 525,750 -- of the city's households pay more than half their income for rent.
"Problems of grossly unaffordable housing were particularly prevalent in the Bronx, where one third of all renters pay more than half their income for rent," Professor Schill said. The Federal Government definition of affordable housing is a household that pays no more than 30 percent of its income for rent. "Therefore, the 1996 survey suggests that affordability problems among renters have reached crisis proportions, particularly for poor people," Professor Schill said.
Much of the city's new housing construction has been in the Manhattan financial district, where city tax abatements have made it possible for developers to convert outdated office space into residential property.
"The downtown market, of course, has seen new construction in the Wall Street area," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a leading rental broker in Manhattan, "and it has been met with demand and price levels which, I think, far exceeded most people's expectations. At 25 Broad and 45 Wall, the prices are almost the same as the Upper East Side."
A large studio at 25 Broad Street, a building called the Exchange, where occupancy is to start in September, is renting for $1,850, while a two-bedroom is starting at $2,500, and a three-bedroom with 2 1/2 baths is starting at $4,800. At 40 Wall Street, studios are starting at $1,300; one-bedrooms at $1,650; two-bedrooms at $2,770, and three bedrooms at $3,100.
In general, Ms. Packes said: "The Manhattan market is up reasonably, but not hugely, in the studio and one-bedroom categories. But the two-bedroom category is showing far more substantial increases, and I think that's due to the fact that there is demand for two-bedrooms in the sales market, which is depleting the supply of available two-bedrooms for rent."
Feathered Nest issues quarterly reports on its sales in the luxury market. Except for two extreme examples, its most recent survey showed that price fluctuations in the second quarter of this year, as compared to the end of 1996, ranged from a decrease of 4.3 percent for a studio in a non-doorman building on the Upper West Side (from $1,450 to $1,425) to an increase of 16.8 percent (from $4,925 to $5,750) for a three-bedroom unit in a doorman building on the Upper East Side. The two extreme examples, both between Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue, were the 34.1 percent increase (from $2,125 to $2,850) for a one-bedroom apartment in a non-doorman building, and a 17.2 percent decrease (from $5,100 to $4,225) for a two-bedroom unit in a doorman building.
"There's been very little change in the past year," said Cathe LeBlanc, managing director of the rental division for the Corcoran Group. "What we saw in the last quarter of '96 was a leveling and a dip in rents. But then the strong economy in the financial, entertainment and law industries created a much stronger demand than we anticipated. Those industries did more hiring than the real estate market anticipated, so we've seen an increase in price in the last three months."
A comparison of Corcoran reports for the second quarter of this year and the second quarter of 1996 shows only small fluctuations in rents. For most high-end apartments in Manhattan below 96th Street, the reports indicate, the rents of studios increased 3.3 percent (from $1,248 to $1,290) over the last 12 months, while they dropped 3.6 percent (from $5,984 to $5,767) for three-bedroom apartments.
Navigating the Manhattan rental market recently were three college buddies -- Jay Abramovitz, Aaron Davis and Jason Sobol -- all 22 years old, all from Harvard and all swept up in the Wall Street hiring wave. They hoped to find strength in numbers: $1,000 apiece.
That's what the three June graduates decided each could afford for a three-bedroom unit. "I was glad to have two good friends with me entering into this apartment-hunting process," said Mr. Davis, who grew up in Roslyn, L.I.
"To be honest, it was a little depressing at first," said Mr. Abramovitz, a native of Columbus, Ohio.
The three young men spent four intense days in the city last month, trudging from apartment to apartment -- 10 in all -- between 60th and 80th Streets on the Upper West Side. Eventually, they had to set their sights on a somewhat smaller apartment a bit farther north -- a two-bedroom with a large living room on West 96th Street, renting for $2,500. "A nice bonus," Mr. Abramovitz said.
Three guys, two bedrooms? "They actually advertise it as a two-bedroom convertible," Mr. Abramovitz said. The solution: installation of a temporary wall, dividing that spacious living room, at a cost of $800.
IN other parts of the city, post-recession rental pressures were readily apparent in the Housing and Vacancy Survey data compiled by the N.Y.U. researchers.
In Queens, the median rent for all sizes of apartments in one statistical area (Forest Hills-Rego Park-Kew Gardens-Woodside) rose 15.38 percent, from $650 to $750, between 1993 and 1996. In another (Middle Village-Ridgewood), the increase was 21.74 percent, from $575 to $700.
Rental units are relatively scarce on Staten Island, but those few also recorded increases between 1993 and 1996 -- 13.64 percent, from $550 to $625, on the North Shore; 8.33 percent, from $600 to $650, in the middle of the island.
The Borough Park section of Brooklyn, according to the N.Y.U. data, experienced a 21.5 percent increase for all sizes of apartments over the three years, from $535 to $650. Bay Ridge was unchanged, at $600. But in Brooklyn Heights-Fort Greene, the increase was 8.57 percent, from $700 to $760.
Katherine Lilly, owner of Realty on the Greene in Fort Greene, put the changes in her community into far broader context: "The big increase that you saw last year wasn't so big, as opposed to just the market correcting itself from the huge drop in the early 90's. Because, in reality, I think, the rents last year and this year were maybe slightly higher than the market in 1988 and '89 -- probably the height before the market collapsed."
But in less affluent communities of the city, rent increases squeezed against the wall of scarce vacancy.
"The thing that we're looking at in particular," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group for the poor, "is the steady diminution of rental units in the lower end of the market."
Using the new Housing and Vacancy Survey statistics, the Community Service Society has calculated that 112,000 housing units renting for $500 or less in 1993 had surpassed that mark by last year, "which represents, I'm afraid, 20 percent of the stock of those units," Mr. Jones said.
"A large number of those units," he said, "are the only ones available for people who are either working poor or on public assistance -- neither of which group has seen an increase in wages or benefits to meet this kind of rent increase."
The N.Y.U. data shows that in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, median rents increased 12.1 percent, from $535 to $600, between 1993 and 1996. In Manhattan, above 96th Street, the increase was 10.19 percent, from $530 to $584.
And in the Bronx -- rebounding from the boarded-up desolation of the 70's, yet still pocked by poverty -- the statistical area that includes Morrisania, East Tremont, Highbridge, University Heights and South Concourse saw a 40.85 percent jump in median rents over the three years, from $426 to $600.
Earl Washington is president of United Realty Services, based on the Grand Concourse near Yankee Stadium. "A lot of people are rediscovering the Bronx, in proximity to Manhattan," Mr. Washington said. "And so there's a steady stream of people looking for a two-bedroom apartment for less than $1,000 -- and my market is low- to moderate-income persons."
"Fordham Hills, which is a very nice co-op," Mr. Washington continued, "is doing rentals at about $1,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. And that's again, working people."

HEADLINE: COPING;
The March of the Empty Suitcases

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
THE summer people have arrived. They are cluttering the streets, walking slowly, looking stupid. They are smoking in the subway and drinking red wine in the park. The young ones are nearly naked. Many are barefoot. The old ones are in clashing plaids. All are slung with sacks filled with water, hard currency, caps, jackets, inflatable back rests and maps they will pull out and unfold anywhere, halting traffic. I hate them. I wish they would go home.
Why? Because they are on vacation and I am not? Because their currency is harder than mine? Because they feel free to saunter, saunter, in my neighborhood? Real people don't saunter unless they are being walked by dogs. Where do these summer people think they are, Western Europe in the 50's and 60's, Asia in the 70's, Eastern Europe in the early 90's? They point at a scruffy man staggering under a load of seltzer in plastic bottles and they say something in hard currency about his native clothing. Who do they think I am, local color? 
 "It's worse than you think," said my friend Jonathan Kandell, the travel writer. "They didn't come here to make fun of you, which would at least be a valid cultural statement, or even to take in the sights. They came to buy clothes at one-third the price they'd pay in Europe.
"Go down to Century 21 and find out what's going on. There's a reason the salespeople speak a smattering of five languages. These people you hate are secretaries from Stuttgart and unemployed from Paris. They come with empty suitcases. They get Armani, Versace, Ralph Lauren, and sell it when they get home. Pays for their vacation. Sometimes they come with orders."
Now I am really steamed. It was bad enough when the Eurotrash arrived, rich kids and their natural predators, art dealers, and began turning SoHo and 57th Street into theme parks. Now their poorer cousins have arrived, the economy class, and they are turning the city into a shopping mall.
Just look at them in the Union Square Greenmarket, shaking berries into their mouths. They point at a 25-year-old blond woman at the Seven Pines cut-flower stand and say something in hard currency about natives. Was this the way I once looked at people in Les Halles?
"Relax," said Ruth Levine, the flower seller, who just quit her $40,000 publicity job at Simon & Schuster. "It's O.K., I'm having fun. This is a great mind wash, and the people are interesting. I sometimes felt like a baby sitter in publishing, and I just didn't believe in all the books I was selling. I believe in delphiniums. And just smell this rose."
Ms. Levine is taking a poetry course at the Writer's Voice at the West Side Y.M.C.A. while she decides what to do next. She had worked in publishing publicity since graduating from New York University in 1993. She says she really likes the farmers at the market, especially after four years of "well-bred adults taking endless marketing meetings and treating each other like kids." And she thinks it's fun talking to the summer people.
Grumbling, I head home, refusing to jump off the sidewalk for a delivery biker from Zen Palate, the overpriced, undertasty vegetarian restaurant near Union Square. In a dark moment, I imagine him plowing into a grove of summer people, scattering them to the Beth Israel emergency room. Mayor Giuliani would visit them and finally declare war on sidewalk bikers, encouraging the Departments of City Planning and Transportation's greenway network to promote cycling. My current favorite Council member, Andrew Eristoff, has been making dawn raids to stencil "No Bikes" on Upper East Side corners where his constituents have been mowed down.
Now I feel guilty wishing harm to innocent travelers. Maybe I just want them to share local anxieties. They were oblivious to the rent control panic or to the possibility that Sammy the Bull Gravano, 20 summers after Son of Sam gave his name to a law denying criminals profits from their books and movies, may be getting more hard currency from the tales of his murders than are all his victims' families.
And summer people will never share with me the joy of watching Barney's on West 17th Street close forever. Hateful attraction. That was where my mother took me for extra roomy pants at the Extremely Fat Boys Shop. How I loved the demolition of S. Klein's On the Square. That was where we shopped at the Crisco Kid Shop (for boys who were fat in the can).
So how can I hate the summer people when I feel so sorry for them? They don't live here. Eventually they will have to go home. But I must also be true to my scruffy, fat, native, soft-currency self. When one summer person stopped traffic last week to unfold a map and ask, "Where Niketown?" I could answer only, "The one in the South Bronx or the one on Staten Island?"

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE;
A Small-Scale Start, Perhaps, for a Children's Insurance Program

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: PATERSON

 BODY:
A state-subsidized children's insurance program called Children First, envisioned by Governor Whitman 18 months ago, is expected to start in September, officials said last week.
But the program, with $5 million in seed money allocated by the Legislature in June, will begin only in a limited way because full financing to cover the 100,000 children eligible remains uncertain. 
 The program would start by offering policies to the parents of 5,000 children under the seed grant. To insure all the eligible children, the state would require Federal block grant money, donations by large corporations and health maintenance organizations in the state, or profits from the proposed national settlement with the tobacco industry, none of which is certain at this time.
"Seventeen percent of our charity-care dollars are spent on children, so we know that if we can insure kids, it will do some good here," said the Health Commissioner, Len Fishman.
The program is part of a larger state initiative to deal with an estimated 1.1 million uninsured New Jerseyans. Care for them has usually come through a network of charity hospitals, their bills partly covered through $453 million from the state's Unemployment Insurance Fund and matching Federal grants. The rest is covered by hospital revenue.
But the mandate to use the Unemployment Insurance Fund for charity care will lapse at the end of the year, leaving state health officials scrambling for other permanent and cost-effective financing.
Children First is one of these, and a 36-member panel of health experts, lawyers and business leaders was commissioned last month to find others.
"We need to put some order in chaos, so that we are not chasing a patchwork of funds after every election year and people are given the sort of health care that assures them some semblance of health," said Sister Jane F. Brady, who runs St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center here and sits on the committee.
As with all publicly administered charity care in the state, there are many uncertainties left to wade through in Children First. Until recently, there was no source of money for the program; a proposal to raise the cigarette tax last year failed in the Legislature. And the state has continued to resist any structuring of the program until it figures out its share of the $16 billion recently promised by President Clinton for a national children's health care policy, and what strings will be attached.
Governor Whitman is also waiting for news from the proposed $368 billion national tobacco settlement, which is to be split among the states if it ever passes Congressional muster. She has pledged at least $100 million from any settlement to help pay for low-income health care in New Jersey.
With little known about either the financing or structure of Children First, the corporations and H.M.O.'s expected to contribute to the program have been reluctant to commit themselves.
"We have members who participate in other states' programs who would be willing to participate here if there was just some more flesh on the bone," said Paul R. Langevin, a spokesman for the New Jersey H.M.O. Association, whose members insure more than 90 percent of the state's residents in commercial managed-care plans.
According to the Department of Health and Senior Services, Children First would emphasize preventive health care, offering comprehensive medical coverage. It would be open to families with incomes below 250 percent of the Federal poverty level ($39,000 for a family of four, for example) who cannot receive health coverage through employers or a public program. Those families who qualified would be enrolled in an H.M.O., paying a monthly contribution of between $5 and $15.
Health care experts said the state was likely to use the administrative structure of Health Access New Jersey to sign up applicants and track their progress. That two-year-old program provides subsidized health insurance for people who cannot afford a policy.
Although the original goal was to broaden it to cover all those who use charity care, the program is being phased out by the state in favor of Children First.
One of those hoping to enroll his son in this latest incarnation of subsidized care is Slawomir Winsiewski, who laid out his troubles as an uninsured worker while waiting for 10-year-old Jakub to see a doctor at St. Joseph's.
His tale began last fall with the loss of a job at a warehouse and the insurance that it provided for Jakub, who has cystic fibrosis. When that job ended, he did not find another until spring.
Although he now works 60 hours a week as a landscaper for a large company, his family still lacks company-sponsored insurance. And making less than $20,000 a year, Mr. Winsniewski cannot afford private insurance on his own.
"It's tough," he said, shaking his head. "It's really tough."

HEADLINE: LOOKING BACK;
The Darkest Hours of a Dark Time

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
THE dinner with the police brass was going well. The East Harlem Community Corporation, a local community action group, wanted to thank the commanders of the 23d and 25th Precincts for help with a local festival.
But as Roberto Anazagasti, a subway signalman and the group's volunteer chairman, raised his glass of sangria for another toast, the lights went out in Ponce de Leon, a Spanish restaurant in East Harlem. People gasped. Then a strange scratching, twisting sound could be heard. Someone was pulling the iron gate off the store next door. "The looting had begun," Mr. Anazagasti said. 
 In Port Chester, 20 miles north, Arthur Hauspurg, the president of Consolidated Edison, was playing tennis when the court's lights began to flicker, then dim. "I thought it was a local problem," Mr. Hauspurg recalled. But when he got home, his wife had packed a bag full of sandwiches. Con Ed had called. "She knew it was going to be a long night," Mr. Hauspurg said.
Twenty years ago tonight, shortly after 9:30, Con Ed suffered a huge power failure, plunging nearly nine million people in the city and Westchester County into darkness. But unlike the big Northeast blackout, on Nov. 9, 1965, when there was little civil disturbance, and something like a Battle of Britain camaraderie prevailed in New York, the 1977 blackout led to widespread chaos and looting in the South Bronx, Harlem and especially in Bushwick, Brooklyn, the city's hardest-hit neighborhood.
Explanations for the looting varied, most of them centering on the weather. The 1965 power failure struck on a chilly autumn afternoon, and most people stayed indoors. But the 1977 blackout hit on one of the hottest nights of the year, when school was out, tempers were short, and people were milling around the streets.
But it also seems clear, from the vantage point of 20 years, that the city had reached a psychological low point in 1977. The economy was bleeding jobs, and the city's population was shrinking. An underclass -- troubled, volatile and violent -- was growing. New York had narrowly averted bankruptcy the year before, and City Hall continued to slash services. Time magazine had depicted Mayor Abraham D. Beame on its cover as a beggar with a tin cup.
"In 1965, in many parts of the city, the blackout was almost a party," Mr. Hauspurg, 71, said. "New York laughed its way through that blackout. But in 1977, the whole social scene had changed in the intervening years."
Robert R. McDonald, the director of the Museum of the City of New York, sees the 1977 blackout as coming at the worst possible time. "There were already great strains on social cohesiveness, the Vietnam war, racial tensions, and then this demoralizing downturn in the economy," he said.
"What the blackout underlined was a loss of control, a loss of faith in technology that we have just now begun to climb out of. If any good came out of the blackout, it was a realization that everyone was vulnerable and that in the end everyone had to somehow attempt to work together."
That was what Mr. Anazagasti said he tried to do in the 25 hours the power was out. He drove through the streets of East Harlem with a bullhorn, trying to shame the looters, to little effect. "I get emotional when I remember this," he said last week, sobbing softly. "I said it was wrong, please stop. I yelled, 'No es parte de la cultura nuestra' ('This is not part of our culture'). "
In Bushwick, a third-year medical student, Carl St. Martin, was studying his internal medicine textbook by the bare light bulb in his living room when it and the rest of the lights went out. A few minutes later, as Mr. St. Martin talked to neighbors, he was startled to see a man carrying a large couch on his back and another man trying to take it away from him. "Get away from me!" the first man was saying. "They got plenty of stuff up there." The man was referring to the stores on Broadway nearby, where looters were massing.
Mayhem was spreading, Dr. St. Martin recalls, and he dashed to Wyckoff Heights Hospital to volunteer in the emergency room. "The looters were looting other looters," said Dr. St. Martin, now 42 and a neurologist in Forest Hills, Queens, "and the fists and the knives were coming out."
The looting in Bushwick persisted the next day, when Artemio Santiago, the manager of what was the George Foti clothing store at 1273 Broadway, two blocks from Dr. St. Martin's apartment, arrived at 9:30 A.M. to open for business.
"We were good until about 1 o'clock," recalled Mr. Santiago, 57 and a salesman at Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. "All the other stores just had windows, but we had an iron gate. But pretty soon we were the only store left, and they pulled down the gate." The store, he said, lost $200,000 in inventory. "I felt like it was my own place," Mr. Santiago said, "like I lost everything."
In Manhattan, Dr. Robert Holzman, an assistant hospital epidemiologist at Bellevue Hospital Center, had other worries on the blackout's second day.
"All I thought about was water," said Dr. Holzman, 57 and now Bellevue's chief epidemiologist. "The pumps that provide water were down. My job means infection control. We needed water to wash our hands with, our instruments with. We needed water for the toilets. The first thing I did was to organize bucket brigades to get water to the places we needed it."
The Mayor's office set up a joint command post with One Police Plaza. The police had a functioning backup power system. But with the photocopy and mimeograph machines out, a single secretary had to pound out news releases on a manual typewriter five at a time, one original and four carbon copies.
At first, Mr. Beam said, he did not realize the extent of the emergency. Facing a re-election challenge, he had been addressing a group of the elderly residents at Co-Op City, the huge apartment complex in the Bronx. "I was in midsentence of some speech," Mr. Beame, 91, recalled."And I thought the auditorium going pitch black was just a temporary thing." But aides quickly hustled him into a car for a frenzied drive to City Hall.
Characteristically, Edward I. Koch, who defeated Mayor Beame in the Democratic primary that September and won the general election two months later, sees the power failure in political terms. "The blackout in 1977," Mr. Koch, 72, said with a chuckle. "Ohhhhhh! The one that got me elected."
Mr. Koch described New York as at a nadir in 1977, with Mayor Beame unwilling or unable to bring order to an increasingly chaotic city. "People were ashamed of being New Yorkers," Mr. Koch said, explaining that he backed the deployment of the National Guard to keep peace during the blackout, a move that Mr. Beame vetoed as potentially dangerous because armed guardsmen might provoke more confrontations than they quelled.
Mr. Anazagasti, now the general manager of Nuevo el Barrio, a housing advocacy group, says the blackout helped New York, if only as a wake-up call for the most blighted neighborhoods. "We began to view looting for what it is, self-destructive," he said. "You cannot trash the supermarket in your neighborhood because tomorrow your kids will not have milk to drink."

$12 Million Helps Restart Plan for Pier

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
The redevelopment of Pier A at the Battery has been on the drawing board in one form or another for a decade. Delays stemmed from financing difficulties and the reluctance of a developer, Wings Point Associates, to include certain businesses on the refurbished pier.
"We didn't want any chain stores or restaurants," Carole Taylor, a partner in Wings Point, said. "But chains are what's bankable." 
 The project remained stalled in the Koch and Dinkins administrations, Ms. Taylor said. But then the city's Economic Development Corporation obtained $8 million in Federal bond guarantees and a $4.2 million grant from the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for a visitors' center, and Southern California Edison agreed to be an equity partner.
That cleared the way for work on a new $26 million design that includes a catering hall, restaurant, gift shop and the tourist center.
On June 18 ground was broken at the pier, which was built in 1886 and whose three-story Victorian shed, a city landmark, was headquarters for the police harbor unit and an Ellis Island ferry terminal. The project is scheduled to be finished in two years.
"Don't expect another South Street Seaport," said Ms. Taylor, explaining that the developers, now called WPA/Edison, were looking for far less of a shopping atmosphere.
Ms. Taylor said the company held a 49-year lease and would pay rent to the city based partly on income from the businesses. The first year's rent is expected to total $750,000, Ms. Taylor said.
Tenants who have already been chosen include Abigail Kirsch of Tappan Hill for the catering center and Billy and Anita Long, who run a supper club, Metropolitan, in Glen Cove on Long Island, for the first-floor restaurant.
Ms. Taylor said several shops had expressed interest, but she declined to be more specific.
She said the Harbor Park Visitors' Center would focus on museums, landmarks and other attractions around New York Harbor, including Snug Harbor on Staten Island, the Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn and Battery Park. Pier A will also be headquarters for Op Sail 2000, on the Fourth of July in three years, Ms. Taylor said.
"Our goal is to entice New Yorkers downtown," she said.
Charles Millard, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, sees the catering hall as setting Pier A apart from other waterfront attractions.
"It's going to be beautiful," Mr. Millard said. "In 20 years, we'll all be reminiscing about the wonderful weddings we attended there." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Waiting for Boomers To Discover the Road

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
THIS is the time of year when America's love for the wilds finds its fullest expression, when all that a family needs is some blue sky, towering mountains, crystal rivers and, perhaps, a fully equipped kitchen with microwave, two showers, a queen-size bed and a satellite dish offering phone, television and Internet connections, all mounted on wheels.
The recreational vehicle, or RV, is as much a part of summer in this country as bug spray and dripping ice cream cones. And it has evolved from those rugged trailers with lumpy beds to genuine motorized homes, often packed with luxuries and selling at average prices of $40,000 to $60,000, with some running to more than $250,000. 
 The only thing that has not evolved as much, analysts say, is the profile of the typical RV buyers: an older couple who travel without children and are principally interested in avoiding Northern winters. Winnebago Industries, based in Forest City, Iowa, says its customers are typically 50 to 70 years of age. That is both the bane and the promise of the industry, particularly for Winnebago, the company that gave these vehicles their identity but is now struggling.
Sales slipped slightly for the nine months through May 31, to $336.8 million, from $364.3 million for the same period a year earlier. And sales have remained disappointing in the current quarter, the company says. Other RV companies include Fleetwood Enterprises and Coachmen Industries, which have also had disappointing performances this year.
Winnebago -- named after an Indian tribe -- says it has diagnosed the problem and found a solution: selling more RV's to the generation that once would have laughed at them but now desires the comforts they afford. The company feels that baby boomers, some of whom are turning 50 and finding their joints creakier than in the past, are the market of the future.
Indeed, an estimated nine million baby-boomer families have the income range and areas of interest that fit the RV buyer profile, the industry says, even though few of them have so far bought RV's.
But analysts, while acknowledging the possible growth of this market, are skeptical.
"Those factors will come into play at some point in the future, but I don't see them as instrumental right now," said Guy Nielsen, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities in Westport, Conn. "Demand is less than robust now."
In fact, many sectors of the leisure industry have contended that aging baby boomers will expand sales, but few have seen strong results yet.
"You know, the great thing about demographics is that everyone claims the numbers are in their favor," said Mark Greenberg, who manages the Invesco Strategic Leisure fund, based in Denver.
For Winnebago, such skepticism and the industry slump have translated into a lackluster stock. From a high of nearly $13 in February 1994, the stock has done a crabwalk for years, going mostly sideways to lower. It closed on Friday at $6.75, or just 7.3 times its earnings per share.
"When you think of motor homes or RV's, you think of Winnebago," said Gary Goldstein, an analyst at the Seidler Companies in Los Angeles, who lives in an RV with his wife and travels about 42 weeks a year. "I don't have a clear idea of how they lost that franchise, but they just about have."
Its rivals have suffered, too. Coachmen stock climbed past $28 a share last fall and winter but closed on Friday at $19.125; Fleetwood shares, near $37 last fall, are now $30.0625.
But Winnebago has high hopes -- especially for its baby-boomer card. "This is going to materialize, no question, but over maybe five to six years," said Bruce D. Hertzke, Winnebago's president and chief operating officer. "We have a few more people toward the 50-year-old end of our age range, but there are also more buyers at later ages."
The company has taken other steps to rebuild. Its founder, John K. Hanson, died last year, and with his passing Winnebago has sold off several divisions, like electronics and advertising, that are unrelated to motor homes. Now, "our real emphasis is on the 1998 model launch," Mr. Hertzke said.
He said Winnebago had strengthened its position in so-called C-class vehicles, the midsize RV's priced at $35,000 to $65,000. The focus now, Mr. Hertzke said, will be the more lucrative high end of the market, the A class, where prices begin at $40,000 and rapidly escalate to $250,000. These large, luxurious vehicles are now often enhanced with what is known as a slide-out -- a part of the vehicle that slides out when parked, creating a far larger room inside.
The Hanson family's ownership of about 43 percent of Winnebago has been a drag on the stock price, and it has been unclear how the holding will be managed after Mr. Hanson's death. Company officials are hoping that once the family decides whether it will sell shares, and, if so, how many, investors will have less fear that a huge amount of the stock may be dumped at any time.
Mr. Hanson, who founded the company on the back of a failed trailer company in 1959, retired in 1972 but returned to rebuild it when it was faltering in 1979 and again in the late 1980's. Until his death at age 88, he had a hand in its operation, analysts said, meaning that for the first time its current management has a free hand in running it.
"The company is really in a transition," said Mr. Nielsen of Nutmeg Securities. "They're finishing their first year without Mr. Hanson. We need a little more time to see what they'll do. They know they need to come out with some really new products, not just some cosmetic changes."
One company goal is to promote the benefits of RV's to all who will listen. "It's a cheap way to have a second home for many of these people," Mr. Goldstein said. "You save on everything."
WINNEBAGO and other companies in the industry have also formed the Go RVing Coalition. The group began a $15 million advertising campaign earlier this year to reinvigorate the slumping market by luring baby boomers. The slogan is "Wherever you go, you're always at home."
The industry has a long way to go, however. Sales reached $12.4 billion last year, but growth has lagged so far this year, in spite of the strong economy. Add in the uncertainty over whether boomers will embrace the RV, and analysts remain leery of Winnebago's stock.
Even Mr. Goldstein, despite his own enthusiasm for the RV life, said: "It's a big maybe whether or not they can really turn things around, and until I see something positive, I'm holding back."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Jeff Poppenhagen;
Pioneer Growth Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is roaring ahead this year, leaving many mutual funds behind. But not all.
Investors who tapped into the large-cap growth sector through the Pioneer Growth fund, for example, have been well-rewarded. The fund had a return of 26.4 percent through June 30, compared with 20.6 percent for the S.& P. And for the 12 months through June, the fund had a return of 50 percent, beating its benchmark by more than 15 percentage points, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in Chicago. 
 The fund's three-year returns through June also look very good, largely as a result of the recent returns earned by the fund's current manager. In that period, Pioneer had an average annual return of 35.5 percent, beating the index by nearly 7 percentage points, Morningstar said.
Jeff Poppenhagen, the fund manager since February 1996, says "dominant franchise" is the key concept in the fund's approach. "I try to buy dominant franchise businesses," Mr. Poppenhagen said from his office in Boston. "Nearly all the companies in the portfolio are market leaders."
That strategy is particularly successful these days, he said. "If you're the largest in the industry, you're generally the lowest-cost provider of those goods or services, which is very important in this kind of environment where there's little pricing flexibility on the part of the company."
Why are prices in such a bind? "The huge bull market over the last seven years has created lots of capital, which is looking for a return," he said. "So you're getting competition among companies and you can't just push through price hikes -- you have to go for volume business."
Mr. Poppenhagen looks for companies whose earnings can grow 15 percent a year in the next decade. And he is not afraid to pay a lot. "You might pay a little more today, but you're better off down the road," he said. He has his limits, however. He generally won't pay more than twice the market multiple -- now about 23 times earnings -- for a stock.
Mr. Poppenhagen expects his companies to be able to reinvest capital at a very profitable rate. He aims for a return on incremental investment, which he defines as the amount above maintenance capital expenditures and research and development costs, of roughly 20 percent on a moving-average basis.
The reinvestment is often used for expansion overseas, he said, where, over all, competition is less intense and companies can grow faster. That is the case, he said, with one of his favorite holdings, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. "In China, Wrigley's is considered an innovative franchise company even though we don't consider a stick of gum innovative here," he said.
According to Morningstar, the portfolio's average price-to-earnings ratio was 31.4 as of March 31, the latest data available. At that time, the portfolio had an average price-to-book ratio of 6.9 and its price-to-cash flow was 20. All the ratios were higher than those of the S.& P.
But Mr. Poppenhagen does not use many of the usual statistics to decide when to buy or sell stocks. Instead, his holdings are dictated in part by his commitment to running a tight ship: he holds only 33 or so stocks in the portfolio at any time. "I won't add companies, so I'm forced to sell when I find something more compelling," he said.
Turnover averages 38 percent to 40 percent a year, less than half the average for domestic stock funds. Still, he said, "every once in a while, you have to own up to the fact that the management, the company or the industry isn't as good as you thought."
Technology companies are the biggest chunk -- one-third -- of the portfolio. Consumer nondurables, like clothing makers, are at 21 percent; financial stocks, 17 percent, and service industries, 11 percent. The fund's largest holdings are Dell Computer, 6.3 percent; Intel, 5.9 percent, and Microsoft, 5.7 percent. And the average weighted market capitalization of the companies in the portfolio is now $35 billion, much larger than it was before Mr. Poppenhagen's arrival.
Mr. Poppenhagen, 35, joined Pioneering Management, the fund's sponsor, last year. He had been a portfolio manager with Transamerica in San Francisco from 1991 to 1996, and with Farmers Group before that. One of his recent adjustments, he said, was extracurricular: He had to sell his sailboat, a Coronado 25, when he moved to Boston, but hopes to buy another boat soon.
 
Going Global With Gum
Mr. Poppenhagen is buying shares in big global consumer products companies because, he said, "in the important global markets, returns and growth rates are increasing faster and competition is less intense."
Wrigley, the chewing gum maker, holds about 50 percent of the market in the United States but 70 percent to 80 percent in international markets like Britain, Germany and China, he said. The company, he said, gets about 55 percent of its revenue overseas, and is "really starting to grow their international units well over 10 percent a year, even though the U.S. business is slightly down."
Over all, the unit sales growth rate for the entire company is about 7 percent to 8 percent a year, "a really big number, considering world G.D.P. growth is 3 to 4 percent," Mr. Poppenhagen said. He predicts 1998 earnings of $2.80 a share, if the company raises its domestic prices; if not, he predicts $2.65 a share. That would be an increase of 19 percent or 13 percent, respectively, over 1997 projected earnings of $2.35.
Moreover, Wrigley has a large amount of free cash flow, and that should grow as the company's worldwide capital spending plan starts to slow in the next 18 months or so, he said. Its stock closed on Friday at $70.25.
 
A Champion of Marketing
Mr. Poppenhagen also likes Nike, the footwear giant, which he says earns 45 percent of its revenues overseas. The company's domestic business is growing at a slim 5 percent to 6 percent a year, but Mr. Poppenhagen said the international units could probably grow at 30 percent a year. That would yield an overall growth rate of 17 percent to 18 percent a year, he said.
Moreover, Nike's long-term market position is enviable, Mr. Poppenhagen said, and its marketing is inspired. "It has great brand awareness, which they can leverage internationally," he said.
The company also has tighter control over its distribution than any other company in the athletic shoe industry, he added.
In the near term, however, Nike is having some product shortages and order cancellations, so its outlook over the next few years is a little unclear, Mr. Poppenhagen said. The resulting weakness in the share price -- the stock closed on Friday at $58.75, down from a 52-week high of $75.75 on Feb. 13 -- creates a buying opportunity, he said.
He forecasts 1998 earnings of $3.25 a share, up 16 percent from projected earnings of $2.80 for 1997.
 
Alone at the Top Overseas
Like Nike, the McDonald's Corporation has been having difficulties -- in this case, with what Mr. Poppenhagen calls the "flap over the ill-fated Campaign 55 promotion," referring to the company's failed 55-cent sandwich campaign. Moreover, McDonald's has been facing increased competition from Wendy's and Burger King, he said.
"I think those concerns overlook just how powerful their global franchise is," he said, adding that McDonald's does 60 percent of its business overseas, and it faces little or no competition in many foreign markets.
The return on investment in developing markets is very high, he added. Mr. Poppenhagen's best guess for what he calls the "cash-on-cash rate of return on investment," which does not take into account depreciation and other noncash expenses, is upward of 20 percent in developing markets.
More than 70 percent of the company's planned capital expenditures have been allocated to overseas, and Mr. Poppenhagen said the international business alone was worth the price of the stock today. The shares closed on Friday at $49.9375.
"In five years, the company will do 75 percent of its business abroad," he said, "and its domestic business will become less important every day."
He sees 1998 earnings of $2.75 a share, up 14 percent from the projected $2.42 for 1997. He said he could not predict the impact of last week's management shake-up at the company, intended to revitalize its United States business. In any case, he said, his investment decisions were not based on the company's domestic sales.

HEADLINE: European Integration;
Guns, Yes; Butter, Maybe

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE glow around the celebration of the expansion of NATO with President Clinton hailing a new Europe that is "undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time since the rise of the nation state" -- lasted for about three days last week.
Then, before the President re-boarded Air Force One bound for home, the carping began. The French said they wouldn't pay a centime to help integrate Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary into the club. And others in Western Europe, while less adamant, made clear that they couldn't pay to defend the new NATO members at a time when their national deficits were already threatening to delay or sink the launching of a common European currency 18 months from now. 
 The Eastern Europeans weren't all that ecstatic either. With NATO expansion under way, they have already returned to a more concrete and immediate concern: getting into the European Union. This week, the union is expected to release a report calling for delay and caution before 10 countries now applying to become new members are admitted. It's one thing to pledge that you will defend the nations of Eastern Europe with blood, guts and missiles. But open markets further to their goods and help subsidize their farm goods? Well, that's serious business.
"Welcome to the new world," one of President Clinton's top economic advisers said. "It's easier these days to get countries to agree to link their armies than it is to integrate their economies."
 
Two Europes

Of course, this was all supposed to happen together. Security and prosperity are all of a piece, Mr. Clinton's aides have argued throughout the debates on the wisdom of NATO expansion. And up to a point, that is perfectly good logic. NATO membership carries with it an aura of stability, and so, faced with the choice of where to put their money, investors are now somewhat more likely to favor an auto plant in Poland or a software operation in Hungary.
Earlier this year, the White House even enlisted its economic team to make the case for an expanded North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "Our strong economic relations with Europe could not have evolved over the past 50 years if not for that continent's security and stability," Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy Treasury Secretary, said in April. Just the expectation that the military alliance was starting to expand, he argued, has helped "lock in Central Europe's practices of market democracy," fueling Hungary's privatization drive.
Hoping to be part of a future round of expansion, he argued, Romania has opened itself to investment from the West and Estonia has lowered its protectionist tariffs. Bulgaria dumped leaders "who had run the economy into the ground," and the Bulgarians now say that new reforms are linked to their interest in joining NATO.
But the fact is that expanding NATO in these times of peace has relatively little impact on the lives of ordinary citizens, either among the old members or the new. True economic integration, however, carries with it big costs, thanks to Europe's byzantine system of agricultural subsidies, which assures that farmers in all member states get the same guaranteed prices. That could mean major transfers of money from West to East. Western Europe is also balking because the new applicants would increase the population of the European Union by 30 percent, but would expand its economic muscle by only about 4 percent -- not exactly the kind of great addition China made on July 1 when it added a tiny bit of population and got a world-beater of a business center in Hong Kong.
The problem now is that the same three countries that were the first to join NATO are probably also the three in the best shape to join the European Union. That raises the specter of two Europes -- one protected and prosperous, one unprotected and struggling.
"The way these things work in real life is that you have to do your security relationships and economic relationships in tandem," said Robert Zoellick, a former senior official in the Bush Administration and a supporter of NATO expansion. "But you also want to be careful not to create huge imbalances" that affect stability, he said.
In fact, what is happening in Europe right now -- and to some degree around the world -- is that military and economic alliances are being traded off, so that no one feels completely left out.
To make the Russians less grumpy about NATO expansion, the Clinton Administration granted them almost full membership in the Group of Seven industrialized nations, even though in economic terms they are hardly a superpower these days. Washington also promised to get Moscow into the World Trade Organization -- the club of trading nations -- by the end of 1998.
 
Bending Rules
 That is proving easier said than done. Mr. Clinton made the commitment despite warnings from some members of his economic team that Russia's legal system, trading regime and protectionist policies could not be revamped that fast -- warnings similar to the ones Western Europeans make about economic integration with the East. And if the rules are bent for Russia, what about China? It is also applying to the World Trade Organization, but is balking at the strict requirements -- especially allowing in imports that could undercut state-run industries. So whatever is done for Moscow must be done for Beijing.
"The cold war had one major thing going for it," one of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet members mused recently. "Simplicity."

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
They once stretched, as politicians often intoned, as far as the eye could see. But Federal budget deficits, which only a few years ago were symbols of national decline, government run amok and political gridlock, are now evaporating.
And for all the chest-thumping by leaders of both parties about their resolve in reaching an agreement to actually balance the budget over the next five years, the dissipation of the annual deficits has little to do with any tough choices or courageous leadership in Washington. 
 The stunningly rapid decline in the deficit is testament to the power of economic forces that governments have trouble anticipating or understanding, much less controlling. Because the economy over the last few years has been so much stronger than expected -- and because it is generating tax receipts far bigger than expected even for the robust economic growth rate -- the gap between what the Federal Government spends and what it takes in has already narrowed to its lowest level since 1979, and seems to be headed even lower.
 
Annual Shrinkage
 Under the most optimistic scenarios, the deficit could disappear entirely in the next few years, leaving the budget in balance for the first time since 1969, even without taking into account the effects of the balanced-budget agreement that is moving rapidly through Congress in tax and spending bills.
Indeed, the budget agreement could actually slow the progress toward eliminating the deficit because it cuts taxes immediately while delaying most of the cuts in spending..
Each month this year has brought better news on the deficit as the Treasury Department tallies its tax receipts and economists use the figures to project the size of the budget shortfall. The latest set of estimates, based on tax receipts through June, put the deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, at as little as $45 billion.
That is down from the official projection incorporated in the budget agreement two months ago of $67 billion, and is less than half of last year's deficit of $107 billion. The deficit peaked in 1992 at $290 billion. Some economists believe the deficit could continue falling over the next several years, though Administration officials say it is more likely to rise slightly before the balanced-budget package sends it downward again.
The most meaningful way to measure deficits is as a percentage of the nation's economic output. By that standard, this year's deficit seems likely to be around 0.6 percent of the gross domestic product, the first time it will have been below 1.0 percent since 1974. Nearly all the other big industrial countries, by contrast, are struggling to bring their deficits below 3 percent of output.
The figures highlight a point that many economists have been making in recent years: that the deficit has become economically insignificant in a country the size of the United States. Eliminating the deficit, in their view, is primarily a political imperative at this point, intended to show voters that Washington can tackle a tough issue and overcome partisanship to get something done for the country.
 
The Rewards of Rectitude
 Still, the declining deficits do owe something to the tax increase supported by President Clinton in 1993. And there is a case for continuing the political push to drive the deficit down to zero, or to run a budget surplus. Fiscal rectitude in Washington helps ease fears of inflation. It also helps keep interest rates down by assuring investors that the Government will not be competing with the private sector to borrow money in the financial markets.
Running surpluses could allow the nation to establish a rainy-day fund to keep the budget balanced if it hits a bad economic downturn. Surpluses could also let the Government begin attacking its mountain of debt, which stands at $5.4 trillion.
If the optimists are wrong, the Federal Government may never have the luxury of deciding what to do with any excess money. But that does not mean that politicians are not already drawing up their wish lists.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chief Republican tax writer, says he would want bigger tax cuts.
The Clinton Administration is developing a contingency plan for allocating any windfall among various spending programs, tax cuts and the reduction of remaining deficits faster than planned.
But it is starting to dawn on political leaders that they are dealing with economic forces that are impossible to tame or predict. Not only is it unclear whether the economy, now in its seventh uninterrupted year of expansion, can continue to grow at robust rates for long enough to eliminate the deficit, but no one knows for sure why tax revenues have been so high or whether that welcome phenomenon will continue.
"What we do want to do is keep the economy growing," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, "because we all now know that's the major way in which you bring down the deficit."

TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
Joe Camel, R.I.P.
Under intense attack, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco decided to drop Joe Camel from its advertising and replace the cartoon figure -- which critics said enticed children to begin smoking -- with stylized versions of Camel cigarettes' original camel trademark. Anti-smoking advocates and the White House cheered the demise of Joe Camel. "We must put tobacco ads like Joe Camel out of our children's reach forever," President Clinton said. A brief statement from Reynolds did not mention a ban on cartoons as part of a landmark $368.5 billion settlement reached on June 20 by Reynolds and other tobacco marketers. Earlier in the week, Mr. Clinton rejected a central provision of that accord as "totally unreasonable." The provision would have required a cumbersome process to further regulate nicotine.
 
THE STOCK MARKET
Another Wild Week
Blue-chip investors must have felt as if they were on a seesaw. The Dow Jones industrial average began the week on a slightly sour note, falling 37.32 points. But on Tuesday, it surged 103.82 points, to its 32d record high for the year -- and its first close above 7,900 -- as investors remained optimistic about corporate profits and a stable economy. On Wednesday, the Dow inched to within 10 points of 8,000 before plunging almost 120 points. Analysts cited program trading and profit taking for the drop. The Dow gained 44 points on Thursday, and 35 on Friday, ending the week at 7,921.82, for a five-day advance of 26. A recovery in technology issues allowed the Nasdaq to set records all week. It closed on Friday at 1,502.62, up 11.69 -- and a gain of 35 for the week. 

COMPUTERS
Deal! Deal! Deal!
Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and I.B.M. will cut prices for commercial desktop computers by as much as 24 percent to match lower prices offered by Dell Computer, which sells directly to consumers without a network of dealers and has been growing more rapidly. The reductions promise to be a bonanza for corporate computer buyers, but a price war could cut into the profits of all the computer makers. Japan's Hitachi Ltd., meanwhile, has become the No. 2 maker of powerful mainframe computers used by businesses, tripling its share of the market last year, to 20 percent. I.B.M. remains No. 1; the Amdahl Corporation, which was No. 2 in 1995 with a 12 percent share, slipped to third place, with 7 percent. Hitachi sells the machines through Hatachi Data Systems, a joint venture of Hatachi and Electronic Data Systems of Texas.
 
RETAILING
Ward's Woes; Bids for Barney's
Montgomery Ward, one of the oldest names in American retailing, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows a company to operate while it develops a reorganization plan. GE Capital, half-owner of Montgomery Ward, will provide $1 billion as part of the reorganization; during the last nine years, GE Capital has invested $180 million in the retailer and lent it an estimated $300 million to $900 million. Montgomery Ward, based in Chicago, had been deadlocked for months in negotiations with its banking syndicate and insurance companies over $1.4 billion of debt. Four bidders, meanwhile, came forward to meet a deadline to bid for Barney's Inc., the luxury retailer in New York, which is also under bankruptcy protection. The four are Heico Acquisitions, an investment firm controlled by the Chicago financier Michael Heisley; Dickson Concepts (International), a Hong Kong retailer; Ong Beng Seng, a retail executive from Singapore, and Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm led by David Bonderman. Barney's has until July 25 to accept one of the bids. Saks Holdings declined to improve on the $290 million it offered in April, adding that it thought its bid was now too high anyway.
 
MEDIA
Hercules the Weak
Hercules, known for his great strength, has proved impotent at a very important task: lifting the Walt Disney Company's stock price. In its first two weeks of general release, Disney's latest animated feature, "Hercules," took in only $58 million at the box office. This was a poor showing compared with other recent Disney summer releases like "Pocahontas," which took in $80 million in its first two weeks in 1995, and "The Lion King," which grossed $119 million in two weeks in 1994. One Disney executive said "Hercules" was a disappointment, in part, because of heavy competition and the fact that it failed to appeal across various age groups within a family. The film's lackluster performance -- along with slowing growth at Disney theme parks and a management shake-up at its ABC broadcast network -- helped pare the company's share price to about $76 by Friday, compared with its 52-week high of $85.375 on May 12.
 
PUBLISHING
More Books Gather Dust
The Book Industry Study Group reported that sales of hard-cover and paperback adult trade books -- the chief moneymakers for publishers -- fell by 5.3 percent from 1995 to 1996, dipping to 459 million copies. It was the second consecutive year that the drop in sales exceeded 5 percent. Publishers have been acutely aware of the declines, which have been accompanied by large numbers of returns from bookstores. In contrast to companies in many other industries, book retailers share little of the risk that a product will be unsuccessful because publishers allow bookstores to return unsold items -- a custom that began in the Depression as an enticement to booksellers. By publishing fewer titles and limiting print runs, publishers may be able to improve their profits but not necessarily increase overall sales, according to the annual report by the publisher-supported group.
 
MANAGEMENT
Who Wants This Job?
Apple Computer's board, unhappy over continued losses, ousted the company's chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio. In addition, Apple's executive vice president for technology, Ellen Hancock, resigned. The company said its co-founder, Steven P. Jobs -- who had been ousted in a 1985 boardroom coup but returned as an adviser in December when Apple bought his Next Software Inc. for more than $400 million -- would play a larger role in coming months but was not expected to take over as chief executive. Apple's woes have tested the loyalty of its customers and software makers; its share of the personal computer market in the United States is down to 3.3 percent, and many industry analysts wonder whether the company that pioneered the personal computer can be revived. Its troubles are a legacy of technological stagnation, product missteps and management turmoil; finding a new leader will probably be difficult. Apple's stock, which traded at a peak of $73 in 1991, ended the week at a little above $15 a share.
 
THE ECONOMY
Good News Keeps Flowing
Low unemployment is often followed by surging inflation, but the United States has been enjoying the best of both worlds: low joblessness and low inflation, thanks to millions of workers willing to enter the labor force without bidding up wages, economists say. The American labor force has been growing rapidly: By early this year, it was expanding at nearly twice the rate of other years in the 1990's and is continuing to grow faster than the working-age population. A result: Four million more workers have been fed into a growing economy since the start of 1996. Hispanic people are the biggest contingent, but younger women and men older than 55 also figure prominently among the new entrants. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, reported that consumer borrowing increased at a slower-than-expected 2.9 percent annual rate during May, down from the 9.7 percent pace in April. The level of consumer credit increased by $3 billion in May, to $1.224 trillion.

HEADLINE: Roll Reversal;
Welfare Finds a Few New Friends

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
FOR years, advocates fighting the unpopular fight to help people on public assistance have accepted that getting states to spend extra dollars on welfare is about as easy as wrestling hogs in a mud pit. Most expected the battle only to get tougher after President Clinton signed the welfare bill last summer that reversed six decades of social policy by eliminating the Federal guarantee of cash aid for the nation's poorest children.
But one year later, the outlook is sunnier than anyone might have imagined. Witnessing the shift in attitudes seems like watching the Earth spin in reverse. Who would have imagined that politicians, and the taxpayers who elected them, might support spending on what was considered the nation's most reviled social program? 
 While advocates for the poor still have long, unfulfilled wish lists, states are spending millions more than expected on innovative day-care and transportation programs, large and small, to help welfare recipients march successfully into the new world of work.
Minnesota will spend about $25 million to wipe out an 18-month waiting list for day care. Wisconsin will finance $4 million in emergency loans for welfare recipients and working parents who need to buy used cars or repair old ones to get to work.
And Rhode Island will spend more than $12 million to raise its payments to day-care providers by about 14 percent over the next three years while sparing parents any increases, in an effort to improve the quality of child care.
"I feel like the Red Sox just won the World Series," said Alexandra Moser, executive director of Catholic Charities' Office of Child Care in Rhode Island. "I'm still in a state of shock."
Spending is being approved, not nearly as often as advocates would like, but more than expected. Unlikely allies are even popping up in unexpected quarters.
In New York, for example, Republican legislators helped force Gov. George E. Pataki to abandon his plan to slash welfare benefits by 45 percent over five years, arguing that the cuts would drive families deeper into poverty. In Alabama, fiscally conservative Democrats argued more this year about how much more they should spend, than about how much they should cut.
"Legislators were asking themselves, 'Is there enough child care? Do we need to invest more money in early education?' " said Jack Tweedie, who follows welfare for the National Conference of State Legislatures. "The idea that states wouldn't care about welfare recipients was misplaced."
But it isn't benevolence that has spurred the spending. Very few states are actually using more of their own dollars. Instead, they are responding to an infusion of Federal cash. Under the new law, states will receive about $2 billion more this year, 16 percent more than they otherwise would have. The windfall, enough for an extra $650 for every welfare family in the country, is the result of a new Federal formula that pays states based on the welfare population of earlier years, even as rolls decline.
Officials have also been pushed to act by the threat of hefty Federal fines -- cuts in funding that range from 5 percent to 21 percent levied on states that fail to get welfare recipients working.
Under the law, 50 percent of the heads of welfare families must find jobs by the year 2002. And that won't happen if mothers can't find day care for their toddlers or easily accessible bus routes to their offices.
So Pennsylvania is considering offering free subway passes. And Delaware has expanded its criminal background checks to cover babysitters so that the new working women can kiss their babies goodbye with confidence as they leave each morning.
"These changes emerge from the recognition of the kind of barriers poor people face every day," said Mark Alan Hughes, a leading expert on transportation problems of the poor. "When you're driving a 1977 Buick LaSabre and it breaks down, being able to get a quick loan to have the brakes replaced is a serious policy intervention."
Not all the news is good. The end of welfare as it was known meant the death of a single Federal standard and the birth of 50 different plans in 50 states. No one has comprehensively assessed the evolving patchwork. But several state policies have been criticized for not doing enough.
New York, for example, plans to spend $54 million to create 23,000 new day care slots statewide, while advocates say New York City alone needs 35,000. In addition, Governor Pataki has been criticized for choosing to use nearly half of the state's $730 million windfall for purposes other than welfare. Pennsylvania, which has expanded day-care subsidies, gets a negative rating from advocates for raising the dollar amount that parents must contribute for that care.
And the need for funding is likely to increase, not decrease, as states struggle to move the most difficult cases from the rolls: the long-term recipients, the substance abusers, the illiterate. That money will be hard to come by if the economy sours and caseloads rise again as people turn to the dole for help.
"The hard work, the heavy lifting, has not started here," said Peter B. Edelman, who resigned as assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services last year in protest over the welfare law.
"You're talking about four million people who have to be off the rolls four years from now," said Mr. Edelman, cautioning against premature celebration. "We're a long way away from being able to say we're doing everything that needs to be done."
But the good news is that while voters rejected spending on the old welfare system, they seem to support spending for one that puts people to work. In polls conducted in three states this spring, more than half of those surveyed said they were willing to spend more money to carry out welfare reform, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster based in Washington.
"People want welfare recipients to work, but they don't want to see them starving on street corners," said Amy Tucci, a spokeswoman for the American Public Welfare Association, which represents state and local social-service commissioners. "And they're beginning to realize that it's much more difficult to put people to work than it is to write a check."

HEADLINE: Hard of Hearing;
A Scandal Falls Victim to Its Own Irrelevance

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE telltale sign came only three hours after the much-touted hearings on campaign finance finally opened last week in the Senate: several spectators got up and left, leaving a noticeable swath of empty seats in the public gallery. These people did not go home to watch the proceedings on television, because even cable channels like C-Span and MSNBC devoted scant time to live coverage.
Even John Dean, whose compelling testimony in the Watergate hearings 25 years ago kept Americans glued to their seats for five days, said he did not have time to bother watching the hearings. And The Washington Post, which catapulted to international prominence for breaking the Watergate scandal, could not bring itself to give Page 1 play to the second day of testimony. 
 The proceedings don't seem to have penetrated deeply beyond the Beltway. A nationwide survey by the trade publication Talkers Magazine found that the most popular subject on talk radio last week was the Mars landing, followed by U.F.O.'s in Roswell, N.M., and the Nevada boxing commission's ruling on Mike Tyson. The Senate machinations came in fourth.
 
Interested in U.F.O.'s
 "People are talking about U.F.O.'s and a boxing match over the heart of the ethics of our political culture," said Michael Harrison, the editor of Talkers. Despite the potential gravitas of the hearings, he said, "you start yawning after a while. And when you think about what you're yawning over, it's incredible."
The lack of evident public outrage over the campaign finance practices described at the hearings is further evidence that there is not an angry, galvanizing constituency on the issue of money and politics. (True, it did not help that the hearings thus far have been devoid of vivid witnesses or gripping drama.)
Polls show that people are distressed that millions of dollars of unregulated money has seeped into campaigns. And they believe that moneyed interests wield an undue influence on their public servants.
Even so, people have become so discouraged that they seem to have given up. The latest ABC News/ Washington Post Poll, released last week, found that 63 percent of the public opposes the way Presidential and Congressional campaigns are financed. But 67 percent said they had little hope that Mr. Clinton or Congress would substantively change things. Further, there is no great incentive for Mr. Clinton to prod Congress to reform the system: according to the poll, his approval rating stands at 64 percent, as high as ever.
Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican running the proceedings, sought to introduce some surprise and drama on opening day by announcing that there was as-yet-undisclosed evidence of a sinister plot by the Chinese Government to infiltrate elections in the United States. But even Mr. Thompson's dramatics did not seem to register.
So the public may be at peace with the notion that the campaign-finance system is flawed, even corrupt, and that it will never be fixed so long as that is left to the politicians who relied on the system to get elected in the first place.
Yet the lack of interest in cleaning up campaign finance is not fueled merely by cynicism after years of unfulfilled promises or the absence of a civic consciousness. To many people, the Government and the Presidency are not as important as they were in the days of Nixon and Watergate. In this era of relative prosperity and governmental devolution, when Republicans sound like Democrats and vice versa in the middle ground of moderate consensus, it does not seem to matter as much who is President or who is in Congress. As a result, even though they may pay dearly for their indifference, people simply may not care as they once would have that Candidate X spent millions of dollars of tainted money to get elected.
"Government and politics in this country has simply become less relevant to people -- they're less interested and paying less attention," said Robert M. Teeter, a Republican pollster. "We've had a long, sustained period without any major crises and no recession. So they view the economic system as more important than the political system."
Craig Fuller, who like Mr. Teeter was close to President George Bush, put it more bluntly: "I suspect more people are keeping their eye on the stock market these days. Dow 8000 may be more compelling than John Huang."
It's all a far cry from the days of Watergate, a true Constitutional crisis whose Senate hearings riveted the public and, for the most part, transcended partisanship. "Watergate was much more serious, and a lot easier for the public to understand," Mr. Dean said, adding that these hearings deal with "a problem both parties have and it's highly charged with partisanship -- I think the public sees that."
 
A Well-Worn Script
 Another difference is that during the Watergate hearings, the narrative was unfolding -- "What did the President know and when did he know it?" But the campaign finance hearings have dwelled on material that has already been made public. Desperate for a new script, Mr. Thompson has started to emphasize the national security threat rather than simply the corruption of politicians by money.
But it may be premature to write off his hearings, or the appetite in Congress for remaking the system. After all, the first witness in the Watergate hearings, Robert C. Odle Jr., a Nixon re-election committee official, was hardly memorable.
"All you need is one witness to say, 'The attache of the Chinese Embassy gave me a million dollars in a leather suitcase to pass around to American officials,' " said former Senator Warren B. Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican who was co-chairman of the Iran-contra hearings. Then, he said, "the American people would stay home from work to watch it on television."
 
Wish List
This 1994 memo to Ann Cahill, an assistant to Harold M. Ickes, who was deputy White House chief of staff, from Martha Phipps, a special assistant to the former general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was released during the Senate hearings. Lanny J. Davis, a White House special counsel, explained: "This was a wish list drafted by someone who didn't understand what was or wasn't appropriate. It was just a proposal that never happened. . . . We're not saying that friends or supporters didn't do these things. But they were not in return for giving a campaign contribution."

To: Ann Cahill
From: Martha Phipps
 
RE: White House Activities
In order to reach our very aggressive goal of $40 million this year, it would be very helpful if we could coordinate the following activities between the White House and the Democratic National Committee.
1. Two reserved seats on Air Force I and II trips
2. Six seats at all White House private dinners
3. Six to eight spots at all White House events (i.e. Jazz Fest, Rose Garden ceremonies, official visits)
4. Invitations to participate in official delegation trips abroad
5. Better coordination on appointments to Boards and Commissions
6. White House mess privileges
7. White House residence visits and overnight stays
8. Guaranteed Kennedy Center tickets (at least one month in advance)
9. Six radio address spots
10. Photo opportunities with the principles
11. Two places per week at the Presidential CEO lunches.
12. Phone time from the Vice President
13. Ten places per month at White House film showings
14. One lunch with Mack McLarty per month
15. One lunch with Ira Magaziner per month
16. One lunch with the First Lady per month
17. Use of the President's Box at the Warner Theater and at Wolf Trap

Handoff in Panama: Hong Kong Was Just a Rehearsal

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BALBOA HEIGHTS, Panama

 BODY:
LIKE Hong Kong until this month, this American-run outpost is a place living on borrowed time. For the moment, pockets of the former Canal Zone still retain their quaint, Mayberry-in-the-tropics ambiance of Baptist churches, manicured lawns and Elks and Lions clubs. But a final, historic deadline is fast approaching: in less than 30 months, the Panama Canal will cease to be an agency of the United States Government and become a purely Panamanian possession.
Both sides are preparing for that signal event with a contradictory mixture of boosterism and trepidation. Just last month, Panama's national assembly approved the "organic law" that will govern the administration of the canal. But to oversee the transition process, President Ernesto Perez Balladares last week named Jorge Ritter, who served as Foreign Minister during the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, as Minister of Canal Affairs and head of the future Panama Canal Authority. 
 At the headquarters of the Panama Canal Commission here, overlooking the waterway's Pacific Ocean entrance, the emphasis is on what the canal administrator, Alberto Aleman Zubieta, an American-educated Panamanian engineer, likes to call "a seamless transition" on Dec. 31, 1999, when the final provisions of the Panama Canal Treaties, signed by President Jimmy Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos in 1977, go into effect.
"That's a big date on the calendar for the politicians, but in terms of operating the Panama Canal, it is virtually meaningless and we are ignoring it," said Richard Wainio, director of planning for the canal commission. "We are already looking many, many years beyond that."
 
A Lock and a Hard Place
 The transition has been eased by two consecutive years of record traffic and revenue: more than 13,700 ships carrying 198 million tons of cargo paid $486 million in tolls in 1996. A billion-dollar modernization program that will increase the capacity of the canal by 20 percent is under way, and 92 percent of a work force of 9,800 people is already Panamanian, including two-thirds of the pilots who guide vessels through the 50-mile waterway. "We're going to be turning over a debt-free canal that is as modern as it has ever been, so that Panama will have a running start," Mr. Wainio said. "What more can you ask for?"
What shipping companies would ask is for the canal to remain in American hands. They worry that Panama will be tempted to divert canal revenue for its own use and that the Canal Authority will be politicized, concerns Mr. Aleman says are groundless.
But Panama is not the United States, "the American veneer notwithstanding," said a senior executive of a large shipping company. "That has always meant you have to deal with sudden swings in policy, nepotism, corruption and laws that look good on paper but are never enforced." Panama's recent handling of bids to privatize moribund ports at either end of the canal engendered protests from the losing American companies and public criticism of the bidding process.
On the Panamanian side, too, there are questions about the disposition of the real estate and military bases that surround it. Who will guarantee the security of the canal once American troops leave? Should the United States be encouraged to retain a military presence, despite the treaty's prohibition? How much are the 569 square miles and 7,000 buildings that are being handed over really worth on the open market?
"This sort of thing is always a trauma," said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a former president of Panama who now heads the Government agency that supervises disposal of what are called in official parlance the "reverted areas." "We are going to be losing $200 million the American military presence contributes in added value to our economy each year. But we hope increased investments and exports will substitute for that."
Though the canal has been the central fact of Panama's existence since the country was carved out of Colombia in 1903 with the connivance of Teddy Roosevelt, the waterway remains an enigma to many Panamanians. Perhaps as a result, some people here are convinced the United States will not hand over the canal and is secretly plotting to remain; others, more than 75 percent according to recent polls, actually want the Americans to stay, but only so long as they are willing to pay to do so.
"The Canal Zone disappeared in 1979, but a lot of the myths and mystique that surrounded it linger on, which is what happens when you have run a closed shop like we did," one American military official here said. "The folks up in the hills still think the streets here are paved with gold, and it always surprises them when they come into the zone for the first time and find a lot of old buildings with roofs that leak."
 
America's Stake
 Nevertheless, the transition process here promises to be less wrenching than in Hong Kong. Unlike China, Panama has a government that is democratic and resolutely capitalist -- with its own home-grown robber barons, some critics would maintain. The preparation time is longer, more than 22 years, and the United States has gradually been ceding authority and territory, with the Southern Command set to move its headquarters to Miami and give up Albrook Air Force Station by the end of September. Already, the military has surrendered to Panama more than a third of the territory it once controlled.
Panama has many grandiose dreams for the zone, some of which seem fanciful, like a vast technology and research park to be called the "City of Knowledge," and some of which are already taking shape. The notorious School of the Americas, for instance, where Latin American military officers once were trained in dubious practices, has just been acquired by a Spanish-Mexican consortium, which plans to spend $20 million to turn the decaying building into a five-star hotel catering to eco-tourists.
With the end of the cold war and the emergence of new means and routes of transportation, the canal may be of less strategic importance than in the past. But it remains both a vital waterway and a symbol of empire, and the American stake in its smooth functioning will continue to be huge even after control is transferred. "We can't make Panama succeed," said an American military official here. "But we can't afford to let them fail."

Viva Mexican Democracy -- In Theory

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
DURING the Mexican Revolution, violence spilled across the United States' southern border so frequently that on the eve of World War I, the Army had half of its forces garrisoned there to contain Mexico's chaos. Ever since, Americans have wanted stability in Mexico and mostly they've had it: the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been in charge for seven decades.
PRI presidents made the important decisions, hand-picked governors, judges and legislators, and every six years anointed their own successors. Workers were kept submissive, and people -- and corporations -- with connections were able to get favors done. 
 And so the United States' initially positive reaction to the PRI's trouncing last week in a watershed national election may eventually develop into mixed feelings.
In rejecting the PRI, Mexico exchanged its longtime formula for stability -- one-party rule -- for a bold new democratic experiment. And while many of the changes that may follow will seem healthy and thrilling to Americans, others may cause discomfort. For Mexico, after so long seeming immutable and quiet, now is likely to be not only turbulent but newly assertive.
The emboldened opposition parties victorious in the elections may press President Ernesto Zedillo to seek better terms from the United States in trade and other disputes. American corporations here may confront new labor unions that will defend Mexican workers more vigorously than the PRI-controlled federations. And anti-Americanism, largely absent from public discourse in recent years, may be heard. The price of Mexican democracy, for the United States, may be a more contentious neighbor.
"Mexico may become more confusing," said Robert A. Pastor, a director at the Carter Center in Atlanta who led a delegation of election observers to Mexico. "There'll be more voices and it may seem discordant, but Mexico has become more stable. Some people think stability requires a strong hand, but they're mistaken. Stability requires a framework for peaceful change. That's what Mexico got with these elections."
At the end, the seeming stability of the PRI was deceptive as the party grew decadent and corrupt.
In recent years, for example, Patricia Hogan, who helps Americans relocate their families to Mexico, watched her business stall in the months around every major election. Business was awful in 1988, when presidential balloting was widely considered fraudulent. "People feared some sort of revolution," she said. Americans also stayed away in 1994, another election year when Mexico seemed headed toward chaos. This spring her business again hit the skids as Americans grew nervous about Mexico.
But on Monday, the day after elections in which the PRI suffered its worst defeat ever, Ms. Hogan's phone rang crazily. "The voting was clean, the stock market shot up, the peso stayed strong," she said. "It was a pretty good picture." The State Department applauded, several Wall Street firms recommended boosting investments here, and Ms. Hogan signed nine new clients.
Allowed for the first time to elect the mayor of Mexico City, voters chose Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the son of the Mexican president who nationalized the oil fields in 1938, who broke with the PRI a decade ago to form his own party. In the lower house of Congress, two opposition parties denied the PRI its perpetual majority and began preparing to transform what has been a rubber stamp chamber into an assertive new check on presidential prerogative.
 
Economic Ties That Bind
 America's craving for stability is understandable. Mexico has at least $50 billion in American investments, $156 billion a year in bilateral trade and a critical petroleum supply. Each year more than 10 million American tourists head south, and a million or more Mexicans head north, legally and illegally, to supply crucial labor for American fields and factories. The United States Embassy says some 350,000 Americans live in Mexico, many in retirement, many in professions or businesses.
John E. Smith, a Rhode Island native, has managed his own head-hunting business for 25 years, recruiting executives to work for American or Mexican companies here. "I think the elections were stupendous, a real mark of Mexico's maturity," he said. "But I see years of uncertainty and turmoil, and I'm not sure all Americans will welcome the roiling waves of Mexican democracy. It could be unsettling to comfortable working arrangements, for business people and others who have liked the secure surroundings of a well-established order."
One arrangement that may come under attack is the agreements struck among the Government, large employers and PRI-controlled unions, which for years have kept salaries low. Driving voters last week was not only a desire for fresh leadership, but also anger over 30 months of austerity and a daily minimum wage that has plunged to $3. Opposition lawmakers and independent unionists are likely to work together to improve conditions.
Along with labor unrest may come a dose of anti-American rhetoric, since many of the new lawmakers believe that PRI governments have been too solicitous of the United States. The newly independent Congress will also mount investigations into official corruption. To some Americans, it may even appear that Mexico is growing more corrupt as the country airs dirty laundry that has accumulated over years.
What Americans would like to see, but are unlikely to, are major new approaches to their main priorities in Mexico: slowing illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking. Both were non-issues in the Mexican election campaign.
"The major security issues in Mexico -- the increase in crime and especially kidnappings, the growing importance of Mexican gangs in the narcotics trade, the corruption of Mexican law enforcement -- are these things going to change as a result of an election?" asked Brian M. Jenkins, a deputy chairman of Kroll Associates, the security firm. "The answer is no. Those things are not going to change overnight."

HEADLINE: Rights Abuses Stain Turkey's Democratic Image

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey

 BODY:
Every Saturday at noon, as they have done for more than two years, about 100 Turks converge on a bustling plaza in downtown Istanbul and quietly sit down on the pavement.
There are usually no speeches and no placards. The protesters, mostly women, make their point by silently displaying photographs of their missing loved ones, although their emotion sometimes boils over into an occasional chant, like "Mothers' anger will strangle the murderers." After half an hour, they rise and go their separate ways. 
 "Three men in civilian clothes grabbed my husband as he left the house one night in 1995," one of the protesters, Hanim Tosun, 32, said on a recent Saturday. "They were carrying pistols and walkie-talkies. We checked the license number of their car and found it was registered to the police. That was almost two years ago. We have tried everything to find him, but the police tell us nothing."
Mrs. Tosun's husband was a street vendor who had served three years in prison on charges of collaborating with Kurdish guerrillas in southeastern Turkey and had come to Istanbul to start a new life. He is now a statistic, one of an unknown number of Turks believed to have disappeared while in police custody.
As Mrs. Tosun and the other "Saturday Mothers" carried out their weekly protest, people around them went about their business. At nearby kiosks, newspapers carried bold headlines accusing politicians of various abuses. Organizers of rightist and leftist parties huddled in downtown offices, making plans for the coming election campaign.
"This is in many ways a very free country, so free that people can go to the polls and change their government whenever they want," Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's most prominent young novelist, said in an interview. "But it is also a country with a horrible human rights record. Probably there is no country in the world where this contradiction is so sharp and clear."
Turkey's human rights record is the subject of endless debate, not only here but also in the Western world. Turkish officials say the problem is exaggerated, but it is one of the main reasons why the European Union insists on holding Turkey at arm's length and why some Westerners consider Turkey to be a difficult partner.
Many strategists in Washington and in European capitals agree that because of Turkey's membership in NATO, its geographical position, its history and its role as a defender of secularist democracy in the Muslim world, Turkey could become even more important than it has been.
But they also say that before Turkey can become a full partner of the West or a desirable model for the new nations of the Caucasus and Central Asia, it must resolve nagging questions about the way it treats prisoners and dissenters.
"Human rights and freedom of expression are very important issues for the image of Turkey, and they condition many people's reflex reaction to questions about Turkey's role in Europe," said Michael Lake, the European Union envoy in Ankara. "This reflex is so strong that it outweighs important perceptions of Turkey, such as its strategic importance, its place in the foreign and security architecture of Europe, and even its growing importance as an economic partner."
Hanging over the human rights debate is the war being waged by Kurdish nationalists in the southeast. Most charges of human rights abuses in Turkey stem from incidents in that region. As many as 80 percent of the charges arising in other parts of the country, according to several human rights advocates, are somehow related to the Kurdish conflict.
"Tens of thousands of people have been killed out there," said Sabri Ergul, a member of the human rights committee in Parliament. The remains of Turkish soldiers and civilians slain in the fighting "have come back to nearly every town and village in Turkey," he added. "Naturally people are very angry about this. They develop the feeling that whatever has to be done to stop terrorism is justified."
"Terrorism is the problem of our age, but our age is also the age of human rights," Mr. Ergul said. "The great mistake that is made here is the belief that when you combat terrorism, you don't have to respect democracy and law."
Mr. Ergul is involved in one of Turkey's most important torture-related cases. He is a lawyer for the families of 16 teen-agers who were arrested last year for scrawling leftist graffiti on walls and who are accused of belonging to subversive organizations in the western town of Manisa. Although the police have admitted that the teen-agers confessed to their crimes under torture, they were found guilty and sentenced to terms of up to 12 years in prison.
A public prosecutor in Manisa has filed suit against 10 police officers accused of having carried out the torture, but the Government is drawing out the case and seems to hope that it will somehow fade away. It is doing the same in another important case, the investigation of officers charged in the 1996 beating death of journalist Metin Goktepe.
"The Government, especially the Interior Ministry, protects the police who torture," Mr. Ergul said. "They encourage it. They are the ones telling the police forces to behave this way, so naturally they are not in a position to prosecute officers who follow their instructions."
Human rights advocates say that besides torture in detention centers and the "mystery killings" of perceived Kurdish nationalists, the other principal human rights problem in Turkey is the ban on statements deemed to threaten national unity. Laws that forbid these statements are applied most often against those who question Government policy in the Kurdish region. It is generally considered criminal to suggest that the army shares responsibility for the carnage there, to advocate peace talks or to assert that the Government should treat the Kurds as a distinct ethnic group that deserves autonomy.
These laws are often used in cases that devastate Turkey's image. Last year, for example, one of the country's most beloved cultural figures, the novelist Yasar Kemal, was sentenced to a 20-month prison term for making pro-Kurdish statements that were interpreted as separatist propaganda.
Mr. Kemal's sentence was suspended, as often happens in such cases. Nonetheless, human rights advocates say that more than 70 journalists and writers are in jail for statements they have made.
Turkish officials concede that torture is sometimes used in detention centers, but they insist that it is not systematic and not sanctioned by the authorities. They also assert that laws against separatist propaganda must be judged in the context of a civil conflict in which terrorism has been used as a principal weapon.
At a news conference in London last year, Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said that Turkey "has decided to take a series of measures in order to totally eliminate in practice the crime of torture, which as a matter of fact is forbidden by our laws." After she spoke, Parliament passed a law cutting the maximum time defendants may be held incommunicado to 10 days from 30.
Perhaps the most illuminating human rights case in Turkey is the complex scandal that emerged after a spectacular car crash near the western town of Susurluk in November that killed a top police official and an escaped heroin smuggler. A pro-Government Kurdish clan leader who is also a member of Parliament survived. Questions about what the three men were doing in a car together led to accusations of Government involvement in smuggling, death squads, illegal repression in the southeast and other crimes.
But a parliamentary investigation of the scandal fizzled out after senior military and civilian leaders signaled that they would not cooperate. Many Turks believe responsibility for the crimes reaches so high that a full investigation is impossible.
"I'm glad we had Susurluk," said Taciser Belge, coordinator of the Istanbul-based human rights group Helsinki Citizens Assembly. "Now when we speak about these things, people realize that we're not making up stories. Since Susurluk, people understand that when things like mystery killings happen, the army and the state are involved. This is very new in Turkey."

HEADLINE: Clinton's NATO: Keen on Growth, Murky on Mission

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, July 12

 BODY:
For most of last week, President Clinton sang the praises of the NATO alliance, hailing the three nations invited on Tuesday to join the club and promising that others would be asked to join it in 1999.
Mr. Clinton spoke boldly of a new European order, and there is no doubt that the United States and its Western European allies have undertaken something of breathtaking scope -- a security network stretching, as an Administration official said, "from Vancouver to Vladivostok, the long way." At the first session of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, 16 NATO members and 28 other countries were represented. 
 But what the President said added up to less than a comprehensive plan for the future, and he seemed to be addressing European security concerns more than making a case to his own electorate. Today, in a radio address broadcast in the United States, he said that expanding NATO was a "serious step." He added, "It requires a full discussion I intend to lead with the American people."
In Warsaw on Thursday, Mr. Clinton said that "the old dividing lines of Europe were wiped away forever" by the decisions NATO made in Madrid. He told a cheering throng in Castle Square: "Never again will your fate be decided by others. Never again will the birthright of freedom be denied you. Poland is coming home."
The next day, in Bucharest, Romania, the President was hardly less expansive. He assured a nation denied entry to NATO in the first round of expansion: "I welcome Romania's deep desire to contribute even more fully to Europe's security and strength. I want that, too, for Europe, America and you, and I say to you today: Stay the course and Romania will cross the milestone."
But what the new NATO and the new security network radiating from it will do, and how they will do it, remained murky despite the fervor of Mr. Clinton's oratory and the ambition of his commitments.
Although there is a lot of talk about making Polish weapons and Czech intelligence services and Hungarian communications systems compatible with those that NATO uses, Mr. Clinton made it reasonably clear that in the post-Soviet era military matters are no longer primary.
What the allies must guard against, the Administration believes, are terrorism, illegal drugs, nationalist extremism and regional conflicts fueled by ethnic, racial and religious hatreds. Yet Mr. Clinton has not spelled out what means would be used to do so. Warplanes are of little use against terrorism and drug smuggling, and naval power is of little help in fighting racism.
The idea seems to be that membership in NATO itself, and hope for such membership, will make nations behave. It has to some degree dampened the enmity between Turkey and Greece, supporters of the new order argue, and it has prompted the Romanians to paper over their conflict with Hungary over Transylvania.
"Bringing in new members," Mr. Clinton said, "will help to lock in the gains of democracy in those countries and the free market they are already achieving. The example of these new members will help to encourage others to aspire to membership and to continue their democratic reforms and their efforts to settle disputes with their neighbors."
Those are largely unexamined propositions. In the past, countries with democratic governments and market economies have found themselves seriously at odds with one another, even at war, in Europe and elsewhere. It is not self-evident that one NATO member, feeling its national interest threatened, would refrain from hostile action because the alliance would be upset if it did not. Things are less rational than that.
Nor, as recent history suggests, will it be as easy to bring NATO -- to say nothing of the wider alliance -- into focus against a perceived threat. With a small number of NATO members and a common enemy, the old Soviet bloc, it was relatively simple. That is one key reason why NATO is one of the great success stories of the century. But it proved much harder to make common cause against strife in Bosnia, even without an expanded membership with a more diverse ethnic, historical and geographic character.
Mr. Clinton will have to do a much more thorough job of selling and explaining in the months to come if he is to persuade the American people that the new system will work and that it is worth committing several billion dollars to its creation.
According to the opinion polls, few ordinary voters have devoted much thought to NATO expansion, which is not surprising. This week's were the first events when sustained publicity was given to the matter, especially on television. With no clearly definable military threat, and with the economy thriving, foreign policy has been remote from American voters' concerns.
Mr. Clinton is confident that he can win approval of the expansion plan in the Senate next year, even though it requires a two-thirds vote. So are most Senate leaders of both parties, although Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the sometimes bellicose chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Mr. Clinton's "egregious mishandling of NATO expansion was raising serious concern" in the Senate and warned that "dramatic changes need to be made" if the plan is to win approval.
Perhaps a half-dozen other Senators have hoisted warning flags.
Ratification, if achieved, will not be enough; broad public support is clearly needed for an agreement that requires the United States to defend countries in Central Europe that are less familiar to most Americans, except those with ethnic ties, than are, say, France and Germany.
Mr. Clinton will have to take the offensive. One of his top diplomatic advisers said he had "already done a lot to sell NATO," including leading off the foreign-policy section of this year's State of the Union message with the subject, but the old political hands think he will need to press ahead in a much less abstract, more down-to-earth style.
That will be even more true if France continues to insist, as it did in Madrid, that it is unwilling to spend money to expand NATO and the other major European countries, including Britain and Germany, continue to show some fiscal reluctance as well. It would be political poison for the President if it looked as if the United States was doing things for the Europeans that they should do for themselves but were unwilling to.
Still, Mr. Clinton is in a strong position, should he wish to spend some of his political capital on NATO. Close to two-thirds of the voters approve of his performance, for all his personal troubles and all the investigations, and he need not worry about another election. If ever there was a moment to step up to the bully pulpit, this is one.

HEADLINE: Handy? Surely, But Debit Card Has Risks, Too

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
When Meredith Platt ripped open the envelope from Chase Manhattan Bank in March, she expected a simple replacement for her automated teller machine card. But the shiny blue piece of plastic that fell out could be used at more than just the corner cash machine. It was also good for siphoning money from her checking account at more than four million retail outlets nationwide.
"My first thought was, 'Why are they sending me a debit card when I didn't ask for one?' " said Ms. Platt, a research psychologist in Orangeburg, N.Y. "That just didn't seem right." 
 Right or wrong, millions of Americans are getting debit cards -- also known as check cards -- that they did not ask for. And many are carrying them around without realizing they have them. In what some industry analysts are dubbing the Big Switch, 1.3 million debit cards are being issued each month -- largely as replacements for A.T.M.-only cards. And brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch are offering them as part of their customers' Cash Management Accounts. Banking experts estimate that two-thirds of American households will have one by 2000, up from a little less than one-half today.
Ultimately, the experts predict, the penetration rate will rise to 80 percent, meaning that debit cards will rival the popularity of the ubiquitous credit card. Indeed, debit cards are already easier to get than credit cards and are becoming more so as banks tighten credit card restrictions and raise fees and interest rates to counter a rise in unpaid bills.
Many people are pleased with their debit cards. For one thing, users need not show identification, as they would have to when writing checks. Also, they can use the cards instead of cash, meaning they have to carry less money, and instead of a credit card, on which they would pay a double-digit interest rate.
"I love my debit card," said Toni Simonetti, who works for the General Motors Corporation in New York. "It's better than cash because I can keep track of where I'm spending my money. And when I travel, I no longer have to stock up on traveler's checks or cash."
But debit cards pose perils that consumers usually are unaware of and that banks do not like to discuss: liability for lost or stolen cards. Losses from credit card theft are capped at $50. But with debit cards, the loss limitation quickly climbs to $500 and is unlimited if the theft is not reported for 60 days. Also, people who write checks can always stop payment on them; they lack that option with some debit cards.
"Banks are not disclosing the pitfalls associated with debit cards," said Pam Pressley, a lawyer with the California Public Interest Research Group, a consumer organization based in Los Angeles. "If your card is stolen and money is taken from your account, you're out that money while the bank investigates." Consumer groups are pushing for the rules on debit cards to be changed to match those for credit cards.
Still, Americans are definitely warming to innovation, notching up 1.4 billion transactions totaling $54.5 billion with the new-style debit cards last year, up from 279 million transactions worth $14.2 billion in 1993. Consumers generally use the debit cards for small purchases at grocery, liquor and other stores where they used to spend cash or write checks. For big purchases, most shoppers still use their credit cards.
What is astounding about the proliferation of debit cards is that American consumers rejected them several years ago. Realizing that consumers balked at the word "debit" with its connotation of debt, the banks have quietly renamed them check cards and added the debit feature to automated teller cards.
The potential for profit is enormous. For one thing, when a shopper uses a debit card, the store pays the bank that issued the card a fee -- typically 2 percent of the purchase price, about the same as when a shopper uses a credit card. And banks and the major credit card companies, Visa U.S.A. and Mastercard International, which promote the debit cards, have concluded that the debit cards do not compete with credit cards, so they are not simply shifting revenue.
Better yet for the banks, debit cards save them money. The average debit card transaction costs 29 cents, compared with 65 cents to process a check and 91 cents to cash one with a teller, according to Gemini Consulting in Morristown, N.J.
But consumer groups worry that millions of people are unaware of the debit feature on their A.T.M. cards and the risks it carries. Only slightly more than half of American households that own debit cards regularly use them, according to Payment Systems Inc., a banking consulting firm in Tampa, Fla. That alarms industry consultants, who fear that many consumers pocket their new A.T.M. cards without reading the material that explains the debit card feature.
They miss plenty. Traditional A.T.M. cards could typically be used only at grocery stores and gas stations after consumers punched in their personal identification numbers. The newer versions, like the Visa Check and Mastercard's Master Money, are usually embossed with those companies' logos and are accepted like credit cards.
Most consumer groups think the old-fashioned cards are safer -- thieves have a more difficult time stealing an identification number than a receipt. But banks do not like them as much. Whereas the newer versions generate a 2 percent fee on each purchase -- or 80 cents on the average transaction of $40 -- the older cards generate a scant 14 cents for each transaction.
With debit cards expected to generate $250 million for banks this year, plus the savings on processing costs, it is no wonder banks are promoting the cards. In mid-June, 62.5 million new-style cards were in Americans' wallets, a 146 percent increase in three years.
"Consumers really liked Visa Check once they began to understand it," said Michael Beindorff, an executive vice president for Visa. "The card has developed a broad demographic."
It is lucky it has any demographic at all after its dubious beginning in the late 1980's. But the recent makeover worked so well that many bank customers now ask for a debit card.
But what millions of consumers often fail to grasp is their liability for fraudulent billings. Whereas credit card holders can be charged only $50 for charges by thieves, for debit card users that limit applies only if a card is reported lost or stolen within two business days. Wait more than that, and liability climbs to $500. Neglect to notify the bank of the theft within 60 days after a bank statement is sent, and you could lose everything in your account.
How is this possible? Debit and credit cards are covered under different Federal Reserve regulations, tricky laws that even bankers apparently have trouble following. Mr. Beindorff dismissed arguments that debit cards were not safe, saying that "people didn't have the real facts." He then misquoted the Federal Reserve regulation that applies to debit cards, stating wrongly that consumers do not face serious liability unless their cards' disappearance goes unreported for several weeks. (A Visa spokesman insists Mr. Beindorff knows the rules.)
Mr. Beindorff should talk to David Small, a 34-year-old grocery clerk in Stockton, Calif. Mr. Small's debit card was stolen from a gym in April, but he did not discover the theft until several days later. Rushing to his Bank of America branch, he canceled the card and closed his checking account.
He then opened a new account and ordered a new debit card. But whoever had stolen his old card continued running up bills. Even though Mr. Small was not liable for them, bills totaling $2,000 were charged against his new account until the bank finished its investigation.
He was flat broke. "I eventually got my money back," Mr. Small said. "But it wasn't easy. While Bank of America was investigating the theft, I was totally out of that money. That was about two weeks. They eventually had to give me $500 so I could live. They gave me another debit card, and I leave it in my house."
The banks dismiss contentions they have been recklessly mailing out debit cards. Banks send out material with each card, clearly explaining it is tied to a checking account, said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. On top of that, consumers who do not want the debit card can exchange it for a plain A.T.M. card.
"The theft protection, though, is different with a debit card," Mr. Hall said. "But the key really is when the customer notices that his card is missing. If someone has their apartment robbed, they're going to report it immediately, and then they would be covered. They wouldn't be if they decided to wait a few weeks while someone is running up charges. The customer has some responsibility."
To get more people to use their new A.T.M. cards as debit cards, banks are introducing incentive programs such as retailer discounts.
Turning a loyal check writer into a debit card user is not going to be easy, however. Not only are consumer groups questioning some of the banks' practices, but banks are also facing resistance from some retailers unhappy with the high fees. In a suit filed in Federal Court in Brooklyn last October, Wal-Mart and the Limited contend that Visa is forcing them to pay a debit card fee that is almost as high as the credit card fee.
And, concerned about consumer confusion and issues of antitrust, the Senate Banking Committee will begin hearings on banks' debit card practices in the fall.
Elizabeth Hitchcock, the communications director at the United States Public Interest Research Group in Washington, said her own brush with debit card fraud convinced her more controls were needed. Somehow, she says, a thief obtained one of her receipts and used it to make a $75 mail-order purchase and to book a hotel room.
"Losing my debit card receipt was an expensive lesson," she said. "The merchant is not on the hook when someone starts stealing money out of my checking account. The person who loses with that is me."

HEADLINE: Danger as a Way of Life

BYLINE: By Sebastian Junger; Sebastian Junger is the author of "The Perfect Storm."

 BODY:
For five years -- before I managed to make a living as a freelance journalist -- I made my money working as a high climber for tree-removal companies. The trees were leaning over people's houses and couldn't simply be felled; they had to be dismantled piece by piece. Two or three days a week I would climb 60- or 70-foot trees, cutting sections off with a chain saw and lowering them on ropes held by workers on the ground.
It was dangerous work, but for manual labor, it was extremely well paid and one of the few things that managed to prop up my self-esteem. Watching the top 20 feet of a pine tree peel off over my head while the chain saw screamed in my hands was a thrill that almost made up for my failure as a writer. For a few moments, at least, I would feel like the most powerful man on earth. 
 Society has a great use for young men who feel invincible. It throws them at projects that are so brutal or dangerous that no one in his right mind would go near them, much less relish them. In exchange for that feeling of strength, young men go to war, go to sea, build skyscrapers, parachute into forest fires.
One day I was up in an utterly forgettable elm tree when a hurried move with the chain saw opened up the back of my leg. I could see the Achilles tendon, white and rubbery, imbedded in a substance that was the inside of my leg. It didn't particularly hurt and it didn't bleed very much. But it took a month to heal, and, facing my 30th birthday and the revelation that I could actually get hurt or killed doing certain things, I started to reassess my life.
I decided to make it as a writer or to get out of the freelance trap entirely. No more of this in-between stuff, facilitated by the easy money I was making in the treetops.
So instead of doing the dangerous jobs myself, I researched smoke jumpers, loggers, war correspondents and commercial fishermen. The people who did these jobs seemed to divide neatly into two categories.
The first, in which I included myself, were mainly college-educated men and women who wanted to experience the world as broadly as possible. For them, fishing in Alaska or fighting forest fires in Montana was an interesting adventure. Eventually, they moved on to the kinds of careers that -- if I may say this -- their parents probably envisioned for them.
As the poet Michael Klein observed, "risk is extra life," and that wonderfully simple formula describes these people perfectly. Their decision to do dangerous work was evidence, in a way, of the vast array of choices they had available to them after college.
The other category of people -- almost exclusively men -- were in dangerous work for the opposite reason: They had almost no choices at all. The Oregon loggers I spoke with, and the fishermen in Gloucester, Mass., often hadn't even finished high school, much less college, and were hanging on for dear life to the only industry they knew. Few relished the beauty of the sea or forest. Most saw precious little romance in their work and wanted to get out of the business before they were killed or maimed.
The country has become fascinated with dangerous sports -- mountain climbing, big-wave surfing, extreme skiing -- and the people who do these things receive an incredible amount of attention, even glory. And some of them should. What is missing, however, is an appreciation for workers doing things that are just as dangerous -- and that actually contribute to society.
Let's face it, we don't, in any kind of basic way, need another solo ocean crossing or another free-diving record. But we do need people who are willing to work on oil rigs, build skyscrapers and run farm machinery -- jobs that kill people with relentless regularity. In Gloucester alone, for example, 10,000 men have been lost at sea since the town was founded. Has any other American town taken those kinds of losses?
 Not only are these jobs dangerous, many of them are dying out as well. Two of the country's most hazardous occupations -- logging and fishing -- are so fraught with problems that many families can't even support themselves anymore. One fisherman I know -- whose ancestors settled in Gloucester in the 1600's -- refused to let his children set foot on any fishing boat because he was afraid they'd fall in love with it. He wasn't worried that they might die at sea; he was worried that they might never get the chance to die at sea.
For many people, in other words, risk doesn't mean extra life -- it means hardship, unemployment and even the possibility of early death. And the rest of us, parachuting from airplanes, climbing up rock faces, skiing down mountain walls, would do well to keep our accomplishments in perspective.

HEADLINE: I Told You So

BYLINE: By David E. Bonior; David E. Bonior, a Michigan Democrat, is the House minority whip.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On Friday, the Clinton Administration released a report on the first three years of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The most the Administration could bring itself to say is that Nafta has had a "modest positive effect" on the American economy. That's a far cry from the extravagant promises made by the accord's proponents during the 1993 debate: "Hundreds of thousands of new jobs! Higher wages! A cleaner environment! Just you wait and see!"
They were wrong. The facts are in. 
 Three hundred thousand new jobs? No. The report, required by Congress, suggests that Nafta-related exports have created 90,000 to 160,000 new jobs. But those figures don't account for the 132,000 Americans who have lost their jobs as a result of the agreement. That's the number of Nafta-related job losses certified under the Labor Department's Nafta Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, set up to help displaced American workers.
Higher wages? No. Mexican wages along the border have dropped from $1 to 70 cents an hour, according to International Monetary Fund figures. A 1996 Cornell University study commissioned by the Labor Department found that 62 percent of U.S. companies surveyed have used the threat of moving to Mexico to hold down wages here at home.
Environmental cleanup? No. Toxic sites along the border have continued to multiply. To date, only 1 percent of the $2 billion in cleanup funds promised under Nafta have been spent.
The Administration's report ignores these facts, trying to put the best face on an agreement that clearly hasn't delivered on its promises.
It is true that trade has risen between the United States and Mexico in the last three years, but it has been lopsided. Imports from Mexico have surged by 83 percent since 1993. What was a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico before Nafta became a record $16 billion deficit last year.
Even the Nafta-generated exports are costing us jobs. More and more, multinationals are shipping components to Mexico, so they can be assembled by low-wage workers, then sent right back as finished products to the United States. According to an analysis by the University of California economist Harley Shaiken, these revolving-door exports have more than doubled, from $18 billion in 1993 to $42 billion last year.
So who does benefit from Nafta? Some of the big winners are the 28 core members of USA-Nafta, an industry group that lobbied for the agreement. Forty-two percent of these multinationals shipped jobs abroad once Nafta was adopted, an analysis of the Labor Department's trade adjustment assistance data shows. Their profits have increased by 296 percent, according to financial information published in Forbes.
Nafta's toll cannot be measured only in economic terms. The Administration's report also ignores real threats to our health and safety.
Imports of Mexican fruit have increased 45 percent since Nafta was enacted, and vegetable imports have gone up by 31 percent, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported this year.
This produce rolls into the United States on 3.3 million trucks a year. Fewer than 1 percent of these trucks are inspected at the border, according to a May 1997 study by the General Accounting Office. That means parasites, pesticides and infectious diseases go undetected.
For example, the Environmental Working Group found that 18.4 percent of imported Mexican strawberries contain "very high rates of illegal pesticides."
Earlier this year in Michigan, 179 children became seriously ill after eating contaminated Mexican strawberries. Shouldn't such incidents argue for stiffer inspections of imported produce? Unbelievably, under Nafta, such inspections could be considered an unfair trade restriction.
This appalling lack of inspections is also encouraging the drug trade. The Drug Enforcement Agency says that 70 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States now comes across the U.S.-Mexican border.
Nafta has not delivered on its promises. Let's not repeat the errors of the past. Instead of rushing to expand it and putting other countries on the "fast track," let's concentrate on fixing Nafta first.

HEADLINE: Athletes Are the Victims In These Sneaker Wars

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
Sixteen-year-old Rafael Berumen launched his basketball career in earnest last week, flying from California to New Jersey on booster-club money to audition with 239 other high school players for several hundred college coaches at a recruiting fair sponsored by a shoe company.
"I came to get rated," he said, shrugging at the suggestion that this seemed like a lot of pressure for a high school kid going into his junior year. He held one big hand, palm down, about four feet off the ground. "I'm used to it. People have been looking at me since I'm this high." 
 He is now 6 feet 8 1/2 inches high and a foot soldier in the Sneaker Wars. Berumen had chosen to attend the Adidas-sponsored ABCD camp although he had been invited as well to the rival Nike camp in Indianapolis, also held last week. The camps are kickoff events of the summer basketball season. On Tuesday, Berumen will compete with his Simi Valley High School team, which is outfitted by Adidas, in the Adidas-sponsored 182-team Big Time Amateur Athletic Union tournament in Las Vegas, Nev.
There are many front lines in the Sneaker Wars. Minds and soles are won by Spike Lee commercials for Air Jordans and by "street reps" who hand out shoes to gangsters and by the million-dollar deals of Coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke and Georgetown's John Thompson. After the Asian sweatshop workers who actually make the shoes, the most exploited figures are the young players like Berumen.
"It's hypocrisy, lunacy," said Sonny Vaccaro, who runs the ABCD camp. While at Nike, he refined and institutionalized the hiring of college coaches to make their players wear a particular brand of shoes, and of using all-star games and summer camps as trade shows. "We get great advertising and the coaches get to see the kids. What do the kids get? A T-shirt. We give them all top-of-the-line tennis shoes to play in, but they have to turn them back afterwards. Amateur rules. We donate the shoes to charity."
Home in Simi Valley, Rafael's mother, Terry Berumen, laughed. "You think there are a lot of charity cases with size 15 feet? You know, I didn't even know it was Adidas, I just knew it was a chance for him. He's very talented, and we want him to get motivation. If we could have afforded it, we would have sent his older brother along. Rafael isn't so streetwise."
But he's courtwise. He averaged about 23 points and 11 rebounds per game as a sophomore last season on a team that won 23 and lost 4. His coach, Dean Bradshaw, says he has "soft hands" and is definitely Division I material. Syracuse, Georgetown and U.C.L.A. have expressed interest.
More schools may get interested if the coaches who crowded into the three-court circus of the Hackensack, N.J., gym of Fairleigh Dickinson University last week liked what they saw of Rafael. Follow-up is easy. For $75, each recruiter bought a book containing the vital playing statistics of each athlete -- most were going into their senior years -- as well as their home addresses and phone numbers, and the names and phone numbers of their schools and their coaches.
For the athletes, the meat-market atmosphere was only an extreme extension of their playing lives. Julian Dunkley, who was discovered at this camp by Temple coaches, was back last week as a counselor, playing in morning games that were covered by pro scouts and coaches.
"This jump-starts your summer," he said. "You get confidence in your game. The high school players get morning classes on how to take the S.A.T. exams, tips like that. Very helpful. The hotel rooms are really nice, and we're fed well. While I'm here, I'm also looking around. We could use a 7-foot center at Temple."
Last summer, Tracy McGrady, an unknown forward from Mount Zion Christian Academy, a basketball factory in North Carolina, took the camp by storm with play so brilliant that he didn't need the college scholarship that Dunkley got and Berumen wants. McGrady proceeded directly to the National Basketball Association. Not only was he picked in the first round by Toronto, but Vaccaro signed him to a $12 million Adidas deal.
There was no such overnight sensation at last week's camp, although the possibility was a common fantasy. Meanwhile, reality had its own built-in dreams. Berumen's parents -- his father is a security guard in Los Angeles and his mother, recently unemployed, is in school -- spent about $250 for his plane ticket. They were reimbursed by Simi Valley's active athletic booster club. In the convoluted world of "amateur" rules, Adidas "donates" basketball shoes to the club, which then distributes them to the team. Coach Bradshaw says he receives no money from Adidas.
According to the school principal, Dennis Rast, shoe company donations are welcome in this time of cutbacks, but need to be monitored. "You wouldn't want students picking a high school because it gets the most and best uniforms and equipment."
The Berumens picked Simi Valley because they wanted to give Rafael a chance to "improve his academics" in an atmosphere free of drugs and gangs. Through his freshman year they had lived in Pomona, more than an hour away, where blacks and Mexicans frequently fight. When they first visited Simi Valley High, senior citizens on duty at the entrances demanded to know where they were going and why; that immediately sold the school to Mrs. Berumen. Although Simi Valley is predominately white, she says she has felt no prejudice. Now and then, people ask her if Rafael is really Mexican, and what she fed him to make him so tall.
"I tell them rice and beans," she said, laughing. "It's what they think we always eat."
Rafael called home a half-dozen times to report on his progress. He thought he was doing well at camp. His mother was proud.
"But it's not a victory yet," she said, "There are bad influences out on the streets and he's at an age where he is easily impressed. I keep close tabs. I don't let him out at night. Except to play."

 THE COLONEL
 The Life and Legend of Robert R.
 McCormick, Indomitable Editor
 of The Chicago Tribune.
 By Richard Norton Smith.
 Illustrated. 612 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Co. $35. 
 If men were ships, Robert R McCormick would have been a dreadnought, Six feet four inches tall, with a 52-inch chest, 36-inch arms, an armor-plated ego and a personality as pugnacious as a gun turret, he hugely displaced all ambient elements, physical, social, and political, as he steamed through his four-decade career as editor of The Chicago Tribune. And like the lumbering battle cruisers of the World War I era, it was his destiny to obsolesce badly as the Second World War eventually engulfed even "Chicagoland," McCormick's boosterish term for the Midwestern land island that stretched from Iowa to Ohio and was daily blanketed by a million copies of his ferociously conservative and stridently isolationist newspaper. McCormick, the British Ambassador to the United States reported in 1938, was "stubborn, slow thinking and bellicose." He was also implacably and-British, anti-New Deal and anti-Franklin Roosevelt -- and The Tribune, with the largest readership and the fattest advertising revenue of any standard-sized newspaper in the nation, was, Richard Norton Smith writes, "a megaphone to amplify the publisher's caprices."
 McCormick, in fact, was anti- just about everything, a man defined far more deeply by his loathings than by his loves. As Smith, the director of the Gerald R. Ford Museum and Library and a biographer of Thomas E. Dewey, Herbert Hoover and George Washington, says in one of the many penetrating appraisals of his subject in his candid and colorful biography: "McCormick needed enemies, it seemed, the way most men need friends."
 Irascibility flowed copiously in the McCormick family bloodstream. His paternal great-uncle Cyrus, inventor of the mechanical reaper, had pursued the Pennsylvania Railroad through the law courts for 21 years over a piece of damaged luggage. His legendary maternal grandfather Joseph Medill, the long-time editor and publisher of The Tribune and a confidante of Abraham Lincoln, in his waning days poured into young "Bertie's" ears the maunderings of his senescent mind, which Smith describes as "a magpie's nest of misinformation and prejudices." Medill's daughter Kate, McCormick's mother, a singularly unmaternal woman who bribed her grown children to visit her, was a gratuitously quirt-tongued harridan who once told an interviewer: "I hate the Jews. I hate the British. I hate the French. God damn them all." She thought Woodrow Wilson a "villain" and a "wretch." She dismissed McCormick's first wife as "that old strumpet." Joseph Medill, she lectured her son, had been a "man of stern morality and immovable convictions, and you . . . are neither."
 In that prickly family atmosphere, McCormick grew up to be a reflexive "aginner," a man of epic antagonisms, prodigious crotchets and -- here his mother was wrong -- fixed, taproot convictions impermeable to evidence or reason. He was "at home in his own mind," Smith writes, "and nowhere else."
 None of McCormick's hatreds burned more hotly than his odium for all things foreign; no conviction shone more brightly than his faith in Chicagoland's cultural and political superiority. McCormick's gentleman-diplomat father had served in London, Vienna and St. Petersburg, but all "Bertie" seemed to get out of those parental assignments was a tenacious contempt for all that was not American, or, more precisely, Midwestern. As a pupil in a British boarding school, he slept under a bedcover fashioned from an American flag. At Groton -- then the most Anglophilic of American schools -- he seethed with resentment as the only member of his class born west of the Hudson River (Franklin Roosevelt, his future nemesis, was one class behind him). Yale he found "feminized and Anglicized." By the time he left New Haven in 1903, McCormick had already crystallized the sentiments that eventually hardened into the Tribune's trademark editorial axioms: Britain was a "chalk-cliffed hell" inhabited by "pink-coated, horn-blowing, supercilious bankrupts." The northeastern United States swarmed with the "dodging, obligation-shifting idle rich . . . diluted in their Americanism by other hordes of immigrants." Should the United States need to be defended against an invasion, McCormick later advised, fortifications should be constructed along a line that ran from Albany through Pittsburgh and Atlanta to Houston, then up the spines of the western mountain ranges. Conspicuously outside this defense perimeter was the eastern seaboard
 When his uncle, The Tribune's editor Robert Patterson, committed suicide in 1910, McCormick and his cousin Joseph Patterson assumed control of The Tribune. They blazed their slogan, "The World's Greatest Newspaper," across the front page and set out to make good on the claim. Joseph Patterson eventually left Chicago to run The Daily News in New York, so it was mostly under McCormick's prodding that The Tribune grew into a fabulously profitable and enormously influential newspaper. Circulation quadrupled. The World's Greatest Newspaper bristled with comic strips, advice columns, sensational reportage and column-miles of advertising. It also trumpeted endlessly provocative opinions, handed down with regal arrogance from the editor's aerie on the 24th floor of the Tribune Tower, a flamboyantly Gothic shaft erected in 1925 that Smith calls "the presbytery of Midwestern conservatism." In the 1920's McCormick expanded into the newest medium of mass communication, radio, with a station whose call letters were -- what else? -- WGN.
 From these print and electronic pulpits, McCormick broadcast the conservative gospel according to McCormick. Even Herbert Hoover could not measure up to McCormick's demanding ideological standard. Hoover, he said, was "the greatest state socialist in history." It did not take the New Deal to make a conservative out of McCormick. "Long before the advent of Franklin Roosevelt,"Smith writes, "the man in the tower was warning of an erosion of personal liberties . . . . Here, then, are to be found the roots of a paranoia that sprouted strange blossoms as McCormick and Roosevelt, the patriot ant the pragmatist, fought a duel over the American way of life."
 After a brief flirtation between the two old Grotonians in early 1933, McCormick soon emerged as Roosevelt's most loud-mouthed critic. His detestation of the New Deal was bottomless. McCormick became the largest single contributor to Alfred Landon, Roosevelt's Republican opponent, in the 1936 Presidential election. As the campaign began, The Tribune headlined: "Only 97 days left to save your country!" -- a warning that McCormick ordered Tribune switchboard operators to repeat, with appropriate countdown as election day approached, to every incoming caller. "Mr. Roosevelt is a Communist," McCormick editorialized, an opinion he never saw any reason to qualify.
 The New Deal might have been an abomination, but Roosevelt's intensifying effort to pursue an internationalist foreign policy was anathema. As the world crisis deepened in the late 1930's, and Roosevelt sought ways to put American influence onto the scales on the side of the democracies, McCormick stepped forward as the most outspoken of isolationists. The United States had nothing at stake in the looming European conflict, McCormick thundered. All the proof necessary to that proposition was to be found in the history American involvement in World War I -- in which, not incidentally, McCormick had served, rising to the rank of colonel. The American intervention in Europe in 1917, McCormick believed, had claimed some 50,000 American lives yet had done nothing to redeem the hopelessly rivalrous Europeans. The miserable failure of that great departure from the ancient American principle of isolationism starkly warned against any further dalliance with internationalist policies. Along with cousin Joseph Patterson's Daily News and cousin Cissy Patterson's Washington Times-Herald, McCormick's Tribune formed a major platform for those isolationist preachments. Henry Luce called the cousins the Three Furies of Isolation. Roosevelt called them the McCormick-Patterson Axis.
 It was no accident that when Roosevelt in October 1937 gave his famous "Quarantine Address," the first of his major public speeches designed to wean his countrymen away from their isolationist illusions, he ventured into Chicagoland to beard the lion in his den (and was forced almost immediately to back off). Nor was it accidental that it was The Tribune that leaked the War Department's "Victory Program" plans in 1941, in an effort to undermine political support for military preparation; nor that it was The Tribune that published sensitive details about the Navy's victory at Midway in 1942 -- an episode that triggered an abortive attempt to convict McCormick on espionage charges. Against this background, The Tribune's most notorious journalistic gaffe -- the "Dewey Defeats Truman" headline in 1948 -- seems but one more episode in a long line of instances where McCormick's editorial wishes were father to The Tribune's reportorial position.
 Though for the most part Smith is content to describe rather than analyze, he explores these and many other chapters in McCormick's long career with sensitivity, flair and even a measure of sympathy. Yet even his measured empathy is put to the test in the book's concluding pages. McCormick, he writes, "lived too long," and in the years immediately preceding his death in l955, his "flair for the outrageous bordered on self-parody." Nor does Smith succeed in revealing much about McCormick's crabbed inner life, including his two marriages, both apparently as barren of emotional warmth as they were of children. Readers will be left wondering, too, what to make of the haunting paradox that McCormick, the scourge of all things alien, the most disillusioned of World War I veterans, the paladin of isolation, died at the estate he named for the World War I battle in which he had fought -- Cantigny -- and directed that he should be buried in his World War I uniform.

Suki John and Horacio Cocchi

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY

 BODY:
"I DESCRIBE myself as someone who does everything you can do to make a living through dance, except strip," said Suki John, 38, who teaches salsa and ballet at schools, senior-citizen centers and studios in New York City. She also writes about dance and has worked as a choreographer for companies in Spain, Cuba, England, Finland and France. "I am the definition of freelance," she said.
A petite woman who appears to have zero percent body fat, Ms. John is a blur of energy, enthusiasm and plans. She rarely stays in one place for long. "Suki has an incredible will to live fully," said Dr. Vera John Steiner, her mother. 
 Ms. John's best friend, Richard Laermer, added: "I gave Suki a postcard once, a picture of a woman packing, and the line was, 'The minute she puts her suitcases down, she's packing again.' That's Suki. She's not running away. She's just running."
In a rare quiet moment a year ago, Ms. John was sitting in a coffee shop near Lincoln Center when she saw Horacio Cocchi standing in line. Thinking he was seriously handsome, she watched as he paid for his lunch, then looked around for a place to sit.
"I gathered my courage and I went after him," Ms. John recalled. "I said, 'Would you like to sit with me?' It was the best move I ever made."
They talked about everything from Spanish poetry to modern dance. Mr. Cocchi, 39, is a Ph.D. candidate in agricultural economics at the University of Connecticut. He grew up in Uruguay, has lived in France and Italy, loves to cook and looks like a rumpled yet charming professor.
He called Ms. John a week later, but they couldn't get together since she was packing to leave for three months in Santa Fe, N.M., where her mother lives. Ms. John had set up yet another freelance job there -- teaching dance on an Indian reservation.
While in Santa Fe, she often thought about Mr. Cocchi, whom she called "the Coffee Shop Man." "One day, my mom said, 'Why don't you call the Coffee Shop Man?' " Ms. John said. "So I called him and asked for his E-mail address. I was aggressive in this relationship, and he loved it."
From then on, Ms. John and Mr. Cocchi corresponded almost every day via E-mail. "Then he started to call me," she said. "One time, my mother heard his voice on the answering machine and said, 'Wow, the Coffee Shop Man has a really nice voice.' "
Soon after Ms. John returned to New York, she went to visit Mr. Cocchi in Connecticut for a day and ended up staying a week. "She really fell for Horacio," said Mr. Laermer, who manages a Web site on America Online called Natives Guide to New York. "I told her, 'Hold back a little bit.' I've always believed the most important thing in a relationship is mystery. I used to tell Suki all the time, 'I know you love the guy, but it's none of his business.' "
Last Sunday, Ms. John and Mr. Cocchi were married in Accord, N.Y., in the backyard of an 1845 house owned by their friends Eric Stewart and Michael Sheran. The couple exchanged their vows under a weeping willow tree big enough to shade about 140 guests. The branches hung so low that one guest even took out a Swiss Army knife and cut off a few branches so he could see better.
Afterward, everyone ate a potluck meal under a white tent in a field of knee-high grass. Mr. Laermer delivered the first toast and reminisced about how he and the bride used to take long midnight walks through Manhattan, discussing their love lives and wondering if they would ever find the right mates.
"Now, eight years later, the answer is yes," Mr. Laermer concluded. "You will find the person of your dreams if you stick to your guns."

 CORRECTION:
The Vows column on Sunday about the wedding of Suki John and Horacio Cocchi referred incorrectly to the computer service that carries the Native's Guide to New York, an on-line forum managed by a friend of the bride. It is Compuserve, not America Online.

Crime Invades a Once-Peaceful Place

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
Wu Chihau often watches the good guys bash the bad guys on TV, but when he found himself tied up and blindfolded the other day, he abruptly realized that heroic escapes are not as easy as they seem.
Chihau, 13, was bound and gagged in a simulated kidnapping, one of a growing number of training programs that are flourishing after a surge of sensational crimes in Taiwan this year. 
 "If we faced the real thing, I'd be so scared I wouldn't be able to think of what to do," Chihau said with a wide-eyed look as he recalled the class. "But now, at least I'll have some idea."
Taiwan and the rest of East Asia have been proud of their mix of exploding wealth and low crime rates. Modernization has brought fancy cars, computers and marble floors to many million-dollar homes here, and at the same time crime rates have mostly been at the low levels of an agrarian society.
But lately, in Taiwan at least, rising rates of robbery, assault and murder have trickled into society along with the Italian fashions and Japanese department stores. Taiwan has become a cosmopolitan and mobile society, but also -- by its own standards -- a dangerous one.
Indeed, crime rates are creeping up and in some cases surpassing those in Western countries; the murder rate in Taiwan is 8.5 per 100,000 people, compared with 8.2 in the United States in 1995.
"The perception of the people is right," said Huang Fu-yuan, a criminologist at Central Police University. "Crime is terrible."
"We need to pay the price of modernization," he added. "If we are going to get more materialistic, then there will be more crime."
Over all, crime rates soared 80 percent over the last decade in Taiwan, but public discontent exploded in May after several particularly brutal cases, including the kidnapping and slaying of Pai Hsiao-yen, the 17-year-old daughter of a beloved movie actress.
The girl was on her way to high school when she was abducted. Later that evening, the kidnappers called the mother, Pai Ping-ping, and told her to go to a cemetery, where she found a demand for $5 million, scraps of her daughter's clothes and a section of the girl's pinky finger.
Miss Pai went immediately to the police, and when word of the kidnapping was leaked to the press, the drama unfolded on television and riveted the island. Miss Pai appealed to the public to cooperate with the police, but after a failed attempt to deliver the money, her daughter's body was found in a swamp. No one has been arrested.
"Now, society is very different from when we were small, when we'd play outside until our mother called us in for dinner. There was no fear at all," said Mao Kai-ling, 42, the mother of two teen-agers. "But now because society's changing so fast, we need to learn about these criminal affairs. We need to take responsibility for our own safety and get the tools to deal with it."
The killing of Miss Pai led to demonstrations in which thousands of protesters demanded that Prime Minister Lien Chan resign to take responsibility for what they viewed as a crime wave. And they called for President Lee Teng-hui to apologize for neglecting to safeguard the security of the island's 21 million citizens.
In the end, Taiwan's Interior Minister, Lin Fung-cheng, stepped down, along with the Government's spokesman. But the public concern has hardly abated.
Two other prominent cases remain unsolved, one of them the killing in November of a county head and his entourage of seven people at his official residence near Taipei. Also in November, a woman politician in the main opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, was killed, apparently by a taxi driver.
"Along with the development of our economy, people have been calling for democracy and freedom, but their moral thinking has not yet found solid ground," said Chou Wen-keh, a senior police official. "Violent crime is actually dropping, but these three cases give everyone the impression that there's a lot of crime."
In 1996, the number of criminal cases rose 12.5 percent. But in the first five months of this year, violent crime cases have actually dropped slightly, partly because the police began a crackdown on Taiwanese criminal gangs like the Bamboo Union.
In fact, in the years since 1991, only 30 children have been abducted. But the prominent cases have naturally drawn the public's attention.
That was why Shaw Mei-chen sent her daughters to a kidnapping-combat class run by the International Bodyguard and Security Service Association.
"If the kids don't have any inkling of how to handle such a situation and if something really happened, they'd be at a loss," Mrs. Shaw said. "They'd scream and shout."
"We protect her from everything," she said about one of her daughters. "We think of everything for her. She'd definitely get herself killed. So I wanted her to learn about what to do."

HEADLINE: Cattle Barons of Texas Yore Accused of Epic Land Grab

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: SARITA, Tex., July 9

 BODY:
As a courtroom drama, the legal battle shaping up between more than 800 descendants of Jose Manuel Balli Villarreal and the John G. and Marie Stella Kenedy Memorial Foundation has the makings of an epic, set against the backdrop of the vast and thorny brushland of South Texas. There are ancient family feuds, mysterious reports of yellowed documents found in an attic that could prove to be legal bombshells, claims and counterclaims of fraud and treachery.
In the early 1800's, Mr. Balli was given a land grant by the King of Spain to a large tract in South Texas when it was part of the Spanish empire. The clan descended from Mr. Balli and his wife, Maria Antonia Cavazos de Hinojosa, asserts that the land was ultimately stolen by Mifflin Kenedy, one of Texas's most powerful ranchers, who built a cattle empire across the area and whose own descendants later became fabulously wealthy from both the cattle and the oil and gas on the property. The Ballis are now asking for tens of millions of dollars, maybe much more, in compensation. 
 At its core, the issue turns on an interpretation of history: Were the great Texas ranchers like Mr. Kenedy and Richard King, of the fabled King Ranch, visionary figures who tamed a wasteland with honor and grit, or were they Anglo land grabbers who used trickery and violence to rob Mexicans of their property?
And, as scholars watch with fascination as the case unfolds, many say that the fact that the lawsuit has even advanced in the courts speaks volumes about the changing demographics of the region and the ways in which American history is revised from generation to generation.
"The kind of argument that the Ballis are making is going to get a much better hearing than it would have had 20 or 25 years ago," said Don Carleton, director of the Center for American History at the University of Texas in Austin, and a specialist in Texas history. "Hispanic-Americans in this country have a lot more political power, and this is what happens when you get political power in a democratic society."
In some ways the case can be compared to efforts in recent years by American Indians to gain land or compensation for past injustices, said Lynne Perez, a genealogist and historian in San Antonio who has been hired by the Balli clan to research old land claims.
"Years ago, no Mexican-American family could have gone into court and demanded justice from the white establishment," said Ms. Perez, whose husband is a great-great-great grandson of Mr. Balli and thus a claimant to the fortune. "Times have changed."
In setting the stage for a lawsuit, the more than 800 Balli descendants asked to be legally acknowledged as his heirs. Last month, the case took an important step forward when Judge Manuel Flores of the 49th State District Court in Zapata County, along the Mexican border, declared 586 of them in that role. They joined about 250 other petitioners who had already been declared Balli heirs.
In an unusual response, the Kenedy Foundation, a charitable trust whose assets derived from Mr. Kenedy's fortune, filed a court petition in tiny Sarita -- the county seat of Kenedy County, named for the rancher -- that seeks to have the roughly 370,000 acres at issue legally declared to be owned by the foundation.
The petition, which listed many of the Ballis by name in an effort to have their claim ruled invalid, said that the Kenedys had been "in possession of all of said lands for over 100 years," and noted that the land had been "fenced and enclosed" for all that time. It also argues that even if the land had at one time been taken from the Ballis, it had long since come into the Kenedys' possession under a legal principle known as "adverse possession," a rough equivalent of squatter's rights.
Moreover, suggested Richard Leshin, a Corpus Christi lawyer who represents the foundation, the very principle being invoked by the Ballis could open up a Pandora's box of legal problems across the state.
"The opportunity to attack the legal title system based on assertions about events that occurred centuries ago could cause strong disruption to the ownership of properties throughout the state of Texas," Mr. Leshin said in a recent interview.
Not so, say the Ballis, who contend that they never abandoned the land and who note that various efforts have been made by clan descendants over the years to get land back, including an effort in the 1950's to reclaim much of Padre Island, on the Gulf Coast. The bid was thrown out by a state court.
"Those lands belong to us," said Jose A. Perez, a retired air traffic controller in the Fort Worth area who is president of Los Ballis Restoration L.L.C., a partnership of Balli descendants formed to advance the clan's claims on the land. "They were taken, stolen, whatever, from our forefathers, and it's time we go into court once and for all and get this resolved."
Land claims in South Texas have sparked lawsuits for decades, mainly among Anglo families, and many of them have resulted in financial settlements.
"This region has had so many overlapping legal jurisdictions, from Spain to Mexico to the Republic of Texas, to the period after the United States annexed it, and so on and so on and so on," said Professor Carleton at the University of Texas. "The whole area is really a quagmire as far as land titles are concerned."
With so many hundreds of Ballis involved in the lawsuit, no one in the clan seems to expect to get rich if it is successful. Instead, said Irene Balli-Dumas, a 42-year-old corporate communications manager who lives in California, "I think what's important to us now is that a wrong, so to speak, gets corrected."
About half of the Ballis are in Texas, with the rest spread from Mexico to Michigan and California to Florida. Many of them gather regularly at family reunions.
Of the family's contention that a great historical injustice was done by Mr. Kenedy and other ranchers, she said, "I've been hearing about this my entire life." There is no question that the land owned by Mr. Balli, a Spanish military officer and rancher, and other Hispanic families was swallowed up over the years, primarily by Anglo ranchers, after Texas defeated Mexico and became an independent nation in 1836.
In 1842, Texas military commanders "advised all Mexican nationals to evacuate south of the Rio Grande," writes T. R. Fehrenbach in his book, "Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans" (American Legacy Press, 1983). "Many did, abjuring Texas citizenship and abandoning their land, from Juan Seguin of San Antonio to the Balli heirs on Padre Island."
But many did not, and even many of those who had fled in fear came back, arguing that they had never truly renounced their claims.
By 1848, with the United States having annexed Texas and defeated Mexico in yet another war, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo "confirmed all Mexican land titles in principle but could not guarantee them in practice," Mr. Fehrenbach notes. "A horde of American businessmen, squatters and ex-soldiers arrived," he added, many with various types of claims to the land.
In subsequent years, many of the large ranching families consolidated their holdings, including Mr. Kenedy and Mr. King, for a period. And for decades, the dominant version of Texas history had the two and other ranchers fighting a valiant effort to claim the land and ward off the advances of cattle rustlers, many of whom were Mexican.
But a newer generation of scholars has offered a radically different interpretation of the era. These scholars have suggested that the ranchers essentially used their leverage over law-enforcement agencies, including the Texas Rangers and the court system, to steal land from Mexicans.
"These were very large landholders, the economic elite, and they were so powerful that they often resorted to what I would call illegal means of obtaining land from Tejanos," or Texans of Mexican origin, said Armando C. Alonzo, a history professor at Texas A & M University.
"They could basically get whatever they wanted through using the courts and the sheriffs and extra-legal means, " said Professor Alonzo, who is the author of a book scheduled for publication next year, "Tejano Rancheros and Settlers in the Lower Rio Grande Valley 1734-1900" (University of New Mexico Press).
Whether all this will help the Ballis in court in 1997 is, of course, another question, but several legal experts said that if they could demonstrate continuing efforts to get back the land, they might just have a case -- or a shot at a settlement with the Kenedy Foundation, whose assets in land and other holdings are widely believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The foundation, created in 1960 after all of Mifflin Kenedy's heirs had died, supports a variety of causes, most associated with the Roman Catholic Church.
Moreover, Eileen McKenzie Fowler, a Houston lawyer who is representing the 586 Balli family members recently certified as heirs, said that one family member had unearthed a stunning set of papers while cleaning out the attic: a 50-year lease that had been signed in 1949 by Sarita Kenedy East, Mifflin Kenedy's granddaughter and then the leading member of the Kenedy family, and by Gustavo Munoz, Mr. Balli's great-great grandson.
In it, Mrs. East purportedly agreed to a cash payment and cattle in return for the grazing rights to Balli land.
"This lease is absolutely a killer for them," Ms. Fowler said of the Kenedy Foundation. "They know they don't have a clear chain of title to this land, because adverse possession can never apply to a lease. You can't have abandoned land that you took the time and trouble to exercise a lease on."
Because the case has not yet reached the trial stage, the reported lease has not even been shared with the Kenedy Foundation, and its lawyer, Mr. Leshin, said he was highly skeptical of its authenticity.
Soon, however, the question will likely be aired in court, as the foundation tries to establish its rightful ownership of the land.
Specifically at issue is a tract known as La Barreta when it was granted to Mr. Balli by the Spanish King. The overall grant to Mr. Balli and some of his relatives involved about two million acres in nine present-day counties; Ms. Fowler and other Balli lawyers have suggested it is only a matter of time before claims may be made on other land.
Just how jurors here might respond to the issue of claims dating back to the early part of the last century remains to be seen, of course, but the filing here insures that the Ballis' claims are at least going to be heard.
Without predicting the outcome of the Balli suit, Professor Alonzo at Texas A & M said, "We've had so much change, social and economic change, their chances are better today than they ever were."

HEADLINE: The Souffle Of His Success, And Its Fall;
Exiled From His Restaurants, A Culinary Star Ladles Soup

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
At 23, Johannes Sanzin was a sous-chef at Bouley, the youngest ever at the TriBeCa temple of gastronomy. After leaving Bouley, he had a six-month stint at the equally renowned Le Bernardin, then helped to open Pitchoune, a small French restaurant. Last year, Mr. Sanzin, at 25, opened his own restaurant, Sanzin, in SoHo, where he was praised for such dishes as pan-roasted skate dusted with walnuts in Roquefort sauce. In March, he opened his second restaurant, named 131 Duane Street, in TriBeCa, again to raves for his exhilarating combinations of flavors.
So why does Mr. Sanzin now ladle out soup and work the cash register behind the tiny counter at Souperman, his takeout operation tucked into an alley in the financial district? 
 In the ever-changing New York City restaurant business, where money, ambition and ego may rise in the heat of a kitchen to form a delicate souffle of success, Mr. Sanzin's fall shows how perishable such a recipe can be. Nobody denies that Mr. Sanzin (pronounced sahn-ZEEN), now 26, was given the boot by his partners. Beyond that, the reasons for the breakup seem as irreconcilable as oil and vinegar.
His former partners say that while Mr. Sanzin is an inspired cook, he has an artist's contempt for restaurant economics, an attitude they say was heightened by drinking. But Mr. Sanzin dismisses that characterization, saying his problem was not alcohol but having partners motivated only by profit. Either way, to those in the restaurant business, the story of a young chef achieving acclaim one minute and in exile the next is all too familiar.
Since Mr. Sanzin's first apprenticeship in Munich, where he grew up, he has pointed toward the chef's holy grail, owning his own restaurant. Further training in Paris, then experience in two of New York's best restaurants, won him a reputation as a skilled, strong-willed cook.
In late 1995, he was introduced to two young Frenchmen who were opening Pitchoune at Third Avenue and 19th Street. Mr. Sanzin took charge of the kitchen and quickly earned praise for his beautifully executed, moderately priced dishes. Among those taking note of the young chef was Jim Mamary, who owned three restaurants in Brooklyn but was itching to break into Manhattan.
By chance, Mr. Mamary had dinner at Pitchoune after it had been open a few months and liked what he ate. He liked it so much that he went back four nights in a row. "I thought, this would be a great guy to go into business with," Mr. Mamary said.
As it happened, Mr. Sanzin would soon be looking for a new opportunity. While the owners loved his cooking at Pitchoune, other tasks, like controlling food costs, were causing friction.
"I asked him to leave," said Thierry Cabiego, an owner. "When you start a restaurant, it's your baby. If a guy starts to think he's the main person in the restaurant, he has to go." And, he added, Mr. Sanzin had no regard for the bottom line. "Money was flowing down the drain."
Mr. Sanzin sees it differently. The entree prices were set too low, he said. "They wanted to serve a rack of lamb for $16, and then complained that the food cost was too high," he said.
For Mr. Mamary, the timing was perfect. He and Mr. Sanzin agreed to become partners. They found a site in SoHo and named the restaurant Sanzin.
More seasoned restaurateurs might have sensed danger. Drew Nieporent, who counts Montrachet, Nobu and TriBeCa Grill among his holdings, discussed naming Montrachet with David Bouley, the first chef there. "If we name it Bouley or we name it Drew, you can never use those names again," Mr. Nieporent said.
While Mr. Mamary and Mr. Sanzin were to be the operating partners in the new venture, they would not, at first, be owners. In the restaurant business, upfront costs for real estate and construction can be immense. They needed financial backers.
Mr. Mamary lined up investors, who offered a typical arrangement. They would make the initial investment, and the two operating partners would get a percentage of the ownership, but not until the initial investment was paid back.
Mr. Sanzin was responsible for the food, wine and kitchen staff, and Mr. Mamary was responsible for everything else. "I didn't see a menu until the day we opened," Mr. Mamary said.
That day was June 12, 1996, just six weeks after signing the lease. At first, Mr. Sanzin's inventive cooking attracted little attention. "I thought I might have to go back to the investors and ask for an infusion to get us through," Mr. Mamary said, "because Johannes only uses the best."
Instead, the infusion came from another source, a glowing two-star review in The New York Times. Ruth Reichl likened Mr. Sanzin to Primo, the brilliant, uncompromising chef in the movie "Big Night."
"Business literally tripled," Mr. Mamary said.
The stories diverge here, though both Mr. Mamary and Mr. Sanzin agree on one thing: It was a nightmare.
According to Mr. Mamary, Mr. Sanzin took some time off shortly after the review was published. He had been working six nights a week and deserved a vacation, Mr. Mamary conceded. Meanwhile, Alex Oefeli, the sous-chef, also from Pitchoune, held the fort.
The problem, Mr. Mamary said, was that Mr. Sanzin never returned. October melted into November. Thanksgiving passed, he said, and Mr. Sanzin still was not cooking. "He'd come in, have a couple glasses of wine and we'd talk," Mr. Mamary said. "I figured he'd know when to come back. It was chronic absenteeism."
To Mr. Nieporent, this was a critical mistake, "When you're given such an accolade, now's the time to put your heads down and earn it."
The Times review said that Sanzin's dining room was uncomfortable, and Mr. Mamary thought a different setting might reinspire Mr. Sanzin. "I started looking again," he said. "I thought, maybe he's bored, maybe he needs a new thing."
But Mr. Sanzin says a second restaurant was his idea. "Sanzin was a very small kitchen," he said. "To be really creative, there was just no way."
Mr. Mamary found a bigger place, at 131 Duane Street near West Broadway in TriBeCa. He said he gave Mr. Sanzin everything he wanted: "Fancy stuff from France, copper pots, a $5,000 convection oven; this was going to be his signature place."
They timed the opening of the new place, called 131 Duane Street, for March, hoping to gain momentum from a review of Sanzin that was to appear in the March issue of Gourmet magazine.
Dan Iserra, who had become a friend of Mr. Sanzin when both worked at Bouley, signed on to assist in the kitchen. But Mr. Iserra, 33, sensed that something was wrong.
"He was talking to so many people, trying to do so many things," he said. "He was going to consult, he wanted to open a nightclub lounge. He had a wife and kid, and he had OD'ed on the American dream."
Mr. Iserra left after one night.
The Gourmet review of Sanzin called Mr. Sanzin "a new German-born star." The irony, Mr. Mamary said, was that Mr. Sanzin was not in the kitchen when the critic visited. Mr. Oefeli, the sous-chef, was.
"A lot of respect I used to have for Johannes dissolved," said Mr. Oefeli, 24, of his mentor. "Johannes was here, but he wasn't cooking. In his mind, he was working, but he wasn't doing anything except being at the bar."
Mr. Sanzin disagrees vehemently. "I was active cooking in both restaurants," he said. "They have to say negative stuff about me, otherwise why would they get rid of me? I like a good glass of wine, but I'm not a drunk."
Meanwhile, at 131 Duane, things were not going smoothly. Mr. Mamary asserted that Mr. Sanzin was hardly in the kitchen and often drank, which Mr. Sanzin denied. In any case, a Times review of 131 Duane awarded the restaurant two stars and again praised Mr. Sanzin as an uncommonly interesting, "supremely confident" cook.
"He got two stars, and he wasn't even trying!" Mr. Mamary wailed. From there, things degenerated. Orders in the dining room were not being filled, Mr. Mamary said. People were left waiting, the staff left directionless. Mr. Mamary said he believed Mr. Sanzin was sabotaging the restaurant. "He spent and did whatever he wanted to do in pursuit of his culinary career," he said.
In June, he told the investors that Mr. Sanzin had to go.
Mr. Iserra said what galls him is that, at 25, Mr. Sanzin had an opportunity with his restaurants that other people wait years to get. "It was his own thickheadedness that did him in," he said.
Mr. Sanzin said he believed his former associates were just waiting to get rid of him. He said they feared he would succeed with his soup business, which had been in the works for months, and leave them in the lurch, so they wanted to jettison him first.
"It was four against one," he said. "Each time something came up, it was me. For me, it is more important to please the customer than it is to make a huge amount of money."
To Mr. Sanzin, the reviews speak louder than the criticism.
"I created the restaurants," he said. "It's me who made the food. I worked 18 hours a day, six days a week. I worked for it: It wasn't an opportunity just presented to me on a silver tray."
Mr. Sanzin resents the fact that his ex-partners retain the name Sanzin. "Just give it another name," he said.
Mr. Mamary says the name is tied to the success of the restaurant, where Mr. Oefeli is now the chef. "In reality, nothing has changed," he said. "He's still not here."
Many in the restaurant business see Mr. Sanzin's fall as a cautionary tale about too much acclaim, too many restaurants, too soon.
Jonathan Waxman, who owned Jam's, Bud's and Hulot's in the go-go 1980's, sympathizes with any chef celebrated at a tender age.
"You have no personal life," he said. "I think most chefs are pretty shy. Once they're put in the limelight, it's very tough. Your partners expect more from you, your public expects more from you. Your every move is scrutinized."
For his part, Mr. Sanzin said he is proud of Souperman, at 77 Pearl Street and Coenties Alley, where the lunch line for his soups extends out of the building. "Now I get up at 3 in the morning to make my soups, to make sure they're ready at noon, and they're good," he said.
He says he enjoys his relationship with his Souperman partners, two French restaurateurs, and would definitely like to open a new restaurant.
What has he learned?
"It's a tough business," Mr. Sanzin said. "But if things go apart, it's an ugly business."

"Just give it another name," he said. Jim Mamary, a co-owner of Sanzin restaurant in SoHo, helped an acclaimed young chef to open two Manhattan restaurants, but their relationship later turned sour.

HEADLINE: Orders Increase 8% For Machine Tools

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Orders for machine tools by American companies rose 8 percent in May, compared with a year earlier, further evidence of steady expansion in manufacturing, according to two trade groups.
The rise came despite an unexpected falloff in orders in the Midwest, home to the Big Three auto makers and other large manufacturers. Because of that drop, orders in May were lower than in April, even though they were higher than the level of May 1996. 
 "The Midwest experienced a needed breather in May machine tool orders, but compared to a year ago the national picture is still strong," said Ralph J. Nappi, president of the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association, which compiles the report along with the Association for Manufacturing Technology.
Total domestic orders were estimated at $678 million, up from $627 million in May 1996. For the first five months of this year, orders rose 10 percent, to $3.47 billion.
Machine tool orders are used to gauge manufacturers' long-term confidence in the economy. A rise in orders suggests that companies expect enough future business to justify expanding or upgrading their factories.
The two trade groups obtain data from about 70 percent of the nation's machine tool makers to derive their estimates. They do not disclose which companies are increasing orders.
In the Midwest, orders fell 10 percent, to $184 million among companies surveyed. The strongest region was the Far West, which increased spending 69 percent, to $69 million.
Orders rose 24.5 percent in the South, to $67 million; 19 percent in the Northeast, to $80 million, and 5 percent in the region between the Mississippi and the Rockies, to $94 million.
Export data in the report showed that foreign demand for United States machine tools rose 15 percent from a year earlier, to $103 million. For the first five months of 1997, export orders totaled $371 million, up 69 percent.

HEADLINE: PIONEERING STATE FOR MANAGED CARE CONSIDERS CHANGE

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Leading a national surge of second thoughts about managed health care, California, long a pacesetter in the field, has plunged into a wholesale review of its managed-care system, which now covers more than half the state's 32 million people.
An avalanche of proposals for tighter government regulation is advancing in the California Legislature. The Governor and legislators have appointed a joint commission to recommend improvements in managed care. And patients are expressing their qualms: State officials registered more than 2,000 consumer complaints about health maintenance organizations last year, an 18 percent increase over 1995. 
 The growing skepticism about managed care, which reduces health care costs by rejecting treatment that is deemed not medically necessary, is fueled by cases like those of Joyce Ramey, a 69-year-old retired nurse in Riverside, who was awarded $1.1 million last week in a binding arbitration with her Medicare H.M.O.
Mrs. Ramey, who has required kidney dialysis treatments twice a week since April 1995, said her health plan had for two years ignored or rejected her primary doctor's requests to send her to an H.M.O.-approved kidney specialist. The arbitrator, John K. Trotter, a retired California appeals judge, said in his ruling that the H.M.O.'s conduct was "unconscionable."
The health maintenance organization, Inter Valley Health Plan Inc. of Pomona, is considering an appeal on the ground that "the medical facts of the case don't support the decision," said Mark Covington, the company's president.
Defenders of managed care say that California -- and the nation, as well -- is legislating by anecdote, exaggerating the importance of cases like Mrs. Ramey's. They say that the benefits to the public of managed care -- lower health care costs foremost among them -- are being obscured in a haze of story telling. And insurers can point to surveys showing high levels of patient satisfaction with their health plans.
But consumer groups, doctors and spokesmen for the elderly say they are countering the excesses of the managed-care avalanche, which in the last decade has brought at least 150 million Americans under some sort of plan that reviews or restricts health care choices. Most of the legislation these groups are backing would make it more difficult for health maintenance organizations to deny care. Several bills would also weaken their sway over doctors.
Across the country, state legislators have introduced about 1,000 managed-care bills so far this year. At least 182 bills have become law, following the adoption of 100 such laws in 1996, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Recently adopted laws require H.M.O.'s in a number of states to authorize hospital stays after mastectomies and to pay for emergency room visits that turn out to have been avoidable. Health plans are being ordered to allow direct access to obstetricians and certain other specialists without permission in advance from a primary doctor.
So far this year, 16 states -- including Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Ohio and Texas -- have adopted comprehensive consumer-rights bills covering a number of managed-care issues; New York and five more states enacted similar bills last year. In June, the New Jersey Legislature approved and sent to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman a bill that would establish an independent appeals process for H.M.O. members, forbid financial rewards to doctors for denying care and require managed-care companies to subsidize care by doctors outside their networks.
In May, Texas attracted national attention by enacting the first law allowing medical malpractice lawsuits against H.M.O.'s. Similar bills have been introduced in Congress.
Managed-care companies have always insisted that they do not make medical decisions, and insurers lobbied hard against the Texas measure. In June, Aetna Inc. filed a lawsuit in United States District Court in Houston seeking to invalidate it under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa. Erisa has often been invoked to thwart state regulation of health insurance, but recently there have been conflicting court decisions about its reach.
California, though, is the cockpit for some of the most hotly contested battles. The State Senate has scheduled hearings this week on 50 health care bills already passed by the Assembly. The Assembly health committee, meanwhile, will take up 30 measures approved by the Senate.
A coalition that includes labor unions, the American Association of Retired Persons, Consumers Union and Health Access California, an umbrella advocacy group, is promoting an 11-point legislative package it calls a "patient bill of rights." Recently, dozens of supporters of the package came to the Capitol in Sacramento to lobby and demonstrate.
One of the measures would make H.M.O.'s and the physicians who are their medical directors liable in malpractice lawsuits involving denials of care judged by the H.M.O.'s not to have been a "medical necessity."
Other bills backed by the California coalition would give protection against reprisals to patients, doctors and health care workers who complained about managed-care misconduct. Health maintenance organizations would also have to state reasons and give advance notice before dismissing doctors, nurses, therapists or medical technicians.
The H.M.O. industry and the California Chamber of Commerce are lobbying vigorously against five bills in the Health Access package, as well as a number of other proposals. Allan Zaremberg, executive vice president of the chamber, said the measures were "job-killer legislation" that would raise medical costs, especially for small employers, and add to California's 6.5 million uninsured.
Myra Snyder, president of the California Association of Health Plans, a trade group, agreed. "Everything they add to a benefit package, no matter how worthy, will increase the cost," she said. "No one is looking at the big picture, at what happens to the monthly premiums and to the numbers of uninsured."
However, the business representatives said that they would not oppose popular bills that would make it difficult for managed-care companies to send women home without a hospital stay after a mastectomy, or within 48 hours of giving birth.
Self-interest is evident on all sides of the debate. The California Medical Association is backing a measure to make it harder for H.M.O.'s to drop physicians from their networks. It also supports a bill that would require the companies to disclose the "actuarial criteria" on which they base capitation payments to doctors -- the set monthly amounts paid for each enrolled member.
Some doctors complain that H.M.O.'s cut these rates arbitrarily, forcing them to skimp on care or absorb financial losses.
Dr. Melvin Kirschner, a family practitioner in Van Nuys, a suburban area of Los Angeles, said that one managed-care group with which he is affiliated had reduced its monthly payment per patient by 30 percent in May. "I can't make a living," he said.
Ms. Snyder of the health plans association said capitation rates remained "appropriate," and remarked that H.M.O.'s perform actuarial studies "to negotiate with physicians, not to help them to negotiate with us."
Alain Enthoven, a Stanford University management professor who is a longstanding advocate of managed care, said the backlash in California against H.M.O.'s had been encouraged by a sharp rise in enrollment, to 14 million last year, with 3 million more Californians in related types of managed care.
"It has been worsened by the fact that a lot of the media are dealing with it quite irresponsibly," asserted Mr. Enthoven, chairman of the state's Managed Health Care Improvement Task Force, which is scheduled to report to Gov. Pete Wilson on Jan. 1. "They take one episode and blow that up into a huge story."
He mentioned widespread coverage of the refusal by Healthnet, a big California H.M.O., to pay for a cancer patient's bone-marrow transplant. The company said that the procedure was experimental.
"It was unfair to attack Healthnet," Mr. Enthoven said. "All health insurance has exclusions for experimental treatment."
In the wake of the publicity, a law was passed giving patients the right to an independent medical review when a health plan rejects a treatment as experimental.
He acknowledged that managed- care consumers need protection from corporate excesses. "This has to be the most complicated product or service in our economy," he said. "A health insurance contract is extremely complex. Anybody who says they understand their health insurance doesn't understand the problem."
Steven Thompson, vice president of the California Medical Association, said that changing managed care had lately become a bipartisan issue, because more and more people in "the middle and upper middle class" were experiencing H.M.O.'s firsthand.
Jeanne Finberg, a lawyer with Consumers Union in San Francisco, said she was worried that Governor Wilson, a Republican who is generally opposed to regulation, might reject most of the managed-care legislation.
"I worry that the task force will be used as an excuse for delay," she said. But Mr. Enthoven said that would not happen. The Governor's office, he said, had pledged that each bill would be considered "on its merits."

Protecting Patients
A few years ago, the main focus of state legislation to rein in health maintenance organizations was on protection for doctors and other providers. This year, many states have passed or are considering bills to protect patients.
 
Map shows states where comprehensive consumer rights bills have been enacted or are pending. Specific provisions vary from state to state, but most of the bills require grievance procedures for patient complaints; ban "gag clauses that limit what doctors tell patients; require payment for emergency-room visits even if, in hindsight, they might have been avoided; limit financial incentives for doctors to deny treatment; and require direct access to certain specialists, like obstetricians, without going through a primary care doctor.
 
Similar legislation was passed in New Mexico this year but was vetoed by the Governor. Some states primarily use regulations rather than laws to govern health care; some of these have written aspects of comprehensive consumer protection bills into their regulations.

HEADLINE: Sale of Institutional Investor By Disney Is Expected Soon

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company, continuing with its sale of assets outside its core entertainment business, is expected soon to reach an agreement to sell Institutional Investor publications to Euromoney Publications P.L.C. for $120 million to $130 million, according to executives familiar with the negotiations.
Other potential suitors, including the Thomson financial publishing group and Pearson P.L.C. of Britain, have shown strong interest in buying Institutional Investor, according to these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, but those companies have recently dropped out of the discussions. The Economist and McGraw-Hill also looked at the company's books, they said. 
 In the world of glossy trade magazines and specialist newsletters that chronicle high finance, the acquisition of Institutional Investor by Euromoney would be rather like Newsweek buying Time. Institutional Investor, based in New York, and Euromoney, which has its head office in London, have competed for years for the reading time and desk space of financiers and investors. Euromoney is 63-percent-owned by Daily Mail and General Trust P.L.C., publishers of The Daily Mail of Britain.
Institutional Investor has a circulation of about 150,000, some of which is free, with two-thirds in the United States. It has outpaced Euromoney in the American market and has for years been on Wall Street's preferred reading list. Its annual survey of analysts, with rankings, can help make or break a securities analyst, and a top ranking generally adds many hundreds of thousands of dollars to an analyst's annual bonus.
There is concern at Institutional Investor that Euromoney might seek to influence its editorial content. Discussing whether a takeover by Euromoney could work, someone inside the company said that "the company's franchise is based on the editorial integrity and independence."
"If any effort were to be made to compromise that independence and integrity, that would put the whole franchise at risk," this person said.
During the last few months, Disney's advisers have been sounding out potential bidders about Institutional Investor. "Most of the bids were around $130 million," said an executive at Institutional Investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He added that the eventual price would probably be less than that, most likely around $120 million.
"There have definitely been negotiations" between Euromoney and Institutional Investor, another person familiar with the matter said, adding that the price was expected to be lower than the original asking price of $170 million to $200 million.
Euromoney, if it acquires Institutional Investor, is expected to use it to build its American magazine business, an area where it has been relatively weak. But Euromoney is also expected to try to prune costs and perhaps close Institutional Investor's international edition.
Officials of Euromoney and Institutional Investor were unwilling to provide much detail on their talks on Friday. "We had some discussions and there is nothing new to report," P. Richard Ensor, a managing director of Euromoney Publications, said in a telephone interview from London. The discussions, he added, "are sporadic and continuing." Ken Green, a spokesman for Disney in Burbank, Calif., dismissed questions about the talks, saying, "We never discuss discussions in progress."
After its $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC last year, Disney said it would sell companies from the deal that were not related to its core entertainment business, and it appointed the investment bank CS First Boston to advise it on those sales, which could realize as much as $2 billion to $3 billion, according to Wall Street estimates.
In April, Disney sold the Chilton group of magazines to Reed Elsevier P.L.C., the British-Dutch business publishing company, for $447 million in cash. That month, Disney also sold four newspapers -- The Kansas City Star, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Belleville News-Democrat in Illinois and The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader in Pennsylvania -- to Knight-Ridder for $1.65 billion.
A deal for Institutional Investor would include its newsletters and its conference business.
Other potential bidders for Institutional Investor dropped out of the negotations because of price, the executives familiar with the talks said. Ron Schlosser, president of the Thomson financial publishing group, did not return telephone messages left with his office on Friday. An assistant at the London office of Marjorie M. Scardino, chief executive of Pearson, said late Friday that Ms. Scardino had left for the day and could not be reached.
Institutional Investor, which was founded by Gilbert E. Kaplan in 1967, was sold to Capital Cities in 1984 for an amount that was widely rumored to be around $72 million. Mr. Kaplan left the company some years ago to pursue his interest in music.

HEADLINE: THE FALL OF NEWARK -- A special report.;
In Riots' Shadow, a City Stumbles On

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS; Ronald Smothers covered the Newark riots 30 years ago as a reporter for The Washington Post. He lives in Newark.

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 12

 BODY:
Amiri Baraka, the poet and writer whose advocacy of "black power" is inextricably linked to the riots that tore through this city 30 years ago, was sitting on the porch of his Victorian style house in west-central Newark the other day, pointing to his neighbors' well-kept homes.
The neighbors -- a mailman, a schoolteacher, a college professor -- were determined, he said, "to stay here and scratch it out." But, he went on, "If you go two blocks in either direction from here you are in some of the worst slums imaginable." 
 Mr. Baraka's porch is as good a vantage point as any from which to view Newark's situation now. Much as his neighborhood of neat blocks of single-family homes represents a gleam of hope amid wider devastation and poverty, there are other pockets of progress in the city, from a huge new $200 million performing arts center to hundreds of middle-class town houses to construction at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
Yet all the millions of dollars in national and state aid that have flowed into the city since the riots in 1967, all the corporate assistance, both in dollars and sense, all the jobs and education and housing programs, have failed to change this fundamental fact about Newark: It is a city in the clutches of poverty, a city sliding ever downward, one that many say is in worse shape now than it was on July 12, 1967, the night the riots began.
The riots were less a turning point than a "historical inevitability," said Mr. Baraka, who was then known as LeRoi Jones and who was charged but later acquitted of weapons possession and inciting to riot.
Even before 1967, Newark -- like many other troubled cities, particularly in the industrial Northeast -- was gripped by economic forces that were squeezing its tax base, shuttering its factories and drawing its middle class to the suburbs.
The city remains a transportation hub. Train and bus lines still run through Newark. Its airport has become a major force in the region, as has its port. Newark also has the advantage of being near New York City. But many of the warehouses and trucking companies that once thrived in the city's 24 square miles have shifted out of its narrow, crowded streets to spacious suburban tracts made more accessible by new highways.
From 1960 to 1967, more than 60,000 white residents moved out of the city's aging and heavily taxed one- , two- and three-family frame homes for newer dwellings in the suburbs, much as the white middle class was abandoning other big cities in the country.
At the same time, black people from the South and Hispanic people were moving in, on the familiar currents of hope that had carried generations of immigrants years before. Only now there were far fewer jobs to greet them.
But even as the population was changing in 1967, political power in the city -- in the mayor's office, the City Council, the Police Department and school system -- remained in the hands of white people, many of them corrupt and racist.
The conditions in Newark were a warning of the "clear and present danger to the very existence of our cities," according to a 1968 study of the riots and the city's plight commissioned by Gov. Richard J. Hughes of New Jersey.
In a statement that prefigured the findings by President Lyndon B. Johnson's National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, popularly known as the Kerner Commission, the state study said: "If the events of last July had one effect, it was to show that we can no longer escape the central issue. The central issue with which this nation has temporized for the past 100 years -- to make equality real for the black man -- was bound sooner or later to land on the doorstep of each of us."
The riots did lead to some significant changes. In 1970, the city elected its first black Mayor, Kenneth J. Gibson. And national and state assistance began to pour in.
But these changes failed to reverse Newark's decline. The city remains New Jersey's largest, but it has shrunk substantially in the last 45 years. From 1950 to 1967, its population fell to about 406,000 from 438,776, and in 1994, the latest year for which figures are available, it was about 259,000.
Mr. Gibson, who now runs a business consulting company, noted in a recent interview that his early successes in getting national and state grants, as well as in building "a kinship" within the city, worked to arrest the city's problems only for a time. In the end, abandonment of housing continued, along with the departure of businesses to the suburbs. Eventually, black middle-class families joined this exodus.
And many people in the city now say that the black political establishment, in place by the mid-1970's, grew to be as ineffectual, and perhaps as corrupt, as the white administrations it supplanted.
Mageline Little, a retired school librarian who at the time of the riots was among the few middle-class black residents in the mostly white Weequahic Park area, recalled noticing within two years of the riots that many of her white neighbors had moved away. She and other black homeowners hung on, clinging to the hope that the election of black mayors would bring more services, lower taxes and more police protection.
"I think it was the third burglary in a month and no one from the Police Department showing up that did it for me," she said, explaining why she decided in 1990 to move to the nearby suburb of Maplewood. "I was tired, and it was like the black elected officials had forgotten us. Somehow they got selfish and failed to encourage us."
Sharpe James, the current Mayor, who won a City Council seat in 1970 when Mr. Gibson was elected Mayor, conceded that he and others had thought "we could wave a magic wand and overnight things would change." But, he went on, "the tragedy was that we didn't have the skills, knowledge and vision to move the city. We had many failed projects."
Mr. James, who has been Mayor since 1986, insisted that he had brought "a new realism" to city government, bringing in professional managers and aggressively pursuing the construction of the performing arts center and a proposed stadium for soccer and minor-league baseball.
Still, he conceded, "The disinvestment continues; the Federal Government is still trying to balance its budget on the backs of the cities; the population continues to decline, and the manufacturing jobs that used to be here are still disappearing."
Mr. James was careful in his comments about today's Newark and its prospects, recalling the heady days after Mr. Gibson took office predicting, "Wherever American cities are going, Newark will get there first."
The reality proved to be the opposite, Mr. James said. "Baltimore with their harbor crossed the line. Seattle was bringing people back from the suburbs, and even Cleveland, which someone once called 'the mistake by the lake,' is now jumping with arts centers and professional sports. And the question was, 'Where's Newark?' "
 
Marginalized Majority
Black Residents Sense Hostility
 In the summer of 1967, Newark had many reasons to be tense. Even though the population was nearly 52 percent black, the city's police force was 90 percent white. There was only one black elected official. And the Mayor, Hugh J. Addonizio, a white Democrat, had an uneasy relationship with black residents, many of whom felt he was interested in them only at election time.
There were many problems, but perhaps the one that best illustrates that relationship involved the proposed expansion of what was then the College of Medicine and Dentistry. While publicly professing their desire to remain in Newark, trustees of the college decided in early 1967 to move to Madison, which lies to the west in Morris County.
Their price for staying, according to the Hughes commission's report after the riots, was an offer they thought the city had to refuse -- condemning 150 acres in the middle of Newark.
The Addonizio administration, desperate to keep such a major institution, came up with a gambit of its own. It offered the college 185 acres, just 30 of them in blighted areas the city had already slated for urban renewal. But the deal also included more than 100 acres of relatively stable, racially mixed, working-class neighborhoods.
Richard Cammieri, who was a child at the time and lived in one of the mixed Italian and black areas, recalled the reactions to the plan and the subsequent fight.
"A black family on the block -- he was a postal worker and she was a schoolteacher -- led the neighborhood effort to fight the condemnation, and we were successful for a while," said Mr. Cammieri, who still lives in Newark and drives by his old block, now just vacant land.
This contributed to the tense mood in the city on the night of Wednesday, July 12, when two white police officers, John DeSimone and Vito Pontrelli, arrested John W. Smith, a black cabdriver, for resisting arrest after a minor traffic violation.
Mr. Smith later told investigators that one of the officers had beaten him in the patrol car. He had been doubled over in pain as they arrived at the Fourth Precinct house and was dragged inside, where he was thrown into a cell and beaten some more.
Residents of Hayes Homes, a public housing project across from the station house, saw the police dragging Mr. Smith inside. Word quickly spread, drawing 250 people to the station house, many of whom by that time believed he had been killed.
The first barrage of bottles and Molotov cocktails came from this crowd, although the anger seemed contained that night to the area around the Hayes Homes. But the next night it spread rapidly, as rampaging black residents ripped security gates from businesses along major commercial boulevards in black areas of the Central Ward, looted them and set fires.
City officials met with civil rights leaders, but were unable to stop the violence.
By Friday, the first wave of more than 6,000 National Guard soldiers and state police officers streamed into the city. The patrols often found themselves besieged by youths throwing rocks.
According to the state study of the riots, the presence of the soldiers and state police, while quelling the rioting, hardly proved a total blessing. Investigators attributed some of the 26 deaths in the riots to panicky shooting at apartment buildings by frightened guardsmen. Businesses that displayed signs showing they were black-owned were spared the rioters' wrath, but were later damaged by gunfire from angry white police officers and guardsmen.
About 1,500 Newark residents were arrested over the five days of rioting. And what sticks in the minds of many who lived through that time, including Mayor James, was how all of the black people in the city were treated as if they had broken the law.
 
Hardy Optimism
Good Intentions Survive for a Time
 Even with the political and racial tensions in the city, 1967 was also a time of great optimism. Rebecca Doggett, who was 26 at the time and working with the new Head Start program and a nonprofit housing group, recalled that white groups like the Students for a Democratic Society were working in the city alongside local civil rights groups and the Committee for a Unified Newark, founded by Mr. Baraka.
"Young people were coming out of the woodwork to save the world," she said. "There were black and white churches, nonprofit groups and school activists, and we all saw ourselves as the Northern branch of the Southern civil rights movement."
What was surprising, she said, was that the riots failed to dim that optimism. "In spite of the violence and the real loss suffered by Newark, there were positive and productive things going on."
That mood persisted for a while, as a wave of good intentions seemed to engulf the city. State and Federal agencies began pumping millions into the city to improve the schools, housing and health care. Nonprofit housing programs with hopeful names like Amity Village, New Hope Homes and the New Community Corporation sprung up to build housing and promote home ownership.
But by the early 1980's the hope had faded. Msgr. James Linder, a Roman Catholic priest who founded the New Community Corporation, said that much of what was built was underfinanced, poorly designed or poorly managed. Many of the new high rises fell into disrepair and the homeowner-assistance programs ran out of grant money.
Mrs. Doggett recalled the loss of state support in the 1980's for a homeowner-assistance program she helped develop, Amity Village. Today, the 30 houses in the Central Ward have fallen into disrepair.
"I am concerned because I don't think the city has the same sense of optimism that it had 30 years ago, even in the aftermath of the rioting," she said. "Then, there was much more interaction between the poor in the city and middle class, white and black, the service providers and those served. Now, the poor are just more isolated."
Newark's school system is perhaps in a more dismal state than its housing. A year after the riots, the commission appointed by Governor Hughes found the Newark school system "in an advanced state of decay," either "poorly educating or miseducating children in the schools in our ghetto neighborhoods."
Two years ago, state educators wrote this in a study of Newark's schools that formed the basis for the state takeover of the district: "The Newark School District has been at best flagrantly delinquent and at worst deceptive in discharging its obligations to the children enrolled in public schools."
 
Troubled Future
Fear of Violence Pervades Thinking
 The fate of public education in Newark, economists and other analysts say, is one of the crucial elements determining the city's future as it tries to attract service sector jobs, which are growing in the region.
Monsignor Linder said he was troubled by the gulf between the skills of the people that his New Community Corporation seeks to serve and those needed by the businesses that may help revive Newark's downtown. And he said he saw the shiny new buildings as underscoring that gulf.
"Prime office space is that with garage parking, and they are all built like fortresses, with their lobbies up on the second floor and retail space in atriums and courts," he said. "They were all built with the riots in mind, and it's not very pedestrian-friendly and inviting. The result is you have two cities downtown: the one in and around the offices and the one on the streets where the people are."
It is in these concrete ways that the 1967 riots remain an abrupt line of demarcation, and not merely a step in the city's decline, for those who lived through it. The riots persist for them as the yardstick against which so many things today are measured.
A case in point is the routine drug arrest on June 7 that ended in an officer shooting to death a 31-year-old pregnant woman, a half-mile from where the riots started.
Just as had happened 30 years before, angry crowds gathered at the scene. But this time, the officer involved was black, as were many of the officers who arrived. By the time demonstrators descended on City Hall to protest the shooting two days later, Mayor James had already suspended the officer without pay. By the end of June, the Mayor announced a group of measures to improve police-community relations.
"Some conditions are worse today in Newark than 30 years ago, but you didn't have rioting this time like you did then," Mr. Gibson, the former Mayor, said. "Today the city administration doesn't make the mistake of not allowing the questioning of police actions, and there is a penalty for unwarranted police violence."
Mr. Baraka himself circulated among the people and the police on the night of the shooting last month, less a lightning rod than a calming voice.
"I made it clear to the police that we weren't interested in any madness," he said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Gore's Bandwagon Gets Big Push As Clinton Shows His Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Not Ronald Reagan, not Dwight Eisenhower, not even Thomas Jefferson worked as early and as aggressively as President Clinton to help his Vice President succeed him.
Even before he took the oath for a second term, Mr. Clinton shattered White House tradition by signaling his support for Vice President Gore in several interviews. No President in at least 150 years has made such early public declarations about his Vice President. The last two-term President, Ronald Reagan, waited until shortly before the general election to announce his support for Vice President Bush -- and his initial remarks were hardly enthusiastic. 
 More important than words, Mr. Clinton has taken steps to make sure that the staff and resources of the White House are at Mr. Gore's disposal -- not only the traditional perquisites like Air Force Two. As a result, while Mr. Gore quickly established himself as an unusually influential Vice President after the 1992 election, his public and political profile has intensified in recent months.
And behind the scenes, Mr. Clinton has stocked the White House with many of Mr. Gore's allies who are committed to seeing the Vice President elected President in 2000.
The President's efforts may have significant consequences not only for Mr. Gore but for Democratic politics. Some of the President's allies may feel that they have little choice but to rally behind the Vice President.
For example, George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's former senior adviser, has long been close to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, for whom he once served as a top aide. But if Mr. Stephanopoulos does not support Mr. Gore, the President could interpret that as a personal slap. (Mr. Stephanopoulos, who has maintained close ties with the Administration despite his position as a television news analyst, has said that he expects to back Mr. Gore.)
The downside is that by taking sides this early, Mr. Clinton could further damage his relationships with important Democrats in Congress who are preparing to run for President themselves, notably Mr. Gephardt. And Mr. Gore could still be hurt if the President's popularity slides, or if voters rebel against being told whom to vote for -- or against the notion of a Clinton dynasty. (Only four Vice Presidents have been elected directly to the Oval Office from the Vice Presidency: Martin Van Buren, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and George Bush.)
"I don't think any President three years before the election has tried to designate his successor," said Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian who was an adviser to President John F. Kennedy. "It carries certain risks of alienating possible contenders, particularly Dick Gephardt."
The President is willing to take those risks, his aides said, because his support is a logical outgrowth of their unusually close relationship. While the two were not close when Mr. Clinton picked Mr. Gore as his running mate in 1992, they have had one of the closest personal and work relationships of any President and Vice President in history. This weekend, the President cut short his European trip by a day and on Saturday flew back to Washington, where he attended the wedding reception of Mr. Gore's daughter, Karenna.
"This President has always felt that Al Gore would be an excellent President," said Douglas Sosnik, a senior Clinton adviser, "and that furthermore, the Vice President has been an integral part of the successes of this Administration."
Mr. Clinton may also have some self-interest in helping Mr. Gore. Mr. Gore's ascension to the White House would affirm Mr. Clinton's tenure, White House aides said, and help him win credit for reshaping a more moderate Democratic Party.
Joel Silbey, a historian at Cornell University, said he thought that Mr. Clinton was "really trying to establish an inheritance here."
Mr. Silbey said President Andrew Jackson, who was elected with Vice President Martin Van Buren in 1832, was the last President who went out of his way to signal his belief that his Vice President should succeed him. Yet even then, Mr. Jackson's comments about Mr. Van Buren were far less direct than what Mr. Clinton has said about Mr. Gore.
The most public demonstration of Mr. Clinton's backing of Mr. Gore is the extent to which Mr. Clinton has dispatched him to deliver major announcements that past Presidents would have reserved for themselves.
For example, when Mr. Gore recently announced White House support for tax breaks to help start-up companies, his advisers remarked privately that his involvement could help the Vice President clinch political and financial support from the high-technology industry.
In the last several days, when Mr. Clinton was in Europe, it often seemed as if Mr. Gore were President. Over the Fourth of July weekend, Mr. Gore appeared on the network news broadcasts when he congratulated space officials for the Mars landing. Rather than save the appearances for Mr. Clinton's return, the White House had Mr. Gore announce the new television ratings system, and held several events assuring pivotal Democratic groups that they would benefit from tax cuts supported by the Administration.
On Thursday, at a White House news conference where a $500-per-child tax cut was proposed, Mr. Gore shared the stage with Mr. Gephardt. But after he spoke, Mr. Gephardt was placed in a spot far to the side, while Mr. Gore dominated the event.
When Mr. Clinton injured his knee in March, Mr. Gore benefited, at first, because the President was forced to constrain his schedule, leaving the high-profile assignments such as touring flood disaster areas to Mr. Gore. But White House advisers also said that since his re-election, Mr. Clinton has been less interested in attending heavily political events like labor conventions.
In one exchange that demonstrated the President's cheerleading, Katie Couric of NBC News asked Mr. Clinton in early January how important it was for Mr. Gore to be the Democratic nominee in 2000. Mr. Clinton responded that "the Democrats of America will have to decide that question." But, Mr. Clinton continued, Mr. Gore "has been, unquestionably, the most effective Vice President in history. And if the people decide to make him President, they won't be disappointed."
"That's quite an endorsement," Ms. Couric said.
"That's my feeling," Mr. Clinton responded.
The President's comments were particularly notable in contrast with what Mr. Reagan said about Vice President Bush in the last paragraph of a speech in 1988. At the time, Mr. Reagan acknowledged that his comments were perceived as so "lukewarm" that he had to issue a stronger statement of support. On top of that, he called him "George Bosh."
The episode created a furor of speculation; some people theorized that Nancy Reagan did not want her husband to cede the limelight, while others said Mr. Reagan was never convinced that Mr. Bush had true conservative credentials.
Mr. Gore's ample opportunities to appear at public events have deflected attention from his controversial role in Democratic fund-raising, in contrast to Mr. Bush's inability to break free from the negative publicity over the Iran-contra affair.
Richard N. Bond, who was Vice President Bush's political director, argued that an early public endorsement from Mr. Reagan would have backfired because critics such as columnist George F. Will were already calling Mr. Bush a "lap dog." "Having had Reagan hover too protectively over Bush isn't what Bush wanted," Mr. Bond said.
But when asked whether an earlier endorsement from Mr. Reagan would have been welcome, Mr. Bond said: "Reagan was the strongest thing in the Republican Party for 12 years. At any given time that was certainly a welcome thing to have."
Well before Mr. Reagan, Presidents had been less than helpful and sometimes openly scornful of their Vice Presidents. At times, Presidents were threatened by the ambitions of their Vice Presidents; in other instances, Presidents were not fond of their Vice Presidents but picked them out of expediency.
In the 1960 campaign, President Eisenhower did not do his Vice President, Richard M. Nixon, much good when he was asked what decisions Mr. Nixon had participated in. Mr. Eisenhower replied, "If you give me a week, I might think of one."
And in 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey clashed so much over Vietnam that neither man seemed to want to be associated with the other.
Several White House aides said Mr. Clinton has been quite blunt about how he wants to make certain that Mr. Gore succeeds him. As Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's former political adviser, put it in his book, "Behind the Oval Office," the President told him: "I just want you to know I will work ceaselessly, ceaselessly, to be sure that Al Gore is the Presidential nominee -- without a primary if at all possible. Ceaselessly."
From all indications, Mr. Clinton is working hard, if not ceaselessly, to help Mr. Gore. At the Democratic convention in Chicago last summer, Mr. Gore was given an especially long speaking slot in prime time.
More recently, White House aides said the President suggested that Mr. Gore address a political dinner in Arkansas, a move that could help Mr. Gore win political support early from the President's home state. In June, Mr. Clinton used a setting in the Vice President's home state of Tennessee to announce tougher new air quality standards -- and to give Mr. Gore some of the credit.
A more obvious sign of how Mr. Clinton has broadened the Vice President's network can be counted in the number of Gore loyalists on his own staff. Karen Skelton, who was Mr. Gore's political director, has moved to Mr. Clinton's staff as deputy political director. Thurgood Marshall Jr., who was Mr. Gore's head of legislative affairs, is now secretary of the President's Cabinet. Lynn Cutler, a longtime party worker close to Mr. Gore, is now Mr. Clinton's deputy for intergovernmental affairs. Frederick P. DuVal, Mr. Gore's campaign manager last year, is also a deputy for intergovernmental affairs. The national chairman of the Democratic Party, Steven Grossman, is a Gore ally. And two others hold top posts in the second term: Andrew M. Cuomo as Housing Secretary and Franklin D. Raines as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Despite all the positioning so early on, some analysts argued that Mr. Clinton's popularity in 2000 -- which will ride heavily on the health of the economy -- is what really matters.
"Al Gore is locked in the trunk of Bill Clinton's car," Ted Van Dyk, a longtime Democratic analyst, said. "If the car goes over the cliff, that's the end of Al. If it speeds first over the finish line, it helps Al."

HEADLINE: Shark Is Efficient Killer, but Picky Eater

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
FEW animals have the power to frighten people into the cold terror of being eaten alive. But the great white shark does so effortlessly. Its reputation for blood lust is rooted in images of jaws gleaming with rows of razor-sharp teeth, their edges nicely serrated to ease the job of tearing through bone and flesh.
Nature's great killing machine grows to lengths of 20 feet or more and is often viewed as crude and mindlessly malevolent, feeding just as heartily on humans as on fish, seals, whales and sea lions. 
 But new research is challenging that notion and shedding light on the hidden life of the great white, revealing a finicky eater that may find people unpalatable.
Though it is pitiless with prey, lunging and slashing in red-stained water, the species can be quite civil among its own. Scientists have found what appears to be a ritualized competition over kills in which two great whites will forgo attacking one another for a genteel bout of slapping tails on the sea's surface. The biggest splash decides the winner.
Such finesse stands in stark contrast to the raw violence among predators like wolves, which can engage one another in bloody fights to the death.
Over all, scientists say, great whites have been badly misunderstood, wrongly making them the demons of movies and nightmares.Some research has even found evidence that the killers, when thwarted in feeding, get visibly frustrated and agitated, perhaps even sad and dejected.
"We're dispelling myths and learning a lot about how they really live," said Dr. A. Peter Klimley, a biologist at the University of California Bodega Marine Laboratory in Bodega Bay, Calif., who is a prominent expert on the infamous shark.
"They're not stupid feeding machines," he said. "They're exquisitely adapted."
Dr. Douglas J. Long, a fish scientist at the California Academy of Sciences who studies great whites, said the new insights, while substantial, still left a greater number of riddles.
"For instance," Dr. Long said, "we know virtually nothing about how and where they mate."
Even as scientists seek to unravel the great white's biology, behavior and ecology, a political push is accelerating to protect the beast. The top predator of the sea, it appears to be declining in numbers because of assaults by sport fishermen as well as commercial interests serving a growing international market for white-shark jaws and teeth.
California, South Africa and Australia have taken steps to try to save the great white, and other states and countries are considering such conservation efforts.
Its numbers "will inevitably dwindle unless prudent controls are enacted," Dr. Richard C. Murphy, a marine ecologist at the Cousteau Society in Chesapeake, Va., wrote in "Great White Sharks," a collection of scientific reports published late last year by Academic Press.
"In addition to being increasingly rare," Dr. Murphy said, "they are majestic preeminent participants in a complicated food web which we, as yet, only partially understand." The willingness and ability of humans to protect the killer, Dr. Murphy said, "are indicators of the economic, political and sociological health of our own species."
The mythology of terror surrounding the great white is even wider and more ominous than the shark's jaws are in real life. In "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea," Jules Verne tells how Professor Aronnax was taken by Captain Nemo for a global submarine tour, the two men finding themselves face to face with some of the razor-toothed giants during an underwater walk.
"The blood froze in my veins," the professor said, as "silver bellies and huge mouths bristling with teeth" rushed out of the darkness.
After a narrow escape, the professor later told his companions of reports that fishermen had cut open the stomachs of great white sharks and found a buffalo head, a whole calf and "a sailor still in uniform."
More recently, the beast achieved fame as the villain of "Jaws," the best-selling book by Peter Benchley and the blockbuster movie by Steven Spielberg. Both featured a marauding great white that terrorized swimmers near crowded beaches.
The great white is "firmly ensconced in the pantheon of sea monsters," Richard Ellis wrote in "Monsters of the Sea," (Knopf, 1994). "It is the largest predatory fish in the world," he said, with some specimens weighing "as much as a full-grown rhinoceros."
Sharks are ancient animals, long predating the dinosaurs and myriad types of modern creatures. Carcharodon carcharias, or "ragged tooth" in scholarly Latin, is found in temperate waters throughout the world's seas. To find prey, it has acute sensors known as lateral-line organs that apparently can detect disturbances in seawater at ranges of a mile or more.
Closer to a victim (exactly how close is uncertain), its keen ears can hear thrashing, its sensitive nose can sniff blood, and its eerie black eyes can spy flesh. Powerful muscles send it lunging.
The triangular teeth grow to lengths of two or more inches and are extraordinarily strong. Three layers of enamel crisscross in different directions so the teeth can better withstand impact as well as twisting and bending. If a tooth is lost, a replacement directly behind it will rotate forward in a day or so. New teeth are constantly being formed in this replacement process.
Judging from stomach contents, the beast can indeed devour prey whole, including other sharks and sea lions. Though one of its nicknames is "man-eater" (another is "white death"), no one knows for certain if people are in fact a preferred food.
To explore such questions, scientists in the last decade have increasingly studied the beast's predatory habits. Dr. Klimley of the Bodega Marine Laboratory, working with Peter Pyle and Scot D. Anderson, did a pioneering study near the Farallon Islands, which lie some 30 miles west of San Francisco in one of the most productive fisheries on the West Coast.
Video recordings were made of 129 great-white attacks on seals and sea lions, the assaults rich in explosive splashes in bloodstained water.
An analysis suggested that a shark near the surface would bite its victim, drag it down bleeding, carry it underwater and perhaps take another bite, then let the carcass float upward. If the victim was still alive, the act might be repeated.
The shark's aim, the scientists deduced, was to have the prey bleed to death as soon as possible, minimizing a violent struggle.
In an interview, Dr. Klimley noted that attacks on people often followed a similar pattern -- but the sharks, after dragging humans down, bleeding, often let them go.
Dr. Klimley said white sharks might spit out humans, birds and sea otters because their bodies lacked the energy-rich layers of fat possessed by animals like seals and whales. "If they ingest something that's not energetically profitable, then they're stuck with that for a few days" of slow digestion, he said. "Fat has twice the energy value of muscle."
Dr. Klimley noted three recent attacks along the northern California coast near Bodega Bay in which people had been quickly let go.
"Can you imagine?" he said. "These sharks are seizing people and holding them very gingerly to make this decision. They strike and hold and release -- and that's for big sharks, three or four meters long." A meter is equal to 3.3 feet.
Worldwide, great white sharks attack people four or five times a year, perhaps killing one of them.
An even more subtle side of predation involves the tail-slapping ritual, which Dr. Klimley discovered and has described. One white competing with another over a kill will often twist its body to the side, lift its tail and slap the sea surface, often splashing water in the direction of the rival.
"A shark was permitted to feed further on a seal only if the vigor and frequency of its tail slaps were greater than those of its opponent," Dr. Klimley wrote in a paper on the ritual in the Academic Press book "Great White Sharks."
To study the shark's feeding habits, scientists are about to inaugurate a system of acoustic tags and buoys that will reveal the position of seals and great whites as they battle under the sea.
The first-of-its-kind experiment is to begin this fall along the California coast near Santa Cruz and Ano Nuevo, a rocky isle that is the year-round home of 1,500 to 5,000 elephant seals. It and is a stop-and-shop for great whites.
Twenty acoustic transmitters will be attached to as many sharks and elephant seals, and the underwater signals will be picked up by three electronic buoys and radioed to scientists on shore. The work is financed by the University of California at Davis, which runs the Bodega Marine Laboratory, and the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that supports basic research.
Heading the investigation are Dr. Klimley, the shark specialist, and Dr. Burney J. Le Boeuf, a seal expert at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
"It's difficult to know what the predator is doing and the evasive tactics of the prey," Dr. Le Boeuf said in an interview. "Now we have a chance to understand that very well.
"I think we can find out some fundamental things about this animal that have eluded us -- basic things like how many there are around a seal rookery. It's like a supermarket. The seals are coming and going at all times. So why don't the sharks live there all year round?"
The speculation, Dr. Le Boeuf said, is that the great whites breed in the south and move north for easy feeding.
"But even so, once in central California," he said, "how do they divide the food among themselves? We don't have a clue. Whether it is the most dominant individuals and families, or more random, no one knows."
Scientists say a better understanding of the life history of the white terror will ultimately help it survive the increasingly crowded seas of the next century.
"If we want to conserve them, we have to figure out where they go," said Dr. Long, of the California Academy of Sciences. "There's still a lot of mysteries."

By studying red stains and surface attacks, scientists have found that the shark apparently tries to get victims to bleed to death quickly in an effort to minimize violent struggle. Sharks near the surface bite prey, drag it down bleeding, carry it underwater and perhaps take another bite, then let the carcass float upward. If the victim is still fighting, the act may be repeated. (The New York Times; Illustration by Michael Rothman)(pg. C1)
 
"On the Scent"
Great white sharks' noses can sniff blood at great distances. A large part of a shark's brain is devoted to the sense of smell.
 
"Destroying Bone and Flesh"
Extraordinarily strong teeth are made of three layers of enamel that crisscross to withstand impact, twisting and bending.
 
"Tracking Distant Turmoil
Acute sensors called lateral-line organs, which run the length of the shark's body, can detect disturbances in seawater, likely to signal the presence of prey, at ranges of a mile or more.
 
"New Insights Into a Perfect Killing Machine
Scientists are exploring the hidden life of the great white shark, discovering how it tracks and kills its prey and how it vies with others of its own kind for the spoils.
 
"Ritual Combat Over Dinner"
After a kill by two male sharks, scientists observed them in a splashing display to determine who got the carcass, first swimming past each other without toouching, then rolling over slightly to splash water in the other's direction. The shark that managed to stir up the most water in several passes ended up with the meal.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Workers Get Left Behind

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While it is encouraging that the national economy is absorbing the rapidly growing labor force (front page, July 10), political leaders and the Hispanic community must not overlook the problem of Hispanic workers being hired as low-wage manual laborers. They are the largest group filling the void left by others who "shift from one sector to another in pursuit of better jobs." When the economy slows down, Hispanic laborers will be out of a job and will not have the skills for the service-oriented job market. 
 As I read that Hispanic workers are "clearly among the nation's most mobile workers," I worry that their children will move from school to school, slip through the cracks of our educational system and join the nearly 1.1 million Hispanics between ages 16 and 24 who are high school drop-outs.

HEADLINE: A Break for Students

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Hewing to the five-year budget deal struck between the White House and Congressional Republicans, both the House and Senate tax bills include $30 billion-plus in tax breaks for college students. And while both have been criticized by President Clinton for doing "an inadequate job of opening the door to college," the White House's alternative is close enough to assure that a variation will be part of the eventual tax package.
But many economists, including some who favor increased investment in education, see little cause for applause. Some of the money, they note, is almost certain to be drained away in higher tuition. And a good chunk will end up in the bank accounts of parents who would have sent their children to college anyway. "The subsidy will pay for a lot of vacations and new furniture that families would have otherwise forgone," Thomas Kane, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, predicted. 
 More generally, they view new tax incentives with skepticism, doubting that the benefit is worth the price in added complexity and government involvement in private decision-making. "This whole tax bill is antithetical to the spirit of tax reform," argued Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan Business School.
Both the House and Senate bills offer credits to offset half of the first $3,000 in tuition for the first two years of college, phasing out the benefit for families with incomes exceeding $80,000. Both would restore the tax-free status of employer-paid tuition at least temporarily, and create a variety of opportunities for setting aside tuition nest eggs in tax-exempt accounts. The Senate bill would also make interest on student loans deductible up to $2,500 a year for five years. President Clinton's college plan goes further, phasing in a 20 percent tax credit on up to $10,000 in tuition for the third and fourth years of college.
The White House portrays the plan as fitting into its often-repeated goal of increasing wages and narrowing income inequality by spurring investments in "human capital." But there is an obvious catch: it will also tempt colleges to raise prices.
This should not be a problem for students attending the majority of four-year private colleges, Mr. Kane noted, "where competition drives tuition." But it could easily change the priorities of state legislatures that largely underwrite public college systems. And the most selective private colleges, which could enroll far greater numbers than they have room for, will have incentives to reduce need-based financial aid, dollar for dollar.
The tax credits will also be powerful incentives for low-tuition community colleges to raise charges. President Clinton's plan would offer a 100 percent tax credit on the first $1,000 in tuition and, after 2002, a 50 percent credit against the next $1,000. In 1994-95 fully one-third of community college students paid less than $1,000 annually to attend.
Moreover, the money that does reach students is unlikely to reach those in greatest need. Lawrence E. Gladieux, director of policy research at the College Board, estimates that 30 percent of families with children are too poor to owe Federal income taxes, and would thus not be eligible for the credit. Nor would most older, self-supporting students, who typically scrape by on part-time work and their own savings.
The White House understands the problem: President Clinton is also proposing to increase the maximum tuition subsidy under the Pell grant program for low-income students. But the $300 increase in the maximum annual grant in the President's budget, Mr. Gladieux noted, is far less than the tax credit.
By the same token, the credit would put cash into the hands of the great bulk of the middle class whose children already go to college. That would be no problem, were the idea to relieve their financial strain. But Len Burman, an economist at the Urban Institute, said it was inconsistent with the end of inducing families to save more on their own. And it hardly meshes with the primary goal of raising the productivity of the work force through education.
College attendance has risen by one-third since the early 1980's in response to the widening wage gap between the skilled and unskilled. Indeed, nine out of ten college-age Americans in the top quarter of the income distribution already get some form of post-secondary education, Mr. Gladieux said. "So if we're going to lift our net investment in education," he concluded, "the action has to center on those with incomes below $50,000."
The three proposals could be sliced and diced to deliver more of the benefit to this group. No amount of tinkering, though, would be likely to satisfy reformers who view tinkering itself as the enemy of sound tax policy. A central idea behind the 1986 Tax Reform Act -- and more recent reform proposals including the flat tax -- is to separate the task of collecting revenue from how it is spent.
But after a decade without new Federal programs or tax cuts, the temptation to use the tax code as a prescription for what ails -- or, more simply, as a means of pleasing important constituencies -- is apparently irresistible. "It's been a long time since Washington has been able to hand out money," Mr. Slemrod said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Drop in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday, as investors remained cautious ahead of this week's retail and price data and stood unfazed by the June Atlanta Fed survey of manufacturing activity, which inched up.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 10/32 , to 101 to yield 6.55 percent, up from 6.52 percent at the close of the New York market on Friday. 
 Over all, the Atlanta Fed's index for June showed a reading of 17.5, up from 17.3 in May, while its prices- paid component declined to 8.7 in June from 11.0 in May. Investors remained focused on today's release of the June retail sales and tomorrow's Consumer Price Index for any hint of whether the economy could accelerate and push inflation higher, leading the central bank to tighten credit.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said a busy week lay ahead for the Treasury market, with important reports every day beginning today. "While the bullish tone remains intact as we enter the week, there are two significant threats to the market in this week's releases, retail sales and the Consumer Price Index," he said.
"Neither release is expected to pose a problem for the market," he said, "but an unexpected upside surprise on either could undermine the optimistic economic slowdown-low inflation scenario. The bottom line is that while further gains appear likely this week, the downside potential is greater than the upside potential, particularly early in the week."
Retail sales fell in March, April and May, and the June report today is not expected to extend the negative streak to four, he said, but not much a rebound is expected either. Like the market consensus, Briefing estimates a two-tenths of 1 percent gain over all with the ex-auto numbers a bit stronger. Briefing.com sees a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent, and the market estimate is for a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent.
"While auto sales are not likely to surprise on the strong side given the weakness in unit auto sales," Mr. Jones said, "ex-auto sales remain something of a wild card."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, is not concerned. "The economy of the 1990's is a low inflation economy, able to grow strongly and maintain a low unemployment rate without experiencing any increase inflationary pressures," he said.
This important change, he said, means that the outlook for the coming years is about as good as it gets. "The Fed is committed to keeping the economy from overheating, so the likelihood of a significant increase in inflationary pressures is low," he said. "Instead, the economy should be able to continue expanding at a healthy rate for the foreseeable future."
Rates at yesterday's bill auction were lower than the previous week, but the bills auction was generally in line with recent offerings. The rate for a three-month issue increased to 5.05 percent, from 4.97 percent, while the six-month bill increased to 5.09 percent, from 5.07 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. to Give North Koreans Surplus Grain

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Two weeks after North Korea agreed to join peace talks, the United States announced today that it would donate $27 million worth of surplus grain to help that Government cope with severe shortages of food.
The announcement came in response to the latest appeal by the World Food Program for emergency aid to avert a catastrophe in North Korea, where there are reports of severe food shortages caused by floods and years of economic decay. 
 The United States has repeatedly insisted that it does not link aid to North Korea's willingness to take part in "four party" talks with the United States, South Korea and China to devise a formal end to the Korean War.
After months of delay as it raised demands for food, North Korea finally agreed on June 30 to take part in those talks. The four countries scheduled a meeting in New York in August to hammer out further details on the timing, site and agenda.
However, Administration officials remain wary of North Korea's willingness to see the process all the way through to a formal treaty to replace the 1953 armistice.

HEADLINE: Laws Are Urged to Protect Religion

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
The effort to counter the Supreme Court's recent decision that struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is likely to take the form of legislation and steer clear of a contentious effort to amend the Constitution, testimony at a Congressional hearing indicated today.
Representative Charles T. Canady, the Florida Republican who heads the Constitution subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, said at a subcommittee hearing that a constitutional amendment would be "ill-advised," premature and "most likely would not pass in any event." 
 Mr. Canady called the hearing to explore other approaches to shielding religious observances from Government regulation, the goal of the doomed Federal law that had passed both houses of Congress in 1993 with only three dissenting votes.
Lawyers for several of the major religious groups that made up an unusually broad coalition that supported the law all urged legislative action rather than an amendment.
"My overriding message is one of caution," said the Rev. Oliver Thomas, special counsel to the National Council of the Churches of Christ, and the chairman of the coalition four years ago.
Mr. Thomas, while calling the Supreme Court's decision "a profound national wrong," said a constitutional amendment would "create a bigger problem than the one we seek to solve."
Mr. Thomas and other witnesses, including a law professor who played a leading role in drafting the 1993 law, predicted today that more narrowly written laws tied to Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce and to control Federal spending would accomplish the goal of protecting religious practices and surviving a Supreme Court challenge.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act said no level of government could enforce a law that "substantially burdened" the free exercise of religion unless the law served a "compelling governmental interest" and was the "least restrictive means" of serving that interest. On June 25, in a 6-to-3 decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it exceeded Congress's authority.
In passing the measure, Congress had invoked its authority under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, which gives it the power to enforce constitutional rights and to prevent violations of those rights by the states. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's opinion for the Court said the law amounted to a substantive change in the meaning of the Constitution, an unauthorized expansion of constitutional rights, rather than a permissible enforcement or remedy within the proper meaning of Section 5.
While the hearing today was in one sense the first step of a congressional response, in another sense it was only the latest chapter in an unusual dialogue that Congress and the Court have been conducting since 1990. That year, in the decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Court ruled that the "compelling interest" test was not part of the First Amendment's guarantee of the free exercise of religion. A generally applicable law that happened to place a burden on religious practices did not violate the Constitution, the Court said. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, making the compelling-interest test a matter of Federal law, was the response to the 1990 decision.
Mark E. Chopko, general counsel of the United States Catholic Conference, which supported the law, said at the hearing today that the use of the word "restoration" in its title was a red flag to the Justices that Congress was encroaching on the Court's domain. Mr. Chopko urged Congress to "avoid the linguistics of 'restoration' " and focus instead on the goal of protecting religious liberty through legislation. Trying to pass a constitutional amendment would be divisive, he said.
Marc D. Stern, legal director of the American Jewish Congress, urged Congress to compile a "careful record" of the negative impact that regulations burdening religion can have on the economy. For example, Mr. Stern said, many Roman Catholics might not want to live in a state where liquor laws would not permit minors to drink communion wine.
With an adequate record, he said, Congress should be able to defend a new version of the law as an exercise of its power to regulate interstate commerce.
Mr. Stern and Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Texas who was instrumental in drafting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, also urged Congress to consider requiring a high level of protection for religious observances as a condition of receiving Federal money, much as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been effective in barring racial discrimination in programs that receive Federal aid.
One issue mentioned at the hearing was the effect of the Supreme Court decision on Congress's ability to apply the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to Federal laws, as opposed to state or local laws, a question the Court did not directly address. Professor Laycock and others said that since Section 5 of the 14th Amendment dealt only with Congressional authority over the states, the Court's interpretation of Section 5 left undisturbed Congress's authority to make law for the Federal Government.
But to be sure, he said, Congress should pass a joint resolution or a new measure to assert that the 1993 law is still binding on the Federal Government.
Amid the general enthusiasm for moving ahead with a Federal reply to the Court's decision, one witness, Jeffrey S. Sutton, the Solicitor General of Ohio, said the law had created a problem for Ohio and other states. Its failure to exempt prisons from its coverage led to burdensome and often frivolous lawsuits from prisoners who claimed violations of their religious rights, Mr. Sutton said.
Mr. Sutton, who argued in the Supreme Court on behalf of 16 states that the law violated state sovereignty, said the Ohio Attorney General, Betty D. Montgomery, had drafted a proposed state "religious liberty act" that did not cover prisons. While other witnesses said a state-by-state approach would lead to an unwieldy patchwork of religious protection, Mr. Sutton said states should be permitted to experiment.
The concept of federalism that the Court honored in its decision last month "was also designed to protect individual liberty," he said.

HEADLINE: Governors Island Is No Lure For Developers, Panel Hears

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
With developers saying that its isolation and high maintenance costs may make Governors Island a money-loser at any price, the island's fate seemed caught in a web of conflicting city, state and Federal Government interests yesterday at a Congressional hearing in Manhattan.
The hearing, intended to provide New York officials, business people and civic groups with a forum to suggest ways to reuse Governors Island -- and prevent it from being auctioned off as surplus Federal real estate -- became as much an exchange of opinions about what cannot be done and should not be considered for the scenic tract in New York Harbor. 
 "It is just not logical to consider this as an attractive development site," said Douglas Durst, a Manhattan developer, who said that the cost of a large-scale development on the 174-acre island, half of it protected as a city historic district, could be close to $1 billion.
President Clinton has offered to help transfer Governors Island to New York for $1 if city and state officials can agree on a plan for its development. The island was vacated by the United States Coast Guard in May after 200 years as a military installation.
If the city and state cannot agree on a development plan, the island would be offered to other Federal agencies and then put up for auction in 2002.
One point of agreement at yesterday's hearing, conducted at the Custom House in lower Manhattan, was that Congress has grossly overestimated the appeal of the island to real estate investors. Congress has approved a provision in the Federal budget that calls for the sale of the island in 2002, and it estimates the selling price at $500 million.
"Every once in a while it's like the Congress discovers a bunch of Confederate money lying around and thinks it's worth something," said Stephen Horn, a California Republican and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government, Management, Information and Technology, who presided at the hearing with Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat and fellow member of the committee. "Somebody in Washington pulled that $500 million figure out of a phone book," Ms. Maloney said.
But while holding the Congressional estimate in collective ridicule, those testifying yesterday differed sharply on what a redeveloped Governors Island would cost and who should pay for it.
"It is time for Washington to show us some money and maybe everybody will get serious about this project," said Randy Levine, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor for finance, planning and economic development. He maintained that Congress must drop any hope of raising money from the island's sale, and must provide Federal support to help the city and state maintain it.
The President's offer to transfer the island to city and state control for $1 had been made to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who described it in an interview in March. He said that the advisers to Mayor Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki risked losing out on the President's offer of help because they appeared unable to agree on a plan for the island.
"I have the President's promise, but two years from now the island will be irrecoverable unless we come to Washington with a plan," Senator Moynihan said in an interview yesterday.
One proposal that has circulated widely among civic groups -- and was offered at the hearing yesterday by officials of the Sierra Club -- would turn Governors Island over to the National Park Service, to be combined with Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty as a national park and tourist attraction.
"The parks service perhaps ought to take it over, but we know it won't," Senator Moynihan said, adding that the National Park Service is under too much financial strain managing its existing parks to add to its property in the New York Harbor.
Another proposal, offered at the hearing by Ms. Maloney, is that a development agency controlled by a consortium of Federal, state and city officials be formed to acquire the island.
The proposal drew a cool response from Mr. Levine, reflecting a repeated refusal by the Giuliani administration to share power with other levels of government in development projects. "The city is fully capable of handling this on its own," Mr. Levine said.
Mr. Levine's response was criticized by Ms. Maloney, who said: "The city seems to be saying it has the resources to get this done, but they certainly didn't put any cash on the table today."

HEADLINE: Is This the End of Lilco? Silver Has the Crucial Vote

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 14

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, a deal that would help determine the Island's electric rates for the next three decades and require the largest municipal bond sale in American history, faces a crucial test this week, with its fate resting in the hands of the Governor's nemesis, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
For the $7.3 billion plan to go into effect, it needs the unanimous approval of the state's Public Authorities Control Board, which will take up the matter on Wednesday. Mr. Silver is a member, as are representatives of Governor Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, two certain votes in favor. That leaves it up to the Speaker, who has said he will not postpone the vote, but has not said which way he will go. 
 "The deal will rise or fall on its merits," he said recently.
When it was announced in March, the proposal to take over Lilco's debts and many of its assets was one of the Republican Governor's proudest achievements. It appeared to resolve some seemingly intractable problems for the Governor in a region that is one of his political bases, just in time for his 1998 re-election campaign. State officials argued that it would lower the Island's electric rates, the highest in the continental United States, by 19 percent, while settling a tax dispute with Lilco that threatened the financial health of Suffolk County and some local governments there.
For Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, the calculations on the politics and the merits are different. Some of his allies are concerned that if he votes against it, Republicans will accuse him of blocking the Island's only hope for significantly lower electric bills. And he is surely loath to give the Governor something he so dearly wants.
Mr. Silver's aides and other Assembly Democrats say that he has given them few clues as to his intentions, but they predict that he will at least try to alter the deal in ways that will allow him to say that he improved it.
The deal was warmly received at first by a wide range of business groups and politicians. But since then, it has come in for heavy criticism, forcing Mr. Pataki to stump for it aggressively in recent days. Consumer groups oppose it, the Republican-dominated Suffolk County Legislature commissioned a study that came out critical of the takeover, the Island's Democratic Assembly members have urged Mr. Silver to oppose it, and Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, continuing her feud with the Governor, sent him a letter today saying that she, too, had reservations.
An examination of the deal, and interviews with people on both sides of the issue, yield several crucial questions and conclusions. And, allies of Mr. Silver said, he is considering these issues as Wednesday's vote approaches.
The first is whether the state can back out of a 1989 agreement that allows Lilco to recover nearly all of its costs from the Shoreham nuclear plant. The administration says no. If the answer is yes, the savings to consumers would be far greater.
The second issue is that the deal is fairly sweet for Lilco and its shareholders, though how sweet is a matter of dispute. While this is galling to the utility's legion of critics, it appears that Lilco will accept no less, leaving the state with little choice if it wants to execute the takeover.
The third issue is that the agreement pumps up consumer savings in the early years by increasing the amount borrowed by more than $500 million and postponing some debt repayment for years. That increases the long-term cost of the deal -- and the amount people will pay for electricity over the next three decades -- by more than $1 billion. State officials make arguments for this arrangement, but critics say it is meant to bolster Mr. Pataki's short-term political fortunes.
Another major issue is the promised rate savings. Even some advocates of the deal concede that the savings are exaggerated, though it is impossible to say just how much. Still, it appears that there are savings, which state officials argue is, finally, what matters.
After the state control board, the proposal must jump two more administrative hurdles. One is approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the other a waiver by the Internal Revenue Service of $2 billion in capital gains tax that Lilco could owe on the deal.
As with all Lilco matters, it seems, the entire dispute centers on Shoreham. The utility, which serves Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, began work on the nuclear plant in the early 1970's, with the state's support. But in the 1980's, local opposition prevented it from going into service.
In 1989, that dispute ended when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed an agreement that insured that Shoreham would never go into service. A state agency, the Long Island Power Authority, took possession of the generator and decommissioned it. Lilco was promised that higher rates, over many years, would allow it to recover all its outstanding costs for the plant, a figure that now stands at $4.5 billion.
The fight over Shoreham left a legacy of bitterness toward the utility that infiltrates every discussion of the proposed deal. It also left the region with rates more than double the national average, which hinders its economy.
Consumer advocates have long argued that state should simply order Lilco to swallow some of Shoreham's costs and lower its rates. "Shareholders, investors, should have to take a write-off, rather than socking it all to the ratepayer," said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Lilco Citizens Advisory Panel, appointed by a Federal judge as part of a lawsuit settlement against Lilco.
But officials at Lilco, the Long Island Power Authority and the Pataki administration insist that the state is still bound by the 1989 agreement.
"The State of New York made a contractual agreement to let them recover the cost of Shoreham," said Louis R. Tomson, first deputy secretary to the Governor and one of the architects of the buyout. He said an attempt to break the pact would be tied up in court for a decade.
Electric industry analysts on Wall Street say there is no clear answer to the legal question. Other states have ordered utilities to write off costs, but those states had nothing like the 1989 agreement to contend with.
The state buyout would settle the matter once and for all, guaranteeing that Long Island ratepayers would pay for Shoreham.
Under the takeover, the power authority would buy almost all of Lilco's outstanding stock for more than $2.8 billion, and would take over $3.2 billion in Lilco debt. To pay for these and related expenses, the authority would sell $7.3 billion in bonds, to be repaid by electric ratepayers over the next 33 years.
The authority would acquire Lilco's transmission and distribution system, and the company's 18 percent ownership of an upstate nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point 2. By the state's calculations, Lilco would be paid book value for those assets, or $2.5 billion.
But critics charge that the company is being vastly overpaid for the assets. For instance, Nine Mile Point 2, one of the most trouble-plagued nuclear plants in the country, has been a money loser. Yet the power authority proposes to pay Lilco $301 million for its share of the plant.
But Mr. Tomson argued that the deal negotiated -- the total dollar figure and the inclusion of Nine Mile Point 2 -- were the minimum that Dr. William Catacosinos, the company's chairman, would accept.
Joseph W. McDonnell, senior vice president of Lilco, insisted that the deal was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. "The deal has been negotiated," he said. "The transaction will not be negotiated before each body that needs to provide approval."
The merger agreement with Brooklyn Union provides that if the state takes over the debt, Lilco stockholders would get a 9.6 percent bonus -- more than $2 a share -- in the form of a larger share of the merged company.
Yet Wall Street does not view the takeover as a windfall for Lilco. Even with the promise of that bonus, the proposed merger and proposed state takeover, the company's stock has under-performed the market as a whole since late last year.
One of the more appealing aspects of the deal is that it allows Suffolk County, the town of Brookhaven and the Shoreham-Wading River School District to escape a $1.1 billion judgment Lilco recently won against them for years of excessive property taxes on the Shoreham plant. The company had several similar suits pending against other local governments, over taxes on other properties, that are potentially worth another $400 million.
Under the takeover, the authority, inheriting Lilco's role, would settle the Shoreham case for $625 million, and drop the other cases.
"All the people who complain that we're paying too much don't take into account that we're getting out of a $1.5 billion obligation for $625 million," Mr. Tomson said.
But the authority proposes to finance the settlement of the property tax case like a family using credit cards to live beyond its means, though it means higher costs in the long run.
The settlement could be paid off by adjusting electric rates over many years, at no overall increase in costs, but that idea was rejected by Suffolk officials. So instead, the authority proposes to send customers rebate checks and give them large rate reductions in the first five years. To pay for that, it would borrow $462 million, to be repaid by Suffolk residents through higher rates until 2028.
"The whole thing is just nutty," said Larry Shapiro, staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group that opposes the takeover. "You borrow half a billion just to hand people some cash?"
Similarly, much of the borrowing behind the entire deal would be arranged to postpone payments for several years. Such moves allow deeper rate reductions right away, but raise the cost of repayment for the next 33 years.
Mr. Tomson said the structure was needed to provide the authority with a cushion of cash as it goes into business. Yet the state had already earmarked $640 million in borrowing specifically for the creation of a reserve fund.
In the long run, critics say, the agreement is flawed in that it hinders competition, which is replacing electric monopolies around the country, and which could lower rates. This is in part based on a provision that has the Power Authority pay the merged Lilco-Brooklyn Union for 15 years for the right to buy its power.
Critics have also attacked the authority's promise that it would lower electric rates an average of 19 percent over the first 10 years. In fact, the authority's predicted prices average 15 percent below current levels, not 19 percent. The higher figure is based on a comparison with Lilco's projections that assume steadily climbing rates without the takeover.
The state's predictions assume modest increases in power demand, which consumer groups say may not materialize.
Still, it appears that the deal would, at least over the first decade, save ratepayers money. The authority can issue tax-exempt bonds, so it would pay lower interest rates on the debts that Lilco has been paying. And unlike Lilco, the authority would not have to pay Federal income tax on shareholder dividends.
In the second and third decades, by the state's own projections, the savings would be much smaller.

Agency to Sell Bonds To Expand College

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The New York City Industrial Development Agency has authorized the issuance of bonds worth $9.16 million on behalf of the College of New Rochelle that will allow the private, nonprofit institution to expand its services to adult-education students at its School of New Resources.
The bonds are to be used by the college to purchase and renovate a building it now leases at its South Bronx campus and to create a new Adult Learning Center at its Co-op City campus. The improvements will enable the college to double its Co-op City enrollment to 1,000 students. 
 The tax-exempt bonds are more advantageous to nonprofit institutions because they usually come with a lower interest rate than bonds issued by the institution itself.
In fiscal 1997, the Industrial Development Agency, a public benefit corporation created by the State Legislature and administered by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, expects to issue $102 million worth of private activity bonds for 12 institutions, including some Y.M.C.A.'s in Manhattan and Staten Island.

HEADLINE: THE DOLLAR SOARS AS EUROPE DOUBTS ITS CURRENCY PLAN

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 14

 BODY:
Defying the efforts of policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic to restrain the strength of the American currency, the dollar surged in value today against most major European currencies, reaching its highest level in six years against the German mark and the French franc.
The rise reflects the dollar's expanding role as a haven for currency traders skeptical over the future of the euro, the new single European currency that is supposed to start replacing several national denominations here in 1999. 
 With the dollar buying nearly 1.8 German marks and more than 6 French francs, it is now worth about 10 percent more than it was in early February, when American and European finance ministers declared that the United States currency had already climbed enough and was due for a pause.
By contrast, however, the dollar has moved in the other direction against the Japanese yen, helping to alleviate fears in Washington that a weaker yen will only aggravate the gaping American trade deficit with Japan by making Japanese exports cheaper in world markets.
After soaring against the yen for more than a year, the dollar has slipped back in recent months from its high point of 127 yen in April to about 114 today. For the Clinton Administration, led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a slumping mark is much less worrisome than a slumping yen would have been, several economists said today.
"If the dollar strengthens too much against the Japanese yen, it will contribute to a further deterioration in the trade balance," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "That argument will not be made about Europe."
Treasury officials declined to comment on the dollar today.
There is little question, though, that Tokyo has always been seen in Washington as more of an economic rival to the United States than Germany or Western Europe. When the dollar spurts against the yen, it brings politically powerful protests from American auto makers and others industries that compete against Japanese imports or are trying to crack Japan's sheltered market.
For American tourists in continental Europe, the stronger dollar means that they can buy far more for their money than during last summer's vacation season.
But the resurgence of the dollar in Europe after a few months of relative stability could mean headaches for at least some American exporters because it makes American products more expensive and European products more competitive.
The divergence between European and Japanese currencies highlights the extent to which exchange markets dance to their own tune rather than the dictates of policy makers.
On Feb. 7, Mr. Rubin signaled a significant change in American policy. Mr. Rubin had previously held fast to the position that a strong dollar was good for the United States but suddenly and explicitly he began saying that the dollar had been strong "for some time now."
Though subtle, that shift was formalized and welcomed in Berlin the next day by the finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's formidable central bank, followed up by frequently stating that the "correction" had gone far enough and that the mark was ready to stabilize.
Since then, however, policy makers have been rocked with new shocks related to the introduction of the proposed euro. Germany, bogged down with the highest level of unemployment it has seen since World War II, is running budget deficits that violate its own tough fiscal standards for countries that are allowed to join in the new European Monetary Union. France, meanwhile, has elected a Socialist Government that has been far more hostile to the strict fiscal requirements of the euro, and its budget deficit is running much higher than economists had expected just a few months ago.
All of this has raised serious new doubts about the strength of the future euro. Analysts predict that Germany, with red ink of its own, will no longer be able to block weaker countries like Italy from taking part in the new monetary union.
"It looks like the European Monetary Union will occur and that it will be relatively wide, and this will keep alive doubts about the euro until the new European central bank establishes its credibility," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief global economist for Salomon Brothers in London.
Other analysts argued today that the dollar was now one of the few good escape routes for investors skeptical of the euro who want to bail out of marks.
The other escape route is the British pound, which has also soared against the mark in recent months, in part because Britain is not expected to join the new monetary union. The pound has also been helped by Britain's comparatively strong economy and by the fact that the Bank of England, Britain's central bank, is widely expected to further raise interest rates to help cool off the overheated economy. The British currency, which closed today at 1.6821 to the dollar, down from 1.6946 on Friday, has even strengthened against the dollar in recent weeks.
But there is only so much money that can go into the pound. And the Italian lira and Spanish peseta, which had served as attractive targets for skeptics of the euro, are now considered overpriced. "The avenues for investors to bet on a soft euro have been closed off," Avinash Persaud, an economist at J. P. Morgan in London, said. "So those who want to sell Deutsche marks are now putting more money into dollars."
In late currency trading in New York today, the dollar traded at 1.7907 marks, up sharply from Friday's close of 1.7744. The dollar settled at 6.0680 French francs, up from 5.9885 on Friday.
Analysts say there are reasons to believe that the dollar could go even higher against European currencies in the weeks and months ahead. For one thing, European leaders have yet to demonstrate serious alarm about the depreciation of their currencies.
"Deep in their hearts, the Europeans are happy about the falling mark," Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs International said. "They are saying that they have to create more jobs and one of the few areas of hope is on the export side. If the dollar goes up, so much the better."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Seeks Argentine Deal Linking Credit to Governing

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
In negotiations that could have a ripple effect throughout developing nations, the International Monetary Fund is offering for the first time to give its seal of approval to a country that agrees to improve its governing process instead of simply meeting strict economic targets.
The offer, now being discussed with Argentina, would make an I.M.F. line of credit dependent on such evidence of "good governance" as emphasizing spending on health and education, overhauling the tax system, improving court practices, strengthening private property rights and opening Government ledgers. 
 Until now, the fund's credit was pegged to holding the line on inflation, limiting budget deficits and the like.
If both parties agree on the arrangement, Argentina would have improved standing in private credit markets, allowing it to borrow at lower rates. Presumably, it would also attract more foreign investment since the changes sought by the I.M.F. would provide more protection for business.
The arrangement, if it works, could well serve as a model for developing countries in Latin America and possibly other areas, giving private business and investment a bigger share of the role that the monetary fund has played.
The offer grows out of Argentina's success in overcoming inflation and promoting the fastest growth in Latin America this year -- currently around 8 percent. It also reflects the decision in 1991 to peg the Argentine peso's value to to the United States dollar as well as the Government's willingness to embark on what the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, has termed "the second generation of structural reform in Latin America."
The Argentine economy is forecast to grow 7 percent for the year with virtually no inflation, leaving the monetary fund with no grounds for seeking new pledges of conventional economic rectitude in exchange for credit promises.
Instead, Argentina would be given the right to borrow an as yet-undecided amount in exchange for a package of governing reforms.
The goal, I.M.F. officials predict, is to prolong Argentina's strong growth and further reduce poverty.
"These commitments will consolidate and extend the reforms we have already taken," Argentina's Economy Minister, Roque Fernandez, said in an interview in New York yesterday. "They give us more credibility. They are an international seal of approval."
Pablo Guidotti, the country's Treasury Minister, added, "We do not plan to draw the new loan because we have adequate access to private capital markets. But we need technical assistance from the I.M.F. for many of the changes we plan."
Under the emerging agreement, he said, the Government would give priority in public spending to improving the health and education of the work force. It would make public-spending accounts more open and create special courts to clear a backlog of tax disputes.
It would also reform the selection process for judges to give the impression of greater judicial independence. And it would make it easier for banks and other lenders to recover assets from borrowers in default.
The proposed agreement reflects the increased importance economists now attach to the quality of government as a means of encouraging development.
The I.M.F.'s sister finance agency, the World Bank -- in its latest World Development Report, published last month -- said that countries with sound governing practices and effective economic policies saw real income rise 3 percent a year in the three decades from 1963 to 1993.
For those with poor governing practices but good economic policies, the rise was 1.4 percent. And for those with poor ratings in both areas, the gain was a mere four-tenths of 1 percent.
In a speech to Argentine bankers in Buenos Aires in May, Mr. Camdessus said that the kinds of changes Argentina planned to make would allow nations to achieve "high-quality growth of the kind that will be genuinely sustainable over the long term."
While the widespread adoption of market-oriented economic policies in Latin America and the Caribbean has lifted average growth rates to around 5 percent from 1.5 percent in 1988, most countries have been unable to narrow the income gap with more economically advanced nations or make a significant dent in poverty rates, Mr. Camdessus said.
The answer, he contended, involved "reducing state intervention in the economy," as well as carrying out the sorts of changes that are now the subject of the talks with Argentina.

HEADLINE: Chicago Journal;
Once Stolid and Big-Shouldered, Now a Cinderella on the Lake

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 14

 BODY:
Property values are zooming. Crime is plunging. Unemployment is falling. The Bulls are reigning.
Test scores in the public schools are rising. And the 110-story Sears Tower has regained its status as the tallest building in the world, at least by some measures. 
 In this city that always has one eye on the mirror, the self-image of Chicago, as in "Sweet Home, Chicago," has lately been something to dance about.
Describing the mood of Chicagoans, Greg Longhini, the city's spokesman for the Department of Planning and Development, sounded a bit like James Brown:
"We feel good."
If not for the hapless Cubs (still in last place) and the shady politicians (five current or former Aldermen are among 13 people charged in a recent Federal investigation of corruption), it would seem that this capital of Middle America had lost its salt-of-the-earth demeanor.
It helps, of course, that it is summertime. With the music in Grant Park, the revelers at outdoor cafes on Rush Street and the sailboats on Lake Michigan, this city looks distinctly more charming than it does, say, in January, when hypothermal pedestrians cling desperately to light poles to avoid being swept away by the freezing wind.
But not even the infamous winter wind, known here as The Hawk, appears likely to chill the property market here.
It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out why Chicago is booming. In a national economy that seems almost too good to be true, the industrial Midwest is a regional leader. And this city is the financial and cultural center of the vast sweep across the heart of the nation.
Developers seem to be salivating at virtually every scrap of land in Chicago. Abandoned railroad property is being transformed into upscale housing. Even near public housing projects, new town houses are commanding prices of $350,000.
While many malls outside Chicago are struggling, suburbanites now flock to Michigan Avenue to shop on weekends. And many of them, weary of long commuting times to work, have been returning to live in the city.
Parts of the city do not seem so different from the suburbs anymore. Neighborhoods like Bucktown and Wicker Park, downright dangerous a decade ago, have become yuppie havens. Lincoln Park, once a hot spot for the young and hip, is now rich and staid. The 43d Ward, a nerve center for the antiwar movement in the 60's, now has Republican leanings.
This city still gets plenty of mileage out of the Big Shoulder image, the dominant Chicago cliche since Carl Sandburg coined the phrase in 1914.
In truth, it can be tough to find the old Chicago, the lunch-bucket, working-class town that jumped to the sound of factory whistles.
One of the greatest symbols of that plain-spoken ethos was Montgomery Ward, which started its mail order catalogue in 1872, a year after the Great Fire. Now in desperate straits, the company recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and dismissed 400 people, or 20 percent of its staff at the corporate headquarters here.
Chicago these days, especially on the North Side and along the lakefront, is no longer a town filled with typical Montgomery Ward customers: sensible, no-frills shoppers who think twice before spending a hard-earned dollar.
Rather, it is the razzle-dazzle of North Michigan Avenue, the high-end stores along the Magnificent Mile, that has been setting the Chicago retail market on fire.
Unemployment has dropped below 6 percent, the lowest in more than 20 years. The fastest job growth is in the financial sector, including people who have grown suddenly rich in the high-flying stock market.
Chicago is gaining on the dirty rats, and not just the kind targeted by the prosecutor's office.
Rodents are dying off in this city. Not so long ago, rats outnumbered Chicagoans more than 2 to 1.
People strolling along Rush Street in the Gold Coast, a neighborhood of expensive brownstones and boutiques along the lakefront just north of downtown, sometimes crossed paths with the furry creatures -- which did not create the best kind of advertisement for tourists.
But an aggressive campaign to clean up neighborhoods and require tighter lids of garbage containers has cut the rat population to about 500,000, down from about 6 million in 1979, according to the city.
Chicago politics have become so peaceful they are almost boring, except, of course, for the corruption. During the 1980's, Chicago was called Beirut on the Lake for its political warring, often along racial lines.
For the last few years, this city has largely been getting the kind of ink that is better than advertisements, like the glowing reviews that surrounded last year's Democratic National Convention here.
Mayor Richard M. Daley, the son of the legendary boss of the Chicago machine, much prefers the role of efficient manager to ward politician. In his easy re-election in 1991, Mr. Daley won 25 percent of the black vote, up from the single-digit percentage in his first successful campaign for the office.
But one politician who thinks Mr. Daley is vulnerable is Representative Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther and later an influential alderman. A Democrat, he is considering a run against Mr. Daley next time around.
In the view of Mr. Rush, Chicago, under Mayor Daley, has evolved into two unequal societies. He sees the division not so much along racial lines as class ones. He says the Daley administration has used tax incentives to rebuild neighborhoods for the rich, while lining the pockets of developers, a pin-stripe patronage.
"He's trying to suburbanize Chicago," Mr. Rush said.
The City Council, however has presented Mayor Daley the younger, as he is sometimes called, with virtually no opposition. And he is reaping the rewards of the improvements in the city's fortunes.
 "He will be Mayor as long as he wants," said Paul Green, an author on Chicago politics and professor at Governors State University. "He has far more control over this city than his father ever had."

HEADLINE: Entrenched Hispanic Democrats Feel New Mexico's Sands Shifting

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., July 10

 BODY:
For years, the hills and arroyos of northern New Mexico seemed to be an unchanging tableau of Hispanic farmers wedded to ancient irrigation ditches and to ancient political loyalties -- Democratic.
But in an electoral upset two months ago that still reverberates around the plazas here, northern New Mexico voters have sent to Washington a Congressman who is non-Hispanic, Protestant, Republican and born in Chicago. 
 In a three-way race to succeed Representative Bill Richardson, Bill Redmond, a nondenominational Christian minister, won the May 12 election in the state's Third District with 43 percent of the vote. Mr. Richardson, a Democrat of Mexican and New England ancestry, gave up the House seat in February to be the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Holding his Congressional seat since it was created in 1982, Mr. Richardson had easily beaten Mr. Redmond in last November's election.
"Hispanics have controlled the politics of northern New Mexico for so many years -- what the heck happened?" asked Mayor Debbie Jaramillo of Santa Fe, a Hispanic Democrat who plans to challenge Mr. Redmond in next year's election. "I just can't close my eyes and pretend that he represents me."
Mr. Redmond's victory, a surprise to Republicans, is more than a triumph over high political odds. It is also part of a larger story of political, social and economic change being played out across the Southwest, particularly in New Mexico, as wealthy whites, known here as Anglos, have moved in, markedly changing the character of the area. For Hispanic leaders, angry at seeing their political power diluted here even as it grows in other parts of the nation, these changes, brought home by the election of Mr. Redmond, are cause for soul-searching.
In 1970, 65 percent of the surnames in Santa Fe were Spanish, but that number was down to 49 percent in 1990, according to the United States Census. Rising real estate prices and taxes have forced old Hispanic families to trade their adobe houses in the center of the city for trailers on its edge. With 60,000 residents, Santa Fe has about 200 art galleries, 300 restaurants and 800 real estate agents.
"The white people moved in, painted the town brown and moved the brown people out," Mayor Jaramillo once said.
But the well-known changes in Santa Fe are not the only reasons for the political shift here. High-tech industries have arrived in a big way, with the Intel Corporation opening a major manufacturing plant in Rio Rancho, just north of Albuquerque. Fast-growing Rio Rancho is a model of Sun Belt development and could soon displace Santa Fe as the district's largest city. Its demographics show an increasing number of voters who are evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, as well as expanding suburban neighborhoods of retirees drawn by the warm, dry weather.
In the northwest corner of the state, Farmington is the center of both a growing gas and oil industry and conservative politics. Republicans have long been strong in Los Alamos, the home of Mr. Redmond and of Energy Department laboratories. In the district's dry eastern flatlands, a region known as Little Texas, conservative politics flourishes among the cowboy twangs and military personnel.
Still, Mr. Redmond's victory comes in a district where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans two to one, and where the gradual swing of much of the West toward the Republican Party, with the notable exception of Denver and Boulder, Colo., had not taken hold.
But Democrats in New Mexico have found a new competitor, the Green Party, which has used its environmental agenda to siphon votes from Democrats in recent elections. Indeed, many here credit Mr. Redmond's victory to the strong showing by the Green Party candidate, Carol Miller. She won 17 percent of the vote, leaving the Democrat, Eric Serna, a longtime state official who spent more than twice as much as Mr. Richmond, with 40 percent.
In Santa Fe, Hispanic leaders are fighting the cultural changes, especially the transformation of the city into what some old-time residents grumble is "Santa Fake," with adobe architecture mandated for new construction. As Spanish fades from sidewalk conversations, and prices in high-end chain stores like Talbot and Ann Taylor keep locals away from the streets around the 17th-century central square, city officials have responded with an official community celebration each May called Take Back the Plaza Day.
"Children today do not speak Spanish -- in my grandmother's house, we were not allowed to speak English," said Frank Ortiz, a retired United States Ambassador to Peru who traces his family's presence in Santa Fe to 1607.
Like Mr. Ortiz, about a third of the voters in Mr. Redmond's district are Hispanic, many tracing their family's presence here back nearly four centuries. Some of the district's 21 Indian tribes date back 1,000 years. And for some with historic ties here, the Republican victory in the district is particularly bitter, especially when they consider the influence of the Green Party.
In this week's Santa Fe Reporter, a local weekly newspaper, Chris Roybal, a lifelong Democrat who traces his family's presence here to the days of Spanish kings, wrote: "We do not have the benefit of trust funds or the luxury of taking on causes that benefit the salvation of the whales far away at the expense of our own economic development and well-being here at home. We are here forever, as were our ancestors before us, loving and protecting our lands -- not just having a summer condo to live in during the good weather periods."
Hispanic, and Democratic, concern about the growing influence of the Green Party may well be justified. In the 1994 race for governor, a Green Party candidate won 10 percent, helping to insure victory for a Republican, Gary E. Johnson. In a setback to Mayor Jaramillo's hopes to run for the Congressional seat next year, Ms. Miller narrowly won Santa Fe in May and plans to run again in 1998.
Ms. Miller, a health care planner, spoke of a sour mood among many Hispanics here. " 'Spoiler' is what people say when they lose," she said. "We are stimulating democracy, helping the United States reach a more diverse political situation."
The Greens not only won Santa Fe, but also did well in Navajo areas and won the Indian pueblo of Taos, just north of the resort town.
"The Native American vote," Ms. Miller said, "is a cornerstone for building the Green Party.".
Noting that her party's platform had been translated into Navajo, she added, "My Indian friends told me they were tired of hearing that this was a Hispanic seat."
But the defeat of Mr. Serna, who regulates a variety of industries as a member of the New Mexico State Corporation Commission, has created ill feeling toward the Green Party among many Hispanic voters.
"A lot of people are mad at the Greens," said Sam Baca, a historic preservation worker whose family presence in Santa Fe goes back 13 generations. "They don't have a chance of winning, and they just serve to elect Republicans."
Hoping to make peace -- and win elections -- some Democrats want New Mexico to pass the kind of election law in effect in New York State, where a candidate can run on the ticket of more than one party. But Governor Johnson is expected to veto such a law if it reaches his desk.
"The Republicans are dancing in the streets," Attorney General Tom Udall, a Democrat, said of the Green Party's electoral strength. "It's elected a Republican Governor and a Republican Congressman in a heavily Democratic state. Why would they want to change that?"
Mr. Udall, who says he "is leaning" toward running against Mr. Redmond next year, knows that his family name could help him gain Indian support. His father, Stewart, and an uncle, Morris, promoted Indian affairs in the 1960's and 1970's. But as for the latest political force on the horizon, he vowed, "I intend to make peace with the Greens."
To win, Mr. Udall may well need to do so. "The district may be registered Democratic, but it is . . . very independent," Mr. Richardson said in a telephone interview from New York. "It is an eclectic Western constituency that can turn on you if you don't have the right message."
Indeed, some have called the district the nation's most diverse, pointing to the balkanization among the Indian tribes, conservative and liberal whites, and the Hispanic base.
In a rare point of agreement, Representative Redmond concurred with his predecessor.
"The people are more independent-minded in their politics than outsiders give them credit for," he said.

HEADLINE: Diet Pills: Allure and Risk

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
DR. PIETR HITZIG of Timonium, Md., is so impressed with the diet pill combination fenfluramine and phentermine that he has given it to 8,000 people. In fact, he advertises on his web page that if you cannot make it to his office, he will prescribe the drugs anyway over the phone. There are no contraindications, his web page says.
Dr. Ben Z. Krentzman, a family practitioner, said he had come out of retirement last year to prescribe the pills. He began by advertising on the Internet and seeing patients in his living room. Now he has an office in Culver City, Calif., and is about to open two more, one in San Luis Obispo, Calif., and the other in Hawaii. So far, he said in an interview, he has given the drugs to 800 people. 
 Not since the amphetamine craze of the 1970's have diet pills swept the country like fen-phen, as the drug combination is known. Patients got 18 million new prescriptions and refills last year, said IMS America, which tracks drug sales.
But now, in the wake of new hints that the drug combination might be dangerous, some medical experts are asking what the nation has wrought. What does it say about the American medical system when millions of healthy people rush to take an untested combination of drugs for long periods of time? What are people willing to risk to be slim?
The evidence that the drug combination may be dangerous is preliminary, but leading cardiologists and obesity experts say they are alarmed. Last week, doctors at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere reported that 35 women who had taken fenfluramine and phentermine had developed an unusual and serious heart-valve defect. Previous studies have linked fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, a chemically purer version of the drug, to primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal condition in which the artery that feeds blood to the lungs becomes choked off.
Wyeth-Ayerst, one of two companies that make fenfluramine and the sole maker of dexfenfluramine, sold as Redux, sent out a news release saying it was working with the Mayo Clinic to further investigate the question of whether the fen-phen combination causes the heart valve defects but added that at this time the data were "limited and therefore not conclusive." In addition, said the company, a unit of the American Home Products Corporation, obesity itself "is associated with serious health disorders."
The Food and Drug Administration sent out a letter to thousands of doctors advising them of the valve defects but not telling doctors to take patients off the drugs.
Fenfluramine and phentermine are old drugs, approved two decades ago as short-term diet aids for the obese. Doctors started combining them only recently, after a four-year study of 121 obese people indicated that the combination could succeed where diets alone failed. Dr. Bernard Weintraub of the University of Rochester, who conducted the study, noted that the patients had not actually reached their ideal weights but that most had lost enough weight to lower their blood pressure and blood sugar levels. He suggested that obesity be treated as a chronic illness, with patients taking drugs for life.
But except for Dr. Weintraub's small study, no one has tested fenfluramine and phentermine together, and no one has looked for adverse effects when people take the drugs for long periods of time. In effect, said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, an internist and economist who is associate dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, when doctors began prescribing the drugs en masse, they were conducting an uncontrolled experiment on millions of Americans. That was legal because doctors are free to prescribe approved drugs for any uses they please, but Dr. Hillman and others question whether it was wise.
When a nearly untested drug combination enters the obesity market in a country where people are willing to try almost anything that promises to help them shed pounds, Dr. Hillman said, "you have a potential disaster on your hands."
Of course, not every weight loss center freely prescribes the drugs. For example, Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the Van Itallie Center for Weight Loss and Maintenance at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said his center's doctors had prescribed the drugs for fewer than 5 percent of their patients.
And Dr. Adam Drewnowski, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Michigan, said that an overweight but not obese friend of his had gone to a weight loss clinic near Atlanta looking for the drugs but that the doctor at the weight loss center had refused to prescribe fen-phen for him.
But there is no doubt that some clinics have prescribed the drugs to huge numbers of people.
About 10,000 people visiting the 16 Los Angeles area offices of California Medical Weight Loss Associates have taken the drugs, said Aaron Baumann, the group's administrator. "This is L.A.," Mr. Baumann said. "People tend to want to be thinner than in the rest of the country." He said the drugs "work like magic." He himself takes them.
Some commercial diet centers have used the drugs to attract customers. Nutri-System, for example, advertised two months of free medication with either fen-phen or dexfenfluramine to dieters who switched to them from Jenny Craig, a competing chain of diet centers. Jenny Craig Inc. said on Thursday that it was recommending that doctors at its centers stop prescribing fen-phen. Nutri-System's vice president for scientific affairs, Dr. Joseph Di Bartolomeo, said yesterday that his company's medical advisers were studying the new data and that, in the meantime, the company was still prescribing the drugs.
The Internet is bristling with fen-phen advertisements, including one that rather mysteriously quotes "L.D., San Diego" as saying, "I lost 40 pounds in six weeks on fen-phen and had to force myself to eat." The web page adds, "It was so easy," and promises to tell more for $5.
Dr. Hitzig, Dr. Krentzman and others say they have prescribed the drugs to people with just a few pounds to lose. Dr. Hitzig's web page quotes a patient saying that until taking fen-phen, "no matter what I did, I could never shed that last 15 pounds." Dr. Hitzig also said he prescribed the drugs for people with eating disorders, who may not be overweight, as well as for alcoholics, cocaine addicts and people complaining of gulf war syndrome. But he noted that the vast majority of his patients wanted to lose weight.
Mr. Baumann, of California Medical Weight Loss Associates, said that doctors there prescribed the pills for people who are at least 20 percent above their ideal weights. "A lady who weighs 120 and should weigh 100 pounds is obese," he said. But he added, "You might not look at her and say she is obese."
Mr. Baumann and others whose medical centers have prescribed the drugs widely said they had not seen any patients with heart damage. But cardiologists say the damage is not easy to spot.
"The first step is that you have to be aware of the connection," said Dr. Jeffrey Isner, a cardiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine. If a young woman comes in complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue -- signs of a heart valve defect -- most primary care doctors would look at other possible causes first. The woman would most likely be overweight, which could account for her symptoms, Dr. Isner said. "You may not think to inspect the cardiac system that carefully," he added. Now, of course, examining a fen-phen patient's heart "jumps to the top of the list," and doctors would be likely to order echocardiograms to examine patients' heart valves.
The same goes for primary pulmonary hypertension, Dr. Isner added. The initial symptom is shortness of breath. Since the condition is so rare that doctors may have never seen it, few would think to do an angiogram -- injecting dye into the arteries -- which is the only definitive test for pulmonary hypertension. In a recent study in France documenting the association between fenfluramine alone or dexfenfluramine and primary pulmonary hypertension, the researchers noted that it took a year, on average, from the onset of symptoms until a correct diagnosis.
Doctors at some medical centers say they are starting to examine fen-phen patients for heart valve problems. "We've called all our patients who were on it," said Dr. Albert Stunkard, an obesity researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who said that the university's obesity center had prescribed the drugs for 20 patients.
But some doctors who enthusiastically prescribe the drugs say they are not worried. "It's stupid to bring patients in for an echocardiogram," Dr. Krentzman said. "That's a very expensive procedure." The risk is not established, he said, adding that none of his patients had experienced problems with the drugs.
Dr. Christian Renna, a doctor with offices in Dallas and in Los Angeles, who says he has prescribed fen-phen for hundreds of patients, said, "I am not worried about the use of these medications." Rather, he said, "I am worried about the public's reaction."
Dr. Hitzig said he simply modified the dose of the medications if people start to have problems, thereby preventing serious ill effects. "Every side effect I've seen, to my current state of knowledge, is an indicator to modify the dose," he said. When it comes to serious problems, he said, "we abort them before they happen."

HEADLINE: Finding Government Profit in Aid to the Arts

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
Government support for the arts in New York State is a low-risk, high-yield investment that in taxes recovers several times its cost and generates billions of dollars in related economic benefits, says a government-commissioned study to be released today.
The study, conducted over the last year by McKinsey & Company at the request of the New York State Council on the Arts and the City of New York's Department of Cultural Affairs, is an admitted attempt to make a case for giving the arts financial help and to counter arguments that such help is elitist and a drain on public funds. 
 It is being released just as support for the arts is under attack in Washington. This month, the House of Representatives voted to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts, then stripped it of $10 million in shutdown costs and rejected a compromise to replace it with block grants to the states. The agency's fate will be decided in negotiations with the Senate and the White House, which are somewhat more sympathetic to Federal money for the arts.
"The idea behind the report is to offer a businessman's approach to this, something that you just could not quarrel with," said Reba White Williams, a member of the state arts council. "If it's returning a great benefit to the state, then you can't argue with it."
The study, titled "You Gotta Have Art," found that $197 million was spent on the arts in 1995 by Federal, state, county and city agencies in New York State, while the arts generated $761 million in taxes, although obviously much of the taxes would have been collected even if government had spent nothing on the arts.
New York City spending on the arts that year was $91 million, while city tax revenues from the arts were $221 million. The report said that $65 million in state support helped generate $480 million in state taxes.
The study was based in part on a report by the Alliance for the Arts, to be released shortly, that concludes that the total economic impact of the arts on New York State in 1995 was $13.4 billion. That figure includes direct spending on the arts, as well as secondary spending on restaurants, parking and other services and the effect of the money circulating through the economy.
A study by the alliance in 1993, covering New York City and its suburbs in New York State and New Jersey, found that the arts had a regional economic impact of $9.8 billion.
"I hope these reports will help both the public and private sector to realize that financial support for the arts is an investment, not a charitable contribution," said Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner. "Hopefully, this is the kind of thing that will put real teeth into our often stated position that the arts are a huge economic engine."
The study being released today was not designed as a guidebook for public investment in the arts. Though it acknowledges that not all spending on the arts has economic benefits, it concentrates on the successes.
Instead, the study is intended to make the case for more money for the arts and to change the terms of the political debate over government spending.
"Frequently, public spending on the arts is viewed as 'support' or 'charity,' for some vague benefits related to the cultural importance of the arts," the study says. "We disagree with this narrow point of view."
Instead, the study concludes, government spending on the arts should be viewed as an investment. More money should be spent on the arts because it is a sound way to spend the public's money, generating taxes, jobs and economic growth far in excess of the amounts invested.
The study, which McKinsey undertook without charge, was based on an analysis of state and local records and field work around the state on the effects of government spending in specific instances.
It concludes that not only has government spending generated economic and social benefits, but that there remains considerable room for growth in the arts.
"We believe that New York State, including New York City and even Manhattan, is substantially unsaturated in terms of both supply of and demand for the arts," the report said. "We believe that there is a large untapped audience for the arts in New York State."
Just over 183,000 people in New York say their primary occupation is artist, about 2 percent of the state labor force. The report estimated that 180,000 to 270,000 people are "nonartistic employees" of arts organizations.
The presence of all of these artists has other benefits, the report said, providing a pool of creative people who can move into commercial sectors, generating business opportunities, increasing real estate values, improving the quality of life and revitalizing cities and neighborhoods.
"I was most excited by some of the case studies, showing how a very small amount of seed money from the government, a little venture capital, revitalized whole communities and neighborhoods," Ms. Williams said.
While state and local support for the arts has risen slightly in New York State in the last two years, the report found that such spending had declined 25 percent since 1990. At the same time, Federal money for the arts in the state fell precipitately, to $10 million in 1996 from $33 million in 1993. Whatever the outcome of the debate in Washington, further cuts are expected.
"We also found a decrease in support from private donors, perhaps out of this concern that the arts are elitist," Ms. Williams said. "We hope this will help convince them to give more."

HEADLINE: Francois Furet, Historian, 70; Studied the French Revolution

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 15

 BODY:
Francois Furet, a prominent historian who challenged the popular Marxist interpretation of the French Revolution and reshaped French thinking about subsequent events, died on Saturday in a hospital in Toulouse. He was 70.
He had received a head injury while playing tennis a few days earlier, his family said. 
 Mr. Furet, who for 12 years had spent each autumn at the University of Chicago as a member of the Committee on Social Thought, was considered one of the most influential French thinkers of the postwar era, a reputation consolidated by the enormous European success of his most recent book, published in 1995, "The History of an Illusion: An Essay on the Idea of Communism in the 20th Century."
But it was his lifelong fascination with the French Revolution and his many books on it that earned him a special place among historians. He won both admirers and critics with his conceptual approach to history, in which he preferred to overlook minute detail in favor of political and philosophical analysis.
This led him first to question and then to undermine the Marxist interpretation of the revolution, which in the 1960's and 70's was still widely taught in French schools and universities. According to this view, which glorified the revolution, an attempt by a rising urban bourgeoisie to overthrow the monarchy led within four years to the Terror and the possibility of a proletarian takeover, although it was later blocked by the bourgeoisie.
Mr. Furet's rejection of this approach in a sense reflected his own experience of the left. Like many intellectuals of his generation, he belonged to the French Communist Party in his 20's but resigned in protest after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. "It was the most intelligent thing I did in my life," he later said.
He challenged what he called the "revolutionary catechism," arguing that democratic ideals existed as early as 1781 and were based less on class struggle than on breaking up the highly centralized power of the state. In this way, he chopped away at revolutionary myths about France that had lasted into this century. "The French Revolution is over," he liked to proclaim.
"Thanks to his talent, his strong opinions and his moral courage, he was the man who changed the revolution in the spirit of intellectuals and eventually in the spirit of all French," Laurent Joffrin wrote today in the left-of-center daily Liberation in an article with the headline, "He Remade the Revolution."
Although frequently denounced as reactionary by the left, Mr. Furet did not embrace the ultraconservative position of French Catholics and monarchists, who came to view the revolution as a precursor of Stalinist totalitarianism. Rather, he took a firmly centrist position on both the Revolution and contemporary politics.
"He was responsible, more than anyone else, for the revival of liberal thinking in France," said Nathan Tarcov, professor of political science at the University of Chicago. "He championed the European concept of liberalism, one that honors democracy, individual rights and a mixed economy. His own work and teaching spanned political theory, history and literature."
Born in Paris on March 27, 1927, into a wealthy family, Mr. Furet was a brilliant student who graduated from the Sorbonne with the highest honors and soon decided on a life of research, teaching and writing. In 1961 he entered the School of Higher Studies of Social Science and was president from 1977 to 1985. Then he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago and became the founding director of the Raymond Aron Institute in Paris.
He was a prolific writer, publishing at least 13 major studies, notably "The French Revolution" (1964), "Interpreting the French Revolution" (1978), "Marx and the French Revolution" (1986), "The Revolution 1770-1880" (1988) and A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution (1988), of which he was co-editor with Mona Ozouf. Many of his books were published in English and were influential in British and American universities.
In March this year, he was elected a member of the Academie Francaise, although he died before he could take his seat. His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Deborah, and two children, Antoine and Charlotte. He was buried on Monday in a private ceremony near his country home in the village of St.-Pierre-Toirac in southern France.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
German Remarks Halt Dollar, But It Climbs Strongly vs. Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
After briefly touching a six-year high, the dollar retreated yesterday against the mark as Germany's Finance Minister called the United States currency's strength excessive. But the dollar rose strongly against the yen on comments from Japan's foreign-exchange policy maker.
The remarks by Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, were surprisingly blunt and suggested the possibility of coordinated intervention by central banks to cap the dollar, which has accelerated on growing doubts about the credibility of the single European currency. 
 Mr. Waigel said the rise in the dollar and the British pound against the mark in recent weeks reflected an "overreaction of markets."
He also reiterated his belief that Germany would meet the euro's strict fiscal standards and said the German Government would have more to say about the mark's exchange rate today.
"I think Waigel pretty effectively put a lid on things," said Jan Alvarez, senior currency dealer at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia.
Still, despite Mr. Waigel's veiled hint of central bank intervention, analysts and traders remained skeptical that such action would occur, limiting the dollar's slide.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8035 marks, the strongest since August 1991 and second consecutive six-year high, before pulling back on Mr. Waigel's remarks to settle at 1.7920 marks in New York, up from 1.7907 on Monday.
The dollar also reached an intraday high of 115.98 yen, the strongest since June 6, before settling in New York at 115.53 yen, up from 114.05 yen on Monday. The pound settled at $1.6779, down from $1.6821.
The dollar strengthened against the yen early in the trading day after Eisuke Sakakibara, the new Vice Finance Minister and Japan's foreign-exchange policy maker, said he did not think that Japan's trade surplus would rise significantly this year and that Japanese surpluses would not aggravate trade frictions.
Mr. Sakakibara's remarks came three days before the United States reports its trade balance for May. Currency traders have been reluctant to push the dollar higher against the yen on fear that Japan's surpluses will continue to grow.

HEADLINE: Nafta Is About Foreign Relations, Not Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The "modest positive effect" of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- reported by the Clinton Administration last week and derided by Representative David E. Bonior (Op-Ed, July 13) -- disappoints only those who believed the Administration's pro-Nafta hyperbole. A modest positive effect, while remarkable given the 1994 peso crisis, is exactly what most economists predicted. 
 Unfortunately, both sides continue to assess Nafta in terms of jobs. As the economist Paul Krugman and others have observed, phasing out our already low tariffs (about 3.5 percent on average) has had little to do with United States employment, which is fundamentally determined by the discount rate. The economy is now at full employment neither because of nor in spite of freer trade with Mexico.
The pact's importance lies in foreign relations, not economics. In this sense, Nafta has already paid dividends: Mexico's recent successful elections show the country is living up to expectations that as a trade partner it play by "first world" rules.

HEADLINE: Resisting Reform in Kenya

 BODY:
Across Africa, people are demanding greater democracy and condemning corrupt governments that cheat them out of economic growth. The latest protests have erupted in Kenya, where the autocratic regime established by Jomo Kenyatta in the 1960's has continued, with deepening corruption, under President Daniel arap Moi since 1978.
Oblivious to Africa's new climate, Mr. Moi has responded, as ever, with brute force. In this he ignores a new sensitivity to democracy among the Western countries he counts on to provide aid and encourage investment and trade. The Clinton Administration and its European partners need to remind Mr. Moi that Kenya risks losing this crucial support if it continues to meet reasonable demands with violent repression. 
 For years Kenya's opposition leaders and human rights activists have braved police beatings, long prison sentences and even death threats to press for broader political rights. Five years ago, after their efforts were backed by a brief suspension of Western aid, Mr. Moi agreed to multiparty elections. He survived that challenge, even though he failed to win a majority of the votes. Opposition divisions and electoral regulations favoring the ruling party preserved his grip on power.
With new elections due this year, opposition groups are campaigning for constitutional changes that would give them a realistic chance of winning. Their efforts have attracted broad public support, and a harsh police response. In the past two weeks, Kenyan police have attacked unarmed demonstrators with guns, clubs, whips and ax handles and invaded the sanctuaries of churches and universities. At least nine protesters have been killed.
Kenya's crisis is an early test for the Clinton Administration's newly declared approach to Africa, unveiled just before last month's economic summit meeting in Denver. The new policy links the extension of investment incentives and other forms of assistance to efforts by recipient countries to increase democracy, combat corruption and extend economic reform.
Other nations represented at Denver are moving in parallel directions. Britain, closely linked to Kenya since colonial times, has a new Labor Government that is emphasizing democracy and human rights issues in its diplomacy. Germany, another large donor, said this week that continued assistance to Kenya would depend on Mr. Moi's respect for "democratic, pluralist and constitutional rules in political debate." One clear lesson from past policy failures in Africa is that far more attention must be given to the internal practices of governments receiving significant Western support. Kenya is a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
A New Hotel Is Out of the Way but Fits Right In

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: MOUNT OLIVE, N.J., July 10

 BODY:
When builders of the Wyndham Garden Hotel here dedicated the structure, they happily reported that occupancy rates in the first few weeks of operation had been unexpectedly high. "In the second week after opening, we had sellouts," said Dave Johnson, senior vice president for operations at the Wyndham Hotel Corporation. "That has not happened before."
This would seem an unlikely location for a hotel, a rural stretch of wooded hill country adjacent to Interstate 80, about 50 miles west of New York City. But it is part of the International Trade Center, a 670-acre business park that is home to companies employing nearly 6,000 people -- about the population of the entire township when I-80 was built here 30 years ago. 
 "The hotel was part of the original master plan," said Leslie E. Smith Jr., executive director of the center. He said businesses located in the center need a place for visitors to stay and the nearest comparable lodgings are in Parsippany, which is about 25 miles away.
Indeed, he said the BASF Group, the German chemical giant, insisted that the center commit to building a hotel before the company would agree to move its North American headquarters here, with about 2,000 employees.
Business travelers have shown up as expected, but what has surprised the developers is the local demand for rooms for out-of-town visitors attending social events, like parties and athletic events. "The local community has taken this place to heart," said Jonathan D. Green, president of the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, a division of the Rockefeller Group, which owns 90 percent of the trade center and the affilated office park.
When the hotel opened for business on June 9, its executives expected to rent no more than 30 rooms, said Carlos Molinet, the hotel's general manager. Instead, more than 60 were occupied. "We had told the companies in the park what our opening date was, and they believed us," he said.
With a weekday room rate of $105 a night, including breakfast, the Wyndham Garden is positioned slightly above a midscale business hotel in the suburban market, Mr. Green said. The developers own the building, which is operated by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.
The hotel, which was built in 12 months, has 141 rooms, including eight suites, in a five-story building. An attached one-story building holds a restaurant, an indoor swimming pool and a meeting room that can hold up to 300 people.
The hotel is the latest amenity added to the trade center, about half of which is reserved for the New Jersey Foreign Trade Zone. The zone is, in effect, a duty-free port connected to the ocean by I-80. Companies operating in the zone are mostly warehouse and light manufacturing operations, while the rest of the center is occupied by office tenants.
Among the companies in the trade center are BMW of North America, Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Lucent Technologies and the Shell Oil Company.
In operation since 1982, the center is about half developed, with 3.5 million square feet of the permitted 7 million square feet of space completed. Most of the buildings are owned by the center and occupied by tenants on long-term leases.
Mr. Smith bought the land where the center is located from a visionary developer named Andrew Clark, who assembled the site in the 1950's when the Interstate System of highways was still in the planning stages. Mr. Clark believed that the highways would promote commerce the way railroads had in the 1800's and that because of them, free ports could easily be located inland. "He knew that Route 80 was going somewhere near here, but he never expected that it would go right through the property as it did," Mr. Smith said.
When Mr. Clark retired, Mr. Smith bought the property and recruited the Rockefeller company as an investor, retaining a 10 percent interest in the project for himself. "I was a local real estate developer who was looking for an international equity partner," he said.
The first tenant, the Seiko Corporation, was signed up in 1982, Mr. Smith said, adding that "15 years and 2 recessions later, we are still together."

HEADLINE: U.N. Renews Censure of New Israeli Housing in East Jerusalem

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 15

 BODY:
For the third time in four months, the General Assembly adopted a resolution today condemning Israel for continuing to build housing in disputed territories.
The resolution asked Israel to identify products produced in those areas, with the intention of calling for a boycott. It also made a vaguely worded but clear threat to Israeli rights within the United Nations. 
 The resolution was approved by a vote of 131 to 3, with 14 abstentions. Only Micronesia voted with Israel and the United States against the resolution.
The action brought immediate criticism from Israeli and American envoys, who accused the General Assembly of reverting to the anti-Israeli crusades of the cold-war era.
"This session represents an approach which threatens to turn the clock back decades, undermining the painstaking efforts of the international community in three vital areas: the work of the United Nations, the work of humanitarian organizations and the work of all those involved in the peace process," said Dore Gold, the new Israeli representative at the United Nations, who arrived in New York this morning and had not yet presented his credentials.
He spoke as a special envoy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Bill Richardson, the American representative, repeated Clinton Administration criticisms of Israeli building of a housing complex called Har Homa on a site in East Jerusalem that Arabs call Jabal Abu Ghneim. But Mr. Richardson said hints of a boycott ran counter to a pledge by Middle Eastern countries to improve economic relations. He called the threat to Israeli membership in the United Nations "a throwback to the ugly credentials challenges of past decades."
In an interview after speaking to the Assembly, Mr. Gold, a scholar of the Middle East and of American strategic interests there, said the Palestinian leadership had always "looked over its shoulder" at the United Nations as a fallback.
"When the issues in the peace process are relatively easier -- Israel withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and Jericho -- and things run relatively smoothly, that's one thing," Mr. Gold said. "As the process becomes more difficult, it can be expected that there will be an attempt by the Palestinians to bring every impasse to the United Nations and to the international community. We believe very strongly that the attempt to build bypass roads away from direct negotiations is doomed to fail."
The issue of Israeli housing construction and the United Nations response has already drawn Secretary General Kofi Annan into a diplomatic impasse and cost him an Israeli rebuff.
Mr. Annan recently proposed sending the head of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs, Kieran Prendergast of Britain, to Israel on a fact-finding mission before submitting a report requested by the Assembly in April.
Israel objected to the plan, which had to be called off. Unable to send a mission, Mr. Annan depended on unnamed sources in the field for information in compiling his report.
In his speech today, Mr. Gold accused United Nations relief agencies of gathering information for the Secretary General in the region in contravention of their assigned tasks.
"U.N. member states support such agencies so they can help refugees and coordinate aid projects," Mr. Gold said. "The use of such assistance and funding for political ends raises serious concerns. It also threatens to harm the cooperation between host states and U.N. agencies, which is essential to their effective functioning."
Mr. Gold also called the Secretary General's report "hostile and one-sided."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Sales Figures Fail to Move Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were flat to slightly higher after yesterday's release of retail sales data for June. The report appeared strong at first, leading investors to sell securities, but after deducting auto sales, the number was less imposing.
June sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent, which was more than expected. But excluding autos, sales were weaker than anticipated. The May sales data were revised downward to a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent, from a drop of a tenth of 1 percent as first reported. A gain of two-tenths of 1 percent was expected. 
 The 30-year bond gained 4/32 , to a price of 101 4/32 , in what many traders said was a dull summer session. The yield was 6.54 percent, down from 6.55 percent on Monday.
"Though retail sales rebounded off weakness in March, April and May, the rise does not suggest the consumer has come back with a vengeance," said Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS.
She said the data were not strong enough to cause the Federal Reserve to act on rates. In fact, she said, almost no one whom her company had surveyed expected a tightening in August, and yesterday's data should not change those opinions.
"With inflation staying tame, the Fed seems to have the luxury of waiting," Ms. Rupert said. "However, the Fed is not completely out of the picture. We and a slight majority of our survey participants expect a September rate hike."
There is some concern that prices of government securities may be topping and that the dollar will run out of steam, causing foreign investors to stem the flow of cash here, which has kept rates lower.
But Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said, "The Federal Reserve System should not view the preliminary June retail sales recovery as being part of anything strong like the strong January-February demand conditions that ultimately triggered a round of Fed tightening of short-term interest rates at the end of March."
Regarding the trading environment, Jack Regan, chief derivatives strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said: "Bonds are at a point where they need something significant -- a statement or economic data that would be so bullish it would take the yield on the long bond through the 6.50 percent level. Meanwhile, we'll be trading in a narrow band of between 6.50 percent and 6.75 percent until inflation is proved to be nonexistent or the fear of its resumption occurs."
This afternoon, the Treasury is to announce the size of next week's two- and five-year note auctions.
"At this juncture, supply does not pose a problem for the market, which up until now has absorbed everything," Mr. Regan said. "One factor that could impact the bond market is if earnings data from equity markets come in on the strong side. This could be another element that could be somewhat disquieting for the fixed-income market."
Also, some investors are skittish about buying securities with so many economic statistics still to come this month. The market consensus for today's report on the Consumer Price Index for June is a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent over all, with the core rate advancing three-tenths of 1 percent. If those numbers are in line with expectations, some investors may turn to the industrial production and capacity utilization report, also scheduled today, for direction.
Another factor is a heavy supply of new corporate issues, as companies take advantage of the environment for low interest rates.
The Chrysler Corporation priced $500 million of 100-year bonds through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers yesterday.
The issue, which is rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's, is callable in 90 years. It was given a 7.40 percent coupon and priced at 99.914 to yield 7.406 percent, about 82 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than the 6.50 percent Treasury bond due in November 2026.

HEADLINE: June Rise Ends 3-Month Retail Sales Slump

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Retailers rang up their first increase in sales in four months during June, the Commerce Department said today, as consumers spent more freely after a spring lull.
Total retail sales increased five-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted $210.3 billion, helped by a surprising pickup in new-car sales. The June rise comes after a revised drop in May of three-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Analysts said that last month's increase reflected a modest revival in consumer demand, enough to fuel continued economic growth but not enough to fan fears of inflationary price rises that might cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an effort to slow the economy.
"It's not explosive by any means," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "But as the weather warmed, consumers' spending propensities seemed to warm as well."
May sales were originally reported to have been down one-tenth of a percent, while April sales, previously reported to have fallen nine-tenths of a percent, instead dropped a revised 1.1 percent. March sales fell three-tenths of a percent.
The Commerce Department said that June sales by new-car dealers climbed 1.1 percent after a 1.2 percent decline in May. That was a surprise because auto makers had earlier reported feeble June sales and that weakness had been expected to be a drag on overall retail business.
Analysts said dealers might have been selling cars from their inventories in June; some of the car makers themselves were hurt by strikes that held down production earlier this year.
Even without automobiles, the overall trend in retail sales was firm in June. Excluding new cars, retail sales rose a relatively modest three-tenths of a percent, after being flat in May and declining six-tenths of a percent in April.
Sales of all types of durable goods, from cars to refrigerators and furniture, rose five-tenths of a percent, to $85.1 billion, after a drop of nine-tenths of a percent in May. Sales of nondurables, like food and clothing, were up four-tenths of a percent last month, to $125.2 billion, after rising one-tenth of a percent in May.
"The modest rise in June retail sales suggests that the slump in household spending may have ended and consumption expenditures are rising at a moderate pace as the economy heads into the third quarter," said Joel Naroff, an economist in Philadelphia for the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.
Sales by general merchandise stores rose eight-tenths of a percent, to $27.5 billion, after a gain of five-tenths of a percent in May. At apparel stores, clothing sales were flat in June, at $9.6 billion, but that was after a sturdy 1.2 percent jump in May.
Strong job growth and rising incomes are widely expected to lead to a further recovery in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of national economic activity.
"The extent of the rebound will be the key in determining Federal Reserve policy," Mr. Naroff said. The Fed last raised short-term interest rates, by a quarter of a percentage point, on March 25.
The central bank's policy-making committee is next scheduled to meet Aug. 19. The Fed held rates steady at its last two policy-setting sessions, in May and this month, amid signs that inflation remained muted.

HEADLINE: Centrist Democrats Give Warm Welcome to Mayor

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The 25 prominent centrist Democrats who gathered at a midtown conference room for lunch yesterday had no interest in meeting any of the bona fide Democrats running for mayor. Instead, they lavished a warm reception on the one Republican in the race -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- even calling him a "first cousin" to a Bill Clinton Democrat.
With admiration in their eyes, the trustees of the Progressive Policy Institute, the think tank of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council that President Clinton helped found, nodded appreciatively as Mr. Giuliani told them how many people he had removed from welfare rolls and how far crime had fallen. They asked how long it would be before he gained full control of the schools, and why the city did not understand his ideas about promoting sports franchises. 
 And if there was an actual partisan mayoral race going on somewhere in the distance, they did their best to ignore it.
"This was not about the Mayor's re-election; this was about talking to one of the real innovators in public office," said Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, which, in the view of many New York Democrats, is not centrist, but right of center. "The principles that he enunciated today were very reflective of the New Democratic philosophy. The concept of mutual responsibility he talked about is at the core of what we think the new social compact should be, almost in exactly the terms that he described it."
What the Mayor had talked about was one of his favorite topics: the need for citizens who receive government benefits to give something back to society in exchange, as in his workfare program, the country's largest. It is similar to the philosophy that helped get President Clinton elected and re-elected, but it is not a major plank of any of the Democrats running against the Mayor, who have mostly focused on what they say are the inequities in the workfare program, and Mr. Giuliani's difficulty connecting with those at the lower end of the economic spectrum.
As a result, none of those candidates, including Ruth W. Messinger, who is considered the front-runner, have generated any interest within this wing of their own party, which has always been far more influential at a national level than it has been at the state or city level.
"Ruth's failure to move to the center has cost her the support of national Democrats who see Giuliani as a Clintonlike leader," said Fred Siegel, a fellow at the institute and a professor at Cooper Union, who attended yesterday's luncheon.
Ms. Messinger has actually tried to move a bit away from her base in the party's left wing, accepting the idea of workfare even as she argues against Mr. Giuliani's version of it, making overtures to business groups, favoring certain tax cuts. But the Mayor's successful romance with the Clinton wing of the party -- in which his halfhearted endorsement of Bob Dole last year was forgiven -- dramatized the difficulty that she and the other Democrats will have in redefining Mr. Giuliani away from the ideological middle.
Mr. From's group, for example, has been active in making the Democratic Party take a tougher stand on law enforcement issues, backing Mr. Clinton in signing a major crime bill in his first term, and reduced crime rates have been Mr. Giuliani's most highly touted achievement. It has strongly supported a work requirement for welfare recipients, demonstrated in Mr. Clinton's signing of the welfare law last year, and workfare is the program that the Mayor says is actually his most important change to the city's culture.
In his remarks yesterday, in fact, he even found a way to tie the two issues together. "The reason I believe that crime has continued to decline beyond levels that I thought were possible is that massive movement of 265,000 people who used to be dependent on the government who are now finding ways to take care of themselves," he said, without fully explaining how one issue affects the other. "That really transformed the community. That, I think, is the most exciting change we've made."
The Democratic candidates did not seem terribly surprised that they were not invited to attend.
"Obviously, we disagree with Mr. From's analysis," said Leland T. Jones, the spokesman for Ms. Messinger. "We would just hope that as we move through this election, he and his colleagues at the D.L.C. keep an open mind as we make our argument and present our critique."
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who is also vying to be the Democrat to challenge Mr. Giuliani, said that the moderate Democrats he described as "Demo-publicans" had long ago migrated to Mr. Giuliani's camp and that his base was the only hope of unseating Mayor Giuliani.

HEADLINE: KPMG Abused Its Relationship With Audit Client, Judge Rules

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
A New York judge ruled yesterday that KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, had abused its relationship with one of its audit clients. The suit, brought by Stern Stewart & Company, a New York consulting firm, accused KPMG of using its position as the firm's long-term auditor and tax accountant to create a rival business.
The case illustrates the kind of conflicts that arise when accounting firms venture outside their traditional lines of business. KPMG had served as Stern Stewart's accountant for more than a decade before setting up a unit that offered the same kind of economic analysis conducted by Stern Stewart. That firm learned of KPMG's actions after KPMG had created the unit and hired a number of Stern Stewart's employees. 
 "At bottom, the claim is that a fiduciary, learning of a profitable area of economic practice, acted in violation of its fiduciary obligations," Justice Diane A. Ledebeff of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan said in her ruling. "A fiduciary is not entitled to engage in an actual secretive competitive venture when still in the embrace of an active relationship with a principal. The court finds that Peat Marwick's conduct violated these principles."
Noting that KPMG "had access to a large number of Stern Stewart's confidential documents including financial statements and employee information," the judge found that the accounting firm demonstrated "an absolute assurance" that this area of economic consulting had a potential for "explosive' growth." That assurance of the unit's profitability, Justice Ledebeff said, "ominously bespeaks of inside knowledge."
The court awarded no actual damages in the lawsuit, although a separate trial may look into the possibility of punitive damages.
G. Bennett Stewart 3d, senior partner for Stern Stewart, applauded the court's ruling. "There are ethical boundaries within which accounting firms should be operating," he said.
The lawsuit aside, the situation with KPMG suggests the profession needs to take a closer look at how firms handle possible conflicts with their clients, said Arthur W. Bowman, the editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, an industry newsletter in Atlanta. KPMG "should have resigned from the engagement," he said.
KPMG maintains that it had no fiduciary relationship with Stern Stewart but merely a professional one. "We are always sensitive to business-client issues," said George Ledwith, a KPMG spokesman, and KPMG regrets "any misunderstanding" between it and its former client.
Stern Stewart had also accused KPMG of misappropriating trade secrets, unfair competition, stealing key employees and inducing those employees to breach confidentiality agreements and other contractual obligations. The court rejected those claims.
"We are generally pleased with the outcome," Mr. Ledwith said. "The court has rejected all the claims against individuals and all but one against KPMG."

HEADLINE: CAPITOL SKETCHBOOK;
Campaign Finance Labyrinth Is Obvious, If Not Clear

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The moment was more graphic than revealing: On a day when the Republican Senate majority was determined to portray interlocking intrigues between the Riady family's holdings in the Lippo conglomerate and the business interests of China, a chart was brought forth, seven feet square, to dwarf all previous offerings in what has become a sub-battle of graphics at the campaign finance hearing.
The chart, reputedly depicting the growing involvement of the Lippo Group's global interests with Chinese joint ventures, was a massive web-like display of scores of intersecting lines radiating out from a tiny red Chinese flag. The lines connected to dozens of tiny green squares identified in minuscule printing as businesses like the Beijing Tati Turbo Dragon Real Estate Company. 
Senators walked up to the chart squinting in puzzlement.
"Is this supposed to be an orbital track?" asked Senator John Glenn, the former astronaut and ranking Democrat in the Senate inquiry into campaign financing abuses. Mr. Glenn, of Ohio, seemed delighted at the sheer incomprehensibility of the exhibit. "I'm a Cancer. Where do I fit in?" he asked, shifting to astrology as a possible explanation.
"It's Nancy Reagan's star chart," a photographer agreed, frustrated in trying to make anything graphically usable of a Lippo-Beijing universe to rival the Milky Way.
Within minutes, the Democrats had their own far simpler graphic on the easel, displaying the day's two key vectors -- the overlapping Lippo and China business ambitions. But in this graphic there was a smiling third partner, Pat Robertson, the Christian fundamentalist broadcaster who is dear to many Republicans and who had a broadcasting interest in China that he sold this year.
A whiff of laughter ensued, the same as for an earlier mention that the Riady family, whose ubiquitous Lippo holdings extend back to Little Rock and President Clinton's days as Arkansas Governor, owned a house in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. This laughter was offered in recognition of the fact that even on a day devoted to tracking the arcana of the Lippo Group, there seemed no way in modern American culture not to encounter coincidental notions of O. J. Simpson and his troubles in Brentwood.
The Democrats did show an unequivocal moment of retreat today when they conceded that a 1992 contribution of $50,000 to the Democratic National Committee arranged by John Huang, the devoted Clinton fund-raiser and former Lippo executive, appeared to have been covered illegally by a bank wire from overseas Lippo interests. "It certainly looks like the movement of foreign money to an American campaign," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
Even so, for much of the day the Democrats were in the odd position of defending the interests of the absent Riadys and other Lippo principals in the face of Republican curiosity about $800,000 in Democratic contributions from small-scale, barely profitable Lippo interests.
Democratic senators countered that Lippo business ventures seemed legitimate and that most of their contributions seemed legal. A former Lippo Bank executive, Harold Arthur, insisted that the sizable donations had nothing to do with seeking Government favors but rather were the result of a long friendship between James Riady, a Lippo principal, and Mr. Clinton.
If nothing else, the Lippo-China graphic bore out the caution heard in earlier testimony that the hardest thing to track in big-money politics is the ultimate source of campaign donations from the American subsidiaries of global corporations.
For his part, Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the hearings, patiently kept to tracking Mr. Huang's role in this sprawling sphere. He gratefully hailed a former Lippo employee who testified as one of the "few people who worked at Lippo who remained in the United States."
Back on the graphics front, a Republican floor plan of the executive offices at Lippo Bank of California showed Mr. Huang's space occupied by a literally shadowy figure -- a silhouette of a man vaguely reminiscent of a Pink Panther cartoon character. To the Republicans' charge that Mr. Huang may have been a political and economic spy for China and the Lippo interests, Mr. Arthur, chairman of the bank's board of directors, politely replied, "Hogwash."
During a break in the hearing, Senators Glenn and Lieberman released a printed statement to try to deal with the overarching Republican charge in pursuing Mr. Huang: that the Chinese Government had an ongoing plan to infiltrate American elections and influence Administration policy. They said intelligence information "strongly suggests" that the Chinese Government did have a plan "containing components that are both legal and illegal" to influence Congressional elections, but not the Presidency.
"It is not clear from the evidence that the illegal aspects of such a plan were ever put into motion," they carefully added.
As the second week of hearings maintained what Republicans term their mosaic approach of bit-by-bit progress, one Democrat conceded privately that this was his party's week for "the fetal position" of having to concede some points.
Still, the proceeding is nowhere near what politicians in both parties fear as the "mutual assured destruction" stage -- a cross assault by senator on senator, disclosing each other's questionable campaign initiatives in the era of big-money fund-raising personified by Mr. Huang.

HEADLINE: Koreans Place Kia Motors Under Bankruptcy Shield

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 15

 BODY:
The Kia Motors Corporation, one of South Korea's leading car manufacturers, was effectively placed under bankruptcy protection today, as Korean banks announced emergency financial assistance to the debt-ridden company and many of its subsidiaries.
The Kia group of companies, centered on Kia Motors, is the fourth of the nation's top 30 conglomerates -- and the biggest so far -- to collapse or nearly collapse since the beginning of the year. The failures have weakened South Korea's financial system and raised alarm about the mountains of debt that many Korean industrial giants have accumulated in their race to expand. 
 Kia's difficulties are also a signal of problems, and perhaps of a consolidation, in the South Korean automobile industry. The big three Korean auto makers -- Hyundai, Kia and the Daewoo Motor Company, part of the Daewoo Corporation -- have created more capacity than is needed for the once-rapidly growing domestic market, intensifying pressure on the auto makers to increase exports. Adding to the pressure are plans by the giant Samsung Group to begin selling cars next year.
South Korea manufactured 2.81 million cars last year, and its auto makers are planning to increase annual production to 6 million cars in four years. Only 1.65 million cars were sold domestically in 1996.
Kia's export effort in the United States has been gradual, beginning three years ago with its Sephia sedan and the Sportage sport utility vehicle. Kia models are sold in Western, Southern and mid-Atlantic states, and the company plans to open dealerships in the New York area late this summer. Kia Motors America said today that "the steps being taken in Korea have no immediate impact on the operation of Kia in the United States."
[On Wednesday morning, the Kia group said in Seoul that it would sell 1.9 trillion won, or about $2.1 billion, in land and other assets to raise cash and would reduce its work force of 56,000 by 4,300. In addition, half of the group's 28 companies will be sold or merged, reducing the number of concerns to 14.
[In stock trading early Wednesday, the Korean composite index was down nearly 2 percent; since the first of the year, it is up 14 percent.]
Until last month, Kia was manufacturing and shipping to the United States a small car sold as the Ford Aspire.
The Korean producer's troubles are a setback for the Ford Motor Company, which owns 9.4 percent of Kia Motors. Ford is already trying to revive Mazda, the Japanese producer of which Ford owns 33 percent; Mazda, in turn, owns 7.5 percent of Kia.
Today, Ford officials played down the effects from Kia's problems. "To the extent it appears Kia will continue production, the vehicles we receive from them should continue," a Ford spokesman, John Spelich, said. Ford continues to sell a Kia-manufactured Festiva model, a car that resembles the Aspire, in Taiwan, Thailand and Australia.
The troubles at Kia could increase pressure in South Korea -- which imported only 10,315 cars last year -- to keep its home market virtually closed to foreign cars. Trade groups of American and European makers are in Seoul pushing to open markets.
Kia did not declare bankruptcy. Rather, it was designated for rescue today under a plan announced in April by South Korean banks that was created to prevent more big companies from failing. Kia will be allowed to continue operations, to temporarily forgo debt repayments and even to receive new loans while it works on a restructuring plan over the next two months.
In South Korea, though, being designated for protection from bankruptcy carries the same stigma as bankruptcy itself. Kia said today that it had not asked for such protection.
Jeun Sang Jin, a spokesman for Kia Motors in Seoul, said that the company thought that its debts were not unusually large by Korean standards and that the company "can get back on track again in two months."
The Kia group, the nation's eighth-largest conglomerate, has debts of 9.54 trillion won, or $10.7 billion. That approaches twice the nearly $6 billion in debt of Hanbo Steel when it collapsed in January.
Hanbo's collapse, which precipitated a political corruption scandal, was followed by that of the Sammi Steel, a smaller producer. Jinro, the 19th-largest conglomerate, was given help under the banks' plan, as was the Dainong Group.
Korean banks have long served as unofficial arms of the Government, extending credit to the conglomerates, to fuel the nation's export-driven economic development. But the companies often expanded recklessly and the banks loans' turned sour. Particularly hard hit has been the Korea First Bank, which is owed about $900 million by Kia and was also the leading creditor of Hanbo.
Kia had been looked upon as different from most of the conglomerates because it focuses mainly on one business, and has professional, not family management. But its smaller size has perhaps hurt it in competing against the larger and far more diversified Hyundai and Daewoo.
Still, the subsidiaries it does have are what hurt Kia. While Kia Motors had a small net profit of $8.3 million on sales of $7.8 billion last year, the entire group lost more than $140 million. A big problem is Asia Motors, a truck manufacturer that nearly defaulted on debt payments last month.
Kia has been rumored to be a takeover target for the Samsung Group, which already owns 6 percent. An acquisition of Kia would give Samsung instant market presence as it prepares to begin selling cars. Perhaps to keep Kia out of Samsung's hands, the Hyundai and Daewoo groups have been buying Kia's convertible bonds.

HEADLINE: Lilco Deal Seems Set as Silver Backs Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 15

 BODY:
The $7.3 billion partial state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company appears likely to win final state approval on Wednesday, after Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said today that he would vote for it if certain conditions were met.
Mr. Silver said that before he could agree to the plan at Wednesday's meeting of the state Public Authorities Control Board, there must be a guarantee that the buyout would actually produce the double-digit reductions in electric rates that Gov. George E. Pataki had promised. Some of the Speaker's other demands concern increasing competition among power retailers, which could lower rates further. 
 "We're looking at the conditions and we're hopeful that they can all be met to his satisfaction by tomorrow morning so that the vote can go forward," said Mr. Pataki, the sponsor of the plan. Officials at Lilco, which is planning to merge with Brooklyn Union Gas Company, also expressed optimism that Mr. Silver's concerns could be addressed.
The takeover contract requires unanimous approval by the three-member control board. It must also be approved by several Federal agencies, and hinges in part on whether the Internal Revenue Service will waive a $2 billion capital gains tax bill that Lilco would otherwise owe on the deal.
In another area of state energy policy, the Legislature approved a bill today to triple the size of a program that provides low-cost power to businesses as an incentive to keep them from leaving the state. The measure would make 400 megawatts of power, the output of a medium-size power plant, available at less than half the market price, in addition to 200 megawatts the program already provides. The bill imposed no pollution standards on the power production, so some of it could come from the state's dirtiest plants, a feature that angered environmentalists.
Mr. Pataki's Lilco plan has met with opposition from consumer advocates, some business groups and politicians of both parties. They contend that it would pay Lilco too much for its assets, saddling consumers with high costs for the next three decades. Mr. Silver's decision to back the plan, first reported today in Newsday, is a boost for the Governor, who had invested considerable effort in it.
"It's a difficult decision, in that a lot of the criticisms of the plan are accurate," said the Speaker, a Manhattan Democrat. Still, he said, the Governor's plan appears to be the only way to cut deeply into electric bills that are the highest in the continental United States.
Lilco customers are still paying heavily for the never-used, $6.5 billion Shoreham nuclear plant. The administration contends that the state cannot force Lilco to absorb more costs, and that any attempt to do so would be tied up in court for years.
Mr. Silver said that he thought the state could legally make Lilco bear some of the costs, but that that was not one of his demands. When asked why, he said the state needed to act quickly to gain the Federal tax waiver, whose savings would be passed on to consumers. The Federal agency is expected to make such waivers impossible in the future.
Gordian Raacke, executive director of the court-appointed Citizens Advisory Panel to Lilco, said he liked Mr. Silver's conditions but was disappointed that he had not insisted that Lilco continue to pay for Shoreham.
Some consumer advocates said they thought the takeover would be challenged in court, on environmental and other grounds.
The deal would leave Lilco with $1.9 billion in cash, and Mr. Silver said he wanted a commitment that about half of it would be invested on Long Island in ways that would improve the local economy and foster competition, perhaps through the development of the island's limited gas distribution system. He also called for steps to allow power companies from outside the region to compete directly for consumers' business.

HEADLINE: Costs of Tobacco Accord Take Center Stage

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials and cigarette industry representatives met to review the proposed tobacco settlement together for the first time today, and the topic on the table was money.
Lawyers representing the major cigarette makers said that they were willing to pay a high price to win reprieve from the legal and political threats they now face but that further financial demands could drive them into bankruptcy. 
 Government officials responded by saying they would not recommend approval of a deal unless it included sufficiently harsh penalties to insure that the tobacco companies would drive down smoking by teen-agers through drastic changes in marketing and advertising practices.
Administration officials also began publicly raising questions about the tax deductibility of the industry's payments, which would result in a drain of roughly $100 billion on the Federal Treasury over 25 years. Most of the money in the $368.5 billion settlement proposal would go to the 39 states that have sued the industry to recover smoking-related Medicaid costs, and to plaintiffs seeking individual damage payments.
The meetings' participants, using terms usually reserved for high-level diplomatic encounters, later described the session, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, as "businesslike" and "candid."
Both sides indicated that they hoped it would be the first of a number of meetings, as the Administration seeks to convert the settlement proposal into a document that the President can present to Congress and the American people as a solution to the decades-long tobacco wars.
Emerging from the 90-minute meeting, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said one crucial question arising from the tobacco accord was "who pays, and how it affects the budget of the United States."
Dr. Shalala noted that while it was "standard business practice" to deduct the cost of legal settlements from earnings for tax purposes, the size and scope of the tobacco accord, and its implications for the Federal budget, were unprecedented.
The tobacco representatives, led by J. Phil Carlton, a North Carolina lawyer representing the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, were uncommunicative after leaving the meeting.
Mr. Carlton said only that his team had explained the settlement "in its present form" and had answered questions from Ms. Shalala and the White House domestic policy chief, Bruce Reed, who are coordinating the Administration's review of the accord.
Mr. Carlton declined further comment as a throng of reporters pursued him down the White House driveway.
The industry was also represented by Meyer G. Koplow of the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Jane Hickie of the Washington firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, and D. Scott Wise of the New York firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell.
The Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management and Budget are studying the proposal to gauge its fiscal impact as well as its effects on the financial health of cigarette makers and tobacco growers and the economies of tobacco states.
An Administration official involved in the settlement review, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that because the settlement as currently written allowed for the tobacco industry's costs to be deductible, it essentially provided for a huge subsidy for the states' Medicaid accounts, paid for by Federal taxpayers.
This official added that while the companies had signaled some flexibility on the taxation issue, they were likely to balk at any significant increase in the overall cost of the settlement.
Dr. Shalala said the tobacco representatives had given no sign of how willing they were to accept changes in the agreement, which was negotiated over 12 weeks by state attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers and industry representatives.
"They established no line," the Secretary said. "They didn't turn us up or turn us down."

Good News Is Big News

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Those of us whose job it is to view the world through alarm-colored glasses are having a very tough summer. The good news keeps piling up.
The dollar is strengthening against the franc and mark because the Europeans can't get their act together and we did our downsizing years ago. That means a bottle of wine, as well as imported still water, is tantalizingly cheaper for Americans. 
 Epidemics are coming under control and welfare rolls are shrinking. The Food and Drug Administration bureaucracy snapped out of its lethargy long enough to approve an anti-plaque dentifrice that enables modern mothers to wash their kids' mouths out with soap. Meanwhile, a potency potion on the horizon for both sexes is getting the geezer generation all excited.
Peace is breaking out all over the world. War criminals are belatedly being given a hard time -- resist arrest and make my day -- while political reformers from Mexico City to Moscow are riding high. Astronomers with roving eyes are thinking of renaming planets (Mars is too warlike, Venus sexist).
Economics, which Thomas Carlyle dubbed "the dismal science," is now the delirious science. Inflation is a spent balloon and unemployment a relative joke. The Euphoria Index (new-job creation plus productivity gains multiplied by the percentage rise in consumer confidence) is making new highs every day.
Which brings us to the stock market. A few years ago executives had to rent the Glomar Explorer to observe their companies' stock options, but now they're up here drying in the warm sunshine of runaway prosperity. Who would have thought that lowering the capital gains tax would become a populist issue -- with the populists in favor?
Such a happy combination of peace, progress and prosperity is not without its downside. It has driven professional pessimists -- "prophets of gloom and doom" and "troubadours of trouble" who see the tank half-empty -- into disarray.
Wall Street bears are stuffed and hung on the wall. The Union of Concerned Scientists' clock has been wound back to two minutes past noon. As catastrophists in every field suffer their worst disaster, Gloomy Gus has become a laughingstock.
In journalism, too, naysayers are in a rout. Upbeat reporters focus on the ho-hum reaction rather than the underlying action and cover the coverage rather than advance the story. Headline writers of ordinarily objective newspapers airily declare investigations into wrongdoing to be "irrelevant." Sight-bite newsmaggies declare Senate hearings not geared to a one-week attention span or seven-second sound nibble to be "not ready for prime time."
All this goes right to the top and is reflected in opinion polls. As we laissez les bons temps rouler, the President of the U.S., Reno-loose and fancy-Freeh, rides this wave of national positivism and worldwide well-being to new crests of popularity.
What's missing? What element does the nation need to give sharp definition to the picture of unrelieved optimism -- to remind good pilgrims that the Man with the Muckrake, his gaze eternally cast downward, fails to see the glorious celestial crown offered to him?
Needed at this moment is a contrarian. No garden party is complete without its skunk. Who will volunteer to click on the icon of the iconoclast, to provide the partying populace with the low mutter of a jeremiad, to be the happy society's scapegoat for the sin of negativism, to present a target to be hooted at with universal glee?
I volunteer. Here I stand scruffily in sandwich boards, proclaiming my deviant doctrine.
You see this article in Foreign Affairs titled "The End of the Business Cycle?" and assuring babyboomers no babybust is ahead? I say hogwash. You're going to see a correction one of these days that will curl your hair, followed by a year in the doldrums before the next recovery. Those of us now conservatively 5 percent in cash will laugh.
Count on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as an entry in the Belmont Stakes, computer crashing on Millennium Morning, and the unexpected social consequences of the geezer-sex pill. Brace yourself for the dreary data in indictments handed up on Hubbell and Hillary followed by the Great Popularity Plunge.
All this loathed melancholy do I provide as a summertime public service. Repent! The end is near.

HEADLINE: White House Begins Push for New Global Warming Pact

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
After tinkering with computer models for more than a year, the Clinton Administration predicted today that measures to combat the growth of global warming by limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat from the sun would have a far less dramatic effect on the economy than had been projected by industries opposed to restraints on energy use.
The Administration's analysis opens what is expected to be a long campaign between now and the end of the year, when international negotiations are scheduled to conclude in Kyoto, Japan, to build support for a proposed binding treaty to limit the emissions of those kinds of gases. 
 Any measures to reverse the steady growth in such emissions, mostly given off by burning fossil fuels to operate cars and generate electricity and heat, would probably involve the biggest Federal intervention in energy markets since oil-exporting countries raised oil prices substantially in the 1970's.
But the Administration's computer models suggested that the economic side effects would be only half as severe as those projected in a recent study by economists at Charles River Associates for the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group for fuel producers.
Critics who say the Administration is moving too fast on global warming have warned that mines and factories would close, inflation would rise and productivity would fall. But another school of thought holds that energy conservation can pay for itself and that new technologies can be found, offering major economic gains, not to mention the benefits of limiting global warming and its potentially serious effects.
As the Administration tries to decide how fast and how far to cut those gas emissions, the question of the treaty's economic effect is being asked with increasing urgency in Congress, which has ultimate authority over the country's energy policy. In addition, any treaty would have to be submitted to the Senate for ratification.
In a staff paper released today, the White House said tough action on such gas emissions might, over the next few decades, shave a fraction of a percent from the nation's economic growth, followed by a recovery -- or might, if implemented cleverly, have a barely discernible effect or even a net economic benefit.
"It just boils down to this," Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said at a hearing of the House Commerce committee. "If we do it dumb, it could cost a lot, but if we do it smart, it will cost much less, and indeed could produce net benefits in the long run."
Ms. Yellen's comments were met with skepticism from both the ranking Republican and Democrat on the committee, and by many junior members of the panel as well.
"Unfortunately, in the area of global climate change, the Administration has not yet presented a persuasive case," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who heads the chairman.
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, treated Ms. Yellen and Timothy Wirth, the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, to a sometimes blistering questioning.
Mr. Dingell, whose district is a prime manufacturer of automobiles, said the analysis suggested "huge economic constraints" on American businesses.
According to the Administration's projections, Mr. Dingell said, stabilizing emissions at their 1990 levels by 2010 would require steps equivalent to charging about $100 for every ton of carbon emitted when a fossil fuel is burned. That would be like raising the tax on gasoline of about 26 cents a gallon, a tax on electricity of 2 cents per kilowatt hour, a tax on coal of $52.52 per ton, and a tax on natural gas of $1.49 per thousand cubic feet.
But, Administration officials said, the projections are put in terms of taxes merely because that is the easiest way for economists to model things that are even more complex than the tax code.
Nobody seriously expects the White House to propose a big increase in the gasoline tax.
The White House supports a treaty that would bind the United States and other developed countries to significant reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, leaving each country to decide how it wanted to do so.

Russia Requests U.S. Help In Repairing Space Station
The head of the Russian Space Agency proposed that the American astronaut Michael Foale participate in a tricky space walk to repair the stricken Mir space station. The Russian commander has been judged unable to carry out the job because of heart irregularities. NASA officials said they needed to be persuaded of the urgency of the repair before they would allow Mr. Foale to take on the potentially risky mission. A1
 
Arrest Plan Dropped in Bosnia
Plans to capture several prominent Bosnian Serb figures wanted for war crimes from their capital at Pale were abandoned when France declined to join the NATO operation, senior American officials said. Pale is in the French sector, and is the headquarters of the former Bosnian Serb president, Radovan Karadzic, and the former military commander, Ratko Mladic, both of whom have been charged with war crimes.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Is Told Huang Kept Ties to Company Linked to China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
John Huang, the offstage protagonist of the Senate hearings on campaign finance practices, was depicted today as the highly paid agent of an international conglomerate that has close ties to the Chinese Government and a record of generous contributions to the Democratic Party.
During the time Mr. Huang worked at the Commerce Department and the Democratic National Committee, the Senators were told, he retained his ties to his former employer, the Lippo Group, an international financial holding company based in Indonesia. 
 On its fourth day of hearings, the Senate Government and Oversight Committee produced what appeared to be its first direct evidence of a foreign political contribution -- a memo in which Mr. Huang asked the Indonesian conglomerate that he worked for in 1992 to "please kindly wire" money to cover several expenses, including a $50,000 donation to the Democratic Party. Mr. Huang ultimately raised $1.6 million in donations for the 1996 campaign that later had to be returned because it came from suspect sources.
Lippo, according to a witness, Thomas R. Hampson, who specializes in international business operations, has evolved in the last few years from being a family-owned enterprise to what he said was essentially a joint venture with the Chinese Government. Mr. Hampson was hired by the committee to provide information on the Lippo Group. He was one of three witnesses who appeared before the committee today to testify about Lippo.
"The significance," said Senator Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who is the chairman of the committee, "is that apparently both Mr. Huang and Lippo were perfectly willing and adept at putting illegal money into the United States."
On the question of Chinese involvement in American political affairs, two Democratic Senators, John Glenn of Ohio and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said today that material they had seen in a Federal Bureau of Investigation briefing on Monday left little doubt that the Chinese had a plan to influence Congressional elections. But they added that they saw no indication that the plan had been put into effect or that it had involved the Presidential race.
The significance of the evidence being heard by the committee has been hotly debated ever since Mr. Thompson opened the hearings last week by saying that the Chinese had plotted to give money to influence last year's elections, including the Presidential campaign.
Democrats have said Mr. Thompson vastly overstated the case.
The evidence presented at today's session included these points:
*After President Clinton took office and while Mr. Huang was still at Lippo, he visited the White House 52 times.
*During the period he was working in the Commerce Department, Mr. Huang made hundreds of calls to various Lippo entities.
*In April 1996, when he was on the Democratic payroll, Mr. Huang was registered at a World Bank seminar as a representative of Lippo.
While none of these pieces of evidence are by themselves eye-popping, the Republicans who are conducting the investigation see them as building blocks in the case they are trying to make that the Chinese Government tried to influence the 1996 election campaign in the United States by funneling money to Democrats and that Mr. Huang was instrumental in this enterprise.
Mr. Huang has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against forced self-incrimination and has refused to appear before the committee. Members of the Riady family, the principal owners of Lippo and longtime patrons of Mr. Clinton, and many other people who worked with Mr. Huang at Lippo are in Indonesia and have refused to cooperate with Congressional investigators.
To tie the Lippo enterprises to China, the committee heard testimony from Mr. Hampson, president of Search International, which conducts research into the operations of international businesses.
Mr. Hampson said that in the last few years the Lippo Group had "shifted its strategic center" from Indonesia to China, and that much of the conglomerate's business now involved joint ventures with China Resources, a company wholly owned by the Chinese Government.
"China Resources also has a more geopolitical purpose," he said. "It is well established in the public record that the Government of the People's Republic of China uses China Resources as an agent of espionage -- economic, military and political."
The company, Mr. Hampson continued, "is kind of like a smiling tiger; it might look friendly, but it's very dangerous."
Under questioning from Democrats, however, he conceded that he did not know whether Chinese money was part of Lippo's enterprises in the United States or whether China Resources had any activities in this country.
Documents the committee released showed that Mr. Huang was handsomely paid by Lippo, with a salary of about $90,000 a year and annual bonuses of about $230,000. When he left Lippo in 1994 to join the Clinton Administration, he was given severance pay of more than $450,000, a figure that included the book value of the company car he was allowed to keep, a 1988 Mercedes Benz.
Among the material disclosed today were a $50,000 check sent to the Democratic National Committee in 1992 by Hip Hing Holdings, a Lippo affiliate in California where Mr. Huang worked, and a memorandum from Mr. Huang to the company's headquarters in Indonesia asking for reimbursement for the donation.
Senator Lieberman said this "certainly looks like the movement of foreign money into an American campaign in 1992."
While donations to political parties by American subsidiaries of foreign companies are legal, the contributions must come from money made in the United States.
Because James T. Riady, one of Lippo's principals, lived in the United States in the early 1990's, the family could legally donate to American political campaigns, and documents produced today showed that as much as $800,000 was given from 1992 through 1994 to the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party in several states.
Senator Lieberman asked one witness, Harold Arthur, a former chief executive officer and now chairman of Lippo Bank in California, a bank owned by James Riady, why the Riady family was so generous.
"Friendship," Mr. Arthur replied. "I know that James Riady became closely acquainted with the then-Governor Clinton, and they developed a personal friendship."
Senator Lieberman asked for Mr. Arthur's reaction to assertions that Mr. Huang was a spy for either the Lippo Group or China.
"Hogwash," Mr. Arthur answered.
Although they were associates for years, Mr. Arthur said he did not know exactly what work Mr. Huang performed for the Lippo enterprises.
Whatever Mr. Huang did, the evidence indicated that he had a close relationship with the Clinton White House. He went there 52 times from January 1993 to June 1994, and five of the visits were to Mr. Clinton's private quarters.
After Mr. Huang went to the Commerce Department in 1994 as Deputy Assistant Secretary for international economic policy, Mr. Huang kept in touch with his former employer.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said records showed that Mr. Huang telephoned Lippo entities as many as 400 times after he went to the Commerce Department.
Democrats maintained that he made many of those calls simply to get messages that had been left by people who did not know that he no longer worked at Lippo.
One of the most intriguing documents was a registration form to the World Bank's International Finance Corporation Conference in April 1996, several months after Mr. Huang had left the Commerce Department to become the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser among Asian-Americans.
The typed form showed that Mr. Huang had registered at the conference, listing his employment as "Lippo Group," his address as that of the Lippo Bank in Los Angeles and his position as "adviser."
There was no evidence of who filled out the form.

Man Convicted of Killing His Wife, a Police Officer

 BODY:
An unemployed city bus driver charged with fatally shooting his estranged wife, a police officer, in January was convicted yesterday by a Brooklyn jury.
The defendant, John Rivera, 37, was convicted of second-degree murder with depraved indifference for human life in the shooting of Officer Kimberly Rivera, 28, during an argument outside his apartment in Bath Beach, Brooklyn. Four of the victim's former patrol partners, who had come every day to the four-and-a-half-week trial, sat in court with her family as the sentence was read. 
 Mr. Rivera will be sentenced on Sept. 10, and faces a prison term of up to 15 years to life. During the trial, prosecutors contended that the murder stemmed from a combination of Mr. Rivera's frustration at losing his job as a bus driver and his anger at Ms. Rivera for seeking divorce and custody of the couple's child.
Mr. Rivera maintained during the trial that his wife, a six-year veteran of the 68th Precinct in Bay Ridge, had committed suicide after a late-night argument. In convicting him, the jury of nine women and three men concluded that while he might not have done so intentionally, it was Mr. Rivera who pulled the trigger.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Cut Back on Aid Until Cambodian Election

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
In a stiffer response to the coup in Cambodia by Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen, the United States is planning to suspend all aid except basic humanitarian assistance until after elections can be held, senior American officials said today.
While final decisions are still to be made by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and President Clinton, the officials said, there was a growing consensus that a fuller suspension of aid, tied to fresh elections held under international monitoring, is the only way to prevent Mr. Hun Sen from an outright power grab. 
 About 50 percent of the Cambodian national budget comes from foreign aid of one kind or another, either bilateral or through multilateral institutions like United Nations agencies and the World Bank.
But American officials said that if reports were confirmed that Mr. Hun Sen's forces have killed up to 40 members of the political opposition in custody, "that changes things," though they said it was too early to say how.
The United States earlier condemned reports that two supporters of the ousted First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, had been killed in captivity. "But if two becomes 40, we have a very different situation," the official said.
If confirmed, such reports would also increase pressure in Congress, especially in the House, to cut off all aid, even humanitarian aid.
There is also a debate, both within the Administration and outside it, about the timing of a new election. Before Prince Ranariddh fled Cambodia on July 4, the day before Mr. Hun Sen's coup, the two Prime Ministers had agreed on elections in May 1998.
Some officials believe that May is too soon for elections in the current conditions, which would likely favor Mr. Hun Sen. But other officials, and some human-rights workers, have said that elections should be much sooner, to prevent Mr. Hun Sen from consolidating power.
This fiscal year, the United States has appropriated $35 million in direct aid to Cambodia with another $7 million or so in Defense Department money, mostly for the removal of land mines. About half the $35 million would be cut off, with the rest going to programs for AIDS prevention, care for mothers and babies and other basic humanitarian aid. All the Defense money would be cut off, except to remove mines, the officials said.
But they cautioned that these figures could change in the Government debate, and Congress could also have the final say. The House Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill is due to be drawn up this week, and Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican of California, has called for the withholding of all American assistance to Cambodia under legislation that requires such action if an elected Government is overthrown in a coup.
American officials have publicly refrained from calling the events in Cambodia a coup for that very reason, in an effort not to punish innocent Cambodian civilians who have suffered much in the last 30 years.
Earlier, the State Department announced a 30-day suspension of American aid while it tries to coordinate policy with allies from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which holds its annual meeting later this month in Malaysia.
Japan, which has also suspended aid, gives about $150 million a year. The World Bank had approved funds of some $54.3 million through June 30, but large amounts of that money has not yet been spent. The International Monetary Fund had already suspended its loans due to bad economic performance.

HEADLINE: Ex-47th St. Photo Owner Is Indicted in Fraud

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The former president and owner of 47th Street Photo, Irving Goldstein, was indicted yesterday by a Federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges that he and a group of co-defendants falsified accounts to bolster the fortunes of a struggling company that was closely tied to 47th Street Photo, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992.
The indictment illuminates a period in the early 1990's when the fortunes of 47th Street Photo, once a major force in electronics retailing in New York City with its discount prices and high-volume style, had crumbled in an environment of heightened competition and the recession. The criminal charges announced yesterday by the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, do not relate directly to the electronics chain's collapse, but she said that the investigation into Mr. Goldstein's business dealings is continuing. 
 The charges relate to a now defunct company called Micro Innovation Computer Center that, court documents say, was controlled by Mr. Goldstein.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Goldstein and five other defendants, including his son Josef, and two brothers-in-law, Herbert Greenfield and Michael Mendlovic, created a scheme that allowed Micro Innovation to borrow money by creating the impression that Micro Innovation was doing more business than it really was. That resulted in losses of $5 million to one of the company's lenders, the indictment said.
From January 1995 through July 1995, the lender, Fidelity Funding of California, was presented with what prosecutors say was a false-fronted business, which included fake orders and bogus documents intended to create an impression of health that would keep credit flowing.
Also named in the charges were Isaac Reinhold, the president of Micro Innovation, and the United Talmudical Academy, a yeshiva in Brooklyn on whose board Mr. Goldstein sat. Prosecutors said the school participated in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Mr. Goldstein faces up to five years in prison and fines of $250,000 or more if convicted. The school could be fined $500,000 or more.
None of the defendants have entered a plea, pending on arraignment July 24. Mr. Goldstein's lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, said his client would plead not guilty. Mr. Mendlovic's lawyer, Gustave Newman, declined to comment.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 1997, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the indictment of the former president and owner of 47th Street Photo, on charges of falsifying accounts, referred incompletely to a yeshiva in Brooklyn also named in the indictment. According to the office of United States Attorney in Manhattan, the institution involved, the United Talmudical Academy, is based at 5301 14th Avenue in Borough Park, and has four other Brooklyn locations -- at 1010 45th Street, at 1346 45th Street, at 5411 Fort Hamilton Parkway, and on 49th Street (for which a specific address was not available). The indictment did not involve other institutions in Brooklyn with similar names.

HEADLINE: AROUND DALLAS WITH: Doug J. Swanson;
In the Sunbelt, A Shadow Master

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
"YOU want the Flippo tour?" asks Doug J. Swanson, author and creator of Jack Flippo, a down-and-out Texas private eye. He points the car west into the Dallas night, away from the gaudy, neon skyline of downtown, over the mud-ditch Trinity River and into a neighborhood of factories, fleabag motels and dingy doughnut shops.
At one time, Jack Flippo, the chief character in Mr. Swanson's three crime novels, was a young assistant district attorney in Dallas, a man with a future. One serious "libido-driven mistake" and a few lesser wrong turns later, Flippo is prowling the seedier side of Dallas, with forays into the city's better-known, big-rich side. He peeps in keyholes and digs up dirt, while engaging himself in a philosophical struggle to preserve his integrity, or some shred of it. "He looked on his conscience as something that crashed in the jungle," Mr. Swanson writes, "but was still sending out weak Maydays." 
 Flippo intersects with many of Mr. Swanson's other distinctive Dallas characters, including Buddy George Jr., a motivational speaker (and adulterer and blackmail target) with a pompadour "the size of a canned ham" and hand-tooled baby-blue cowboy boots. A constant font of corny dictums -- "You triumph when you combine 'try' with 'umph'!" -- Buddy makes his money on people who come to his Wayupper seminars, where he sells his book, "Birth of a Salesman!"
"Jesus was a salesman," Buddy tells his crowds. "Sure he was. People say he has millions of followers. I like to think of 'em as customers."
With the Flippo series -- "Big Town" (1994), "Dreamboat" (1995) and "96 Tears" (1996, all HarperCollins) -- Mr. Swanson, 44, has drawn acclaim for his zany writing style ("crime fiction slathered in broad comedy," Publishers Weekly says). "Big Town" won the British Crime Writers Association prize for best first novel. Some reviewers have compared him to off-the-wall crime novelists like Carl Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard.
As much as any human being in the Flippo series, Dallas is a central character in the books, but with a twisted and clever reflection of its vaunted self-image as the ultimate city of money and deals. Everybody has a hustle here. Even low-life criminals are upwardly striving in Mr. Swanson's Dallas; those who blackmail Buddy George listen to his motivational cassette tapes and ask him for more and more money.
"Dallas is not an artistic place -- it's a business place," Mr. Swanson explains, and the pervading sense of money's importance may give his desperate, scrambling characters a greater edge. "You're expected to come here and work and make your money and be a productive citizen and be conservative, and all that," he says as the car zooms across a Dallas freeway. "So I think maybe the contrast here is stronger. And that seems to fit with what I'm trying to do."
At the same time, none of the action takes place in corporate board rooms or the conference areas of luxury hotels, which would explain why his little tour of the Dallas inspirations for his novels is like no sightseeing tour offered by Gray Line.
This tour includes two storefront tarot parlors, an inexpensive Salvadoran restaurant and a very budget motel on Fort Worth Avenue, which helpfully advises its clientele that drug dealing and prostitution are not allowed. (The place, or one a lot like it, gets torched in "96 Tears.") Also on the itinerary is Brownie's Coffee Shop, an east Dallas hangout with eight colors of vinyl seats. In real life, a collection agency and a beeper-repair shop are just above the place; in the books, the coffee shop is called Greenie's, and Flippo's office is upstairs.
"You could imagine a somewhat legitimate detective winding up up there," Mr. Swanson says. "Somewhat legitimate."
His writing is a sort of Sunbelt noir and cocks an amused eye at some of the urban Southwest's small absurdities, like the Timberpark Hill apartment complex along a Dallas freeway -- "nowhere near timber, park or a hill," the author observes in "Big Town." The plots are heavy on double- and triple-crosses and other twists.
"Sure I gave you my word," a swindling lawyer explains to his clients in "Dreamboat." "But all guarantees are subject to change." Even friendly conversation has an edge. "I won't lie to you except it's to sell commercial real estate," says a man Flippo meets in a bar in "Big Town."
The books raise an intriguing question: Is Dallas a natural place to set a crime novel?
Maybe, though while Hollywood is interested in Mr. Swanson's plots, it may just change his setting. Steven-Charles Jaffe, the producer who has optioned "Big Town" and who plans to begin shooting the film late this year, said he would probably set the whole thing in San Diego. More picturesque.
Mr. Swanson, who lives 45 miles north of Dallas with his wife, Susan Rogers, and their two children, says he takes no offense. "I can't imagine the books not being in Dallas, but a movie is a different creature. I don't think it would work so well in Cleveland or Toledo, because the Sunbelt, the sense of quick money, is such a big ingredient. San Diego's O.K. It's really beautiful, but it does have its own sleazy side."
There are other cities where crime stories naturally work. Miami, for instance, with all its flamboyance, somehow seems bred for its part in Mr. Hiaasen's best-selling books. Los Angeles has exuded intrigue and mystery and portents of doom amid the sun and palm trees from the days of Raymond Chandler to the present, when it is seen through the eyes, say, of Harry (short for Hieronymous) Bosch, the tormented police detective in Michael Connelly's best-selling series.
But Dallas?
It is a question to which Mr. Swanson, who has a day job as a roving national reporter for The Dallas Morning News, has clearly given a lot of thought. Dallas, he says, has no stunning natural backdrop.
"It doesn't have mountains. It doesn't have the ocean. It doesn't have a forest. It doesn't have a desert," he says. "I guess I sound like I'm not out to increase tourism to Dallas or anything." ("Rain often fell on Dallas," he writes in "96 Tears," "the way money might drop on some hard-luck bastard who every now and then picked a winner at the track. Not often enough, or regularly enough, and when it did come there was too much too fast to handle.")
"It's not New Orleans," Mr. Swanson says. "It doesn't create the natural mood for plots of intrigue. But it does have this outsized quality. Everyone, I think, has some idea about Dallas. It might be the city that killed Kennedy, it might be the TV show, it might be the Dallas Cowboys. But they've heard about it."
In the main, however, Mr. Swanson's Dallas characters are not moneyed like J. R. Ewing in "Dallas." "People keep telling me I should write about the real Dallas rich," he says. "I've thought about that. But I would have to make it somebody who had money and who is losing money. I just couldn't imagine having a lot of fun with someone who has had it all in life and continues to have it, and is not desperate. I need desperate people to write about."
Most of Mr. Swanson's characters are Texas types. In "Dreamboat" Flippo is called on to investigate a drowning in Lake Dolph Brisco, and the East Texas Sheriff is no help at all (for a reason). Rex Echols, a friendly guy who owned a topless bar called the Melon Patch Ranch with the deceased, seems intent only on making up country music lyrics:
 It hurts to admit it, but one thing I do know
If cheatin' was a fel'ny, I'd live on Death Row.
Other characters seem more universal. Like the coroner who talks only to his poodle, or the divorce lawyer who gives Flippo much of his business. "You think I'm sorry people say their wedding vows like they're ordering fries?" he says. "Ask my wallet."
And then, the author explains, there are a few out-of-state characters, including an overlarge tough guy and recurring nemesis of Flippo, Theodore N. Tunstra 2d, known as Teddy Deuce, the "unemployable son of a dentist" from Queens.
Mr. Swanson says his inspiration for Teddy Deuce was a real-life New Yorker he encountered in Brooklyn when he was from 1986 to 1991 the head of the New York bureau -- actually, he was the New York bureau -- of The Dallas Morning News.
"He worked at this toy store in Park Slope," Mr. Swanson recalls. "We used to call it Toys or Else. He was this big muscle-bound guy with tattoos. Anyway, one day I was in there with my son, who's maybe 4 years old, and this big guy is on the phone behind the counter, and he says, 'Yeah, the judge told me, I just keep seeing the shrink, I stay out of prison.' Then he hangs up, and he's staring there at my boy, and I just remember thinking, 'What a guy to be selling toys to kids.' "
In the books, Teddy regularly tries to kill Flippo, but he has a softer side: an intense phobia about germs and a clearly quixotic daydream of making enough money to settle down and buy himself a nice house.
"Showcase home, I'm talking about," Teddy says. "Tree, four bedrooms. Maybe even one wit a Jacuzzi love tub inna bat room."
Flippo is a pastiche of a lot of characters Mr. Swanson has seen over the years, many when he was covering crime for The Dallas Times-Herald, now defunct. The less glitzy side of Dallas, he says, has been an inspiration since he worked as a teen-age delivery boy for his father's machine shop there. Mr. Swanson has neither the income nor the inclination -- not yet, anyway -- to quit his job as a reporter.
And Dallas will remain the setting for his Flippo novels, including one built around Flippo's relationship with an "assassinologist," who gives tours of Dealey Plaza in his 1963 Lincoln convertible, playing a radio broadcast of the shooting of President Kennedy. Mr. Swanson has plans to branch out and would like to write a novel about a World War I submarine, on which his grandfather served. "Of course," he deadpans, "that would not be set in Dallas."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off vs. Yen on Concern About Trade Gap With Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a two-month high against the Japanese yen but fell to end lower yesterday, weakened by worries about the United States trade imbalance with Japan.
The pullback at least temporarily halted a rally that had pushed the dollar to six-year highs against the German mark and left it sharply higher against most other currencies. The dollar has been supported by the health of the United States economy, the ebullient stock market and doubts about Europe's plan for a single currency. 
 "We saw a significant selloff in the dollar," said Joseph Pedone, a currency trader at the New York branch of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. "There's some concern out there that a further expansion of Japan's trade imbalance might lead to pressure on the dollar."
Japan's trade report for June is being released today in Tokyo. United States trade data for May, to be released tomorrow, are expected to show a growing Japanese surplus with the United States, in part because of the weakening of the yen this year, which has made Japanese goods more affordable abroad and hurt the ability of American companies to compete in Japan.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 116.40 yen yesterday, the strongest level since mid-May, before falling to settle in New York at 115.52 yen, down from 115.53 yen Tuesday. Against the mark, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7982 marks before settling at 1.7906 marks in New York, down from 1.7920 Tuesday. The British pound cost $1.6784, up from $1.6779.
The dollar-selling erased advances made earlier in the day after the German Government said it was not overly concerned about the United States currency's strength.
Traders had been expecting a blunt warning about the dollar's gains after Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said on Tuesday that the dollar was excessively strong. Mr. Waigel also said the Cabinet would have more to say about foreign-exchange rates.
But yesterday a spokesman said only that the Cabinet considered the dollar's strength a reflection of the improving United States economy. He also said the euro currency to be introduced in 18 months would be "punctual and strong."

HEADLINE: Tax Credits Will Not Lead to Higher Tuitions

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "A Break for Students" (Business Day, July 15), your analysis of the proposed tax breaks for college tuition, you report that Lawrence E. Gladieux of the College Board noted that President Clinton's proposed increase in the maximum Pell grants is far less than the proposed tax credit for the first two years of college. This is misleading. 
 For the neediest students, the President's 1998 budget includes a larger college work-study program and a $3,000 maximum Pell grant award, which is double the tax credit proposed for the first two years of college.
The President's tax proposals help lower- and middle-income students in two ways: the tax credit for the first two years of college, and another tuition tax credit for all other students.
These tax credits begin diminishing for families that earn $80,000 a year and phase out completely for families that earn $100,000 or more.
You say that state legislatures could use tax breaks to raise tuition. Three decades of experience shows that the rate of tuition inflation slows as Federal student aid increases. Responding to public pressure and competition, state legislatures and private colleges today are limiting tuition growth, often tying it to the inflation rate.

HEADLINE: Just a Small Tick Up for Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Consumer prices ticked up just slightly in June, the Government said today, leaving inflation virtually dormant and generating further optimism that the economy can continue to enjoy steady growth and low unemployment.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in June, bringing inflation for the last year to 2.3 percent and for the last six months to a 1.4 percent annual rate, the lowest rate for the first half of a year since 1986. The report appeared to eliminate any need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting, in August. 
 It also reassured investors that there were no inflationary surprises lurking over the horizon that could derail Wall Street's remarkable run. Stock prices jumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing above 8,000 for the first time, and bond prices also rallied.
"It's pretty much the same story, but a very good one -- moderate growth and low inflation," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.
The economy's sound footing was underscored by several other sets of data released today. Industrial production rose three-tenths of a percent in June, a moderate increase suggesting that a downturn in consumer spending during the spring was largely offset by an increase in manufacturing.
Capacity utilization held steady at 83.5 percent, remaining well below the level at which production bottlenecks tend to force prices higher. Business inventories rose two-tenths of a percent in May, indicating that companies have supplies on hand to cope with any surge in orders.
The increase of one-tenth of a percent in the Consumer Price Index matched the increase in each of the previous three months. The so-called core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also rose one-tenth of a percent, after a rise of two-tenths of a percent in May. The 2.4 percent annual rate of increase in the core index for the first six months was the lowest rate for the first half of a year since 1965.
The report said the moderation in prices was evident in nearly all categories of consumer goods and services. The index for dairy products fell by nine-tenths of a percent, while most other types of food increased in price by less than they had the previous month. New-car prices were flat and air fares were down 1.2 percent.
The category that the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls "apparel and upkeep" fell two-tenths of a percent in June after rising one-tenth of a percent in May, while medical care was up two-tenths of a percent in June, compared with three-tenths of a percent in each of the two previous months. Among the major categories, only housing and entertainment costs rose faster in June than they had in May.
After last week's report that prices on the producer level had fallen one-tenth of a percent in June, economists said that inflation had ceased, for now, to be much of a concern for either policy makers or for business executives and investors planning for the future.
Cliff Waldman, an economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business lobby, said surveys showed that companies were still trying to push through price increases, but were almost invariably unable to do so.
"The gap between plans and actual pricing activity is almost at a 20-year high, which indicates that the atmosphere is making it almost impossible even for those who want to raise prices," Mr. Waldman said.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is scheduled to testify before Congress next week on the central bank's monetary policy outlook. Fed officials remain uncertain whether the current combination of moderate to strong growth, low unemployment and dormant inflation reflects a fundamental change in the way the economy operates or whether it is a temporary phenomenon generated by a confluence of inflation-dampening forces.
A relatively strong dollar has helped keep import prices down. The shift toward managed care has allowed companies to keep their health care costs down. Computer prices have fallen at a rate that analysts said would eventually flatten out. Slow growth in parts of Asia and in Europe has held back demand for many goods and services that are sold on a worldwide basis.
Economists said some or all of those trends were likely to be reversed at some point. And they said that if consumer spending in the United States rebounded in the second half of the year, it could quickly translate into higher prices.
Still, today's figures gave new ammunition to economists who believe that cost-cutting and productivity improvements among businesses have permanently altered the old rules of thumb about how much growth the economy can accommodate without igniting inflation.

HEADLINE: Embers Of Anger In the South

BYLINE: By Mary Frances Berry; Mary Frances Berry is professor of American Social Thought at the University of Pennsylvania and chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After a task force announced last month that there was no national conspiracy behind the fires that have destroyed more than 100 black churches, the message was clear: It is time to rebuild and move on. But it would be wrong to ignore the racial polarization left in the wake of the attacks, in town after town across the Deep South.
Two-thirds of all the fires remain unsolved, and new ones have been set in the past year. The people whose churches were burned down are still fearful. Unless we get to the bottom of what happened in those many individual cases, how can we prevent a recurrence? 
 Last summer the United States Civil Rights Commission held forums in the states where most of the burnings of African-American churches occurred. We announced that only a few of the arson attacks for which arrests had been made seemed to be racially motivated. But we also found that though there was a wave of outside support for rebuilding, the already poor race relations in many communities failed to improve.
I recently went back to Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana to meet with people in towns where churches were burned. I brought the National Church Arson Task Force report showing that there have been 81 arrests and 27 convictions for arson at black churches. Though arrests have been made in only 35 percent of all church arson cases, the report notes that the arrest rate for arson in general is just 16 percent.
The picture it gives of the response by Government, law enforcement authorities and religious groups is a reassuring one. But in rural Alabama and Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta, people were not reassured. There the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., that killed four black girls seems to have happened only yesterday. Old-time racism and poverty still hold sway.
In Alabama, only five of 12 church fires have been solved; there were two new ones in the state last week. In Boligee, at the town's black public high school in the valley below the private white academy, the audience buzzed about the still unsolved burnings of three black churches. The Rev. Levi Pickens of Mount Zion Baptist Church, 73, stood up on his one leg and spoke proudly of the people from outside Boligee who contributed toward rebuilding his church. Remarking on the lack of interest among local whites in helping, he said that in this town, blacks and whites "were taught to be against each other" from childhood.
In Louisiana, only one of the 14 arson attacks on black churches has been solved. In Baker, La., African-Americans were angry not only about this but also about what they saw as an effort by local whites to carve out a segregated school district.
In Mississippi, there have been arrests in just five of the 14 arsons of black churches. In Ruleville, Miss., the Rev. Dexter Brown of New Mount Zion Church told us that his twice-burned church is regularly shot at from a bridge nearby. The bridge has been repeatedly defaced with graffiti, including Ku Klux Klan symbols.
In town after town, we listened to people describe their fears and dashed hopes. Everywhere we went, African-Americans saw the lack of arrests and the public silence about the investigations as another example of contempt for them. The only whites who came to the public forums were one or two politicians whose votes depend on blacks, a reporter or two, and the transcriber.
It is difficult to be dispassionate where the ghosts of civil rights martyrs stalk the land and the flames of black churches burning are etched in memory. Even if all the arsonists are never arrested, and even if race is not the motivation in the still-unsolved cases, we cannot afford to be smug. We must not close our eyes to what these fires have exposed: the rot of southern rural poverty and persistent racism. An old Alabama woman said, referring to Federal civil rights officials: "You were here 30 years ago and you've come again and again and you promise to come back but little changes." I hope she is wrong.

Large Vehicles Lift Profits at G.M. and Ford

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 16

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company announced better-than-expected second-quarter earnings today, profiting from lower costs and America's seemingly boundless appetite for huge sport utility vehicles and big pickups.
Financial analysts said that the mammoth Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle had emerged as the industry's most profitable model. Jack V. Kirnan at Salomon Brothers estimated that Ford earned $14,000 in pretax profits on each $30,000 Expedition, excluding vehicle design and engineering costs, amounting to $1.05 billion in the second quarter. 
 With inflation and unemployment staying low, G.M. and Ford predicted the good times would keep rolling. "All the indications are that 1998 will be a good year as well," J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said. G.M.'s second-quarter profits climbed 11.1 percent, to $2.10 billion, or $2.68 a share, 11 cents better, after adjustment for one-time gains, than the consensus prediction of Wall Street analysts. G.M. had earned $1.89 billion, or $2.63 a share, in the second quarter of last year.
Ford's earnings jumped 33.2 percent, to $2.53 billion, or $2.06 a share, from $1.90 billion, or $1.56 a share, a year earlier. That was 12 cents a share better than analysts anticipated, according to First Call.
Wall Street had a mixed reaction to the earnings. G.M. shares inched up 12.5 cents, to $54.375, but Ford shares dropped $1.50, to $40.625, as many investors took profits on a stock that had risen 31 percent for the year until today. Also, some financial analysts began worrying publicly about the company's falling lease profits and rising costs for rebates and other discounts.
Because of moves to cut costs, notably their insistence that suppliers accept lower prices and become more efficient, G.M. and Ford managed to raise profits despite modest sales increases. G.M.'s sales edged up to $45.15 billion from $44.78 billion, while Ford's sales rose to $40.27 billion from $38.97 billion.
In its annual ranking of the world's biggest companies in terms of sales, Fortune magazine announced on Tuesday that G.M. and Ford were once again the world's largest. For two years, the giant auto makers trailed several Japanese trading companies, but the dollar's rise against the yen over the last year put the American manufacturers back on top.
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, attributed Ford's strong second quarter to the spectacular success of the Ford Expedition. The enormous sport utility vehicle has been selling so briskly since its introduction last autumn that Ford has had to double production.
"If you have a hot-enough product, you can buck an otherwise not-that- great environment," he said.
Mr. Losh said that because G.M.'s factories were already operating at maximum speed to make the similar Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, "the Expedition has not cost us a single unit sale." He said, "Full-size trucks and large sport utility vehicles continue to go gangbusters."
Both companies have also introduced new car models. John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said that the Expedition "is a good contributor, but not the only one."
Ford's share of the overall United States market for cars and light trucks rose to 25.6 percent in the second quarter from 24.8 percent a year earlier, while its share of the car market alone climbed to 20.3 percent from 19.8 percent. G.M.'s share of the overall market fell to 30.5 percent from 32.0 percent, entirely because of lost car sales; its share of the market for sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks held steady at 28.5 percent.
G.M.'s efforts to rebuild its car business by introducing a dozen new models this year have been hurt by strikes at assembly plants. Work stoppages cost the company $490 million after taxes during the second quarter, mainly because of an unresolved strike at a pickup truck factory in Pontiac, Mich.
The United Automobile Workers has notified G.M. that workers could walk out as soon as Tuesday at a transmission factory in Warren, Mich., and a taillight factory in Anderson, Ind. A strike at either factory could hobble G.M. assembly plants across the country within a week. But the U.A.W. has sometimes threatened strikes at crucial auto parts factories to put pressure on G.M. to settle assembly plant strikes like the one now in Pontiac.
G.M.'s strike-related losses in the quarter were largely balanced by two one-time gains -- $318 million from merging the satellite service operations of its Hughes Electronics subsidiary with those of the Panamsat Corporation, and $103 million after taxes from the sale of its stake in Avis Europe.
Two potential blemishes appeared on both companies' earnings reports. Profits slipped in their lending divisions, because of more bad debts and, at Ford, narrower profit margins on leases. With overall incentives at their highest levels ever, G.M. and Ford also reported that their costs for rebates and other discounts climbed in the quarter.
Mr. Losh said that G.M.'s average incentive on vehicles sold in North America, which hit $1,060 in the second quarter, up from $695 a year earlier, had probably peaked. But Mr. Devine said the high level of incentives was likely to remain a concern in the second half.
G.M.'s and Ford's foreign operations, particularly in Latin America, brought more cheer to auto executives. Ford recorded a $25 million profit in South America during the second quarter, its first profit in the region in two years.
South America produced higher profits per vehicle for G.M. than any other region in the world, Mr. Losh said, but it did not release figures.
Mr. Devine and Mr. Losh said in separate interviews today that a devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the subject of recent market speculation in Brazil, would have little direct effect on profits.

Prices Surge As Yield Hits 7-Month Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday after the latest statistics on manufacturing production and consumer prices provided additional confirmation that the economy is not picking up steam and inflation is benign. The rally drove the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to its lowest level in more than seven months.
"The inflation news just gets better and better," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 27/32 , to 101 31/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.47 percent, from 6.54 percent on Tuesday, and is the lowest since 6.46 percent on Dec. 8, 1996.
Bonds rallied after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June, slightly less than expectations. The Consumer Price Index has now risen one-tenth of 1 percent in each of the last four months and five of the last six, which has not happened since 1965. Excluding energy and food costs, the so-called core index also edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent.
"The economic statistics released today were very much in line with the concept of a moderate growth environment with quiescent and nonthreatening inflation, and certainly do not point to any change in monetary policy in the near term," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst as Chase Asset Management.
"Indeed, no change in Fed policy is expected when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets on Aug. 19, and despite some early signs of a pickup in economic growth in the third quarter, the magnitude of such may not be nearly enough to prompt the Fed to change its policy at the Sept. 30 meeting either."
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose three-tenths of 1 percent in June. The moderate gain was expected, as was the unchanged level of capacity utilization at 82.5 percent. While both numbers suggested continued moderate forward momentum in the industrial sector during the third quarter, the market reaction was neutral to positive after their release.
Mr. Fine noted the spread between the Federal funds rate, now 5.50 percent, and the yield on the two-year note was about 36 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- which indicates a "neutral Fed stance," and that the bond market was not expecting a Fed move soon.
Ms. Cooper of Nesbitt Burns said, "Even if the U.S. economy stages a third-quarter growth rebound, the stellar inflation data will give the Fed plenty of leeway to stay on the sidelines for some time yet."
Elsewhere, the Treasury announced yesterday that it planned to sell $15.5 billion in two-year notes and $11.5 billion in five-year notes next week. In when-issued trading ahead of those auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent and the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.10 percent.
And with interest rates as low as they are, corporate borrowers have lined up to borrow from the public sector. Last week companies sold around $11 billion of debt securities.
Yesterday, Vencor Inc., which operates acute-care hospitals, nursing centers, pharmacies and assisted-living communities, priced $750 million, up from $500 million, of 10-year senior subordinated notes through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities. These securities are noncallable for five years. Rated B-1 by Moody's and B by the Standard & Poor's, the notes were priced to yield 8.69 percent, or about 250 basis points more than a Treasury security with a similar maturity.

3d-Quarter Loss at Apple Computer Is Smaller Than Expected

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 16

 BODY:
A battered Apple Computer Inc. surprised analysts today, reporting a smaller-than-expected loss and allaying fears that the company was on the verge of collapse.
The company's loss grew to $56 million, or 44 cents a share, in the most recent quarter, which ended on June 27, from $32 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Still, that was significantly better than the 61 cents a share that analysts surveyed by First Call had expected. 
 In an effort to reduce its sales woes -- revenue for the quarter fell to $1.74 billion, from $2.18 billion a year earlier -- Apple has apparently embarked on the crash development of a new hardware project.
People familiar with it said yesterday that Steven P. Jobs, one of the company's founders and a former chairman who has taken on a renewed leadership role, had ordered the project. They said it might involve a network computer -- an inexpensive machine for browsing the Internet, of the type propounded by the chairman of Oracle, Larry J. Ellison.
Since the abrupt dismissal last week of Apple's chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, concerns had mounted that the board had acted in the face of a potential financial meltdown. The company's stock plunged briefly to a low of $12.75 before rebounding to close today at $16.4375 in Nasdaq trading, up 50 cents for the day.
"I had feared a disaster," said Daniel Kunstler, a computer industry analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities in San Francisco.
This afternoon, after a telephone conference call led by Apple's chief financial officer, Fred D. Anderson, Mr. Kunstler said that the company's future remained cloudy, but that it had shown that there was a silver lining as well.
Apple executives said that the company's cash position was still strong at slightly more than $1 billion. And Apple said that it had made progress in cutting costs and bringing its break-even point in terms of revenue down toward $7 billion a year -- an amount at which it believes it can be profitable in the long run.
However, Mr. Anderson reiterated that the troubled computer maker, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., can no longer predict when it will return to profitability.
"We do not expect a profit in the fourth quarter," he said. "But as we look to the fourth quarter, operating expenses will go down and the break-even point will be reduced."
The company must still struggle with the fact that its sales have declined substantially in the last year. Apple shipped 698,000 computers during the last three months, compared with 838,000 in the quarter a year earlier. Mr. Anderson said that makers of Apple clones shipped about 75,000 computers during the quarter, suggesting that the market share for the Macintosh product line is still declining compared with machines based on Intel microprocessors and Microsoft software.
The company has chosen an executive search firm to find a person to replace Mr. Amelio, and Mr. Jobs is now spending about half his time at Apple. Mr. Anderson said that Mr. Jobs intended to remain chief executive of Pixar, the digital animation company.
Mr. Anderson did not respond directly to questions about Mr. Amelio's departure, but several statements from people close to the company have indicated that the board took action last week after it became clear that a financial turnaround was still not in sight.
"He had promised the board that he would surprise Wall Street and he didn't do it," said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at First Boston.
Though sales fell from a year earlier, Apple's revenue increased about 12 percent in the United States compared with the previous quarter. And its sales were up by 60 percent in Japan, compared with the fiscal second quarter.

HEADLINE: Clinton Again Waives a Penalty on Foreign Companies in Cuba

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
President Clinton today waived for the third time provisions of a law he signed last year that would allow American citizens to sue foreign companies for using American property confiscated by Cuba nearly 40 years ago.
The decision drew praise from some American trading partners, who have strongly opposed the provision, but it brought protests from prominent members of the Republican-controlled Congress. 
 The law, named for its sponsors, Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, was passed last year in an effort to tighten the United States' 34-year economic embargo against Cuba's Communist Government.
American allies, however, have complained that it also sought to force their cooperation in the embargo, which they have refused to join.
European trading partners stopped short of a legal confrontation with the United States over the law before the World Trade Organization in April. That challenge was put off until October to allow both sides to work out a policy.
In announcing the move today, Mr. Clinton said there had been "sustained progress" in rallying allies to isolate Cuba. He pointed to such actions as the European Union's renewed commitment to make any improvement of relations with Cuba dependent on advances in human rights and political freedom.
Mr. Clinton said that European and Latin American countries were taking steps to press Cuba for democratic changes and that he was suspending parts of the law "to continue strengthening cooperation." Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, also noted statements by Argentina, Nicaragua and El Salvador calling on Cuba to begin the process of democratization.
But the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Representative Benjamin Gilman, contested Mr. Clinton's assertion that other countries were promoting change in Cuba. He pointed to a French investment deal with Cuba signed in April and to a medal of friendship given to a Canadian Ambassador by the Castro Government.
Mr. Gilman, Republican of New York, said a bill now in Congress that would take away the President's right to waive parts of the law "will send a strong sobering signal to the President."
He and Senator Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also questioned whether the Administration was deliberately failing to enforce another provision of the law, which mandates the denial of United States visas to executives of companies that are using property that had been confiscated by the Cuban Government.
That provision was also sharply protested by American allies and is at the center of negotiations taking place between the United States and the Europeans.
In a letter to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Helms noted that the President does not have the authority to waive this section. He asked why only officials of two companies had so far been denied visas. They were from Grupo Domos, a Mexican telephone company, and Sherritt International Corporation of Canada, which owns nickel mines and other interests in Cuba.
Mr. Helms charged that there was a growing suspicion in Congress that the Administration was not enforcing this section "as a quid pro quo" for Europe's suspension of its World Trade Organization suit.
Mr. Eizenstat said the Administration was enforcing the provision.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A new move to cut the costs of Federal regulations.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
SENATOR FRED THOMPSON, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, is making headlines with reports that China tried to influence the 1996 election. But when he's not searching for the Manchurian Candidate, the Tennessee Republican's first priority these days is adding a little common sense to the way regulations are analyzed. To this end, Senator Thompson and Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, have introduced the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997, which would require Federal regulators to calculate price tags for all major rules.
That is a lot more than some environmental groups -- who see bean counters as more worrisome adversaries than their traditional enemies -- are prepared to tolerate. The bill "would undermine crucially important environmental, public health and safety protections," proclaimed the Natural Resources Defense Council.
And it is a lot less than business lobbies want. "The bill is so weak, it's probably not worth passing," said Charles di Bona, president of the American Petroleum Institute.
But the support of a number of centrist Senators, including two Democrats, John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia and John Glenn of Ohio, has heartened pragmatic economists who fear that Federal regulation is becoming a serious drag on economic growth. "At least cost is no longer a four-letter word," argued Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute.
Washington has never quite made up its collective mind about what is needed to justify regulation. Every President since Gerald R. Ford has demanded that executive agencies compare costs and benefits with an eye toward efficiency. But Congress has formally prohibited cost considerations on the biggest-ticket health and safety laws -- notably the Clean Air Act.
In the brief, heady days of the Gingrich revolution, there was much talk of creating a "supermandate" under which regulations could be challenged if costs exceeded benefits. But Congress lost its enthusiasm for regulatory reform after the Government shutdown fiasco. And while the Administration has paid lip service to curbing regulation, the White House approved the new standard for ozone exposure last month, despite estimates showing that its multibillion-dollar annual cost was grossly disproportionate. More striking, the Republicans don't seem inclined to stick their necks out in opposition.
The Levin-Thompson bill lays claim to a rational middle ground that emphasizes accountability and public disclosure. Regulators would be required to hire independent experts to compare costs and benefits in consistent ways, and to provide justifications for any rules that flunked the test. Where regulation addressed health and safety, the regulators would have to explain who was at risk and to what degree. If there are several possible means to the same end -- for example, a choice of mandated technological fixes or market-based financial incentives -- agencies would have to explain the alternatives and the reason for favoring one over another.
Nothing in the bill would invite the courts to toss out rules because costs exceeded benefits. Indeed, little in the bill would break new ground: except in cases of independent agencies like the Federal Communications Commission, the President already has the authority to set standards by executive order. But Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, noted that "no one's been forced to pull it all together" -- that formal guidelines would help reduce uncertainty and increase consistency.
Mr. Litan and Mr. Hahn would go a step further. They note with approval that Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, inserted an amendment into a big appropriations act last year requiring the White House to produce a detailed accounting of the costs and benefits of all Federal regulation by Sept. 30 this year. Why not make this an annual accounting, they ask, giving the public a chance to second-guess regulatory mandates?
There are very few innocents left on the long-contested battleground of regulatory reform. While Senator Thompson insists that he has no desire to "slash and burn" regulation, most environmental groups will brook no changes in the way rules are made because they have the inside track on influencing the senior bureaucracy at the Environmental Protection Agency. By the same token, business lobbyists are at best lukewarm about the Levin-Thompson approach because they are convinced that green-friendly regulators will be inclined to cook the books to justify intervention.
That explains why this seemingly innocuous bill is a long shot, particularly in the House, where compromise on regulation is far from almost everyone's mind. But it also explains why regulatory policy may lurch from "anti-business" to "pro-business," reducing productivity without having a significant impact on health or safety.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Market Oblivious To Gravity

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
What goes up must come down.
Says who? 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed above 8,000 yesterday, just seven months after it first topped 6,000. It has doubled in less than 30 months.
Over the last 12 months, the index has risen 50 percent, a kind of performance seen only during the most explosive market moves.
Why is this happening? "Things are perfect," said Edward Kerschner, Paine Webber's top strategist. "They truly are. How else can you describe 2 percent inflation and 10 percent profit growth?"
That is not all. Interest rates have been falling, and some of the overseas markets that had seen explosive growth have begun to seem risky. Individual investors have continued to pour money into stock mutual funds, with many accepting the thesis that stocks are the best long-term investment, and companies are buying each other at a fast pace. When they pay cash for shares, as many do, that shrinks the available supply of stock.
Many Wall Street veterans find the market's surge hard to believe, and valuation measures show stocks to be quite expensive. But that was also true 1,000 Dow points ago, and anyone who got out then has missed a great few months.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, scared investors in December with talk of "irrational exuberance," and then frightened them more by raising short-term interest rates a bit in March. But since then the Fed has backed off, and now there is confidence that it will do nothing to spoil the party.
"The question," Mr. Kerschner added, "is what price you pay for perfection." He thinks the price being paid now is dangerously high, and expects the Dow to suffer a 10 percent drop soon, something that has not happened to that index since 1990. It has never gone longer than that without such a pullback, but similar forecasts in recent years have always been wrong.
People do not care about value, Steve Leuthold, a Minneapolis-based analyst whose Leuthold Group closely monitors valuation, said yesterday. "Individual investors don't know price-to-book value, or any of those things," he said. "They know prices are going up." Given the market's momentum and the demand for stocks, Mr. Leuthold's market model is bullish, however, even with valuations looking to be very high.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the Dow's ascent is the 50 percent climb since this time a year ago. Over the last half-century, there have been only three times when the market managed to show gains of as much as 47 percent over a 12-month period. Two of them, in 1982-83 and 1975-76, came as the market exploded out of severe bear markets that had been accompanied by recessions. The only similar move in a market environment like this one -- after a prolonged rise in stock prices -- came in 1986-87. It was followed by the 1987 crash, but prices rallied, and within a couple of years the Dow was again setting new highs.
By some measurements, the current bull market can be traced to the 1982 low. By that definition, it will celebrate its 15th anniversary next month. Those 15 years have been better than any comparable period in American stock market history. The Dow is now more than 10 times as high as it was in 1982.
In a true bull market, bad news about a company can have only a transient effect. For example, Intel stock plunged in May, when the company warned that its second-quarter earnings would be disappointing. This week it reported earnings that were a bit better than the profits it had forecast in May, but still well below what analysts had expected before the May announcement. The stock zoomed up, and hit a record high yesterday. It has risen 25 percent since the end of June.
In that kind of environment, the risk of not being in stocks seems to many investors to be much greater than the risk of being in them, regardless of whether valuations seem high. There is nothing apparent on the horizon that is likely to change that risk-reward calculation.

Over the past 12 months, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 50 percent. Only three other rallies in the past 50 years have seen gains of 47 percent or more over 12 months. Figures show the maximum 12-month gains for each cycle, as well as how the average changed in the year before the big year, and in the year after. (Source: Bloomberg Financial Markets)(pg. D8)

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
'Uncle Rudy' Uses Power To the Fullest

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Hardened observers of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were astonished earlier this week when the Mayor removed his jet-black double-breasted Hugo Boss suit jacket and casually tossed it on the grass in the sweltering shade of City Hall Park. As the city's masculine standard bearer, Mr. Giuliani almost never publicly acknowledges that he is capable of perspiration.
It immediately became obvious, however, why it was necessary to parade the mayoral sweat stains before the public: Mr. Giuliani was about to teach summer school. The lesson plan: Drink plenty of fluids, but nothing with alcohol or caffeine. Avoid strenuous activity. And don't wear dark clothing. (He seemed to sense this was not an appropriate lecture for a starchy business suit.) 
 Though wilting city residents may have heard those helpful suggestions once or twice before in their lives, the lesson was somewhat more illuminating of the Mayor's turn of mind regarding his role and that of municipal government in general. This was Mr. Giuliani in what one City Hall staffer called "Uncle Rudy mode," using his prominence and the tools of power to help direct the lives of citizens.
In fact, for all his talk about leaving behind the "tired, old-fashioned ways" of doing things in New York, the Mayor is as much a believer in an activist, in-your-face government as any of his predecessors. Though he has consciously worked to make welfare less user friendly, and though his spending cuts have reduced a variety of city services, he has demonstrated that he is eager to employ the full apparatus of city government when it suits his interest, particularly as election time gets closer.
In his view, much disputed by his opponents, it is government that reduced crime, government that is restarting the city's economy, government that is protecting battered children and putting computers in the schools. Having championed immigrants' rights as one of his campaign themes, he announced earlier this year that he was setting up entirely new offices of government to help immigrants become citizens.
Just yesterday, in fact, Mr. Giuliani made three announcements large and small that clearly illustrate his predilection for using the power of the state: He said his staff had spent the last several days persuading private companies to hire many of the 475 workers soon to be laid off when Swingline Staplers moves to Mexico. (His electoral opponents had criticized him for seeming not to care about the layoffs.) He announced plans to spend $260 million to build the long-delayed replacement for Kings County Hospital, having moved away from his earlier position that the city should move out of the hospital business. He even chimed in on the story about the murder of the designer Gianni Versace in Miami Beach, setting up the city's own reward for the capture of the killer.
At a luncheon with a group of moderate and right-of-center Democrats on Tuesday, the Mayor acknowledged that he was not one of those Republicans who believes government should stay out of people's lives.
"On one side you have people who philosophically believe government has no role, and on the other side you have people who believe government should run people's lives," he said. "I try to fall somewhere right in the middle. I try to figure out where government can be helpful. Sometimes government has to run people's lives because nobody else will help them, but you should try to keep that to a minimum."
Councilman Sal F. Albanese, one of the Democrats vying for his party's nomination to challenge the Mayor, said Mr. Giuliani often goes too far in manipulating the levers of government. "He's got this autocratic style, and he wants to micromanage the entire city," Mr. Albanese said. "In the Police Department, he wants to decide who the precinct commanders will be. He overreaches to the point of causing his managers to second-guess themselves, and it's not an effective style."
Mr. Giuliani is clearly aware that no New York mayor can succeed at the helm of a laissez-faire city government. Residents have become accustomed to the idea of an all-embracing city government, and that's why the city shouldn't expect to hear much talk about austerity as November nears. It's summertime: Put on a hat!

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Fell 21.6% in June

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, July 17

 BODY:
Japan's merchandise trade surplus fell in June from the previous month, with export growth slowing from its blistering pace earlier this spring.
The surplus decreased a seasonally adjusted 21.6 percent in June from May, to 865.46 billion yen, or $7.45 billion, the Finance Ministry said. That was the first decline since March. And while the surplus in June was up about 28 percent from a year earlier, it was still smaller than economists had expected. 
 That lends credence to claims by Japanese officials that the surplus is stabilizing as manufacturers rely less on exports to reap profits.
An end to the growth in the surplus could help defuse tensions with Japan's largest trading partners, including the United States.

HEADLINE: Dow Breaks Through 8,000; Nasdaq Surges 38.52 Points

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market, already in the midst of one of the greatest bull runs in history, reached yet another milestone yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average -- the most widely followed market gauge -- closed above the 8,000-point level for the first time, gaining 63.17 points to close at 8,038.88. 
 And the broader market, while not crashing through any particular barriers, easily outperformed the Dow. Soaring shares of technology issues sent the Nasdaq composite index up 38.52 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,580.63 in one of its best sessions of the year and its 10th consecutive record close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.83 points, to a record 936.59.
The impressive gains this year have come about, analysts say, largely because America is in the midst of a stunning, seven-year-long economic expansion. Corporate profits are soaring, unemployment is at a 24-year low, and yet inflation remains benign.
"You've got a favorable earnings trend, a favorable interest rate trend, and investors are feeling pretty good about it," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "This is a market where it looks like everything is going right."
Yesterday's gains, for instance, came on a day when the Government said that the Consumer Price Index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in June. That means that inflation for the first six months of the year rose at its slowest pace in 11 years. That sent bond prices higher yesterday, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury tumbling to 6.47 percent -- its lowest level since December.
Although many on Wall Street had believed at the end of last year that the best days of this bull market were behind it, investors this year have continued to pour billions of dollars into a booming stock market, sending all of the major indexes to record highs.
Of course, many of Wall Street's seasoned analysts believe that shares are too pricey, and that the fundamentals, although excellent, do not justify the escalating prices. Even more believe the market will end the year below this level.
"I thought we'd have a down year, but I think the chances of that are pretty low now," said Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley. "But I still have a sense of the ominous. I think something negative is brewing; it's just taking longer to come to a boil."
But investors who heeded such advice over the last two or three years have missed out on a spectacular run.
Yesterday, the market was bolstered by another batch of strong earnings reports, from companies like General Motors and Lucent Technologies, both of which jumped sharply in the stock market. And as the second-quarter earnings season picks up, investors are becoming even more ebullient.
While yesterday's session occurred in the middle of summer, when volume is traditionally light, activity was historic -- the fifth- heaviest trading day ever for the Big Board, where advancing issues beat decliners by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
"This is what is called a melt-up," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company. "I've never seen a rally like this. Every time things seem excessive, more good news chimes in."
After flirting with the 8,000 level for a week, the Dow finally broke through at 9:40 A.M. yesterday, 10 minutes after the opening bell, to the cheers of many traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Although the Dow was the center attraction yesterday, technology stocks crowded the market once again. Shares of the software giant Microsoft, a bellwether computer issue, rose 9 31/32 , to 148 7/16 . For the year, Microsoft is up nearly 80 percent, allowing the stock to pass shares of Coca-Cola yesterday as the second-largest issue in terms of market value at $178 billion. General Electric, a Dow component stock, is first at $242 billion. G.E. rose 1 13/16 yesterday, and is up almost 50 percent this year. Coca-Cola, also a Dow stock, rose 3/4, to 70 7/8, with a total market value is $176 billion.
Part of the technology surge was also due to Intel, which reported better-than-expected earnings after the market closed on Tuesday. Shares of Intel rose 7 16/32 yesterday, to 88 3/8. Dell Computer, on a tear in recent weeks, surged 6 1/2, to 147 15/16 , and Compaq Computer, up 35 percent in three weeks, rose 6 1/4, to 133 1/2.
J. P. Morgan was the Dow's best performer, up 3, to 111, followed by the Travelers Group, up 2 1/4, to 68 1/2. Eastman Kodak was the worst performer, losing 8 1/2, to 68 3/8, after it reported disappointing second-quarter earnings.
With yesterday's gains, the Dow has now doubled in two and a half years, passing through five 1,000-point barriers. Seven months ago, few on Wall Street thought 7,000 was possible. Now, there is a growing chorus of unapologetic bulls chanting, "Dow 10,000 by 2,000."

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Promises to Overhaul Organization From the Top Down

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 16

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan announced today that he intends to sweep away a United Nations management system accrued over more than half a century and restructure the organization's administration from the top down.
There will be no large cuts in staff or programs in the plan, which some critics of the United Nations had demanded. 
 But the Secretary General, who said in a news conference today that he was offended by those demands, argued that his plan was intended to make the organization more efficient rather than smaller.
Gone will be the cumbersome arrangement under which more than two dozen fiefs within the Secretariat and the organization's more or less autonomous agencies all had direct access to the Secretary General. In its place will be a cabinet of fewer than a dozen top officials with enhanced powers in major areas.
Under his proposal, for the first time in the organization's history, there would be a Deputy Secretary General. A Department of Disarmament would be reinstated and a strengthened human rights office would get a role in the top tier of management, Mr. Annan said. Some changes require General Assembly approval while others do not.
The Secretary General, who presented his plan to a special General Assembly session this morning, is gambling that his proposals contain enough streamlining and cumulative cost-cutting to pacify the United States Congress and yet pay adequate attention to the demands of poor nations, which could use their majority to block key changes that many believe have been forced on the organization by industrialized countries.
In a two-phase process that began just after Mr. Annan took office in January, he promised to complete cuts of 1,000 staff positions.
A fund for development is to be set up from money saved in administrative reforms. The hope is to have $200 million by 2002; about $55 million may be available this year.
In Washington today, initial reactions to Mr. Annan's proposals were predictably mixed, given the divisive nature of the debate over the relationship between the United States and the United Nations.
A spokesman for Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said that Mr. Annan's proposal fell short of what he had promised Mr. Helms in meetings earlier this year.
"They're going to have to go a lot further than this," said the spokesman, Marc A. Thiessen. He said the plan "really doesn't do anything."
Critics of the United Nations in Washington had demanded further large cuts in staff and the abolition of programs or agencies as well as more control over United Nations activities.
Saying that "the United Nations is not working as it should," Mr. Annan pledged today to begin "a quiet revolution" that would make the organization more efficient without reducing its ability to have an impact in a wide range of areas.
"In return, I ask of you, and of the world, that you judge us not only by the cuts we propose or by the structures we change," the Secretary General said, addressing both rich and poor nations. "Judge us instead -- and judge us rightly -- by the relief and refuge that we provide to the poor, to the hungry, the sick and threatened: The peoples of the world whom the United Nations exists to serve."
Most diplomatic missions here and interested groups around the United States are seeing the completed plan for the first time today, since it has been written and rewritten many times over in the last week or two amid gathering gloom in many quarters that a lot of watering down was taking place within the United Nations bureaucracy.
These criticisms have come not from budget-cutters, but mostly from volunteer organizations who have seen the United Nations appear ineffectual in an increasing number of civil wars and refugee crises and want the organization to take a more active role in these areas.
In a news conference after his address, the Secretary General made clear that his plan was aimed at the General Assembly, not the United States.
"My report is directed at the member states, and there are 185 of them," he said. "I know that you keep pulling me back to the Congress, to the Hill and to Washington. I know there are people in Washington who would want to see a much stricter, a much deeper cut. I'm not sure that some of the people on the Hill who are so strong against the U.N. and come with these conditions and really make these demands on the 184 other states realize the impact of their actions. In my contacts and observations, I can tell you my assessment is that these unilateral demands do not impress. They do not intimidate. In fact, they offend."
Senator Rod Grams, the Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on international organizations, said that "this meager package represents nothing more than the status quo, and that is unacceptable."
"Today's plan merely reshuffles the deck at a time when the number of cards need to be reduced," he said in a statement.
Senator Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat who negotiated a compromise set of demands on the United Nations that would allow money to be released to pay some of the more than $1 billion the United States owes the organization in dues, welcomed the plan for its efforts to consolidate programs, but also alluded to Congressional "benchmarks" for measuring reform -- restrictions on United Nations activities and more American oversight of the United Nations -- demands that many diplomats say are both unacceptable and in violation of international treaties.
Richard L. Thornburgh, a former United States Attorney General who wrote a critical report about the functioning of the United Nations when he was Under Secretary General for Administration and Management in 1992-1993, said today that he applauds the recommendation that a Deputy Secretary General be appointed. He said that the organization was "replete with diplomats" and needed a manager to bring coherence to its many programs.
Mr. Thornburgh, a Republican, echoed the cautious hopes of many when he described Mr. Annan as "a good man who really intends to accomplish reform."
The Secretary General, the first insider elected to the position, is widely believed to have a reservoir of good will to draw on. But he will be judged by his firmness in making appointments, cutting into bureaucratic empires and fending off pressures from governments demanding jobs.
Bill Richardson, the United States representative to the United Nations, said in an interview after Mr. Annan's speech that the report "heads in the right direction."
"The general thrust, which improves efficiency, lowers cost and focuses on the core missions of the U.N. are steps in the right direction," Mr. Richardson said.
"But the Secretary General can't accomplish all his proposed reforms by himself," he said. Mr. Richardson, in his speech to the General Assembly today, urged it to set up a committee to begin work on the proposals immediately. The formal annual work session of the assembly does not begin until September.
Among several proposals that require action by the General Assembly, and are expected to generate controversy there, is the appointment of a Deputy Secretary General. Another is the plan to create for the first time a revolving fund to tide the organization over during financial crises like the one caused by Washington's refusal to pay its dues. Such a fund would rob Congress of some of its power to hold the organization at ransom.
The General Assembly would also have to approve the disbanding or redirecting of bodies like the Trusteeship Council, the insertion of "sunset" clauses into new programs and the creation of a high-level ministerial commission to study the workings of United Nations agencies not under the Secretary General's direct control -- among them the World Health Organization, Unesco and bodies dealing with international trade and communications.
The assembly was also asked today to consider a new system of "results-based" budgeting that would allow the Secretary General and other officials to decide how to spend the money the assembly has allocated and would hold them accountable for their decisions.
David E. Birenbaum, the former United States representative for reform and administration at the United Nations, said in an interview today that this budget reform plan was "terribly important" because it pushes officials to deliver. He characterized the proposals in total as "a good solid package."
Mr. Annan will not need assembly approval to create his government-style cabinet, however, or to group the organization's activities under four major headings led by managers of cabinet rank: Peace and security, humanitarian affairs, economic and social affairs, and development. This process has already begun, but not without frictions. Human rights will also have a cabinet-level position.
Unicef's executive director, Carol Bellamy, had publicly criticized plans to put her agency (and the United Nations Population Fund) under the oversight of the United Nations Development Program, whose administrator is another American, James Gustave Speth.
A similar group of relief organizations -- the High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Program and the Relief and Works Agency in the Middle East -- will come under the chairmanship of a new Emergency Relief Coordinator, yet to be named. That office will replace the larger Department of Humanitarian Affairs, which will be abolished.
Mr. Annan said at a news conference today that he welcomed a little conflict in the decision-making process. "In this organization we are often worried about conflict," he said. "We go around believing that conflict must be avoided at all cost. I don't share that view. I'm not a confrontational person, but I'm not one who avoids conflicts.
"I want us to be a team, but I'm not talking about a rowing team, for example," he said. "I'm talking of a team like soccer, where you play as a team but there is room for individual brilliance, individual expression and for entities to do what they do best."
Other proposals made by Mr. Annan today include the following:
In the field, United Nations agencies will work from one office -- called a United Nations House -- in each capital instead of having separate offices and uncoordinated programs.
The proposal also calls for the creation of a strategic planning staff to advise the Secretary General and his cabinet on policy matters. It also calls for international Internet access to United Nations information and documents.
Taken together, the two phases of streamlining proposals will have the effect of trimming administrative costs by 33 percent and reducing the use of paper by the end of this year by 30 percent.

HEADLINE: Swingline Workers, Facing Layoff, Get a Promise of Help, Sort Of

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The 487 workers at the Swingline stapler factory in Long Island City, Queens, who will lose their jobs as a result of the company's move to Mexico, received a promise yesterday from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that the city would help in their search for new jobs.
For a while it looked like more than just help. Mr. Giuliani was quoted in a press release from his office as saying that the city had "reached agreements with private sector companies," many of them in Long Island City, "to hire a large number of Swingline employees." 
 Aides to the Mayor, and spokesmen for the companies themselves, quickly back-pedalled, saying that employers had agreed only to consider the Swingline workers in their future plans.
"They're willing to look at hiring the Swingline people," said Rudy Washington, the Deputy Mayor for community development and business services. No company, Mr. Washington said, had agreed to hire, "sight unseen -- that's not good business."
"But they are willing to hire out of the Swingline pool," Mr. Washington said.
Mr. Giuliani's announcement came 10 days after he was harshly criticized -- by his likely Democratic opponent for re-election in November, Ruth W. Messinger, among others -- for a series of remarks in which he played down the significance of the Swingline closing. The Mayor said then that in a time of economic growth in New York, a company that was leaving simply to increase profits by getting cheap labor somewhere else would not be overly missed.
Yesterday, the Mayor's tone was just as upbeat, this time about how terrific New York business and educational institutions were for their "willingness to lend a helping hand to others in a time of great need." He said that St. John's University in Queens had volunteered, for example, to help in the retraining of 100 of the displaced Swingline workers.
Swingline, which is owned by Acco U.S.A., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Fortune Brands Corporation in Old Greenwich, Conn., said in May that it could reduce labor costs more than $12 million by moving operations to Mexico. At the request of the city and the state, the company held off a final decision. But the package of tax abatements, energy cost reductions and other inducements assembled by economic development officials were not enough. Last month, the company said it would close in about 18 to 24 months.
Mr. Washington said that more than 70 companies in New York had been contacted on the Swingline closing. The companies, from manufacturers to bakeries, have combined plans to hire 600 to 700 people by the end of this year.
Several companies said they were not sure what kinds of skills the Swingline employees had, so it was impossible to guess how good the fit might be. Steve Kaplan, a spokesman for Blue Ridge Farms, a company in East New York, Brooklyn, that makes prepared foods like salads and entrees for institutions and supermarkets and which hopes to add 100 jobs this year, said he needed mechanics. As blue-collar work in New York has declined, he said, those people have become harder to find.
"There's not the great cadre there used to be of mechanics who know what they're doing, so we're hoping we'll be able to utilize these people," he said. "We'll take a look."

 BODY:

Inflation Remains Benign, And Wall Street Applauds
Consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in June, generating further optimism that the economy can continue to enjoy steady growth and low unemployment, without the need for interest-rate increases. 
 The report reassured investors, buoying the stock market as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed above 8,000. [Page D4.]
 
The bond market reacted favorably, too, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to its lowest level in more than seven months, 6.47 percent, down from 6.54. [D15.]
 
G.M. and Ford Above Expectations
General Motors and Ford announced better-than-expected earnings, benefiting from reduced costs and the seemingly boundless appetite for big sport-utility vehicles and pickups. An analyst estimates that Ford earns $14,000 every time it sells one model, the Ford Expedition. [D4.]
 
Columbia/HCA Papers Are Seized
Law enforcement agents seized documents at dozens of hospitals and offices operated by Columbia/HCA Healthcare. The investigation is multifaceted, but was said to center on whether Columbia misrepresented expenses to increase compensation from Federal programs like Medicare. [A1.]
 
Federal investigators conducting an audit of Medicare said that the Government had overpaid hospitals, doctors and other health care providers last year by $23 billion. [A1.]
 
Apple's Loss Is Below Forecasts
Apple Computer surprised analysts with a smaller-than-expected loss, allaying fears that it was on the verge of collapse. Apple has embarked on a crash hardware development project -- possibly a network computer -- people familiar with the project said. [D3.]
 
Time Warner Entertainment to Stay
Time Warner and U S West ended their talks to disband their cable TV and entertainment venture, Time Warner Entertainment. Also, Time Warner reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. [D6.]
 
Weak Kodak Report Hurts Stock
Kodak's earnings fell sharply, hurt by a strong dollar, a price war on film, and mounting losses on its digital and Advantix cameras, and the company's stock plunged. [D2.]
 
Strong Quarter for Lucent and GTE
The popularity of the Internet and of wireless telephones fueled strong earnings at Lucent Technologies, the nation's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, and GTE, one of the largest telecommunications services companies. Lucent's stock soared on the news. [D5.]
 
Northrop and General Dynamics Up
Two military contractors, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, reported earnings gains that were bigger than expected. [D4.]
 
Helms-Burton Provisions Waived
President Clinton for the third time waived provisions of the Helms-Burton Act, which has angered trading partners, who say that it would force their compliance with the American trade embargo against Cuba. [A8.]
 
Partial Lilco Takeover Is Cleared
New York State officials approved a partial state takeover of Long Island Lighting, after the inclusion of a guarantee that electric rates for Long Island residents would drop by at least 14 percent over 10 years. [B6.]
 
Anti-Seizure Device Approved
The F.D.A. approved the first medical device intended to reduce epileptic seizures, made by a Texas company, Cyberonics. [A20.]
 
New Rule Planned on Derivatives
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, despite pressure for delay from banks and brokerage firms, said that it would issue a new rule on accounting for derivatives this fall. It wants derivatives to be reflected on companies' balance sheets, not hidden. [D19.]
 
Racial Bias Charges Against Firm
The Government added charges of racial discrimination to those of sexual harassment facing Lew Lieberbaum & Company, a securities brokerage. [B6.]

HEADLINE: Sister Charged With Murder, and Identity Switch

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., July 16

 BODY:
A woman who had been hailed as an anti-drug crusader after she claimed her home had been firebombed by drug dealers was arrested late Tuesday night, suspected of killing her sister and assuming her identity.
The woman, Sarah Allman, 47, was charged with murder, forgery and giving false information to the police in a scheme the authorities said was meant to withdraw money belonging to her sister, Stevie Allman, 52. 
 The police say the older Ms. Allman's body was inside a charred freezer they discovered on Tuesday in the burned-out house that the two women shared.
"I don't know if bizarre quite describes it," said Capt. Peter Dunbar of the Oakland Police Department. "This is the stuff of a Hollywood movie."
At some point, the authorities said, Sarah Allman assumed the identity of her sister, apparently to gain access to the deed to their house and payments that the elder sister was to receive from a previous job.
Stevie Allman was an unemployed secretary known by the police for her efforts to rid her East Oakland neighborhood of drug dealers.
For more than a year, Ms. Allman had been videotaping drug sales on her street and sending the tapes to the police. The police say she may have last been seen in early April.
The night of the July 1 blaze firefighters rescued a middle-age woman who had been badly burned on her face, arms and legs. The woman, who identified herself Stevie Allman, told the authorities that she suspected that the fire had been set by drug dealers she had angered.
Her story seemed to check out after officials confirmed that they had been called there twice before to extinguish fires set outside the house.
For residents of this blue-collar city, Ms. Allman's tale instantly struck a chord. Within days, dozens of Oakland residents had cleaned Ms. Allman's street, and $3,000 was donated to a fund set up to cover her hospital costs.
The sudden civic beneficence was capped last week when the Gov. Pete Wilson announced a $50,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of Ms. Allman's attackers.
All the while, the police say, Sarah Allman had been posing as her sister, gilding the fraud by releasing a pair of defiant statements directed at her purported assailants.
"I have no doubt they intended to murder me," she said in statement released on Tuesday. "Their warped minds thought the act would clear the way to do their dirty dealing."
It was only when one of Ms. Allman's 10 siblings alerted the police that two women were living in the house that the authorities became suspicious.
On Tuesday afternoon, officers searching the house with a dog found a charred freezer near the spot where the blaze had begun.
A few hours later, the police said, they persuaded Ms. Allman to provide them with fingerprints, which matched a set taken in 1971 when she was arrested for prostitution. The police say Sarah Allman then confessed to impersonating her sister.
The Governor's office said the reward would stand until officials could determine whether the blaze was actually Sarah Allman's work or someone else's.
Adding more uncertainty to the twisted case, the police said it was not certain whether Sarah or Stevie Allman had sent the videotapes to the department. "We can't tell, we just can't tell," Captain Dunbar said. "Nothing about this so far has been clear."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Golden Girl of Vice K.O.'s Oleo Heir

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
So many cigarettes are theatrically flourished in Raymond De Felitta's nifty sleeper of a film "Cafe Society" that when it's over you may be tempted to inspect your clothing for the stale, clinging odor of secondhand smoke. Many of those cigarettes jut from the enameled tips of tapering holders fingered by bejeweled, white-gloved "socialites" posing for the flashbulbs in El Casbah, a swank early-50's Manhattan saloon reminiscent of El Morocco.
"Cafe Society," which remembers a real-life sex scandal that rocked New York City 45 years ago, is the rare 50's period piece that gets it right, from the little red-shaded lamps on the cramped tables of El Casbah to the slithery come-hither sexual signals of a more repressed era. The hard-boiled banter over endless martinis also has an authentically pseudo-sophisticated ring. Or as one jaded habitue of El Casbah observes when an unfamiliar face appears in the club: "She's new to cafe society. Nescafe, we call that." 
 The movie, which opens today at the Screening Room (it was originally seen on Showtime), re-enacts the downfall of Mickey Jelke (Frank Whaley), the pint-size, girl-crazy, porno-collecting heir to an oleomargarine fortune. In 1952, after a police investigation of prostitution in upscale Manhattan nightclubs, Jelke was arrested and convicted of pimping. The star witness against him was his girlfriend, Patricia Ward (Lara Flynn Boyle), whom he pressed into prostitution after his family cut him off from his trust fund. He had also promised to marry her. When the scandal hit the front pages of the tabloids, Patricia realized her lifelong dream of fame by being dubbed "the golden girl of vice," and for two seconds Hollywood seemed to beckon.
The police officer who dreams up the investigation (a pre-election publicity stunt to help re-elect Frank Hogan, the Manhattan District Attorney) is Jack Kale, (Peter Gallagher), who infiltrates cafe society by posing as an unemployed Hollywood actor. He befriends Jelke by punching out the escort of a former Jelke girlfriend one night at El Casbah. Jelke rewards Kale by dragging him into a world of wild, booze-filled parties attended by a network of prostitutes.
By today's standards, the depravity seems pretty tame. But "Cafe Society," filmed in a style that evokes 50's tabloid news photos, captures the era's zest for naughtiness. As cramped, squalid and soulless as this smoke-filled dolce vita appears, it also exudes the tawdry glamour that can be found among people whose dream of fulfillment is to see their pictures in the paper.
Among several strong performances, Mr. Whaley's Jelke is the most memorable. The young actor, who suggests a homelier, runtier Matthew Broderick, makes this spoiled playboy-manque a pathetically empty creature who is given to hysterical tantrums and whose only claim to fame is the size of his bankbook. Ms. Boyle's Patricia is almost as impressive and equally pathetic, as she brazenly and transparently lies about her background. (She's not from Newport, R.I., as she claims, but from Avenue D in Manhattan.)
Mr. Gallagher is a little too soft as the New York vice officer who becomes disenchanted with his cause. But John Spencer's icy, side-of-the-mouth portrayal of Ray Davioni, a poisonously cynical press agent and pimp, deserves special mention. This ominous bottom feeder is so coldblooded he could have stepped from the shadows of that ultimate 50's nightmare of Manhattan press agentry and corruption, "The Sweet Smell of Success."
"Cafe Society" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, strong language and sexual situations.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;
The Designs of a Genius Redesigning Himself

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
WHEN America's westward expansion finally reached the Pacific coast, the artist's imagination became the country's new frontier. Or so one might conclude from a show of uncommon beauty on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art, "Frank Lloyd Wright: Designs for an American Landscape, 1922-32." The show, first presented at the Canadian Center for Architecture, offers five projects, all unbuilt, in which Wright developed a range of innovative forms for buildings far removed from the urban center. Not coincidentally, the show also depicts an artist in the painful process of recreating himself.
This exhibition is a result of a recently forged alliance between the Canadian Center and the Whitney Museum. Since its founding in 1989, the center has presented some of the most intelligent architecture shows to be seen anywhere today. Now, thanks to the Whitney, New Yorkers won't have to journey to Montreal to view them. 
 Good news for us. But the work on view at the Whitney occupies such a peak of genius, and it has been assembled with such sensitivity, scholarship and skill, that those who care about architecture may feel more than a little ashamed for not having leaped onto a plane and rushed to see it earlier. There are drawings here as ravishing as any that Wright produced: as beautiful, that is to say, as any architectural drawings that exist on earth. There are times when understatement is useful. This is not one of those times.
The show, organized by David G. De Long of the University of Pennsylvania and beautifully designed by the New York architect George Ranalli, includes roughly 100 drawings, architectural models and computer renderings. One might call it "A Man and His Pencils." Wright used to talk about the joy it gave him to spread a selection of colored pencils in his hand and see the colors sparkling in the sun. The architect could be grandiose when talking about himself, and the image of him contemplating the tools of his trade may seem off-puttingly divine. That's the way Wright was. And when you see what he accomplished with these tools, Wright's high opinion of himself begins to look like objective fact.
Wright designed these five projects in the decade following his completion of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. These were not Wright's happiest years. He had little work. His personal life was a shambles. Eventually, with the completion of the Fallingwater residence outside Pittsburgh and the Johnson's Wax Headquarters in Racine, Wis., in 1936, his career burst into a second flowering. But meanwhile, Wright was widely perceived as a burned-out case.
We should all burn out so vibrantly. Even though these five projects were not built, this is a show of rebirth, of new beginnings. Here, the American landscape becomes a metaphor for the eternal American belief in fresh starts. The car becomes a symbol for moving on.
Go west, middle-aged man. In his earlier years in Chicago, Wright developed a predominantly horizontal vocabulary of forms for the Midwestern prairie. In these projects, he devised a formal vocabulary for three different terrains: mountain, desert and lake. All but one of the projects were designed for the American West. All five utilized the concrete-block construction he employed in the Mayan-inspired houses he built in Los Angeles in the 1920's. All typify the anti-urban strain that would dominate Wright's thought in later years. Now, the car enjoys the pride of place Wright had once granted the hearth.
The Doheny Ranch Development, planned in 1923, is the only true suburban project among the five. Conceived for a stretch of the Santa Monica Mountains subsequently known as Beverly Hills, the scheme boasts genuine Hollywood glamour; it could be a set for a vanished sequence from the film "Lost Horizon." A community of homes spread over 411 acres would have been linked by roads and viaducts. To a degree, this is an early version of what architects in the 1960's called the megastructure, but one that draws hill and valley into its lush, sprawling mass.
In 1923, Wright prepared an even more Arcadian dreamscape, a vacation colony for Lake Tahoe. Like Wright's residential designs for Los Angeles, the Tahoe project also drew on Pre-Columbian forms. Here, the Mayan influence is evident in the battered concrete bases of the cabins, while their tall wooden roofs evoke wigwams.
Wright's integration of these structures with nature is as impressive as the forms themselves. Rocks and boulders cluster around the cabins' bases. The wooden roofs echo the surrounding forest, Adirondack style. Wright also designed a series of floating barges that would have dissolved the borders between building, land and water. An offshore lodge to be erected on piles in the lake features "water courts," aquatic atriums enclosed within the building's long, low-slung wings.
The drawings convey an image of baptismal purity. And yet, looking at them in the light of Wright's turbulent life at the time, one is inclined to see this as a place of infidelities and indiscretions, unsolved murders, mysterious drownings, untold Prohibition-era delights.
The American desert provided Wright with almost too poetically apt a setting for the hardships of his middle years. In 1934, with the construction of Taliesin West, the architect made Arizona his winter home. Ten years earlier, however, he prepared a desert oasis for the insurance tycoon A. M. Johnson.
Johnson had already built a small compound of Spanish-style houses on the edge of Death Valley. He invited Wright to join him there on one trip and asked the architect for recommendations on improving the property. Wright responded in typical fashion by drawing up an ambitious proposal that would have enclosed the existing structures within a long, linear building sited to take advantage of the views, the terrain and the approach by car. The plan included terraced farming, fountains and a chapel.
In 1928, Wright was commissioned to design a new hotel outside Phoenix, San Marcos in the Desert. Not long before, he had helped a former apprentice with the design for the fabulous Arizona Biltmore. (That hotel's magnificent lobby, never officially credited to Wright, produces an impact on the body that is felt nowhere except in Wright's buildings.)
For San Marcos, he produced a long, three-story block with setbacks and balconies, a form adopted by many other architects almost 40 years later. The folded planes of the ceiling in the hotel's dining room anticipated the geometric experiments of avant-garde architects today. Again, as in Death Valley, the flat desert plane enables Wright to orient the building around the roadway approaching it.
The most delirious design in the show is the Gordon Strong Automobile Objective, which Wright designed in 1925 for the top of Sugarloaf Mountain in Maryland. Here, the spiral makes its first appearance in Wright's work. Later, he would use this form for projects as various as a jewelry store, a car showroom, a parking garage and the great Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.
The Automobile Objective, as its name implies, was a tourist destination, designed to lure people out for a drive. And the design makes clear the cosmic terms in which Wright regarded cars. Its ziggurat shape recalls the sacred "world mountain" temples of ancient Sumeria. Inside the temple, Wright proposed to build a planetarium.
What's striking about all these projects is that Wright proceeded as if he, personally, had discovered America. He is starting over from scratch, as if the nation had not already been invaded by neo-classical, Gothic Revival and other European styles of building. Sybil Maholy-Nagy was not exaggerating when she observed that Wright was the first architect in history who felt obliged to design an entire continent.
And Wright was hardly the only American for whom the car and the highway symbolized the freedom to seek the future, to speed away from past mistakes: failed marriages, botched careers, the wretched confines of tradition. In hindsight, of course, this optimism seems painfully naive. No force has done more to despoil the American environment than the car culture and its insatiable gobbling of the American land.
Wright cannot be wholly absolved from responsibility for the megalopolitan sprawl of the postwar years. "When people ask me where they should build," the architect wrote in the early 1950's, "I tell them to go far from the city, at least as twice as far as think they should go. And when others follow, as they will, move on!"
Yet in those same years, Wright found himself railing against the electric power lines stretching across his beloved Arizona desert, their metal stanchions disfiguring his glorious mountain views. Soon, tract houses, cars and asphalt would be dumped upon the landscape in overpowering abundance. The nation's economy would become critically dependent on this mass production, never mind that the pileup of industrial production would be hazardous to mental and physical health.
In short, this show will leave the alert visitor hungering for a sequel, in which today's most informed thinkers would be asked to work through the history and prospects of the desert we have built in the wake of Wright's ideas.
"Frank Lloyd Wright: Designs for an American Landscape, 1922-32" remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Aug. 31.

A Pitiful Giant

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
This year's convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was supposed to have been all about children, which was not a bad idea because huge numbers of black children are hurting in ways that would break a normal person's heart. But the interests of children were betrayed right at the start when the thuggish boxing promoter Don King was honored, embraced and gushed over by Kweisi Mfume, the man who was hired to clean up the act of the once-illustrious civil rights organization.
Don King. How's that for a role model? Maybe it'll be Mike Tyson next year. 
 In presenting Mr. King with the association's President's Award, Mr. Mfume compared him to Jackie Robinson and complained about Federal prosecutors who have targeted the promoter in an insurance fraud case. Mr. Mfume did not go into Mr. King's long history of unscrupulous business practices, or the time he spent in prison for pistol-whipping and kicking a man to death.
Mr. King, in accepting the award, smilingly and enthusiastically asserted that the United States is a great country. And he offered what he felt were some helpful comments about the Constitution.
The N.A.A.C.P. has lost its grip. There is a disoriented and at times paranoid quality about the organization that more than any other did the difficult, dangerous and noble work of desegregating America. The N.A.A.C.P. was once the home of giants like W. E. B. DuBois and Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall, brilliant and fearless individuals who spent their lives beating back the raging flames of racism and fighting for the civil rights and personal dignity of everyone. Their heroic lives embodied the true greatness of America.
Now the N.A.A.C.P. is something different, something so much less. It is not just diminished, it has decayed. Instead of the soaring rhetoric and strategic brilliance of past decades we now get a chairwoman, Myrlie Evers-Williams, who vows to fight the "rats" who are gnawing at her organization, and a president, Mr. Mfume, who promises "to get rid of the snakes" who would undermine him. Neither identified the objects of their wrath. Puzzled delegates could be overheard in elevators asking whom they were talking about.
Rats and snakes and kudos to Don King. If there is a method to the madness, I've been unable to decipher it.
As for the children, there is one thing they need more than any other. Fathers. Real fathers, that is. Fathers in the home. Not just boys or men who have dropped their seed and split. But you could have wandered from one workshop to another, from this plenary session to that, from the cocktail parties to the most solemn prayer service without hearing a word about the greatest threat to black children since slavery -- their abandonment by their own fathers.
Children who grow up in fatherless homes are far more likely to live in poverty, to do poorly in school, to have children out of wedlock themselves, to be unemployed and to commit crimes. In short, they are far more likely than the offspring of two-parent families to spread misery and tragedy among themselves and others. You want to do something for the kids? Fight with the intelligence and passion of the civil rights movement for their right to have a committed and loving father in the home.
Mr. Mfume, unfortunately, is not well positioned to lead this fight. In his autobiography, "No Free Ride," he writes:
"I gave new meaning to the phrase 'sowing wild oats.' Consider: In May 1968, Pauline gave birth to Donald. Later that year in August, Yvonne gave birth to Kevin. A year later, in October 1969, Brenda had my son Keith. In January 1970, Carlitta gave birth to Michael. And three weeks later, in January 1970, Pauline gave birth to our second child, a boy we named Ronald."
Five children by four women in 21 months. Mr. Mfume says in his book that his consciousness has since been raised and he has tried to be a good father. Perhaps he has been. But the simple truth is that high-profile black leaders tend not to talk much, in public or in private, about the desertion rate of black fathers and the incredibly destructive effect it is having on black children.
It's like not talking about slavery.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In cases of airplane crashes at sea, like Trans World Airlines Flight 800, the United States Supreme Court decision to use a victim's wages, rather than loss of companionship, as a barometer of damages is indeed unjust (news article, July 11). I applaud the House bill that would eliminate the legal distinction between crashes on land and at sea.
Unfortunately, because of New York State's 150-year-old wrongful-death law, the House bill would bring no relief to victims of planes that crash over the state. New York is one of the few states that award damages only for economic losses. 
 I have sponsored a bill that would amend our archaic law to permit family members to recover economic damages as well as those for emotional grief when a wrongdoer is found liable for the death. We must not continue to discount mothers, wives, children and grandparents by judging their worth in terms of earnings alone.

HEADLINE: Solarz to Tackle Cambodia Issues

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
In an effort to explore a resolution to the political crisis in Cambodia, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today asked the former New York Congressman Stephen J. Solarz to travel to the region as a special envoy, the State Department announced.
Mr. Solarz will report to her July 26 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where she will attend meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is making its own diplomatic efforts on Cambodia. His mission "is intended to be consistent with and fully supportive of those efforts," the department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said. 
 Mr. Solarz served on the House International Relations Committee and has a strong interest in Southeast Asia. He was elected to Congress in 1974 but defeated in 1992.

Tax-Break Deal Tied To Creation of Jobs

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
As part of an agreement to keep Furman Selz, an investment banking and financial services firm, in Manhattan, the city and state have agreed to give the firm up to $2.4 million in tax breaks over the next 16 years, city officials said yesterday. But the deal has some important fine print: The firm has to grow and create jobs in order to collect.
The incentive package with Furman, which has 580 employees in the city, is only the second that New York has done in tying financial abatements or benefits to growth. It suggests a greatly improved bargaining position for the city as its economy and business environment have improved. 
 The first such deal tied directly to job growth, with ING Barings, a British-Dutch financial services firm, was announced in April. In the past, most companies only had to promise to stay in the city to collect concessions.
City officials said that Furman had considered a move to Weehawken, N.J., but will instead stay at its 230 Park Avenue location. The city said the company plans to expand at another Park Avenue location nearby. The company projects that it will add 400 new jobs over the next 16 years. It will be eligible for benefits only as it achieves specific employment thresholds along the way.

HEADLINE: High Marks for Giuliani From Budget Watchdogs

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
With only a few whispers of gloom, the state board that oversees New York City's finances gave an unusually positive grade to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's most recent budget yesterday, saying the fiscal outlook is the brightest in years.
At the annual meeting of the New York State Financial Control Board in Gov. George E. Pataki's midtown Manhattan office, board members said the budget picture had improved significantly because of the prosperity on Wall Street. The board -- which includes the Governor, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, among others -- also credited the Mayor with reducing the size of the long-term deficit by dedicating some of this year's $1.3 billion surplus to paying future expenses. 
 Mr. McCall, a Democrat who has often been at odds with the Republican Mayor, said that despite the progress, he was disappointed that the Giuliani administration is increasing spending by 7.4 percent in this year's budget. He said the city was still relying too heavily on "one-shot" methods of balancing the budget that do not help the long-term picture. And, he maintained, the projected deficits over the next four years remain too high, peaking at $2.8 billion in 2000.
"I support what the Mayor has done, and I urge the city to continue to take efforts to achieve more than a one-year balance by the use of stopgap or one-shot initiatives," Mr. McCall said, with the Mayor sitting nearby. "We have to provide long-term fiscal security for city taxpayers, and the city must continue to work to curtail expenses, as they've done, boosting revenues, especially if it plans additional tax cuts, and continue the practice of establishing significant reserve funds."
But Mr. Hevesi, also a Democrat, was far more upbeat, saying the city was in the best shape since at least 1989, when the current City Charter first required his office to comment on the Mayor's financial plan. He said that the surplus continued to grow and that the long-term deficits could actually be lower than Mr. Giuliani had projected, and he warned only that the city's debt burden was growing too large.
"Even in the worst case, the city will balance the budget without the kind of pain it has known historically," he said, referring to next year's budget. He also praised Mr. Giuliani for devoting almost half the surplus to deficit reduction, saying he had resisted "the temptation in an election year to spend lots of money."
Though such compliments are not particularly good news for the Mayor's Democratic opponents, they seem to reflect a growing consensus within the financial community that the city's books are entering a period of relative stability.
Yesterday, for example, Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency, announced it was giving the city a "positive" credit outlook, an upgrade from the previous "stable" rating. Though the Moody's rating of the city's bonds remains below average at Baa1, where it has been since February of 1991, the improved credit outlook is considered an indication of trends and budgetary practices that increase the likelihood of a change in the bond rating in the next three years.
The Moody's report said the low bond rating reflects the city's underperforming economy, its high debt burden, and its poor financial history. But in improving the outlook, it credited the Mayor with reducing the city's social service costs and welfare rolls, and for strengthening the city's reserve funds.
"Although long-term structural budget imbalance continues to pose challenges," the report says, "fiscal flexibility has improved and outyear gaps have narrowed, positioning the city to better weather future economic and revenue cycles endemic to its economy."
At the control board meeting, the Mayor thanked the members for their generally kind words, which were a departure from the stern warnings that often marked such meetings earlier in his term. He acknowledged that the city will continue to struggle to balance its budget, but said the enormous spending cuts in his first years in office had made the task easier.
"Now the deficits are down to numbers that still should concern us, numbers that still present a challenge to us, deficits that say to us that the era of fiscal discipline is not ended, merely because we are doing better," he said. "But it gives us a great deal of confidence that we're moving very, very much and aggressively in the right direction."

Bond Prices Slip After More Data Show a Strong Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell slightly yesterday following a recent run-up, after several reports showed signs of economic strength.
Still, those reports -- on housing starts, a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelpia survey and weekly jobless claims -- were not enough yesterday to change the market's view that inflation remains benign. Nor did they greatly dampen the enthusiasm generated on Wednesday, when the Government reported that consumer prices barely moved in June and that inflation was running at the slowest annual pace in more than a decade. 
 Alan Levenson, a senior vice president and director of research at Aubrey G. Langston & Company, said that this week's soft data did not give a hint of inflationary pressure.
"All the talk of a rebound in the economy in the second half has been just that, talk," he said.
Prices moved higher for a time yesterday, bolstered in part by rumors of a large purchaser of 10-year securities tied to the mortgage-backed market. But profit taking in the afternoon cut short what would have been the market's third consecutive gain.
Instead, by the end of trading, the price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 , to 101 27/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 6.48 percent, from 6.47 percent on Wednesday.
Bond prices fell briefly after the Philadelphia Fed reported an unexpected pickup in business activity. The regional Fed's general economic index -- compiled from a survey of about 150 manufacturers in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware -- rose to 28.1 this month from 25.2 in June, higher than the 23.3 analysts had expected.
Also yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts grew 4.8 percent in June, to 1.45 million units, at the high end of expectations.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, said that housing fundamentals remain very strong and should get another lift from the latest slide in long-term interest rates.
"While conditions are solid, they are by no means overheated, and starts are still below last year's average of 1.47 million units," she said.
In another report, the initial claims for unemployment insurance fell 28,000, to 349,000, in the week ending Saturday, reversing much of the previous week's run-up that had been a consequence of early seasonal shutdowns of automobile factories.
The focus of market participants now appears to be turning to next week's testimony of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to give Congress his semiannual testimony on the state of the economy.
At yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills, good investor interest lowered the average discount rate to 5.26 percent, from 5.35 percent last month and the lowest since 5.16 percent on Dec. 5, 1996.
The bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the total amount of the issue was 4.52 to 1, compared with 4.71 to 1 last month.
Ahead of next week's sale of two-year and five-year notes, yields edged up. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.89 percent, while the five-year was offered at a price to yield 6.11 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: Despite Assurances, U.N. Workers Fear Downsizing

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 17

 BODY:
This morning it was the United Nations staff's turn to hear about reform from Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The people who keep the organization running from day to day came with some trepidation, overflowing one conference hall and then another and another here at headquarters or tuning in to live broadcasts beamed to offices around the world or reading their E-mail in the muddy outposts of refugee centers and disaster areas. 
 "In all my 11 years here, I've never seen so many people come to hear a Secretary General -- or anyone else," said Salim Lone of Kenya, the organization's chief of publications.
They came with a backlog of bitterness, afraid of hearing more bad news.
"We've been dumped on by the newspapers, the media, the member states, the critics -- and most of us are holding down two or three jobs," said Zuzu Tabatabai, an Iranian who works on women's affairs within the Secretariat.
"Deep down, the people who work here think they are doing something for the world, and they're clobbered every time. They were walking on eggshells. All they heard was cut, cut, cut. They wanted to hear good news."
A day after he announced a restructuring plan, the message delivered by Mr. Annan, the first Secretary General to rise through the ranks of the United Nations bureaucracy, was the talk of the organization. He told the staff that there would have to be attrition, that he would seek to lower the age of the staff, that he would turn loose on them a team of outside management experts from the private and public sectors to review work practices.
But he also told them, "It is not their reform. It is our reform."
What many heard was a reassurance that he would not allow the organization to be torn apart, that there would be no blood on the floor.
"He said, 'I'm one of you,' " Ms. Tabatabai said. "I know what you are going through. He has friends. He hears it all. He knew that the people were unhappy and scared."
Kevin Kennedy, an American who is chief of the peace and security section of the public information department, said the sense that staff members have a protector will make them much more willing to take bad medicine, if that's what is coming. Mr. Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was once booed by employees after constraints were applied during a financial crisis.
When Mr. Annan opened the floor to questions after his talk this morning, the first one was a quip that brought down the house: The questioner wanted to know if management reform could be made retroactive.
"Like anybody who works for a large organization that's going through changes like this, I have some misgivings, and I don't necessarily agree with everything that's being proposed," Mr. Kennedy said. "But I think that most of us feel that, imperfect as the process may be, the staff trusts Kofi Annan. I think they are willing to do more than just give him the benefit of the doubt."
At Unicef, where restructuring and job cuts have already taken a toll and there are fears that grouping the agency with others in a cluster will cost the children's fund some autonomy, "some people are still focused on budget cuts and worried about whether they will keep their jobs, and how duplications will be avoided," said Matilda Weekes of Sierra Leone, an executive secretary. "But most people are saying: 'It's about time; reform is overdue.' "
It was evening in Goma in eastern Congo when Craig Sanders got his E-mail message. "It was interesting, but a long, long way from the reality we deal with on a daily basis," he said in a telephone interview. "There is violence to the east of us and violence to the west of us. Tonight I was working on a contingency plan for another crisis, another emergency."
Mr. Sanders, an American who directs the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' office in Goma, said reform sounded like a good idea, but he would like to see it coupled with more courage on the part of member nations in providing support and security "for the people who have to run the roadblocks."
Filippo Grandi, an Italian who is the refugee organization's field coordinator in Goma, said that even stronger restructuring of the organizational bureaucracy was probably in order. He echoed some of Mr. Annan's own words about changes in the quality of performance mattering more than the mere cutting of staff.
"We think we could do our work better if things were simpler and faster," he said. "U.N. reform is not just about cutting a couple of posts in New York or Geneva. It's about making very important activities more efficient on the ground. Every layer of bureaucracy means that you diminish suffering in a slower way."

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Shevardnadze Agonistes

BYLINE: By PHILIP TAUBMAN 

 BODY:
When President Clinton welcomes Eduard Shevardnadze to the White House this evening, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the Georgian leader. Many times in the final years of the cold war, he met as Soviet Foreign Minister in the Oval Office with American Presidents and Secretaries of State, demolishing the barriers that divided East and West. For that historic statesmanship he should be honored here. But Mr. Shevardnadze is a good deal more complex than the common hagiography about him would suggest. He belongs on the short list of the world's toughest, most hardened politicians.
That is not said to diminish his accomplishments. With the approval of Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Shevardnadze transformed the nature of Soviet foreign policy. Because he was unschooled in the rigid traditions of Kremlin diplomacy -- his 1985 appointment to replace Andrei Gromyko as Foreign Minister was a surprise -- Mr. Shevardnadze was open to new ideas. Without his leadership, the Berlin wall probably would not have fallen so fast in 1989, German unification might not have unfolded so smoothly, Soviet troops would not have left Afghanistan in 1989 and Moscow would not have cooperated so willingly with Washington in resisting Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
 Nor do I mean to impeach his character. There is an infectious warmth and openness about Mr. Shevardnadze that set him apart from other Soviet officials. I watched him at close range in Moscow in the late 1980's and found him invariably candid and straightforward. By far the most informal and informative talk I had with a Politburo member was with Mr. Shevardnadze at a 1987 Kremlin reception. It didn't hurt that as a native Georgian, he spoke Russian almost as slowly as I did.
But Mr. Shevardnadze's achievements and engaging style ought to be seen in the broader context of his political career. He did not make it to the apex of Soviet power through affability, nor has he prevailed in Georgia's bloody political conflicts in recent years simply with enlightened leadership. Mr. Shevardnadze is a fierce partisan who has at times condoned the brutal practices of the police state.
Mr. Shevardnadze's credo comes not from Jefferson nor from Mr. Gorbachev but from Shota Rustaveli, the 12th-century Georgian poet who celebrated the independent spirit of his mountainous and violent land. It is a point aptly made by Carolyn McGiffert Ekedahl and Melvin Goodman, two former C.I.A. analysts, in their newly published book, "The Wars of Eduard Shevardnadze" (Penn State Press).
Georgia is a remarkably beautiful and self-destructive country. Tucked into the Caucasus, this tiny nation can claim an ancient literary tradition, a distinctive and accomplished culture and Josef Stalin. As a Soviet republic, it was long ruled and terrorized by Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's secret-police chief.
Before Mr. Shevardnadze joined Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow in 1985, he was the Communist boss of Georgia, a position he earned in part by running Georgia's internal security agencies in the 1960's with cold efficiency. He was not a notable defender of human rights in those days. But he did try to reduce corruption and ease Communist economic controls that were stifling the Georgian economy.
When he returned to Georgia in 1992 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, his homeland was near disintegration itself, convulsed by ethnic warfare and controlled by criminal gangs. Democratic governance was not a viable option, but Mr. Shevardnadze tried to exercise autocratic power in a fashion reminiscent of his days as internal affairs minister.
Mr. Shevardnadze embodies a curious blend of idealism and ruthlessness, principle and pragmatism. Clearly, a less steely man could not have held together Georgia or gone into the field to direct his supporters in combat, as he did a few years ago. He barely escaped assassination in 1995 when a car bomb exploded as he left the parliament building in Tbilisi.
Today he is the elected leader of a relatively stable, largely democratic and increasingly prosperous Georgia. It is nice to see that a bright smile has returned to his face. But it is worth remembering that Mr. Shevardnadze is not yet a candidate for canonization. PHILIP TAUBMAN

HEADLINE: Builders Start New Homes At Faster Pace

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Housing starts rose 4.8 percent in June, reversing a decline in the previous month and signaling that demand for homes could rebound as the economy enters the third quarter.
The Commerce Department said today that the annual rate of housing starts climbed to 1.452 million in June. Starts rose in the South, the Midwest and the West. 
 May's decline was revised to 6.6 percent from the previously reported 4.8 percent. In April, starts rose three-tenths of 1 percent; the initial report showed a decline in April.
Analysts said June's increase was probably the first of a series because milder weather, a rebound in demand and lean inventories would prompt builders to break new ground in the third quarter.
Permits for new housing construction fell 2.6 percent in June, to an annual pace of 1.395 million.
By region, starts rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in the Midwest, to a 294,000 rate; 11.2 percent in the South, to a 683,000 rate, and 1.1 percent in the West, to a 362,000 rate. They fell 6.6 percent in the Northeast, to a 113,000 rate.
Starts on single-family housing construction rose 2.6 percent, to a 1.11 million rate, while multifamily projects rose 12.9 percent, to a 342,000 rate.
Real estate markets have been bolstered by the highest levels of consumer confidence in the economy in decades, the lowest unemployment rate in a quarter-century and historic gains in the stock market. Home builders, like economists, are optimistic about the housing industry, a survey by the National Association of Home Builders showed.
Mortgage rates have declined steadily since mid-April. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 7.69 percent in June from 7.93 percent in May.
"With the fall in mortgage rates over the last few weeks, the housing sector will modestly contribute to overall economic growth" in the third quarter, said Stan Shipley, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. Mortgage refinancings should also rise, putting more money in consumers' pockets to spend, analysts said.
Separately, the Labor Department said that fewer American workers applied for state unemployment benefits last week, after a wave of claims in the prior week caused by auto plant closings.
First-time jobless claims decreased 28,000, to a seasonally adjusted 349,000, in the week ended Saturday. The four-week average for jobless claims, a less volatile gauge, rose to 348,750, from 348,500 the previous week. The last time the four-week average reached that level was in the week ended Jan. 18, when it stood at 349,500.

HEADLINE: Eye of the Beholder, Inc.;
Middleman of Waste Material, Mistakes and Leftovers

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
John Okun stood in a dark basement in Long Island City, Queens, waiting for someone to find the light switch. But he already knew what would be revealed: something odd or forgotten, wasted or unwanted. That's why he'd been called in on the case.
Mr. Okun is a middleman of misfits, ambassador to the abandoned. He recently resold 2,000 plastic bunny pinwheel toys for a Queens importer who was left with inventory when a brief fad ended, and more than 176,000 fortune cookies. They were baked for export, with fortunes in Dutch and German, but botched by a packaging misprint. Among his projects is a warehouse full of never-used car parts for 1940's Packards, Hudsons and De Sotos, still in the original boxes, and 2,400 safety dart sets, with no pointed tips. They are safe enough, but apparently not all that much fun. 
 In the Long Island City basement, the story was yarn, tons of it. The lights came up on a large room jammed with boxes and bags and skeins and spools in every imaginable color, much of it dating from the 1960's. It had been left behind by a sweater manufacturer whose business unraveled.
"Yarn, as far as the eye can see," Mr. Okun said, awed. He assured the building's owner, Ruth Shu, that there was indeed a market for 30-year-old remnants.
He knows. From his tiny office near La Guardia Community College, Mr. Okun runs what has become in this industrial corner of Queens a commercial halfway house and trading floor for the marginally marketable. He helps companies find takers for their waste products, leftovers and mistakes.
His three-person operation, Industrial Waste Recycling and Prevention, known as Inwrap, began four years ago as a low-budget government pilot project at the Long Island City Business Development Corporation. Financed by a combination of city, state and Federal money and private grants, with an annual budget of $130,000, the goal was to act as a matchmaking service: to help companies cut costs by matching their supply of industrial detritus -- plastic scrap, or wooden packing materials -- with the needs of another company that might be looking for just that sort of raw material.
It was not environmentalism, but economic development. One company would save on disposal costs, the other would save on supply costs, and both might be more likely to remain in New York.
It has worked well enough to save the mostly small companies here an average of $900,000 a year in waste disposal costs, and to become the model for a citywide waste and product exchange program now being set up by the city's Department of Sanitation, with Mr. Okun as consultant.
It also evolved, from its early focus on traditionally defined industrial waste, to things like old car parts and bunnies and dartboards, items from an economic netherworld that Mr. Okun calls "the edge of the market."
National waste experts say there is nothing quite like Mr. Okun's Inwrap service. Many waste exchange services are passively run warehouses at which companies or individuals look for what they need. The New York City service is aggressive, combing the Internet, among other sources, for leads. Many exchanges also operate primarily out of environmental motives; here, economics is the point.
But in the movement toward the re-use of materials, the experts say, unusual is common. Unlike recycling, in which waste items are broken down into components and remade, finding new uses for old items necessarily means piecing together an idiosyncratic local universe of supply and demand.
"They all seem to have formed in their own way, that's what's interesting," said David Goldbeck, who, with his wife, Nikki, is author of "Choose to Reuse" (Ceres Press, Woodstock, N.Y., 1995), a guide for buyers and sellers in the so-called after use market.
A state program in Vermont, for instance, takes in broken electronic appliances like VCR's, trains people to fix them, then sells them. Seattle collected old paint from its residents, mixed it together and cheerfully dubbed the drab result Seattle Gray, and used it for municipal buildings. Boston, in the midst of a construction boom, resells used building materials.
In an area of warehouses and low-rise brick just across the East River from midtown Manhattan, Mr. Okun's program offers a window into an economy of survivors. The giant, vertically integrated manufacturers that only a few years ago dominated places like Long Island City -- self-contained and full of resources and probably not in need of a service like Mr. Okun's -- are mostly gone, and even middle-sized ones are endangered. Swingline, the stapler manufacturer that is just a few blocks from Mr. Okun's office, recently announced plans to move its operation to Mexico.
Most of the companies that remain are small. Many are family owned, generations old, sometimes chaotic. They're incredibly diverse in their products, but also isolated, connected with their customers and suppliers, but not with one another, or with the city.
One thing that does connect them is Mr. Okun, a 40-year-old New Yorker who was raised mostly in nearby Jackson Heights. Local business people say that beyond the exchange of waste or products, the Inwrap service is helping build a commercial community.
One Queens company, Sequins International, produces millions of tiny glittering dots, scrap left over when the tiny hole in the center of each sequin is punched. The dots were going into the Dumpster. Mr. Okun connected the company with the New York City public school system, which will use the dots for art projects.
Another company, a manufacturer of paintbrush handles, was throwing away high quality hardwood beech and oak scraps. Through Mr. Okun, the company found Gregory Anderson and Kevin Nathaniel, two artists who pick up the wood, which they use to make mbiras, the small Zimbabwean musical instruments also known as thumb pianos. The company saves $270 a month on disposal costs and the waste service collects a percentage fee of the first year's savings.
Nestor Shipping Services, a second-generation Long Island City company, builds packing cases. It uses lumber from a Brooklyn pipe company that receives its pipe material in wood frames that it used to discard.
The waste program grew awkwardly into its role as middleman. Mr. Okun said he initially resisted when he began to get calls last year about things like perfectly good plastic bunnies that weren't technically waste. But he said he was feeling pressure, as government contributions declined, to become more self-supporting, and realized that broadening the way he helped companies would also help him. The waste service now makes up about 30 percent of its budget by collecting a fee from the savings it generates for companies, up from almost nothing a few years ago. "We realized that our purpose is to assist companies with materials that the marketplace has a hard time moving," Mr. Okun said. "We're the last resort."
The odd spaces of the marketplace are nothing new to Mr. Okun. His first job, at 16, was at Larchmont Sports, a shop that did trade-ins for ice skates. Mr. Okun said he learned how to estimate a price instantly on any pair of skates, and how to bring blades back to good as new in just a few strokes of the sharpener. In a way, it's still what he does, he said.
But there is often in Mr. Okun's work a tincture of economic tragedy in the buying and selling of failed results and leftovers. And some things, he has learned, really are garbage. No one, for example, seems to want scrap left over by a local commercial window shade manufacturer, because of the odd combination of plastics. And sometimes, even the help he can give is not enough. The import company with the unsalable bunnies ultimately went out of business. Mr. Okun, who sold the toys to small discount novelty stores around the city, was able only to moderate the company's losses.
There are personal victories, though, and moments when his vision of "industrial ecology" seems close to reality. The fortune cookies in German and Dutch were given to City Harvest, which distributes food to soup kitchens and shelters.
Mr. Anderson, the mbira maker, said the program resonates in another way. He takes his mbiras into New York's schools, and always tells where the wood came from.
"I try to make the connection with the kids between man, the earth, and technology, how we can take one man's leftovers and create another useful item," he said.
"I'm trying to get all my artist friends to use his services," he added, referring to Mr. Okun.
But the line between the unusable and the invaluable is more than just individual perspective. There's a time element as well. The 1940's vintage auto parts are probably worth more for having aged. They have vaulted from the utilitarian, Mr. Okun said, past the point of salvage, all the way to the status of antique.

HEADLINE: Departure Stirs Conflicting Reactions

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Around New York City yesterday, reactions to the resignation of W. Ann Reynolds as Chancellor of the City University of New York reflected sharp divisions of opinions about her, both within the system and outside it. Some insisted that her departure was a healthy step; others called it an outrage.
Lewis Rudin, the real estate developer and chairman of the Association for a Better New York, a business group, said he was saddened by the news. "I came to know her through the Association for a Better New York," he said. "The city of New York is a loser and the University of Alabama is a winner." 
 John Cardinal O'Connor, speaking through Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said that although he had not discussed the Alabama offer with Dr. Reynolds, "Her departure will be a loss to the city of New York." But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been critical recently of Dr. Reynolds, said, "I don't think the CUNY system is in very good shape right now."
And Chris Murphy, 26, a history graduate student at the City University Graduate Center, said he welcomed the departure because Dr. Reynolds was part of "a lot of political infighting which didn't serve the interest of the academic community well."
Taking a longer view was James P. Murphy, a former City University board chairman who worked closely with the Chancellor for the last seven years. He said Dr. Reynolds's resignation was inevitable, given the fact that 12 of the 15 trustees were newly appointed over the last year and had not hired her.
"It's a natural kind of thing for a huge group of people like this to want their own person," he said. One of the longtime Reynolds supporters on the board, Edith Everett, said, "I've seen a lot, but this is the worst." She said that Dr. Reynolds was hounded out of office by a newly reshaped board of trustees. Ms. Everett, who has been a trustee for nearly 20 years, said that Dr. Anne A. Paolucci and Herman Badillo, the chairwoman and vice chairman of the City University board, had put Dr. Reynolds in "a horrible situation."
Dr. Paolucci and Mr. Badillo have strongly suggested in recent weeks that Dr. Reynolds resign, accusing her of withholding information from trustees, failing to uphold academic standards, tolerating grade inflation and governing in an autocratic manner. They said that they had a majority on the board to oust her, but that they would not do anything until the fall. Dr. Paolucci, an English professor from St. John's University in Queens, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Mr. Badillo said mildly that he wished Dr. Reynolds well in Alabama.
Kenneth Sherrill, a member of the faculty senate and professor of political science at Hunter College, said the die was cast for Dr. Reynolds's departure with the election of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Giuliani. "They appointed these trustees and the trustees put her in an untenable position," he said.
Professor Sherrill praised Dr. Reynolds for challenging the Governor on budget matters. "She had the courage of her convictions, and manifestly risked her job for the sake of the university," he said. "Of course it was political."
But Alfred B. Curtis Jr., another newly appointed trustee, said the conflict between Dr. Reynolds and the board was not political and that "Chancellor Reynolds could have kept her job if she had been willing to stay on." John J. Calandra, one of the newly appointed trustees, agreed, saying that "there's no Republican or Democratic way to run a university."
Several of those interviewed yesterday speculated about what might be Dr. Reynolds's legacy. Mr. Murphy, the former City University board chairman, said that her greatest achievement was the College Preparatory Initiative, aimed at increasing the number of academic courses that high school students take, to help ease pressure on City University to offer expensive remedial classes.
"It was her initiative and the board's support that made it possible," Mr. Murphy said.
Mr. Calandra, who said he thought it was "time for the Chancellor to go," nevertheless said that her "forcefulness" in such matters as requiring greater productivity by faculty members would be remembered.
Professor Sherrill, who was a sharp critic of Dr. Reynolds at first but later came to admire her, said: "She was the first chancellor to run the university as a system rather than a collection of schools. Centralizing authority is never a popular activity, but she had the strength to do it."

HEADLINE: Clinton, in 2 Speeches, Urges Racial Healing

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 17

 BODY:
In the hope of building support for his initiative on racial healing at home, President Clinton played sociology professor today, repeatedly strolling away from his prepared remarks to take two audiences on discursive tours of ethnic conflicts around the world.
Before the annual meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists here tonight, Mr. Clinton wondered at the violence between Serbs and Croatians, noting that the combatants were "interestingly enough, biologically indistinguishable." And earlier today in Pittsburgh, he told the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that in Northern Ireland, "my people still argue over what happened 600 years ago." 
 Along the way, the President emphasized that he expects the advisory board on race that he appointed last month to focus on differences among many races and ethnic groups. While he referred briefly tonight to the need to "deal with unfinished business" between blacks and whites, he placed far more emphasis on whether, as he put it here, "we really can become one America as we become more diverse" in the next century.
Earlier this week, John Hope Franklin, the history professor whom Mr. Clinton picked as chairman of the panel, stressed a different approach. At the panel's first meeting on Monday, Mr. Franklin demurred when another member said that the group should focus on "multiracialism" during its yearlong review. Mr. Franklin maintained that it should emphasize black-white relations because that was where "this country cut its eyeteeth."
White House aides dismissed the difference as mere nuance, saying that the panel would ultimately address both subjects. But, together with a tart comment from Mr. Franklin about Mr. Clinton's approach to promoting the race initiative, it suggested that the panel would probably try to maintain some independence from the White House.
The President's major address of the day was in Pittsburgh, where in 40 minutes he sought to encompass his hopes for improving schools, fighting crime, increasing homeownership and improving relations among racial and ethnic groups.
Indeed, Mr. Clinton delivered one of his trademark, omnivorous speeches, declaring at one point, "The last thing I want to say is that we've got to send our children to schools that are safe and drug free," before adding moments later, "And, lastly, let me say, in addition to that, if you look at what this modern economy requires, we must open the doors of college education to every single American by the year 2000."
A senior aide to the President remarked later that there were "three or four good speeches in there."
But even before he delivered his speech, Mr. Clinton was criticized by Mr. Franklin for making his first major address on his race initiative -- since announcing it in June -- to a black audience. "The white side has been in control of virtually everything, so they're the ones who need educating on what justice and equality mean," Mr. Franklin said in an interview with The Associated Press.
Asked about that criticism, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said the President intended to deliver "the same message in front of different types of audiences."
In response to a question here, Mr. Clinton predicted a public backlash against efforts in California and Texas to roll back affirmative action because of the abrupt drop in admissions of minorities to professional schools in those states.
As he was when he addressed the N.A.A.C.P. convention during the Presidential campaign a year ago, Mr. Clinton was enthusiastically received there today. In introducing him, the organization's chairwoman, Myrlie Evers-Williams, declared, "We cherish you, we welcome you into our arms and hearts again."
He was also warmly greeted with a standing ovation by the black journalists here tonight.
Before both groups, the President dwelled on his goals for education in poor communities. In his speech to the N.A.A.C.P., he again urged national, voluntary standards in reading and math, saying that children in impoverished schools would be able to meet them.
"I am tired of being told that children cannot succeed because of the difficulties of their circumstances," he continued, to applause. "All we do is consign them to staying in the same circumstances. It is wrong."
Mr. Clinton called for a $350 million program over five years to provide scholarships and other assistance to help train teachers who agree to serve at least three years in poor urban and rural school districts.
"We will have a special emphasis on recruiting minorities into teaching, because while a third of our students are minority, only 13 percent of their teachers are," he said.
Turning to racial reconciliation, the President argued that in a "global society," the diversity of the United States would be asset. He asked his overwhelmingly black audience why the United States was well-positioned to do business in Africa, then answered his own question: "Because of you."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trade and Stocks Hurt Dollar, But Upward Trend Is Still Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower in seesaw trading yesterday, hurt by a Japanese minister's forecast of higher Japanese interest rates, news of a swollen United States trade deficit and a selloff in the stock market.
But traders said the underlying trend for the dollar remained up. They noted the currency was rebounding as dealings ended for the week and that the dollar's levels were substantially higher than a week earlier. 
 An assertion by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany that he was not concerned about the dollar's recent advance to six-year highs against the mark also helped underpin the dollar.
"The dollar was strengthening as we came to a close," said Debra Larsen, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Commerzbank in New York. "The signals are still there that this is not a market ready to turn against the dollar."
The dollar settled at 115.57 yen in New York, down from 116.07 Thursday but up from 114.02 yen a week earlier. Against the mark, the dollar settled at 1.7927 marks, down from 1.7941 marks but up from 1.7744 marks a week earlier. The pound settled at $1.6777, up from $1.6722, but down from $1.6946 a week earlier.
The dollar initially weakened in early Asian dealings after Trade Minister Shinji Sato of Japan said the recovery in Japan's economy would lead to higher interest rates.
Mr. Sato also said that he did not see any benefits to the current interest rate policy, which has left Japanese rates at record lows for nearly two years. Low rates have contributed to the yen's weakness.
The dollar later strengthened briefly against the yen when the Commerce Department reported the May trade deficit with Japan fell 25 percent, to $3.6 billion, less than expected.
But the dollar quickly retreated on details of the broader trade report, which showed the overall deficit shot up to $10.2 billion on record imports and a particularly large surge of Chinese goods.
Traders said the dollar was further hurt by the first big drop in the United States stock market this month. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.31 points, to 7,890.46, erasing all the week's gains.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Dip Before Greenspan Testifies

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices declined for a second consecutive session yesterday, primarily because of concern over the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, before Congress next week.
The 30-year Treasury benchmark bond dropped 15/32, to a price of 101 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.52 percent, from 6.49 percent on Thursday. 
 Supply also played a role in trading as securities firms prepared for next week's Government sale of $27 billion in two-year and five-year notes, which will be in addition to the regular weekly bill auction. The bill auctions will total $16 billion.
Mr. Greenspan will deliver his semiannual testimony on the state of the economy to the House Banking Committee on Tuesday and the Senate committee on Wednesday. In the past, his remarks have either soothed investors' fears about Fed intentions or sent them scurrying for cover.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said some of the data released yesterday, particularly consumer confidence figures, had caused some concern that the strength of those figures "could lead Greenspan to hint that a late year short-term interest rate hike cannot be ruled out." He added, " With all the bullishness that has recently engulfed the market, such talk could stop the latest rally in its tracks."
"The good news, however," Mr. Chan said, "is that with inflation at the wholesale and consumer level under strict control, it is unlikely that Greenspan will deliver any bombshell announcements about a pending immediate rate hike. Instead, his comments are only likely to state that the Fed would consider raising rates only if demand pressures intensify later in the year.
"Such talk is likely to provide encouragement for both bulls and bears. The bond market bulls will conclude that since the economy is not likely to bounce back, the Fed will remain on hold, while bears will use his pronouncement as proof that the Fed is not likely to remain on hold indefinitely."
A report yesterday on consumer confidence for mid-July from the University of Michigan showed a sharp rise from June. The index provided strong evidence that the pause in consumption during the second quarter would very likely not persist much longer. The university's index of consumer sentiment in July rose to 106.4 from 104.5 in June.
Traders also said the market reacted only mildly to a report showing that the United States trade deficit widened more than expected in May to $10.2 billion because it merely confirmed earlier reports that economic growth slowed in the second quarter.
"Greenspan may talk the vigilant talk," said Alan Levenson, a senior vice president and director of research at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, "but neither he nor the market will walk the vigilant walk until they see the whites of the eyes of economic revival."
"From a bond market perspective, it seems too late to get long," he continued, "since significantly lower interest rates depend on further economic deceleration and accompanying thoughts of a cut in the funds rate, which we do not envision."
Elsewhere, in when-issued trading ahead of next week's note sales, the two-year Treasury issue was offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.14 percent. Both were a few basis points higher than the previous day. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

HEADLINE: Gore Defends Budget Plans As a Priority

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Criticizing "out-of-date dogmas," Vice President Gore today defended the Clinton Administration's drive for a balanced budget against liberals in his party who say that strict balance is less important than investment and economic growth.
In an appearance before the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Mr. Gore argued that the Government needed to erase the Federal deficit both to keep interest rates in check and to send a message that Government can be responsible. 
 He called balancing the budget important "not because it's a totem to worship, but because after decades of sheer fiscal recklessness we Americans need to reaffirm our capacity for self-discipline."
While he never mentioned his rival by name, Mr. Gore was clearly answering Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who is expected to challenge the Vice President for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.
Mr. Gephardt has been crafting an economic policy sharply distinct from the Administration's. He has said the nation could afford a budget deficit of up to 1 percent of the gross domestic product to allow more spending to generate faster economic growth rates.
Mr. Gore sought to counter that argument on friendly ground, before a group formed in the 1980's to lobby for a more centrist Democratic Party. He spoke of those who "say the economy is so strong that we can just sit on our hands and let the budget balance itself or that 'almost' should count for budgets as well as horseshoes."
"Let's not kid ourselves," the Vice President said. "If we're really serious about restoring people's basic faith in their Government and showing that we can get a job done, if we are really serious about leading the nations of the world into an era of fiscal discipline and responsibility, then we cannot be satisfied until the deficit is brought down to zero."
Mr. Gore's address was the latest salvo in a battle to define the face of the post-Clinton Democratic Party. Today the Vice President sought to make his argument persuasive not only to his party's moderates but also to its liberals.
Noting that the retirement of the baby boom generation would begin to drain more Government dollars in the next decade, Mr. Gore said, "we must also face up to the fact that without a balanced budget today there may be no progressive activist government tomorrow."
Mr. Gore indirectly took on Mr. Gephardt over trade policy as well, calling for Congress to grant President Clinton renewed flexibility to negotiate future trade agreements.
"With 95 percent of the world's consumers living outside of our borders how can we cut ourselves off from the world?" Mr. Gore said.
Mr. Gephardt, along with organized labor, has been critical of the Administration's free trade policies.
Venturing into one area where the Democrats are united, Mr. Gore attacked the Republican approach to tax cutting, accusing Republicans of advocating tax reductions that help the wealthy.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Is 17% Wider: Record Imports, Dip in Exports

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit grew 17 percent in May as the strong economy drew in a record level of imports while exports fell slightly, the Commerce Department reported today.
The gap between exports and imports grew to $10.23 billion, from $8.75 billion in April, the department said, a bigger increase in the deficit than analysts had expected. 
 The deficit with Japan narrowed for the month, but the deficits with Canada, Mexico and China all expanded, underscoring the continued political sensitivity of trade policy as the Clinton Administration pushes to eliminate more trade barriers.
The drop in exports suggested that the economy might have been growing more slowly than economists had believed in the spring. After growing 5.9 percent in the first quarter, the economy cooled off considerably in the second quarter, and probably expanded at no more than a 2 percent pace in the period, economists said.
If there was good news in the results, it was that the trade imbalance reflected in part the continuing stronger performance of the American economy relative to most of its major trading partners. Not only is the United States enjoying steady growth with low inflation and low unemployment -- factors that help create demand for imports -- but also the dollar is strong, making imports relatively cheaper and exports more expensive to foreign buyers.
"As long as we remain the strongest industrial economy in the world, we're going to have an awful lot of trouble trying to narrow this trade gap," said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at the First Union Bank in Philadelphia. "We have an insatiable demand, not just for consumer goods but for capital goods as well, and our growth rates are just not being matched by our trading partners."
Exports in May fell slightly, to $77.2 billion from $77.9 billion in April, the second consecutive monthly decline. Imports increased from $86.6 billion in April to $87.5 billion in May, the fourth consecutive month in which imports have reached a new high.
Putting a positive spin on the numbers, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said that through the first five months of the year, overall trade balances improved for manufacturing and services, but that price swings in food and energy hurt the balances in those categories by an even greater amount.
"While we are disappointed that the overall trade deficit has widened so far this year, there are quite a few positive things to say about the trade developments in 1997," Mr. Daley said. "All in all, the U.S. remains very competitive in world trade."
The deficit with Japan, long the most politically sensitive gauge of trade performance, narrowed to $3.63 billion, from $4.84 billion in April, although the gap for the first five months of the year remained higher than it was in the first five months of last year. But the gap with China, which is rapidly overtaking the deficit with Japan both in size and political significance, rose to $3.76 billion from $3.45 billion. It was only the third time that the monthly deficit with China exceeded that with Japan.
Mr. Daley said he would travel to China in the fall in an effort to convince Chinese officials of the need to do more to open their markets if they want to join the World Trade Organization and avoid heightened economic tensions with the United States.
"China's economy has been growing at double-digit rates, but its imports from the U.S. and the rest of the world do not reflect that," Mr. Daley said. "China's market, as we have said repeatedly, is too closed to exports, and we must make every effort to open this market to U.S. goods and U.S. services."
The deficit with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner, rose to $1.74 billion, from $853 million in April. The deficit with Mexico rose to $1.70 billion from $1.39 billion.
The expanding deficits with Canada and Mexico have become troublesome to the Administration as its seeks to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement, first to Chile and eventually to other nations.
A report to Congress from the White House last week said the trade agreement had so far brought modest economic benefits to the United States and would prove more beneficial in the long run. But labor unions, environmentalists and other critics of the pact assert that there is no case for expanding it, and point to the expansion of the deficits with Canada and Mexico as evidence that it has failed to help American interests.
Mr. Daley defended American trade with Canada as "doing quite nicely," saying exports to that country are up 12 percent this year. He said trade with Mexico was "booming," with exports up 21 percent this year as the Mexican economy showed signs of increasing growth.
The Commerce Department said the largest decreases in exports were in telecommunications equipment and industrial machinery, cars and parts and industrial supplies. The largest increases in imports came in aircraft, computer accessories, cars and parts and crude oil.

HEADLINE: Stanley to Cut 4,700 Jobs In Revamping

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Stanley Works, the hand tool and hardware products maker, announced a much-expected revamping yesterday that will cut 24 percent of its work force, or about 4,700 jobs, as it seeks to refocus its business.
The company said it would close or sell 53 of its 123 manufacturing plants and distribution centers worldwide. The company declined to identify which plants in the United States it would eliminate but said that less than 1 percent of its employees in Connecticut would be affected. The company, based in New Britain, Conn., employs 19,000 workers, 1,850 of them in Connecticut and 12,000 in the United States. 
 Stanley's chairman and chief executive, John M. Trani, indicated that there would be an overhaul when he took over the company in January.
Mr. Trani's arrival has raised expectations for Stanley, which faces much competition in a price-sensitive and fragmented market. He previously ran the General Electric Company's medical systems division for 10 years, expanding it abroad and improving revenues and profits. Indeed, since January, Stanley's stock price has risen 70 percent.
"With John Trani's arrival, I felt there was going to be a narrowing in the gap between the company's potential and its performance," said Gregory A. Nejmeh, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
But yesterday, shares of Stanley fell $2.0625, to $44.4375. Analysts said the stock fell in part because of its recent run-up and because the company also announced a loss for the second quarter.
Analysts said the job cuts were necessary as part of the streamlining but were only a start.
"Stanley has a very fine, long-term record going back many decades," said Jonathan L. Goldfarb, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "But in the mid-to-late 80's the company's performance began to slip somewhat in part because it was so well entrenched in its markets and so insulated in New Britain, Conn., that they were really never forced into a painful and radical restructuring program that was forced on so many other companies by global and economic realities."
Stanley said yesterday that it would eliminate 110 manufacturing jobs over the next 12 months at its hardware packaging unit in New Britain, but would add 120 salaried positions at its headquarters as it consolidated some operations. The company had previously announced that 150 jobs would be lost when it transferred some production to Richmond, Va., from New Britain.
"To grow, we must be competitive," Mr. Trani said. "That starts by becoming the low-cost provider. In the case of our central Connecticut operations, this necessitates product transfers to lower-cost locations and resulting work force reductions."
Stanley plans to streamline sales, distribution and administrative operations and to increase spending on new-product development and advertising to maximize the potential of its products and brand name.
The company also said it would take $240 million in charges before taxes against second- and third-quarter earnings to pay for the revamping, including $137 million in the most recent quarter. It will also have $100 million in transaction costs related to the reorganization.
As a result of the charge, the company reported a loss of $65 million, or 72 cents a share, for the second quarter, compared with a profit of $33 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell to $674 million from $677 million.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble, Wiping Out Week's Gains

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market plunged yesterday in a broad selloff, just two days after the Dow Jones industrial average breached the 8,000-point level.
There was heavy selling throughout the day, as technology shares and blue-chip stocks closed out an historic week by reversing much of their gains. 
 The Dow plummeted 130.31 points, or 1.62 percent, to close at 7,890.46. For the week, the Dow lost 31.36 points. But for the year, the blue-chip average is up 22.3 percent.
Analysts said technology shares were upset by Microsoft, which reported earnings that were slightly better than expected after the market closed Thursday. The giant software company also said revenues could slow in the new fiscal year that began on July 1.
Microsoft, which often beats estimates by wide margins, had gained 20 points in the previous four sessions. Yesterday, its shares fell 815/16 , to 140 1/2.
A University of Michigan report, showing that consumer confidence hit record levels in the first half of July, created some inflation worries in the bond market, helping push interest rates higher.
"There's a tendency of the market to react even to the little bits of news that come out," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston. "The consumer attitudes were a little steamy and there was some fear that might pick up into inflation."
But Mr. Riley said there was also a rising concern among some investors that inflation might dissipate into deflation, which means that pricing power could erode to the point where corporate profits will suffer.
Yesterday, the selling pressure came shortly after the opening bell. Some of the losses -- and part of the volatility that helped the Dow plunge 145 points early in the day -- were attributed to heavy program trading and "double witching," the expiration of some options on stocks and stock indexes.
But Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a research firm that tracks program trading, said program trades only accelerated a trend that was already in the market.
"There's a lot of hesitancy out there because we're at high levels and high valuations," Mr. Birinyi said. "This is a market that's down because there's widespread selling."
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.31, to 915.30, and the Russell 2000 fell 2.22, to 405.89.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 -- which tracks the largest companies in the Nasdaq composite -- fell even more steeply, down 2.2 percent, as several high-flying technology stocks retreated after two weeks of soaring prices.
"The principal news may well have been the Microsoft news, where they hit their estimate but didn't exceed it," said Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer at the U.S. Trust Company. "That's a news item that did take a little energy out of the tech stocks."
Shares of Compaq Computer, Motorola and America Online were also hit hard after sharp run-ups in recent days. Compaq, which had gained 24 points in the previous two weeks, fell 315/16 , to 128 1/8. Motorola lost 7, to 82, and America Online was down 3 3/4, to 64, after being downgraded to "recommend list" from "priority list"by Goldman, Sachs.
I.B.M. was the only Dow stock to gain, climbing 4 7/8 points, to 104 1/2, after its shares were upgraded by Merrill Lynch ahead of next week's earnings report. Trading in I.B.M., at 11.6 million shares, was nearly three times the average volume.
Within the Dow, 27 stocks lost ground, with Procter & Gamble leading the way, down 45/16 , to 148 3/4. Du Pont lost 3 1/4, to 62 1/4.
Drug, financial and technology shares -- among the year's best performers -- saw heavy losses yesterday, as did energy shares. On the Big Board, losers beat winners by a margin of more than than 2 to 1.
After this week's Consumer Price Index release, which showed inflation growing at its slowest pace in 11 years, investors' attention shifted to whether the market is overvalued.
Since mid-April, when the market began rising out of a swift, monthlong downturn, the Dow and S.& P. 500 have both seen gains of 23 percent. And big-capitalization technology shares have gained even more, culminating in records for all the major indexes this week.
Indeed, when the Dow peaked on Wednesday at 8,038.88, it had gained 50 percent in 12 months, the second- sharpest rise in a one-year period. The best run ended in June 1983, when the Dow had surged 57 percent in the previous 12 months.
The recent run-up has many on Wall Street talking about a "classic blowoff," a period when prices rise too sharply, too quickly in what many consider a danger sign.
"Prices have outrun their sensible structure," said Justin Mamis, a technical analyst who has followed the market since the 1950's. "They've become emotional, speculative almost."
Although many on Wall Street are talking about an ideal economy, Mr. Mamis said he was worried about rising consumer debt, and deteriorating pricing power, or the inability of companies to raise prices.
"It isn't the best of all possible worlds," he said. "There are problems beginning to seep out."
But many analysts contend that the market is being driven by investors who continue to pour billions into mutual funds, as well as an outlook of strong earnings and low inflation.
So, yesterday's selloff, rather than being the onset of a severe downturn, is in the eyes of some analysts a time to rest and contemplate the next move. "After pushing over 8,000 we're just taking a little rest," said Mr. Taylor at U.S. Trust. "This kind of correction today is just a normal midsummer interlude."

HEADLINE: Technology's Towers Invade the Forest

BYLINE: By Keith Schneider; Keith Schneider, a former New York Times national correspondent, is executive director of the Michigan Land Use Institute.

DATELINE: BENZONIA, Mich.

 BODY:
Of all the emblems of the modern economy now invading rural America -- freeways, strip malls, giant subdivisions -- none seemed so benign as the electronic cottage.
Urban professionals who migrated to the country thought they could stay in touch with the urban world through phone, fax and Internet without disturbing their solitude or ruining the scenery. 
 How naive. Here in heavily forested northwest Michigan, the social and environmental costs of the communications revolution are quickly becoming apparent.
A regional wireless phone company, N.P.I. Wireless, has proposed building a 250-foot tower on Benzie County's most prominent forested summit. The tower is designed to carry an array of antennas and receivers for so-called personal communications services, the new wireless technology that its proponents say is superior to cellular phones.
Benzie County instituted a moratorium on such towers, and rejected the company's proposal. But the company has sued and, if a settlement is not reached, will probably win it case -- eventually.
That's because the company can cite the Telecommunications Act, which the White House and Congress teamed up with the wireless industry to pass in 1996. Hailed as the definitive statement of Washington's desire to promote flexibility, innovation and competition, the act was supposed to help speed up the development of the wireless telecommunications industry. But Washington, by taking the industry under its wing, has kicked local governments in the teeth, and created a formidable backlash to its plans.
On the way to passage, lobbyists for the wireless industry quietly made sure that local opposition to the unsightly towers would be blocked. They persuaded Congress to write new rules that drastically limited the authority local governments had to oversee land use.
The Telecommunications Act makes it illegal for local governments to reject new towers. The law also makes it difficult, and in many cases impossible, for communities to restrict the size, location, appearance or number of towers.
The law, however, includes one loophole. Congress directed communities to speed review of new tower applications.
This provision, though, was ambiguous enough to invite a successful challenge. In 1996, a Federal District judge in Washington State ruled that it was legal for the city of Medina to institute a temporary moratorium on building towers to give planners time to update the zoning ordinance.
Since then, some 300 other communities have established moratoriums. The industry has appealed the practice to the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to issue a ruling this summer.
There are many reasons for local governments to be wary of these towers. The technology uses an extremely high frequency on the radio spectrum. As a result, signals don't travel very far and antennas generally must be within five or six miles of one another. That means, industry experts say, as many as 120,000 new antennas will be needed throughout the country.
In cities, most antennas will be hung on existing communications towers, or fixed to tall buildings. But in the countryside, thousands of new communications towers may be needed. In Benzie County, which currently has three towers, there could be perhaps as many as a dozen.
In an era when leaders of both parties have declared the end to big government, the Telecommunications Act is an old-fashioned abrogation of power. But by seeking to cut citizens out of important decisions affecting their communities, the law has led to exceedingly polarized fights. Unsurprisingly, there have been Federal court battles in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Washington State and Wisconsin.
And in late June, wireless providers, blaming lawsuits and other problems, notified the F.C.C. that they were in danger of defaulting on billions of dollars in government loans.
Had the decisions about the towers been handled the old-fashioned way, through public debate, maybe these delays could have been avoided. The question is, Will anyone in Washington listen?

HEADLINE: Court Sets Back F.C.C. Efforts To Open Local Phone Markets

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
An appeals court struck down key elements of the Federal Communications Commission's rules for opening local telephone markets to competition yesterday, adding yet another obstacle to the already rocky landscape of telecommunications regulation.
The Federal appeals court ruling could further slow the introduction of unbridled competition -- and the lower prices expected to result from that competition -- in the nation's telecommunications business, because it would allow states to develop different mechanisms for bringing new companies into the market rather than following uniform F.C.C. guidelines. 
 The F.C.C. rules, which were issued last year and were immediately challenged by state regulators and several local telephone companies, governed the terms by which local phone companies were to let competitors connect to their networks. But yesterday the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, said the commission had overstepped the bounds of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
The law "plainly grants the state commissions, not the F.C.C., the authority to determine the rates involved in the implementation of the local competition provisions of the act," wrote Judge David R. Hansen in the unanimous opinion. The other judges were Pasco M. Bowman and Roger L. Wollman.
The F.C.C. said it intended to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. But if the circuit court's ruling stands, companies that want to offer local telephone service across the country will have to negotiate a potential hodgepodge of regulatory environments rather than follow a single national strategy.
The rules had not yet gone into effect, because the appeals court had put a stay on them while the appeal was pending. And so the immediate effect was simply to uphold the status quo in the local telephone marketplace.
But by rejecting the commission's guidelines, some telecommunications experts said, the ruling would indefinitely delay the introduction of full competition in local markets -- and the lower prices that were expected to result.
"This further endangers the development of competition in telecommunications," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. "The court ruling leaves a patchwork of state proceedings that have been cumbersome, moving slowly and not generating competitive alternatives for local phone service."
The ruling was not only a major setback for the F.C.C., but also for the big long-distance companies, like AT&T and MCI Communications, that are trying to offer local service nationwide. The F.C.C. had argued, in part, that state commissions might unfairly favor the interests of incumbent local telephone companies, which may employ thousands of local voters, over those of a long-distance company, which could be based thousands of miles away.
"The fundamental principle of a level playing field was rejected by the Eighth Circuit," said the F.C.C.'s chairman, Reed E. Hundt. "For the first time in the history of the Federal Communications Commission, a court has ruled that when Congress writes a specific statute that we do not necessarily have the authority to write a rule to implement it."
But Laurence H. Tribe, the Harvard law professor who helped the local telephone companies develop their legal strategy, said that F.C.C. rule makers had "imposed a regime that replaced the market with regulatory specification at so many points in the process that they did not really represent what Congress had in mind."
An AT&T executive said the court's ruling was a blow to local competition. "From a practical perspective, we think it's important to have as much uniformity as possible across the various states," said Mark Rosenblum, AT&T's vice president for law and public policy. "We are disappointed that the court continued to see it in a different light."
Last year's Telecommunications Act was meant to hasten the entry of long-distance companies into the local market, and vice versa. Under the terms of the law, the Bell operating companies, like Nynex in the Northeast and Ameritech in the Midwest, will be allowed to offer long-distance service within their regions once there is significant competition in their local service markets.
Trying to jump-start such competition, the F.C.C. issued a set of rules last summer that laid out how states were to determine the price new entrants into the local market would pay to connect with the existing local telephone networks.
The Bell companies and other large local operators like GTE and Southern New England Telephone rebelled against the rules, saying that the F.C.C. guidelines would not allow them to recoup the full cost of providing service. As such, the companies said, competitors would be allowed into their market with an unfair economic advantage.
State commissioners, meanwhile, argued that their right to regulate intrastate communications was being trampled by Washington.
As for Bell entry into the long-distance market, the F.C.C. has not certified that extensive local competition exists in any of the Bell company areas. That means that while many business customers can order local telephone service from alternative providers like Worldcom or Teleport Communications, most residential consumers still have only one choice: the local phone company.
William P. Barr, the former United States Attorney General who is now general counsel of GTE, was triumphant yesterday.
"There was a complete victory on the jurisdictional argument that it should be the states that should be setting the prices, not the F.C.C.," said Mr. Barr, who argued the plaintiffs' case before the Eighth Circuit in January. "The primary problem with the regulations was that it set wholesale prices in the states and that it set those prices far too low from the local companies' standpoint."
On Capitol Hill, at least one influential lawmaker, who had argued that the Telecommunications Act did not go far enough to encourage competition, saw a glimmer of hope in yesterday's ruling.
"This is a very serious setback to the F.C.C.'s overall regulatory plan and to the act itself," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. "It may mean that we'll have to look at going back to square one or not."
"The decision was correct," he added. "But what I would like to see is a deregulated environment where nobody sets the prices, where the marketplace sets the prices."

HEADLINE: Iowa Insurer Settles Class-Action Suit

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, July 18

 BODY:
The Equitable of Iowa Companies said today that it had agreed to a $22 million settlement of a lawsuit contending that it misled life insurance customers.
The company was one of several insurers nationwide named in class-action lawsuits for sales tactics that became popular in the 1980's as insurance companies faced growing competition from mutual funds, stockbrokers and other providers of financial services. 
 Equitable and other insurers were accused of promoting life insurance as a savings plan and of churning, or replacing policies, to generate new commissions. The lawsuits also contended that improper charges were imposed on policies to pay annual fees and other costs.
The lawsuits said that agents of Equitable of Iowa and other insurers made deceptive sales talks that led customers to believe that their policies would generate enough dividend income to cover annual premiums. The projections were based on overly optimistic projections of interest rates, the lawsuits contended.
Equitable of Iowa denied the accusations but agreed to settle. A court hearing on approval of the agreement is expected late this year, the company said.
Owners of about 130,000 life insurance policies issued by Equitable of Iowa from 1984 through 1996 could be eligible for benefits under the settlement. The benefits include increased interest and dividend payments, reduced-rate loans and enhanced annuities and life insurance policies.
The company said it would mail notices to affected policyholders by Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: Surplus Issue Puts Solution On a Budget Further Off

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 18

 BODY:
State leaders appear further from agreement on a state budget than they were a week or two ago, after the Pataki administration concluded that budget talks were pointing toward huge deficits in future years, and insisted on holding more than $500 million in reserve until next year.
The Governor proposed the reserve fund last week and offered a promise that all of it would be used for school aid in the 1998-99 fiscal year, said administration officials and legislative aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. Legislators of both parties objected to the plan, which would mean less money to spend right away on school aid and tax cuts. 
 A month ago, state officials were confident that it would be relatively easy to reach a 1997-98 budget agreement because this year's decisions were about how much to spend, and not what to cut, as in past years. The state is flush with cash, thanks largely to the boom on Wall Street. Budget negotiators concluded that there was $2.6 billion more available to spend than Gov. George E. Pataki had counted on when he released his proposed $66.3 billion budget in January.
But when the Governor and legislative leaders sat down to decide how to spend the money, it appeared that all of the additional money would go toward expenses, like tax cuts and school spending, whose impact on the budget would likely grow rapidly in future years. Also, the proposals for a relatively fat budget this year were based in part on a $1.7 billion surplus left over from last year, meaning that the state would spend more than it would take in this year, a formula for future deficits.
The talks, aides to Mr. Pataki said, were leading toward a $4.5 billion budget gap, or greater, in 1998-99, which would have to be closed in a gubernatorial election year. That led to the proposal, made last week, to hold back more than $500 million.
Both the Democrats who control the Assembly and the Republicans who run the Senate were furious, their aides said, and the leaders accused the Governor of reneging on tentative agreements on how much to spend in each category.
The Governor's position is similar to that of independent budget analysts, like the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission and bond rating agencies, which argued that the state ought to keep a larger cushion for a sudden economic downturn.
The budget was supposed to be in place by the start of the fiscal year on April 1.
On another budgeting issue, the Giuliani administration and New York City Board of Education have stepped up their lobbying efforts in Albany to get the state to pay more than $600 million that it owes the city in education aid from prior years.
City officials say that they do not expect the state to repay all of the money this year, but that they want the budget to include a substantial payment. They also are pushing the state to agree on a schedule for repaying the rest, which has accumulated since 1989.
In budget negotiations, Mr. Pataki has proposed repaying $35 million in the coming year, a figure that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is likely to reject as too low.
The unpaid school aid is for school construction, handicapped and prekindergarten students and other programs, most of which are required under state law and which the state is supposed to help finance. Board of Education officials say that unless the state pays a lot of the overdue aid in the coming year, the city will have to cut education spending.

HEADLINE: Battles Over Lawyer Advertising Divide the Bar

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., July 16

 BODY:
Ron Bell's face is too big to miss on the highway billboard that advertises his legal services on one side and on the other, Pizza Hut. This year, someone shot an arrow right between his smiling eyes. For weeks it stuck there, like an emblem of the backlash over lawyer advertising that has divided the legal community here and across the country.
Mr. Bell, a personal injury lawyer whose small stature and extravagant appetite for publicity are legendary in New Mexico, was not fazed by the use of his forehead for target practice. 
 "I got great free radio on that," he recalled with glee as he drove past his sign on I-25 in a white Mercedes with NM LAW license plates. "I was the very first lawyer billboard in America." He also claims the first full-page ad in the Yellow Pages of the U S West telephone directory and the first lawyer ad on MTV.
But 20 years after the United States Supreme Court opened the door to lawyer advertising on First Amendment grounds, the establishment trial bar is trying to crack down on maverick competitors like Mr. Bell. The lawyers disciplinary board of the New Mexico Supreme Court has slapped him with a year's probation and threatened him with disbarment for violating its legal advertising rules, and he is fighting back with a Federal suit.
It is one of many such battles being waged around the country as the old-line leaders of disciplinary boards and state bar associations from Florida and Nevada to Iowa and New York try to rein in their more freewheeling colleagues. Depending on one's perspective, they are part of a last-ditch struggle for the soul of the legal profession, or a crass conflict for economic advantage by the old-boys' club, waged at the expense of free speech principles.
"Lawyer advertising adversely affects the respect the public has for the judicial system and the administration of justice," said Richard Ransom, the retired chief justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court who spearheaded the adoption of tough advertising rules in 1992.
Victor Marshall, who is representing Mr. Bell in his Federal suit against the board, which ruled that some of Mr. Bell's ads could be misleading, countered: "The rules are unconstitutional as written and even more so as applied. Members of the public have seen his ads five hundred million times without ever claiming that they were misled. The only people who actually complained are other lawyers."
A changing and even contradictory patchwork of state regulations governs lawyer advertising, but since the 1977 Bates v. State Bar of Arizona decision, the country's highest court has repeatedly held that the content of lawyer advertising cannot be constitutionally restricted except to prevent false, deceptive or misleading communication. Nevertheless, many state bar regulators have used those parameters to try to govern everything from the kind of music allowed in a lawyer commercial to the exact size of a disclaimer like "lawyer advertisement."
Lawyer advertising has grown every year since the 1977 decision, according to William Hornsby, director of the American Bar Association's Commission on Advertising. Television advertising by lawyers reached $157 million last year, and they spent $627 million on ads in Yellow Pages in 1996, up from $447 million four years earlier.
At best, the results of laying down the law to colleagues who wander in this commercial wilderness can mystify the public. A Rochester lawyer was recently allowed to use a vulgarism in an ad calling himself the meanest advocate in town, but was censured for advertising with the words "Shapiro Legal Clinic" because it could mislead people about the breadth of his practice. In Florida, where some of the country's most restrictive rules just became stricter, only instrumental music is allowed in lawyer commercials, which means ads could use Jimmy Hendrix's version of the national anthem, but not a choir's rendition of "God Bless America."
When Brad Slutsky, a lawyer at the Atlanta law firm of King & Spaulding, tried to make the firm's World Wide Web site abide by advertising rules for every state, he found many of the required disclaimers so contradictory, he said, that even his effort to compile them in a 500-word statement is out of compliance in some states. The special problems of regulating lawyer advertising on the Internet will be considered at the American Bar Association's annual meeting next month.
Among the many ads rejected by the New Mexico screening committee under the state's 1992 rules was a bumper sticker featuring an alligator and the line "Tail Gators Beware. . .My lawyer is Ron Bell!" Another rejected ad was a television dramatization showing a happy woman leaving Mr. Bell's office with an 8-by-4-foot check as the lawyer turned to the camera and said, "I can't guarantee that I can get you a check that big, but I will evaluate your case free of charge." The committee also turned down a television commercial of his showing children driving toy cars in a dramatization that warned against drunk driving. The words "lawyer advertisement" were not big enough, the committee said.
But the same committee approved "Ron's Biker Babes," an ad Mr. Bell himself calls "terrible" and "very tacky," in which the lawyer, clad in black leather, makes his pitch to accident victims beside hulking motorcycle dudes and their scantily dressed female companions.
"If it's in poor taste, that's not an issue," said Frank Spring, the former chairman of the Legal Advertising Committee of the Disciplinary Board, whose practice is part of a personal injury law partnership in a no-frills, institutional building a block from Mr. Bell's hacienda-style office that has his name etched in gothic lettering on the glass transom.
Unlike Mr. Bell, 47, who moved here from Philadelphia in a Fiat in the early 1980's, Mr. Spring is a native Southwesterner. He who grew up across the Texas border in a town of 1,200 people where his grandfather owned the general store and his father was a banker.
"My values, to be candid, are small-town values," said Mr. Spring, 54, who wore chinos and an open-collared shirt and was leaving early for a trout fishing trip in the Pecos Mountains. He called lawyer advertising "demeaning" and "distasteful" and lamented its role in fueling settlement mills where clients get short shrift.
"Are we going to become simply commercial entities or focus on getting justice for people?" he asked.
Mr. Bell's reaction to such high-minded concerns by his competitors is derisive. "They want justice, shuddup!" he said with a dismissive wave of his hand. "Our entire remedy in civil justice in America is a check. I want to get the case and I want to get the check."
Underlying the principled rhetoric of their opponents, Mr. Bell and other proponents of lawyer advertising contend, is fear of price competition which would benefit the consumer.
"Whether you make Ron back off or not, it won't matter anyway," said Mr. Bell, who likes to speak of himself in the third person, "because there's some guy who's going to come out of law school and put up a big sign that says '25 percent.' " The standard contingency fee that trial lawyers collect from the settlements or damage awards they win is now a third plus costs.
But in the Queen Anne-style house where Stephen Durkovich runs his successful law practice a block from the hospital where he was born, he and his partners denounce lawyer advertising as a corrosive trend that allows inferior lawyers to prey on the poor, the uneducated and minorities.
"It hurts my soul," said Mr. Durkovich, who specializes in suing doctors. He was one of the lawyers who represented the New Mexico Supreme Court when another lawyer, Terrence Revo, successfully challenged the disciplinary rules' total ban on targeted direct-mail solicitation by lawyers. A $60,000 poll commissioned by the State Supreme Court found that those with the least income and education were most likely to approve of Mr. Revo's letter, and to believe that lawyers who advertised were better than those who did not advertise. In reality, Mr. Durkovich contended, the opposite was true, which makes such ads inherently misleading to one segment of the population, while it makes the better educated even more critical of the legal profession.
When Mr. Revo won, the adversaries of advertising mounted an unsuccessful appeal, and even petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a review in an effort to keep the ban. Yet only nine years earlier, in Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Association, the Supreme Court had upheld the right of a lawyer to send letters of solicitation to victims of accidents whose names he collected from police reports, ruling that the First Amendment "does not permit a ban on certain speech merely because it is more efficient."
In 1995, however, in a 5-to-4 decision, the Court upheld Florida's 30-day moratorium on such direct mail solicitations in personal injury and wrongful death cases, largely on the grounds of protecting the privacy of vulnerable families. That decision has fueled hopes by the opponents of advertising that new restrictions are possible.
Virginia Ferrara, the chief disciplinary counsel who brought the complaint against Ron Bell, is far less zealous about the issue than the board that employs her.
"The bar is always saying, 'Why don't you do something about Ron Bell?' " said Ms. Ferrara, who served on the American Bar Association's commission on advertising two years ago. "But his clients do not appear to be dissatisfied with him. The more established members of the bar, it drives them crazy. But there are some people in the world who identify with tacky."

HEADLINE: Feud's Latest Salvo: Outgoing CUNY Chancellor Assailed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Still angry over her long-running battle with Dr. W. Ann Reynolds, the departing Chancellor of the City University of New York, the chairwoman of the university's board yesterday accused Dr. Reynolds of "virtually lying" to the trustees, and asserted that the new chancellor would have to have "good personal chemistry" with her.
"We expect the new chancellor to be a person who respects our principles," the chairwoman, Dr. Anne A. Paolucci, said. "I want to see certain things turned around, to break down some barriers and not sweep things under the rug." 
 Dr. Paolucci promised "a massive, nationwide search" for a new chancellor to replace Dr. Reynolds, who announced on Thursday that she was leaving to become president of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Dr. Paolucci said she had begun consulting with her fellow trustees on their next step.
Dr. Reynolds, speaking at a news conference in Birmingham hours before Dr. Paolucci made her accusation, refused to comment about the deterioration of her relations with the City University trustees, which had led some trustees to suggest that they might want a new chancellor and eventually led her to seek another job. Dr. Reynolds could not be reached last night for comment on Dr. Paolucci's accusation.
In criticizing Dr. Reynolds for "virtually lying," Dr. Paolucci was referring to a recent controversy over Hostos Community College in the Bronx. In May, the trustees learned that Hostos had waived a writing test that the Chancellor's office said was a requirement for graduation throughout the City University system. The trustees, believing they were only reinforcing existing policy, voted to make the test mandatory for all graduates, but it later emerged that other campuses had also given degrees to students who had not passed the test. Dr. Reynolds said she herself had been misled, but Dr. Paolucci was outraged.
Even before that battle, friction between the two women had become so intense that Edith B. Everett, a trustee loyal to Dr. Reynolds, accused Dr. Paolucci of "beating up" on the Chancellor.
In an interview yesterday, Dr. Paolucci made it clear that she was not looking for a new chancellor "to sit back and take it easy."
"I work tremendously hard at this and I will expect the new chancellor to do the same," she said.
Asked about priorities for the new chancellor, Dr. Paolucci said they would include "taking a look at the foundations of the university and seeing if they need to be redone." The foundations, she said, include expanding a program to improve the ability of students in reading, math and writing, finding cost efficiencies and preventing grade inflation.
Dr. Paolucci said that in consultation with other City University trustees, she had come up with a list of two or three candidates for the job of interim chancellor, to govern the university while a large-scale search seeks a new chancellor. She declined to mention names. "Ideally, the interim chancellor should be a highly placed person who is in CUNY now and can take us over the small crises that will turn up," Dr. Paolucci said.
The interim chancellor might serve for three to six months, Dr. Paolucci said. She also said that rather than set up a search committee to find an interim chancellor she would consult with Herman Badillo, the vice chairman, as well as with other trustees, and then make a recommendation that she would expect the board to approve without delay.
The transition comes at a time when City University, the largest urban university in the nation with 21 campuses and 200,000 students, struggles to cope with seriously eroded city and state financial support, a climbing enrollment and a flood of poor minority students and recent immigrants who require extra help.
Dr. Paolucci insisted that even after publicly urging Dr. Reynolds to resign on June 24, she gave no thought to who might replace her. She refused to name potential candidates, but said she would be looking for someone from a large urban public university "with the experience that can be transferred to our turf."
"But I like to be surprised," she added. "This is going to be a really massive search."
James P. Murphy, a former City University board chairman who presided over the search for Dr. Reynolds and her predecessor, said the board will be inclined to pick someone who has "a good academic background, senior experience in a large public educational system, ability to work well with elective officials and would stay for 10 years."
Mr. Murphy said he expected the new chancellor to "do some aggressive recruiting of new faculty" because a rash of early retirements had left the teaching staff thin.
Kenneth Sherrill, a member of the faculty senate and professor of political science at Hunter College, said the faculty would watch the selection process with care because "it will be a real test of the board's commitment to the mission of the university." He added: "We will be interested to know how open and how widespread the search process is."

HEADLINE: Robert C. Weaver, 89, First Black Cabinet Member, Dies

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Dr. Robert C. Weaver, the first Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the first black person appointed to the Cabinet, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
Dr. Weaver was also one of the original directors of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was formed to rescue New York City from financial crisis in the 1970's. 
 "He was a catalyst with the Kennedys and then with Johnson, forging new initiatives in housing and education," said Walter E. Washington, the first elected Mayor of the nation's capital.
A portly, pedagogical man who wrote four books on urban affairs, Dr. Weaver had made a name for himself in the 1930's and 40's as an expert behind-the-scenes strategist in the civil rights movement. "Fight hard and legally," he said, "and don't blow your top."
As a part of the "Black Cabinet" in the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dr. Weaver was one of a group of blacks who specialized in housing, education and employment. After being hired as race relations advisers in various Federal agencies, they pressured and persuaded the White House to provide more jobs, better educational opportunities and equal rights.
Dr. Weaver began in 1933 as an aide to Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes. He later served as a special assistant in the housing division of the Works Progress Administration, the National Defense Advisory Commission, the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission.
Shortly before the 1940 election, he devised a strategy that defused anger among blacks about Stephen T. Early, President Roosevelt's press secretary. Arriving at Pennsylvania Station in New York, Early lost his temper when a line of police officers blocked his way. Early knocked one of the officers, who happened to be black, to the ground. As word of the incident spread, a White House adviser put through a telephone call to Dr. Weaver in Washington.
The aide, worried that the incident would cost Roosevelt the black vote, told Dr. Weaver to find the other black advisers and prepare a speech that would appeal to blacks for the President to deliver the following week.
Dr. Weaver said he doubted that he could find anyone in the middle of the night, even though most of the others in the "Black Cabinet" had been playing poker in his basement when the phone rang. "And anyway," he said, "I don't think a mere speech will do it. What we need right now is something so dramatic that it will make the Negro voters forget all about Steve Early and the Negro cop too."
Within 48 hours, Benjamin O. Davis Sr. was the first black general in the Army; William H. Hastie was the first black civilian aide to the Secretary of War, and Campbell C. Johnson was the first high-ranking black aide to the head of the Selective Service.
 Robert Clifton Weaver was born on Dec. 29, 1907, in Washington. His father was a postal worker and his mother -- who he said influenced his intellectual development -- was the daughter of the first black person to graduate from Harvard with a degree in dentistry. When Dr. Weaver joined the Kennedy Administration, whose Harvard connections extended to the occupant of the Oval Office, he held more Harvard degrees -- three, including a doctorate in economics -- than anyone else in the administration's upper ranks.
In 1960, after serving as the New York State Rent Commissioner, Dr. Weaver became the national chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and President Kennedy sought Dr. Weaver's advice on civil rights. The following year, the President appointed him administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency, a loose combination of agencies that included the bureaucratic components of what would eventually become H.U.D., including the Federal Housing Administration to spur construction, the Urban Renewal Administration to oversee slum clearance and the Federal National Mortgage Association to line up money for new housing.
President Kennedy tried to have the agency raised to Cabinet rank, but Congress balked. Southerners led an attack against the appointment of a black to the Cabinet, and there were charges that Dr. Weaver was an extremist. Kennedy abandoned the idea of creating an urban affairs department.
Five years later, when President Johnson revived the idea and pushed it through Congress, Senators who had voted against Dr. Weaver the first time around voted for him.
Past Federal housing programs had largely dealt with bricks-and-mortar policies. Dr. Weaver said Washington needed to take a more philosophical approach. "Creative federalism stresses local initiative, local solutions to local problems," he said.
But, he added, "where the obvious needs for action to meet an urban problem are not being fulfilled, the Federal Government has a responsibility at least to generate a thorough awareness of the problem."
Dr. Weaver, who said that "you cannot have physical renewal without human renewal," pushed for better-looking public housing by offering awards for design. He also increased the amount of money for small businesses displaced by urban renewal and revived the long-dormant idea of Federal rent subsidies for the elderly.
Later in his life, he was a professor of urban affairs at Hunter College, was a member of the Visiting Committee at the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon University and held visiting professorships at Columbia Teachers' College and the New York University School of Education. He also served as a consultant to the Ford Foundation and was the president of Baruch College in Manhattan in 1969.
His wife, Ella, died in 1991. Their son, Robert Jr., died in 1962.
