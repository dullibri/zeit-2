HEADLINE: Trading Slump Spurs Online Brokers' Merger Talk

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Online brokerage firms have cut and cut their trading commissions over the last year. But with the stock market still in a slump, the firms may have no other option left but to combine.
 That need to cut costs out of what has become a business with little growth has put three of the biggest names in the business into play. On Friday, E*Trade Financial proposed a merger with Ameritrade Holding valued at more than $5.5 billion, executives involved in the talks said. Ameritrade, meanwhile, has been in talks to buy TD Waterhouse, a division of the Canadian banking giant Toronto-Dominion. 
 ''We've had choppy market conditions for five years now,'' said Kenneth Worthington, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. ''The only way left for these companies to grow is to buy each other.''
 Word of the merger talks lifted the stock prices of online brokers yesterday after months of weak performance.
 The negotiations are happening now because the brokers realize that trading revenues will not revive anytime soon and that they need to take other steps to increase profits, analysts said. 
 Low trading volume has also been one of the driving forces in the recent consolidation among exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange is planning to acquire the electronic trading system Archipelago Holdings, while Nasdaq is combining with Instinet.
 Brokers cut commissions several times last year, to as low as $8.95 a trade in some cases. But despite those cuts, the number of United States households trading online increased modestly to 6.3 million in 2004, up 5 percent from a year earlier, according to Forrester Research, which tracks the impact of changes in technology on business. That figure is still a far cry from a peak of 7.4 million households trading online in 2000.
 ''Last year was, at best, a wash'' for online brokers in terms of trading revenue, said Bill Doyle, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''Trading has become a loss leader,'' he said, as brokers look to sell other products to their customers. 
 In recent years, Ameritrade in particular has lost share to aggressive and better-capitalized competitors like Fidelity and Charles Schwab, said Michael Hecht, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
 Ameritrade's share of online trading by individual investors has fallen to 20.8 percent as of the first quarter, he estimates, down from 27.9 percent four years ago.
 E*Trade's takeover bid reflects the company's belief that discount brokerage customers are good prospects for the sale of other financial services products.
 E*Trade started offering banking products like home mortgages and credit cards after it acquired Telebanc five years ago.
 ''The strategy is paying off,'' Mr. Doyle said in a report yesterday. As of the first quarter, E*Trade derived nearly three-quarters of its revenue from businesses other than trading, he said.
 Since Ameritrade does not offer these products, its customers would be good prospects for cross-selling, analysts said. As of March 31, Ameritrade customers had $12.7 billion in cash, said Richard Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill, in a report yesterday. Some of that money could be converted into bank deposits, he said. 
 Mr. Repetto estimates that the combined companies could see $562 million in cost savings and increased revenues in 2006. 
 Representatives for Ameritrade and E*Trade declined to comment yesterday.
 Investors were clearly heartened by the prospect of a wave of consolidation. Shares of Ameritrade rose more than 18 percent yesterday, to $13.42, while E*Trade's stock increased 5.8 percent, to $12.62.
 Shares of competitor Charles Schwab also rose, to $10.74, up 41 cents. Some analysts said Schwab would benefit from its competitors being distracted by merger talks.
 Still, other analysts struck a cautionary tone yesterday about the industry's prospects, even if the discussions do yield mergers. 
 A rise in interest rates could dampen enthusiasm for the banking products E*Trade is selling. And, if the stock market remains weak, some customers may prefer to do business with larger financial services firms, where they can obtain more advice and have access to a broader array of products.
 ''It is likely that customers will leave E*Trade and Ameritrade as their needs increase,'' said Richard Bove, an analyst with Punk Ziegel & Company. ''Full service brokers will skim the cream off the top'' of the discount firms, he said.

HEADLINE: How Culture Pushed Us to the Top of the Food Chain

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
Specialties in the social sciences are proliferating at a record pace, and the job title of Dr. Robert Boyd illustrates that point perfectly.
 Dr. Boyd is a theoretical biological anthropologist: he uses mathematics and deduction to develop ideas about how Homo sapiens became earth's dominant species. 
 Over a 30-year career, Dr. Boyd, 57, of the University of California, Los Angeles, has made it his task to show how contemporary human behavior is rooted in the cultures that humans developed as they lived the evolutionary process. 
 In the recent book ''Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution,'' Dr. Boyd and his co-author, an environmental scientist, explained why culture was ''essential to human adaptation, as much a part of human biology as bipedal locomotion.''

Q. Your book is called ''Not by Genes Alone.'' Why that title?

A. We wanted to call it ''The Nature of Culture,'' but our publishers, wouldn't have it. They didn't want us stuck on the social science shelves at the bookstore, where books generally don't do well.
 The book is a synthesis of current thinking on the role culture plays in human evolution. My co-author, Peter Richerson, and I believe that when discussing the traits that have helped humans become such a successful species, we should avoid that old nature-versus-nurture debate.
 That's the view that behavior is either learned or genetic. Instead, we need to be talking about genes and culture, and how they interact with each other. 
 Most people think that culture is free from the shackles of biology because it is learned. That's wrong. Learned behavior is shaped by psychological mechanisms that have evolved, just like any other trait. Culture is special in that it is transmitted from individual to individual and evolves through the generations. 

Q. Among social scientists, the conventional wisdom has it that you've filled in an important piece of the evolutionary puzzle. What makes your theory new?

A. Unlike the conventional nature-nurture view, we explain why culture is adaptive, and why it causes people to behave so differently from other animals. We say that while in the long run all organisms adapt by genes, only humans can accumulate knowledge over long periods of time and transfer it so that the next generation can improve on it. It's this trick that has allowed people to be as successful as we are.
 We have the widest range of any mammal. We occupy every inch of the globe basically except Antarctica. We were able to do it because different human populations can acquire from the previous generation the special tools and ways you need to live in such a wide variety of places.
 There's no way that genes can teach an Inuit how to make a kayak, but others in the community can. Humans are animals who evolved in the tropics, but who now hunt for seals in the Arctic. We've been able to do that because we have culture. 

Q. Don't animals have culture?

A. Not in the sense that they have traditions that change as they are transmitted. O.K., chimpanzees in one forest in Africa use short sticks to fish for ants. In another, they use longer ones. Yes, this seems to be socially transmitted. But what doesn't happen is an accumulation of knowledge. What they don't get is something that gets better and better through time.
 In human cultures, things change with each generation. Populations create things that are useful in their survival and these things evolve and get better so that people can flourish. No single individual could have created something as complex and functional as the kayak. 

Q. There are biologists who think that a lot of our behavior is hard-wired into our genes. Do you?

A. I don't think anything is hard-wired. Even the number of fingers on your hands isn't hard-wired. Even the genes that get expressed as your limbs develop depending on environmental circumstances. The thalidomide babies of the 1950's know that rather directly.

Q. There was a time when anthropologists went off to New Guinea and observed how the local people lived. You work in Los Angeles, where you produce theories and mathematical models. Should Margaret Mead be rolling in her grave?

A. I've done field work. But what Margaret Mead did was cultural anthropology. I'm a biological anthropologist. We look at bones, other animals, evolution. One of the things I've tried to do is bring the two subdisciplines closer.
 As for all that mathematics, I use it because it gives a social scientist a kind of mental prosthesis. It lets you make certain your deductions are cogent. Unfortunately, mathematics also forces you to simplify things in a way that verbal reasoning doesn't.
 So you always have to work, back and forth, between mathematics and verbal reasoning in order to have good explanations. At the end of the day, we often send graduate students out to the field to test what we've hypothesized with math models. 

Q. Why is so much of social science moving toward the use of mathematical models rather than field observations?

A. In fact, I see the opposite happening. In economics, the most mathematical of the social sciences, there's a big trend toward field observations used in combination with mathematics. Ernst Fehr from the University of Zurich runs all these interesting experiments with bicycle messengers to determine whether or not people will work longer with higher wages. He found that when you paid them more they worked less.

Q. As a scholar of evolution are you surprised that Darwin remains so controversial?

A. I'm dismayed. I teach evolution in a basic undergraduate course at U.C.L.A. If you're a psychology major, you have to take it. The religious students try to argue with me! I've had a Muslim tell me that evolution wasn't in his religious texts so it couldn't be true. I had a young Christian woman in tears at the end of the term: ''You convinced me. And now what am I going to do?''
 She lived in a small town where evangelical religion played a big role. To doubt Genesis was almost like holding immoral beliefs. I felt strange because I'd made her life a lot more difficult by convincing her of what I considered to be true. But there was no help for it.

Q. A new version of creationism, ''intelligent design,'' is being pushed by the anti-Darwinists. It says more or less that the world is too complicated to be an accident. Do your students cite it?

A. Not just my students. ''Intelligent design'' seems to be creationism stripped of its explicitly Christian biblical background, and so it has wider appeal. My wife has a relative: he's Jewish, and he is attracted to it. Every once in a while, he says, ''You don't really believe that that natural selection gives rise to something as complicated as an eye?''
 And then I have to give him this whole speech on how it works. He's never convinced. And he's a medical doctor!

Q. The anti-Darwinists of an earlier era had a motto: ''I'm no monkey.'' In some ways, doesn't your theory of cultural transmission have the same message?

A. Well, obviously, we're not monkeys. But that doesn't mean that we didn't evolve. I live in Los Angeles, negotiate the freeways, go the supermarket and the beach; baboons don't do that. The real question is, How do we explain that we are different without giving up the truth: that we evolved from something like a monkey and that culture helped make our success possible.

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:

PASSPORT CHIPS TO BE ENCRYPTED -- After protests from business travel representatives, the State Department modified its plan to issue new passports embedded with tiny radio chips that transmit information to electronic devices at customs and immigration stations. The main objection was that the chips could put travelers in danger abroad by transmitting easy-to-intercept data identifying American nationality and other personal information. The State Department said it would modify the chips, called radio frequency identification tags, with encryption technology to greatly reduce the potential for eavesdropping. At its annual meeting last week in Vancouver, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, which represents corporate travel managers, welcomed the move. But it said it would not endorse the proposed passports until the government demonstrated that the chips could not identify United States citizens at any distance from a passport reader and that ''any encryption technology used to code traveler information is virtually foolproof.''

GENERAL AVIATION AND REAGAN AIRPORT -- Since 9/11, Reagan National Airport has been closed to general aviation, including corporate and private jets and charter flights. Now, after years of intense lobbying by the business aviation industry, the Subcommittee on Aviation of the House Transportation Committee has approved legislation directing the Homeland Security Department to allow general aviation to resume operations at the airport, which is near the White House and the Capitol. ''There is no good reason that sound, protective security measures cannot be developed to reopen Reagan National to general aviation,'' said Representative John L. Mica, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee. General aviation passengers are not subject to federal security screening, but the industry says it has been working to improve its own security procedures.

A RELATIVE SLOWPOKE -- How fast is a high-speed train? Amtrak's Acela trains, sidetracked again last month by mechanical problems, are capable of 135 miles an hour between New York and Washington and a maximum speed of 150 miles an hour on a short stretch between New York and Boston. The optimum New York-Washington speed (seldom sustained, passengers complain) is only 10 miles an hour faster than a conventional train. How does that compare with high-speed trains elsewhere, which travel on dedicated tracks? AVE, the Spanish high-speed system, said that signaling and other improvements now allow trains on the Lleida line between Madrid and Saragossa to reach speeds of 186 miles an hour, according to the International Union of Railways. The TGV high-speed trains in France travel at 186 miles an hour on long stretches, as do the Japanese bullet trains. On the 120-mile Hiroshima-to-Kokura route, the average speed is 164 miles an hour.

LUXURY'S LURE -- In another indication of growth in transcontinental business travel, British Airways said its premium traffic -- business class and first class -- increased 13.3 percent in April, compared with April 2004, while economy-class or leisure traffic fell 2 percent. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: How Plan for a Tunnel Turned Goldman Against Downtown

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In many ways, of all the pieces of the developing World Trade Center site, none of them -- not the Freedom Tower, the memorial or the other proposed buildings -- are as important right now as the project that was supposed to go up across the street: a gleaming new $2 billion headquarters for Goldman Sachs, one of downtown's largest and most prominent employers.
 The 40-story tower, the first significant new investment by a financial firm anywhere near the site since Sept. 11, would have signaled to the world that not only had Lower Manhattan recovered from its psychic wounds but also that it remained an international symbol of capitalism, rebuilding officials, real estate executives and financial industry experts said.
 But the investment bank pulled the plug on its plans last month, citing security concerns and general confusion over plans at the trade center site, and has begun a furious search for alternative sites, possibly in Midtown. 
 The final straw in Goldman's decision to pull out was a state plan to bury West Street-Route 9A in a tunnel that would have ended at its headquarters' front door. The state has since abandoned the plan. Now, the city and state are scrambling to lure the investment bank back downtown. 
 But with the future home of Goldman in doubt, downtown executives, real estate executives and some city officials say, so is Lower Manhattan's primacy as a vibrant financial and commercial center. 
 As the New York Stock Exchange moves toward an electronic trading system -- reducing its role as the anchor financial tenant in Lower Manhattan -- and after decisions by other firms to leave, Goldman's commitment was the most pronounced and important signal that the precinct was here to stay. That message, some fear, is now deeply in question.
 ''It would be devastating for Goldman to leave downtown,'' said Michael T. Cohen, chairman of the executive committee at GVA Williams, a real estate company based downtown. ''The large employers who occupy millions of square feet downtown are almost impossible to replace. You can chip away at it with Bowne or HIP, but you would lose not only what's there, but also Goldman's prospective growth.''
 In interviews, more than a dozen people directly involved in the process made clear that a lack of coordination among agencies and governments as well as a failure to take Goldman's concerns seriously were the principal contributors to Goldman's decision to look elsewhere. Although those interviewed, including state, city and police officials, would not speak by name because of the delicacy of the talks surrounding ground zero, they all agreed on the core issues that they said led to the unraveling. 
 Some rebuilding officials said that the New York Police Department consistently raised security concerns about both the Goldman headquarters and the Freedom Tower but was ambiguous about how to solve them. City Hall, whose involvement was often filtered through the Police Department, was not involved at the highest levels with the planning, according to several people involved in the talks, including a city official. 
 Others who were directly involved said the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency overseeing the rebuilding effort, thought that Goldman officials were bluffing when they threatened to pull out if their concerns about the tunnel were not resolved early enough. 
 But Henry M. Paulson, Goldman's chairman, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was quite serious. The firm, according to half a dozen people involved, simply wanted a coherent plan for addressing security concerns.
 Since last August, many meetings were held to wrangle over the proposed tunnel, which would have emptied at Goldman's front door. The state, as well as the city's police officials, thought building the tunnel along the western edge of the site would help contain the damage to the Freedom Tower in the event of a car or truck bomb. Numerous discussions about moving the tunnel failed to result in an agreement.
 The tunnel, though, was extremely important to Gov. George E. Pataki, according to city and police officials. He viewed the tunnel as a potential answer to the broader set of security issues facing the rebuilding project, most importantly those concerning the Freedom Tower. Mr. Pataki has long viewed the Freedom Tower as his key downtown legacy, and he was loath to have security concerns force a redesign of the building. 
 ''Initially, Pataki honestly believed the additional cost of the tunnel was justified because it connected the World Financial Center with the World Trade Center site, and would help the traffic situation down there,'' said a person involved with the negotiations. ''But over time, after Goldman Sachs came along, and as concerns about security were raised, the tunnel became a potential solution for those security issues.'' 
 A state official said that at one point last December they were willing to sign a tentative agreement with Goldman that included a resolution of the tunnel issue. But, the official said, the Police Department had yet to outline acceptable solutions to its security concerns.
 In any event, the Pataki administration now says that it has provided all the certainty Goldman needs to make the proper decision, to stay downtown.
 ''The governor, the mayor and their staffs have been working with Goldman in order to answer any questions and provide all the certainties they need to move forward with Site 26,'' said Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Governor Pataki, referring to the plot where Goldman intended to build. ''We're confident at the end of the day, Goldman will find that this location in Lower Manhattan is the right place.''
 As the issue heated up, Goldman imposed an April 1 deadline for resolution; city and state officials begged the bank to refrain from going public, trying to buy time, two people involved in the talks said. But when that date came and went without an answer on the tunnel, Goldman announced it was pulling back from downtown.
 The firm, which has 8,000 employees downtown and 2,000 more at its new tower in Jersey City, said it would spend the next few months evaluating prospects for building in Midtown, as well as its downtown options. It has disbanded its downtown team of architects, construction managers and engineers and has lost $46 million in unfulfilled contracts.
 One top real estate executive, who has been briefed by Goldman about its real estate needs, said he doubted that the bank would be able to find an acceptable site in Midtown where it could buy the land, rezone it and build a new two-million-square-foot tower by 2010, when the company's leases run out downtown.
 But another executive who worked on Goldman's downtown team said that it was unlikely that the bank would return downtown.
 ''They don't cry wolf,'' said the executive, who requested anonymity for fear of annoying public officials or Goldman. ''I think the governor really underestimated the seriousness of this thing.''
 The desire to keep Lower Manhattan commercially viable has become particularly acute since Sept. 11. Lehman Brothers and other companies have moved their headquarters and thousands of employees to Midtown. A handful of employers, like Bowne & Company, a financial printing house, have agreed to move downtown, and some banks are staying.
 But the downtown real estate market remains sluggish, especially compared with Midtown. There are no tenants for Larry A. Silverstein's nearly completed 51-story tower at 7 World Trade Center tower, nor for the planned Freedom Tower.
 Some real estate experts and politicians now say that if financial firms are not attracted to the Freedom Tower and 7 World Trade Center, efforts should be made to attract lawyers, advertising firms and other businesses back into the area's smaller office buildings.
 ''What is important is for downtown to remain as one of the leading commercial centers of the world,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer said.
 But many industry experts say a tenant like Goldman is essential. Real estate brokers say talks with companies considering moves downtown shriveled after Goldman backed off.
 ''Goldman is an anchor tenant,'' said Frank Fernandez, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, an industry lobbyist. ''It would have a huge impact either way. Geographically, it nails that corner of the area physically, because it is almost symbolically one of the four corners of the Wall Street area.''

HEADLINE: Trinity Church Names Planner To Oversee Realty Operations

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Carl Weisbrod, an urban planner and a lawyer active in the redevelopment of Times Square and Lower Manhattan over the last 25 years, is taking over real estate operations for Trinity Church, one of the largest property owners in New York City.
 Staring in July, Mr. Weisbrod will oversee leasing and development of the church's six million square feet of commercial and retail space in 18 buildings, most of it in the Hudson Square neighborhood, west of SoHo and south of Greenwich Village. 
 Mr. Weisbrod, 60, said he would also explore opportunities to develop office towers, retail space, and possibly residential buildings in the neighborhood surrounding the Holland Tunnel. At the same time, he said, he and Trinity will push for the creation of a business improvement district in Hudson Square. 
 Since the late 1990's, Trinity has moved to transform the old factory buildings it owns, many of which were commercial printing companies, into office buildings, replacing ink-stained printers with white-collar executives.
 ''We're really looking at full development of that area as it might relate to retail, residential and commercial, as well as other aspects of community life,'' said the Rev. James H. Cooper, rector of Trinity Church-St. Paul's Chapel. ''We're looking for Carl to help us discern what would be best for Trinity and for New York City as we go forward.''
 Mr. Weisbrod will step down as president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a job he has held since the group's founding a decade ago. However, both he and Mr. Cooper said that Mr. Weisbrod would not lose his connection to and interest in the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. A 308-year-old parish based downtown, Trinity attracts 1.8 million visitors a year, and has been involved in the rebuilding effort.
 Mr. Weisbrod said, ''It provides me with the opportunity to help create a fabulous New York City neighborhood around Hudson Square for a distinguished New York institution that is really interested in making a positive contribution to the city generally, and to my continuing work in Lower Manhattan.''
 Robert R. Douglass, chairman of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said he would be sorry to see Mr. Weisbrod move to Trinity but would ask members to give the former chairman a seat on the group's board.
 Trinity Church originally owned a large swath of Manhattan under a 1705 land grant from Queen Anne of England. By the early 1900's, it had disposed of much of the land, by either selling it or giving it to Columbia University. During the Depression, Trinity ended up with the factory buildings in and around Hudson Square after it had leased some of the land to developers who built the factories. When the economy collapsed and developers defaulted on their loans, the church took control of the buildings.
 After some of the factory tenants failed in the 1980's, Trinity began to try to gentrify the neighborhood. That did not pick up momentum until the real estate boom in the late 1990's.

HEADLINE: Two for the Seesaw: Young Players Lead Twins

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

 BODY:
Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau have more dimples than whiskers. They could stand and sing in the back row of a college choir without drawing a second look, except perhaps for their height -- each is 6 feet 4 inches.
 So what are they doing hitting third and fourth for the Minnesota Twins, the three-time defending American League Central Division champions? Mauer, a 22-year-old catcher, and Morneau, a first baseman who turns 24 on Sunday, are the youngest players to bat regularly in those lineup slots for a defending division champion in more than 30 years.
 That is what happens when a franchise melds a commitment to its farm system with economic reality. The Twins traded the veterans A.J. Pierzynski and Doug Mientkiewicz the last two years to clear the way for Mauer and Morneau, the most promising hitters to come through the Minnesota system since Kirby Puckett and Kent Hrbek in the 1980's. 
 ''Everybody makes room for good young players, especially in a small market when you're trying to keep a responsible payroll,'' said Terry Ryan, the Twins' general manager, whose $56 million payroll ranks 20th in baseball, far behind the Yankees' ($206 million) and the Red Sox' ($121 million).
 Not since 1972 have two players younger than 25 batted third and fourth in at least 40 games in a season after their team won a division championship, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Bobby Grich and Don Baylor did it for Baltimore and Chris Speier and Dave Kingman did it for San Francisco in 1972.
 Mauer (.341) and Morneau (.415) are still settling into those roles, and they have rewarded the organization's faith in them so far. But the Twins are trying to do something only the Braves have mastered in recent times -- continue to win through budget-induced personnel turnover.
 In the off-season, the Twins lost third baseman Corey Koskie to Toronto and shortstop Cristian Guzman to Washington in free agency, part of the price for committing $40 million over four years to the Cy Young award winner Johan Santana. So Minnesota began the season with the rookie Jason Bartlett at shortstop and three other starters who have never played a full major league season at their positions -- Mauer, Morneau and third baseman Michael Cuddyer. 
 The Twins (19-12) trail the White Sox, who have baseball's best record, by four and a half games in the division.
 ''It's tough for the guys that are here to see guys go every year,'' said Morneau, a former hockey goalie and native of British Columbia. He hit 19 homers in 280 at-bats last year. 
 ''But at the same time, it's great for the young guys. You say, 'Hey, in two years he might be a free agent, there's my chance.' It kind of gives you something to shoot for at the end.''
 The Twins thought enough of Mauer, who was born and reared in nearby St. Paul, to draft him first over all in 2001, ahead of Mark Prior, now the Cubs' ace. ''In Minnesota they draft, and they've got a history of promoting from within,'' Mauer said. ''I don't think it could have been a better fit for me.''
 Mauer and Morneau have battled injury problems. Mauer, after winning the starting job last year, tore the meniscus in his left knee while chasing a foul ball during the second game of the season. He played only 35 games, batting .308.
 Morneau, meanwhile, had a calamity-filled off-season, with an appendectomy and bouts with chicken pox, pleurisy and pneumonia. Then he missed 13 games with a concussion after Ron Villone beaned him April 6 in Seattle.
 ''My goal for the season was not to get hurt,'' Morneau said with disgust. ''Then the third day, I'm on the disabled list.''
 There are moments when Mauer, the dark-haired one with the long sideburns, and Morneau, whose curly blond hair peeks out from under his batting helmet, do things that belie their age and experience. 
 With the Twins trailing Cleveland by one run in the ninth inning Wednesday at the Metrodome, the left-handed Mauer fell behind, 0-2, against closer Bob Wickman, then took two tantalizingly close outside pitches before hitting a single to right. Mauer's plate discipline is a frequent source of amazement in a Twins dugout loaded with free swingers.
 ''I saw him strike out three times in a game,'' Gardenhire said. ''I can honestly tell you, I didn't think I'd ever see that. That's saying a lot about a young hitter. Nothing he does shocks me, because he's so good.''
 Morneau is a left-handed batter whose raw power gives the Twins hope that he could become the club's first 30-home run hitter since Hrbek in 1987. He leads the team with 6 homers and 20 runs batted in despite his stint on the disabled list. Morneau has been Minnesota's hottest hitter since his return, batting .433 (23 for 53) with 19 R.B.I. and 6 homers in 14 games.
 ''Justin has been back a week, but he's been holding it down, hitting the ball tremendously hard, taking pitches,'' center fielder Torii Hunter said. ''Mauer's been taking pitches since he was born. This guy has the eye of a 40-year-old veteran, and he's only 21. So I think somebody needs to check his birth certificate. 
 ''I think those guys are holding the three and four spots real well, 10 times better than I would have done when I was 21 and 23. You look at those guys, and you know they're only going to get better as the season progresses.''

PERSON: Peter Karasz

HEADLINE: Peter Karasz, 63, Managing Partner of an International Law Firm

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Peter Karasz, the managing partner of Cleary Gottlieb, one of New York's leading international law firms, died on April 30 in Washington, where he had gone for a business meeting. He was 63 and lived in Greenwich Village.
 The cause was a cancer diagnosed four years ago, the firm announced. 
 Mr. Karasz, a native of Budapest, joined Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in New York in 1967 and became a partner in 1975. He was elected managing partner in 2000 and was in his second three-year term when he announced his decision last month to step down at the end of the year.
 On May 5, the firm's partners announced his successor, Mark Walker, 63, a senior New York-based banking and finance specialist and a partner since 1975.
 Mr. Karasz guided the firm successfully through the aftermath of Sept. 11, which scattered 1,000 Cleary Gottlieb employees across the city for months until their return to the firm's downtown headquarters at One Liberty Plaza. He also oversaw the expansion of the firm's already formidable international presence.
 In less than six years, Cleary Gottlieb grew from about 600 to 850 lawyers from more than 50 countries, and it opened offices in Cologne and Milan. Its 170 partners now practice in 12 offices in nine countries. 
 Peter Karasz was born on June 18, 1941. His father, Arthur Karasz, also a lawyer, was governor of the Hungarian National Bank in the brief interlude between the end of World War II and the advent of Soviet-style communism. The family fled into exile, and Arthur Karasz eventually became the head of the European office of the World Bank; he died in 1992.
 Peter grew up in France, Bolivia, Thailand and the United States, speaking English, French and Spanish. He graduated with a degree in political science from Johns Hopkins University in 1962 and received a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1965.
 He joined Cleary Gottlieb and was based in the Paris office from 1968 to 1973.
 Mr. Karasz is survived by his wife of 19 years, Marilyn Sobel, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and their twin children, Matthew and Alexandra, 14. Also surviving are a son and daughter from an earlier marriage, Andrew and Valerie Karasz, both of Manhattan; and two sisters, Zsuzsanna K. Lipsky of Brooklyn Heights, and Eva Fruzsina March of Clinton, Conn. His first marriage, to Susan Holaday Schumacher, a resident of Washington, ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: H&R BLOCK AND HSBC IN SETTLEMENT OVER LOANS

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
H&R Block and HSBC Taxpayer Financial Services said yesterday that they had agreed to a $360 million court settlement over loans given in anticipation of tax refunds. The settlement, which requires approval by a federal court judge in Chicago, would cover more than 28 million customers and more than 55 million loan transactions. It would settle a 1998 Chicago class-action lawsuit and all other such lawsuits against the companies over the loans. Refund anticipation loans, which often carry high interest rates, are short-term cash advances against a customer's expected income tax refund. H&R Block, based in Kansas City, Mo., said it would take an after-tax charge of $38 million, or 23 cents per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended April 30, for the settlement. HSBC Taxpayer Financial Services is part of HSBC Holdings.

HEADLINE: Ferrer and Mayor Clash on Brooklyn Rezoning

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The campaigns of Fernando Ferrer, a Democratic candidate for mayor, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg clashed yesterday over Mr. Ferrer's claim that industrial jobs are being threatened by the rezoning of the North Brooklyn waterfront.The city's plans include taking over two parcels where a storage business and a fuel company now operate to create a 28-acre park with an aquatics center that is part of the Olympic bid. 
 ''Every time you scratch the surface of one of these Olympic deals you begin to see the bleeding of hundreds if not thousands of jobs,'' Mr. Ferrer said, adding that the use of eminent domain to obtain sites for the park would eliminate several thousand jobs.
 Mr. Ferrer, who made his remarks in downtown Brooklyn also criticized the administration for discouraging business from American Stevedoring, a shipping company that says it employs 600 people. Mr. Ferrer added that if the area were designated an Olympic site, Bloomberg administration officials would be giving it more attention, and at one point referred to Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, as the ''deputy mayor for the Olympics.''
 Pressed by reporters, Mr. Ferrer did not offer an alternative plan of his own except to say that he would have found a way to preserve jobs on the waterfront, which he conceded are in the hundreds, not thousands. He also said he would have worked to save jobs away from the waterfront as well.
 In response, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign disputed the number of jobs left on the waterfront and accused Mr. Ferrer of suggesting policies that would drive jobs away.
 ''On over 100 acres of the Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront, there are fewer than 200 total jobs today, less than two jobs for each acre of waterfront land, and exactly zero manufacturing jobs,'' said Stu Loeser, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign spokesman. 
 Mr. Loeser said his job estimates were based on statistics from the New York State Department of Labor as used by the Department of City Planning.
 But Norman Brodsky, the owner of CitiStorage, a document storage business that would be condemned under the plan for the waterfront park, said that his business employed 450 people full time. ''The mayor doesn't know how to count,'' he said. Mr. Loeser did not offer an explanation for the discrepancy.

HEADLINE: A Big Board Member Sues To Stop Archipelago Merger

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
A member of the New York Stock Exchange sued the exchange's directors and Goldman Sachs yesterday, seeking to stop the exchange's proposed acquisition of Archipelago Holdings, an operator of an electronic trading system.
 In a suit filed in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, William Higgins, a longtime owner of a seat on the exchange, argued that the terms of the proposed merger -- which would grant members 70 percent of the merged company plus about $300,000 a seat -- grossly undervalued the exchange. 
 The complaint also criticized a lock-up period of up to five years in which current seat holders could not sell their shares in the combined company, as well as a provision that would reserve 5 percent of the merged corporation for some exchange employees.
 Among the employees who would share in the 5 percent is John A. Thain, the chief executive of the exchange. Goldman Sachs would own more than 5 percent of the shares, according to the terms of the proposed deal. The lawsuit noted that Mr. Thain was president of Goldman Sachs until he became chief of the exchange last year. 
 ''The lawsuit is not about whether a deal with Archipelago makes sense but whether the current terms make sense,'' said Jay W. Eisenhofer of Grant & Eisenhofer, one of the law firms representing Mr. Higgins.
 The complaint accuses the directors of a breach of fiduciary duties, and it accuses Goldman Sachs, which owns 15.6 percent of Archipelago and represented both the exchange and Archipelago in the negotiations, of helping to advance the directors' breach while structuring a deal that favored itself. 
 The complaint also pointed to an independent estimate that suggested exchange members should receive as much as 90 percent of the combined company.
 A spokesman for the stock exchange, Ray Pellechia, said the complaint was ''completely without merit.''
 ''We are proceeding with the merger as proposed,'' Mr. Pellechia said. Through a spokesman, Goldman Sachs said it never commented on pending litigation.
 The deal between the exchange and Archipelago, announced on April 20, would convert the 213-year-old member-owned exchange into a for-profit, publicly traded company. It would shift the exchange toward more electronic trading. Currently, people on the floor of the exchange still match buy and sell offers. But the deal has been challenged on several fronts. Kenneth G. Langone, a founder of Home Depot and former exchange director, has been trying to muster support for a competing offer. Through a spokesman, Mr. Langone declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it would be ''premature'' to do so. 
 Mr. Higgins, who is the head of an organization of seat holders advocating change at the exchange, is seeking to have his suit become a class action covering the owners of the 1,366 seats, excluding Goldman and the other defendants. 
 Mr. Eisenhofer said he did not know the extent of the support for Mr. Higgins's complaint, but thought many members were dissatisfied. 
 But it is uncertain whether Mr. Higgins, like Mr. Langone, will achieve sufficient traction to block or substantially alter the deal. For one thing, many investors like it. The price of a seat on the exchange has soared since the deal was announced. Two seats sold in early May fetched $2.4 million each, up from $1.62 million for a seat sold in mid-April.
 Other members are skeptical about the terms, but they are not all ready to go to court. ''I think it's a little irresponsible,'' said James Rutledge of the lawsuit. Like Mr. Higgins, he owns a seat on the exchange, which he leases to others for trading. 
 ''I have some problems with the terms,'' Mr. Rutledge said, ''but not deal-breaker-type problems. It's just a question of tweaking the deal.''
 Benn Steil, a senior fellow in international economics with the Council on Foreign Relations who has worked as a consultant for Archipelago, said a somewhat better deal might be available. 
 Though Archipelago filed a form with the Securities and Exchange Commission specifying the terms of the proposed merger, the exchange has not formally asked for a vote among its members. What the lawsuit could do, Mr. Steil said, is pressure the exchange and Archipelago to adjust the terms somewhat. 
 ''I don't think Mr. Higgins's suit would bring down the deal,'' Mr. Steil said. ''But all these things act as catalysts to put pressure on Thain to modify the terms.''

HEADLINE: Most City 8th Graders Miss State Norm in Social Studies

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
More than 80 percent of New York City's eighth graders failed to meet state standards in social studies last year, a decline of nearly 20 percentage points since 2002, school officials acknowledged yesterday at a hearing of the City Council Education Committee.
 The committee chairwoman, Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz, seized on the statistics as evidence that the city's nearly 1.1 million schoolchildren were worse off three years after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican, took control of the system. 
 ''Student achievement under Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Klein has decreased precipitously in the area of social studies,'' Ms. Moskowitz, a Manhattan Democrat, said in an interview after the hearing. 
 She added, ''I am very concerned that there is no way our students can be prepared for participating in our democracy and living in our global economy with the quality of social studies education that they are receiving.'' 
 New York State administers social studies exams in fifth and eighth grades, but officials said the results get little scrutiny because they are not among the criteria used to determine if schools are performing adequately, either under state regulations or the federal No Child Left Behind law. 
 ''The truth is we do not use it as a measure of accountability,'' said Tom Dunn, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Education. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Dunn said state officials were concerned by the recent drop in the city's eighth grade social studies scores, which mirrored a steep decline in scores statewide.
 But while the state and the city have suffered similar declines, the city's scores are substantially lower than the state's as a whole. Last year, 18.61 percent of the city's eighth graders met social studies standards, compared with 43.78 percent of eighth graders statewide. 
 At yesterday's City Council hearing, Elise Abegg, the Department of Education's director of social studies, gave a broad presentation on the teaching of history and civics in the public schools. The discussion of eighth-grade scores followed during a question-and-answer session. 
 After the hearing, city education officials pointed to better results on fifth-grade scores as well as improved performance by high school students on the Regents examinations in global studies and American history, which are required for graduation. 
 Last year, more than 55 percent of the city's fifth graders were proficient on the social studies exam, compared with nearly 75 percent of fifth graders statewide. But the fifth-grade performance was also substantially worse than in 2001-2002, when nearly 65 percent of city students and nearly 88 percent of students statewide were proficient. 
 History and civics are a personal passion and specialty of Deputy Chancellor Carmen Farina, the school system's top instructional official, who defended her efforts in an e-mail message. 
 ''We have taken many steps to restore social studies to its appropriate place in the overall curriculum,'' Ms. Farina said. ''I expect to see stronger teaching in social studies content and improved student literacy skills being applied to mastery of this content.''
 But Ms. Farina did not testify yesterday. Instead, Ms. Abegg, who was a social studies official in District 15 and later Region 8 in Brooklyn (where Ms. Farina served as district and then regional superintendent) got a civics lesson of her own, fielding questions from combative lawmakers. 
 Reading scores in eighth grade are similarly lower than in the elementary grades, and state and local officials said the low social studies scores clearly reflected the weaker literacy skills of middle school students. 
 Critics of standardized testing argue that the intense effort to lift reading and math scores, which are scrutinized most closely under state and federal law, has led to a decline in instruction in other subjects. 
 Ms. Moskowitz said she had the impression that officials had not been paying close attention to the numbers. ''You didn't get the sense they had been poring over any statistics,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Jockeying Intensifies in Battle Over Nominees for Courts

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans in the Senate busied themselves on Monday with increasingly intense gamesmanship in the fight over President Bush's judicial choices.
 The Democrats, eager to demonstrate that they do not oppose all his choices for federal appeals courts, offered an immediate vote on Thomas B. Griffith of Utah, Mr. Bush's relatively uncontroversial nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
 ''Let's step away from the precipice,'' said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the minority leader. ''Let's try cooperation rather than confrontation.'' 
 The Republicans declined, interested in maintaining indignation over other blocked nominees to fortify themselves to change the filibuster rules. 
 The majority leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, said there should be a floor vote on all the nominees. 
 ''All of this obstruction must stop,'' Dr. Frist said. ''It is hurting the nominees. It is hurting the Senate. It is hurting the American people.''
 By midweek, the Republicans expect to have in place at least four nominees whom they regard as far better test cases than Mr. Griffith for a showdown over the rules. 
 The four are Janice Rogers Brown, William G. Myers III, William H. Pryor Jr. and Priscilla R. Owen. They were among the 10 appeals court nominees blocked from confirmation in Mr. Bush's first term by Democrats who described them as ideologues who do not belong on the federal bench. Democrats have threatened filibusters, or extended debate, to block votes on their confirmations.
 Mr. Bush renominated the four, insisting that they are highly qualified and deserve an up-or-down vote, which they would win because the Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate.
 Of the original 10, three did not seek renomination and another three are the subject of a largely nonideological dispute that involves the White House and the two Democratic senators from Michigan. 
 Dr. Frist has brandished with increasing fervor a threat to change Senate rules to prohibit Democrats from using a filibuster to block several nominees. 
 Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in a floor speech Monday that both parties had been at fault.
 ''Each has ratcheted up the ante in delaying and denying confirmation to the other party's presidential nominees,'' Mr. Specter said.
 Judge Pryor is the only one of the four whose nomination has not been approved and sent to the floor by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
 The committee is widely expected to vote along party lines on Wednesday to approve Judge Pryor, who is sitting as an appeals court judge after having been appointed by Mr. Bush during a Congressional recess to sidestep Democratic opposition temporarily.
 Democrats have criticized Judge Pryor, a former attorney general of Alabama, for his role as a founding member of the Republican Attorneys General Association. The group has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations from corporations that state attorneys general regulate.
 Some Republican senators and Christian conservatives have used Judge Pryor as a leading example to make the case that Democrats have been discriminating against judicial candidates who have deeply held religious views.
 In a brief defending a Texas statute outlawing consensual homosexual conduct, Mr. Pryor wrote that if the law were struck down, it would open the way for legalized ''prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography and even incest and pedophilia.'' 
 In June 2003, the United States Supreme Court overturned the statute by a vote of 6 to 3.
 In Alabama, Mr. Pryor initially defended Chief Justice Roy Moore of the State Supreme Court against a suit that challenged the constitutionality of erecting a monument to the Ten Commandments in a courthouse. After a federal appeals court ruled against Chief Justice Moore, Mr. Pryor filed an ethics complaint with the Alabama bar, saying the chief justice was ignoring a lawful court order. The complaint resulted in Chief Justice Moore's being removed from the bench.
 In the nomination of Justice Owen of the Texas Supreme Court, the most controversial issue is her dissents from court rulings that interpret a state law that allows a minor to have an abortion without parental permission in certain circumstances. In one dissent, Justice Owen said the teenager had not demonstrated that she knew that there were religious objections to abortion and that some women who underwent abortions had experienced severe remorse.
 Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, a justice on the court at the time, said the dissenters' views were far beyond what the Legislature had enacted and amounted to ''an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' 
 Other justices also said Justice Owen and her fellow dissenters were putting their own views ahead of the law.
 Justice Brown, an outspoken, conservative African-American on the California Supreme Court, has been compared as a nominee to Clarence Thomas, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court after a bruising public battle. She has, like Justice Thomas, asserted that her speeches, often laced with vivid and attention-getting language, are not relevant to how she approaches her work.
 Mr. Myers has been opposed by Democrats who say he was chosen only because he is a longtime lobbyist for ranching and mining interests.
 The other appeals court nominees whom Democrats have opposed include Judge Terrence W. Boyle of Federal District Court in Elizabeth City, N.C.; Brett M. Kavanaugh, a senior White House official; and Judge Henry W. Saad, a nominee caught in the Michigan dispute.
 Lawmakers in both parties said Monday that senators outside the leadership were trying to find a solution short of a floor fight over the filibuster rule, but that no compromise had emerged. 
 Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, said he was continuing to work with Republicans to develop a ''backup'' plan to avert a confrontation.

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 10 about the intensity of the Senate debate over President Bush's judicial nominees referred imprecisely to the president's comments on four of his choices. He said they were qualified and deserved an up-or-down vote. The suggestion that they would win such a vote, because the Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, was supplied by the writers of the article.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Pact in Americas Faces Trouble

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Social Security is not the administration's only economic initiative that is in trouble in Congress. 
 The current centerpiece of President Bush's trade agenda, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, is facing unusually united Democratic opposition as well as serious problems in overcoming well-entrenched special interest groups like sugar producers and much of the textile industry. 
 With record trade deficits, concerns about lost jobs and an overarching fear that the United States is losing out in the accelerated pace of global changes, the sentiment in Congress is shifting away from approving new free trade agreements. 
 ''I don't like Cafta; I am not going to vote for it; and I will do whatever I can to kill it,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader. ''We are approaching a trillion-dollar trade deficit. We can't survive as a viable, strong country doing that.'' 
 Even more troubling to the administration, which says free trade agreements are critical components of any effort to enhance American global competitiveness, is the stance of Republicans like Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who wants to hold off on new bilateral trade agreements.
 In a speech on the Senate floor and in a later opinion-page article in the newspaper The Hill, Senator Chambliss said that even though his state is home to global companies like Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service and Georgia Pacific, he could no longer support bilateral trade agreements without being assured that ''American industries and workers are truly benefiting from these agreements.'' 
 The trade deal, which was signed one year ago, involves a handful of tiny countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. But its prospects for moving forward have been soured by larger questions about China's enormous economic power and whether it is playing by the rules of trade in protecting intellectual property rights, valuing its currency and calibrating the tide of its textile exports. Also playing into the situation are unmet expectations from the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 The administration accuses the Democrats and other opponents of putting too much on the back of this trade deal, which would reduce tariffs for many American goods and, the White House says, improve the chances for democracy and free market economics in Latin America. 
 ''Cafta can't be held captive to China or any other trade problem,'' said Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez, who has been crisscrossing the country trying to sell the agreement since he took office in January. 
 The administration admits that even in this off-election year, when trade deals have the best chance of passage, it does not have the votes to pass this one. 
 With little sign of progress, both sides notched up the battle last week. President Bush announced that he would play host this week at a high-profile White House meeting. Since his first term, the Bush administration has promoted free trade agreements with Central America and throughout the Western Hemisphere as important components of its foreign policy. 
 ''For too many decades,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a speech before the Council of the Americas, ''U.S. policy toward Central America and the Dominican Republic has oscillated from engagement to disregard. With Cafta, with the permanent engagement that free trade brings, we can break this trend once and for all and we can demonstrate that the United States is committed to the success of all Latin American countries that embrace the challenge of democracy.'' 
 On the other side, centrist Democrats who normally vote for every new trade deal said they opposed Cafta. They said the administration had yet to outline a clear policy aimed at narrowing the $617 billion trade deficit. And they challenged the White House to write trade deals that reflected what they saw as the pressing challenges of globalization in the 21st century. 
 The administration characterizes most of these complaints as protectionism and hopes that Rob Portman, the new United States trade representative and a popular former member of Congress, will be able to smooth the debate and win votes to its side. 
 But Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Trade of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that Cafta was too small a treaty to warrant such attention. 
 ''Cafta will have a minor impact on our economy; we should be spending time on the big issues like China, agricultural subsidies,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''If I were the administration, I would not like my trade agenda to be judged on Cafta.'' 
 Despite its small weight, many interest groups are deeply divided over Cafta. The Latino groups and politicians who oppose Cafta say that Nafta, the decade-old agreement with Mexico and Canada, failed to fulfill its promise. 
 Representative Hilda Solis, Democrat of California, who describes herself as the only member of Congress of Central American descent, said she opposed Cafta because of Nafta's record, which she said included 750,000 jobs lost in the United States and little progress in improving workers' rights in Mexico. 
 By contrast, Mr. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, said Nafta was a strong selling point for Cafta. 
 ''I've been associated with Mexico for almost four decades and Mexico is better than it has ever been,'' said Mr. Gutierrez, who started his career in that country after fleeing Cuba as a child. ''It now has its lowest inflation rate, and its growth last year was 4.5 percent.'' 
 But questions about labor rights and lost jobs are staying at the forefront of the trade debate, not retreating. American labor unions say the accord demands better enforcement of existing labor laws in Central America without imposing real sanctions. The administration defends the labor provisions as groundbreaking. 
 Even the countries within Cafta have some noticeable divisions. The ambassadors to the United States from Cafta countries are traveling around the nation to try to persuade members of Congress to vote for the accord. 
 But Beatrice de Carrillo, El Salvador's human rights ombudswoman, said in an interview here that she opposed Cafta because it was not strong enough to stop the destruction of unions. And Costa Rica's president, Abel Pacheco, has said he wants to postpone legislative review until an independent committee finds that it will not harm the poor.

HEADLINE: Little-Known Story of G.I.'s Trapped in the Holocaust 

BYLINE: By TOM BROKAW

 BODY:

Soldiers and Slaves
American P.O.W.'s Trapped by the Nazis' Final Gamble
By Roger Cohen
303 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.
 Sixty years later, we're still sifting through the triumphs and the horrors of World War II, the heroes and the villains, the myths and the awful truths, the big stories and the small ones, trying to understand the many layers of a time the British military historian John Keegan has called the greatest single event in the history of mankind.
 While all of the big pieces have been assembled on history's table for some time now, it is the discovery of the little-known episodes that constantly expands our appreciation, fascination and revulsion for the brutal clash of civilizations in the heart of the 20th century.
 Roger Cohen's meticulously reported and passionately felt book ''Soldiers and Slaves'' is just such a discovery. It is the story of American G.I.'s who were captured by the Germans in late 1944 and sent to a notorious slave labor camp where they entered the dark world of the Holocaust. 
 Many of the roughly 350 soldiers, but not all, were Jewish, singled out by the Nazis for assignment to a camp that was so brutally dehumanizing that the American soldiers later qualified as Holocaust survivors.
 Mr. Cohen, the international writer at large and a former foreign editor for The New York Times who writes the Globalist column for The International Herald Tribune, dedicates the book to the memory of Charles Guggenheim, a soft-spoken and elegant man who was an award-winning documentary filmmaker. Guggenheim spent the last years of his life researching and recording the fate that might have been his had he shipped out with his outfit, the 106th infantry regiment, to Europe. Instead, a foot infection kept him home.
 Those who did go found themselves in the winter of 1944 in the Battle of the Bulge, the desperate counterattack by Nazi forces against American positions in the deep snow of a Belgian winter. It was a ferocious battle and the American lines were stretched thin, so the Germans were able take thousands of G.I.'s prisoner.
 William J. Shapiro, a medic with the 28th Infantry Division, was typical. He was a 19-year-old son of Jewish-Russian immigrants who had grown up in the Bronx, where his parents worried more about assimilation into American culture and economic survival than they did about their Jewish identity.
 ''I wasn't a Jew when I went to war,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''I was an American soldier.'' Nonetheless, like other Jewish G.I.'s, his dog tags had an H on them, for Hebrew. As the Germans closed in on his position in mid-December 1944, Mr. Shapiro ditched his dog tags but he couldn't hide his name, so his German captors reserved for him and other Jewish Americans taken prisoner a place in a little-known hell called Berga.
 Berga was one of the smaller Nazi slave labor camps, in the eastern part of Germany. In the closing months of the war, Hitler's planners selected it as the site of a frantic effort to develop synthetic fuel to keep the Third Reich in the fight. They shipped Jewish prisoners from other concentration camps, including Buchenwald, to Berga and forced them, along with the American P.O.W.'s, to begin hollowing out a mountain for an underground production center.
 The bestial conditions of the work, the absence of medical care and nourishment, and the cruelty of the Nazi guards, particularly a German with a long, prewar criminal record, quickly led to a primordial struggle for survival for Americans with names like Goldin and Lubinsky. Others -- Goldman, Schultz, Rosen, Cantor -- died as a result of illness, beatings, malnutrition. So did non-Jews with names like Young, Johnson and Osborn.
 They died not just in the camp at Berga but also on a little-documented death march in April 1945, when the Germans began a frantic retreat to the west as the Russians closed in from the east, a forced trek that claimed the lives of 50 American soldiers in less than two weeks. Two dozen more had died in camp, so 20 percent of the Americans shipped to Berga in December 1944 were dead by mid-April 1945, as a result of the unspeakably cruel conditions.
 Mr. Cohen, relying on Guggenheim's original research, tracked down the survivors for firsthand accounts of their lives then and now, and their continuing struggle 60 years later to live with the memories of that ghastly experience. He recounts the singular role of Johann (Hans) Kasten, a German-American who was a model of soldierly dignity and, ultimately, rage as he pursued a Nazi tormentor at the war's end.
 In the midst of the American ordeal, Mr. Cohen also documents the remarkable odyssey of Mordecai Hauer, a young Austrian Jew who survived Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Berga while losing almost all the members of his immediate family. Mr. Hauer's only connection to the Americans is that they were at Berga at the same time, but his story is so compelling and is included so skillfully that it enhances rather than distracts from the main narrative.
 Who can blame a reporter for wanting to write all he has discovered about inhumanity, cruelty, injustice, courage and survival in an underworld governed by a slavish devotion to ''Befehl ist Befehl'' -- an order is an order?
 As ''Soldiers and Slaves'' reminds us, in haunting fashion, World War II was an epic military and political struggle that six decades later continues to give up from its scarred landscape the grotesque and yet inspirational remains of a time when the world went mad.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 17, 2005

 CORRECTION:
The Books of The Times review yesterday, about ''Soldiers and Slaves: American P.O.W.'s Trapped by the Nazis' Final Gamble,'' by Roger Cohen, misstated the timing of the transport of American prisoners to the Berga slave labor camp in Germany. It was in February 1945, not December 1944. The review also misidentified the home country of Mordecai Hauer, a Jewish prisoner who was at Berga with the Americans. It was Hungary, not Austria.


The Books of The Times review on Wednesday, about ''Soldiers and Slaves: American P.O.W.'s Trapped by the Nazis' Final Gamble,'' by Roger Cohen, misidentified the Army unit of Charles Guggenheim, to whose memory the book is dedicated. It was the 106th Infantry Division, not Regiment.

HEADLINE: Temporary Space for 191 Countries? For U.N., Maybe It's in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; Michael Brick contributed reporting from Brooklyn for this article.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 10 

 BODY:
Angry American critics have suggested that the United Nations should pack up and leave the United States and go to, say, France.
 But Secretary General Kofi Annan has come up with an idea closer to home.
 Try Brooklyn.
 The possibility emerged on Tuesday in a new progress report from Mr. Annan on plans to move the organization into temporary housing during the renovation of the United Nations headquarters on the East River in Manhattan, once stylish but now dangerously antiquated. 
 While the destination remains in doubt, there is no dispute over the need to vacate the existing headquarters. 
 Periodic surveys have found the building, with its asbestos, lead paint, outmoded plumbing and electrical systems and lack of sprinklers to be alarmingly behind the times and below minimal safety standards.
 One example of how little of the insides have been updated since the sleek 38-story tower was completed in 1952 is a padlocked room on the 28th floor housing electrical transformers. On the door is a boldfaced warning, ''High Voltage,'' and the words, ''In case of necessity, call MUrray Hill 2-4477.''
 The original plan had been for the 3,600 people at headquarters to move for five years to a new $330 million, 35-story building one block south on First Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets, constructed by the end of 2006. 
 That plan would have been financed by a $1.2 billion loan from the United States, repayable over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 5.54 percent. 
 The emptied headquarters complex was to be finished in time for the organization to move back in by 2010. Offices now scattered around New York would have been consolidated in the new building.
 But state lawmakers in Albany upset the timing when, in their opposition to the United Nations, they failed to pass the legislation expected last December that would have let the plan go forward. The delays have sowed confusion, sent price estimates soaring and prompted the organization to look for alternatives.
 In his report, Mr. Annan said a search of more than 100 properties in Manhattan turned up no space suitable for both office and conference needs.
 One nearby Manhattan location would do for office space, he said, but a separate site would have to be found for conferences for the 191-nation General Assembly. For that, he said, the United Nations could settle on ''no-cost land'' -- a reference to the park just north of the United Nations -- but he said that $45 million would be needed to construct a temporary building there.
 Mr. Annan said the only property uncovered by real estate consultants that would meet the United Nations' specifications was in Downtown Brooklyn.
 United Nations officials declined to be precise about the address, but the report called it ''part of a larger development in Downtown Brooklyn'' and described it as existing office space where halls could be built to accommodate conferences.
 ''The advantage of this site is that conference and office space would be together,'' the report said. ''The disadvantage is that the site would require additional travel for many staff and delegates.''
 Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Mr. Annan, said that he found the idea intriguing, given the United Nations' embattled circumstances.
 ''Even though I live in New Jersey and I'd have to travel farther, I like the idea of Brooklyn for the United Nations,'' he said. ''After all, Brooklyn is an underdog.''
 No matter how long the odds of a move across the East River, Brooklyn's promoters were quick to think of a precedent: If Queens could play host to the Museum of Modern Art for an idyll, perhaps anything was possible.
 Marty Markowitz, the indefatigably enthusiastic Brooklyn borough president, was so beside himself he could barely speak straight.
 ''I'm beyond myself,'' Mr. Markowitz said. ''Brooklyn is home to everyone from everywhere, so if the U.N. wants a home that reflects the world, Brooklyn is it.''
 He restrained himself from resorting to his signature phrase -- ''I love Brooklyn!'' -- but when he was asked what the borough had to offer diplomats, the temptation to fall back on familiar lines proved overwhelming.
 ''I don't want to use that word, 'fuhgeddaboutit,''' Mr. Markowitz said. ''Just like every Manhattanite who comes across the bridge, they'll know they're in the promised land.''
 As is often the case in these sorts of matters, no one was quite as excited as Mr. Markowitz.
 Sydney Pollack, the director who filmed the thriller ''The Interpreter'' inside United Nations headquarters, said the organization feels like it belongs in Manhattan.
 ''There's something about the international sense of it and global focus that feels absolutely organic to New York that might not be organic to Brooklyn,'' Mr. Pollack said, adding that he was no expert on Brooklyn: ''My experience of Brooklyn is Peter Luger's.''
 The filmmaker Spike Lee, who maintains an office in Fort Greene, offered to show Mr. Annan around.
 ''The U.N., then the Nets, huh?'' Mr. Lee said, referring to a proposal to bring a professional basketball team to Brooklyn. ''I guess we could accommodate them for a little while, but they can't stay.''

HEADLINE: Area Added Jobs in March; Wall St. Sluggish 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
The New York region continues to gain jobs, but its job growth rate still lags the rest of the nation, data released yesterday from the federal government shows, largely because manufacturing jobs are declining in the city and job growth on Wall Street remains sluggish.
 Nonfarm employment rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in March from the same month a year earlier in the greater New York area, which includes New York City, Long Island, Westchester and northern New Jersey, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 But while March represented the 13th straight month of job growth for the city, the region is still down 1.6 percent -- or 136,000 fewer jobs -- from March 2001, when the recession had just begun. The region also lagged the nation in job growth in March over the same month last year. Nationally, jobs grew 1.6 percent in March over the March 2004 level. 
 In the last year, manufacturing jobs in the New York region shrank 2.7 percent, according to the bureau; for the city, the decline was 6.7 percent. By comparison, manufacturing jobs nationally grew a slight two-tenths of 1 percent in March over the same month a year earlier.
 In the financial area, 13,000 jobs were added between March 2004 and March 2005, the data released yesterday showed, but the industry is still 32,400 jobs shy of its March 2001 levels, about 4 percent. 
 ''New York City is growing less than the rest of the country in terms of job creation,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''The continued loss of jobs in New York in manufacturing, unlike in the country, is putting a brake on the jobs recovery in the city and region.'' 
 In terms of the financial sector, where bonuses are up and deals are being done again, Mr. Dolfman added, ''Salaries have come back in the financial sector, but the total number of jobs has not come back.'' 
 The same industries that have been driving job growth and the region's economy continued to do so in March. Jobs in education and health services grew 1.8 percent in the region, according to the bureau, and 3.3 percent in the leisure and hospitality industry, with a 3.7 percent increase in New York City alone. Employment in hospitality is now 7.7 percent above its level at the start of the recession four years ago.

IT has been a year since members of the class of 2004 donned caps and gowns, hugged friends goodbye and left the campuses where they had been for four years.

So, I continue to search for an entry-level job in film or television that at least covers my living expenses and starts me off on the right foot for a career. 
 ''I've considered moving to the West Coast. Moving overseas and volunteering or teaching English somewhere has also crossed my mind. I'm all over the place and trying to whittle down the possibilities, but I'm staying calm and thinking happy thoughts, reassuring myself that the right opportunity will show itself eventually.''

 ''The worst-case scenario for newly minted college grads is to spend their first year of real adulthood pent up in their childhood house, doing nothing, missing the college social life and regretting not being on top of things last year. I know many people who have fallen into a depressive malaise this year. One of the most important things is to be productive. This doesn't necessarily mean getting a job, but just having a purpose. 
 ''Grad school is good at providing a sense of purpose. It's basically a continuation of the college lifestyle, allowing me to work on my own clock and under my own terms, doing what I love to do: study history. But it doesn't foster financial independence. 
 ''So students are either living off their parents or incurring massive debt. And it can also be difficult to differentiate this new experience from your college days. Questions like, 'If I still take courses with undergrads, write essays on deadlines and take examinations, have I actually moved on with my life?' eat at me sometimes. 
 ''At least I'll have those two letters -- M.A. -- after my name, though. That'll be pretty cool.''

 ''Having graduated from a big public university, one of the most important things I've learned is how to navigate an equally as large bureaucracy in the real world. Going to U.C.L.A. made me more independent -- no one is going to hold your hand through it all, which helps when it comes time to look for a job. 
 ''I feel prepared for having to be aggressive in the working world, making myself look competitive. But sometimes I wish more general life skills, like how to budget and deal with your landlord, might have also been taught to me somehow. 
 ''Being away from home now is not like being away from home in college: you have to put yourself out there to meet people, as opposed to just walking down the hall of your dorm.''

 ''While the transition has been pretty smooth, I definitely miss the college days. My friends from school and I constantly talk about how stagnated we feel in the working world. We all studied abroad and constantly met interesting people whose world visions meshed with ours. 
 ''Now we feel nervous that we'll never have that much fun again. But our jobs are providing us with skills, money and knowledge, and we know it won't be like this forever.''

 ''Working four different jobs while going to college was hard. I had the demands of my professors, my employers and Con Edison all wanting a piece of the pie. Here, I'm only working one job, but it's a very intense program. My internship is also demanding, and I still need to make a paycheck. 
 ''Now that I'm in grad school, I feel prepared, but sometimes don't feel prepared. There are many barriers to higher education that women of color face -- having less access to financial and emotional support, and persevering through single parenthood. It's scary because my awareness is changing and my social class is changing, and I'm learning the truth about being middle class. 
 ''Even though I'm able to afford $3,500 a semester in tuition through financial aid, that does not mean that I can afford three meals a day, that my basic needs are guaranteed to be met. Maybe this is what experts have called middle-class poverty.''

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Seeks Leaner Army, and a Full Term

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
Ask Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to define his legacy, and he cuts the question short: ''Don't. Hold off on it. There will be plenty of time.''
 With a full list of policy initiatives ahead and travel plans penciled in through the Beijing Olympics of 2008, Mr. Rumsfeld gives every indication of serving out the rest of the Bush administration, confounding those who predicted his departure even after President Bush refused, twice, to accept his resignation over the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.
 ''I don't think of myself as a short-timer,'' said Mr. Rumsfeld, who turns 73 in July. 
 His goal in this pivotal year is to keep Iraq and Afghanistan at bay so he can turn to closing bases at home and realigning global forces even as combat continues; overhauling personnel policy while dealing with a crisis in recruiting; redefining national security strategy while confronting alarming nuclear developments in North Korea and Iran; and drafting a disciplined military budget -- one that does not rely on emergency spending to scrape through year after budget-busting year.
 But across the Pentagon, officials acknowledge that the twin tasks of building Iraqi security forces and defeating the insurgency stand in the way of Mr. Rumsfeld's longstanding ambitions to fundamentally transform the nation's military into something leaner, more agile and thoroughly modern. Success in Iraq would allow troop withdrawals to begin, relieving strains on budgets and personnel.
 Opening up a new front of controversy, Mr. Rumsfeld is to unveil his list of recommended domestic base closings on Friday. It is sure to provoke opposition from communities that stand to lose the economic benefits of being host to the military. 
 By midsummer, the Pentagon's senior policy aides and top officers will convene a meeting to overhaul military strategy for the next four years. A final report due early next year, a Quadrennial Defense Review required by Congress, will try to balance strategy better with budgets, weapons and troop strength. Everything is on the table, including aircraft carriers, new fighters and broad strategic goals. Here, too, any change that upsets the status quo will meet some opposition.
 In an interview, Mr. Rumsfeld compared the Pentagon he inherited to a factory where there were ''conveyor belts going by and they were loaded four, five, six years ago, and they were not connected with each other.'' He said budgets did not fit weapons, which did not fit strategy.
 Mr. Rumsfeld is opening the Bush administration's second term as if he were an ambitious novice, not five years into his second tour in a job he first held 30 years ago, cognizant that this is perhaps his first year not necessarily dominated by the Sept. 11 attacks and their aftermath.
 Even his sharpest critics -- generals and admirals who have endured the wire-brush treatment of his relentless questioning, and senior civilians across the executive branch who have fought bitter internal battles with Mr. Rumsfeld and his policy proxies -- agree that he got one thing right: Mr. Rumsfeld is forcing the Department of Defense to think about warfare differently and, just as important, to think in new ways about its daily business practices.
 Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview, ''There is not a D.O.D. process of any sort that we haven't turned on its ear in the past four years.'' 
 Mr. Rumsfeld produced an eight-page list of initiatives and accomplishments on his watch, many of them beneath the radar of public attention but nonetheless substantial changes in how the military prepares for and wages war, and how the Pentagon gets through the day.
 The military's map of the world has been redrawn to divide the globe more rationally among regional combatant commanders, and new responsibilities, financing and personnel were given to the specialized commands, in particular, ones responsible for Special Operations and for strategic planning and targeting.
 The United States' nuclear strategy has been rewritten, as have regional war-fighting plans, and efforts are under way to restructure and relocate the forces permanently based overseas. The goal is to reduce the number of large cold-war-era bases, especially in Germany, in favor of access to countries closer to future battlefronts across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.
 The military is rebalancing the responsibilities of active-duty personnel and reservists to help ease strains on the Army and Marine Corps, which are experiencing serious recruiting problems. 
 One set of overwhelming questions remains: whether the American public and Congress are exhausted by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and whether enough money will be available for transformation to a high-tech military while still supporting a conventional force deployed to combat zones.
 ''He doesn't have the money to do it,'' said Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, a senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
 Congressional committees are just starting their detailed review of Mr. Rumsfeld's budget request, work that could take two months or more to complete.
 Mr. Rumsfeld says the Sept. 11 attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not delayed transformation or even been a distraction, but have energized the effort.
 ''It has been the global war on terror and the tasks that we've been assigned that has provided added impetus to doing the things that absolutely had to be done in this department,'' he said. 
 As Mr. Rumsfeld presses his transformation agenda, he still confronts bruised relations with lawmakers and even some in the administration over Iraq policy and the fallout from the Abu Ghraib prisoner-abuse scandal. 
 Critics blame Mr. Rumsfeld for invading Iraq with too few troops and embracing overly optimistic assumptions about what would happen once Saddam Hussein was overthrown.
 ''When it became evident that we were going to face a determined and prolonged insurgency, he was very resistant to increasing troop levels, stepping up production of up-armored Humvees, and modifying the game plan,'' said Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican on the Armed Services Committee. 
 In the interview, Mr. Rumsfeld exhibited a trademark mix, by turns combative and introspective, as he deflected questions of how history would weigh the troubled aftermath of invading Iraq -- particularly the Abu Ghraib scandal -- against the changes he is still pressing.
 ''Anybody who knows anything about history knows that history gets written as a result of a whole series of things being said and aggregated over time, and people with perspective that don't have their nose pressed up against a deadline every five minutes,'' he said. 
 He said there was progress in the war on terror, but conceded that Al Qaeda was still able to function, saying, ''Goodness knows, it doesn't take a genius to blow up a building.''
 Mr. Rumsfeld is banking on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan remaining stable enough for him to focus his attention elsewhere. Frequent video-teleconferences with senior commanders in Iraq during the peak of combat operations have dwindled to a few phone calls a week.
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers say winning support for his proposed changes has been made more difficult by Mr. Rumsfeld's often rocky relations with Congress. In public hearings and in news conferences, Mr. Rumsfeld, a former congressman from Illinois, can often barely disguise his impatience with lawmakers. 
 But he has worked harder to cultivate good ties with Congress, setting aside Tuesday and Thursday mornings for breakfast with House and Senate members at the Pentagon.
 ''It's been up and down,'' said Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, a Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. ''Some people think he doesn't kowtow to them enough.'' 
 Inside the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld is retooling his senior military and civilian leadership team from a war cabinet to corporate-style board of directors. 
 His new management team is led by Gordon R. England, his new deputy, who fits the traditional model of a No.2 who oversees daily operations and avoids ideological battles. Mr. England, the Navy secretary, was once executive vice president of General Dynamics.
 He will replace Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, a lightning rod for critics of the Iraq war, who leaves in June to take over as head of the World Bank. Another senior policy figure criticized during the Iraq war effort, Douglas J. Feith, is also leaving, to be replaced by Eric Edelman, a career Foreign Service officer who previously was a senior aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld is reshuffling his top military advisers, but with familiar faces. Gen. Peter Pace of the Marines who has worked closely with Mr. Rumsfeld for four years as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, will succeed General Myers as chairman this fall. Nominated as the new vice chairman is Adm. Edmund P. Giambastiani Jr., who was Mr. Rumsfeld's top military aide until taking over the military's Joint Forces Command in 2002. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld works hard to leave his imprint on the bureaucracy, spending up to 10 hours a week on senior officer and civilian appointments. He has seeded like-minded proteges throughout the military's senior ranks to ensure that his priorities outlast him. He routinely reaches down to interview one-star and two-star officers for important jobs, a practice that some officers deride as a politically motivated ''Rumsfeld sniff test.'' 
 In a conference room just a few paces from his office, Mr. Rumsfeld and 15 of his top civilian and military advisers meet at least twice a month to hammer out the most pressing issues, like budgets or base closings. 
 ''They know each other, they know each other's strengths and weaknesses, they're comfortable talking in front of each other, which in many cases they had not been,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''The decisions that flow out of that room are all of the big things that take place in this building.'' 
 Mr. Rumsfeld's admirers and critics alike say it is too soon to gauge his permanent stamp on the Pentagon or the military operations he set in motion.
 ''He hasn't finished the job, either in Iraq or with transformation,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has sparred frequently with the secretary. ''So I don't know how you would judge him until the results are in.'' 
 Mr. Rumsfeld believes in measurements, whether electrical output from Baghdad or how many military jobs civilians could take over or how often a bespectacled defense secretary appears in editorial cartoons, many of which hang in his office.
 Each day, he tries to walk five miles through the Pentagon's polished corridors, keeping track with a pace meter on his belt. ''He's an inveterate counter with a purpose,'' said Larry Di Rita, the Pentagon spokesman.
 Some evenings, he plays squash with Mr. Di Rita or Vice Adm. James G. Stavridis, Mr. Rumsfeld's senior military assistant. In the fashion of his hometown, Chicago, Mr. Rumsfeld improves his odds against the younger men by putting in the fix: He refuses to allow the livelier, softer rubber ball favored by today's players.
 ''I play my game,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''I play hardball.''

HEADLINE: Head of New Jersey's School Construction Agency Resigns

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 10 

 BODY:
The head of New Jersey's School Construction Corporation resigned on Tuesday after the agency, responding to an audit that found the $8.6 billion program poorly managed and beset by cost overruns, adopted a series of reforms.
 Jack Kocsis Jr. had served as chairman of the agency, the most expensive public works program in New Jersey history, since it was created in 2000, in response to a 1998 court order to replace schools in low-income districts.
 In his resignation letter, Mr. Kocsis said he was proud that the agency had helped build more than 80 new schools without the delays that have bogged down many construction projects. 
 But reports published by The Star-Ledger of Newark early this year found that schools built by the agency cost an average of 45 percent more than similar schools built by local districts. Mr. Kocsis was also accused of conflicts of interest because he was employed as an executive director and lobbyist for the Building Contractors Association of New Jersey, an industry group whose members received $1 billion in agency contracts.
 In March, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey suspended the agency from spending money and ordered the inspector general to investigate its finances. After a scathing audit, which found that lax fiscal oversight made the agency ''vulnerable to mismanagement, fiscal malfeasance, conflicts of interest and waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayers dollars,'' the board on Tuesday adopted a series of reforms and Mr. Kocsis announced his resignation.
 ''With the reforms adopted today, the primary leadership needs of the S.C.C. board now shifts from construction oversight to financial and corporate management,'' Mr. Kocsis wrote in his resignation letter. Mr. Codey announced that Mr. Kocsis, whose resignation was effective immediately, would remain a board member and be succeeded as chairman by Alfred C. Koppe, a former top executive at both Public Service Electric and Gas and Bell Atlantic. Mr. Koppe has also served on a wide range of government advisory boards from the Newark Alliance and New Jersey Economic Development Authority to the state's Higher Education Commission and the Wilentz Commission to overhaul New Jersey's courts.
 ''He will bring new accountability and new oversight to the S.C.C.,'' Mr. Codey said.
 Mr. Koppe said he was confident that his business experience would help establish a new sense of fiscal discipline at the agency.
 "If there is one skill-set I have learned as a corporate executive and as a lawyer, it is how to make sure that large organizations run at the highest level of efficiency and equity,'' Mr. Koppe wrote in a letter accepting the nomination. ''That seems to be the task at hand here.''

HEADLINE: Police Counter Dealers' DVD With One of Their Own

BYLINE: By GARY GATELY

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, May 10 

 BODY:
In an infamous DVD called ''Stop Snitching,'' Baltimore drug dealers threatened to kill anyone who testified against them. On Tuesday, the Baltimore police countered with a DVD of their own: ''Keep Talking.''
 Officers distributed 600 copies of the video in a drug-ravaged neighborhood of East Baltimore, in a direct response to the makers of ''Stop Snitching.'' 
 ''The men and women of the Baltimore Police Department would like to thank the producers of the 'Stop Snitching' video,'' Detective Donny Moses says in the new DVD. ''In case you didn't know, you actually helped make Baltimore a safer city. If we didn't know before, now we know the faces in the game.'' 
 The police DVD includes footage from ''Stop Snitching'' and says that three people in the video have been arrested, including a man who appeared in it pulling a gun from his waistband. 
 Officers plan to distribute more copies of ''Keep Talking'' later this week in violent neighborhoods in the western and northwestern sections of the city and also plan to turn the video into a public-service announcement to be broadcast on local television stations.
 The earlier DVD had drawn attention because of the appearance on it of Carmelo Anthony, a National Basketball Association star who grew up in Baltimore. Mr. Anthony has said he was unaware that he appeared on the video. He is scheduled to join Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. on Wednesday to start a separate anti-violence campaign.
 While the police DVD speaks directly to criminals, its message, ''keep talking,'' applies to others as well, said Leonard D. Hamm, the Baltimore police commissioner. 
 ''What we're saying to the community,'' Mr. Hamm said, ''is that we're going to help you solve crime problems so you can live decent lives, so people can sit on their steps again, so people can go to the store without being afraid because a neighborhood's inundated by violence.'' 
 The case for the DVD includes anonymous phone tip lines for reporting crime. So, too, do fliers the police are distributing with photos and names of those arrested and the charges against them. 
 In the neighborhoods where officers are distributing the videos, vacant houses stand out on block after block. When the police are not around, dealers work the corners, selling crack and heroin in a city with one of the highest drug-addiction rates in the nation. The drug trade, in turn, fuels violence in Baltimore, which had 278 homicides last year -- a per capita rate five times greater than that of New York City.
 The police say that violent crime has declined and that the number of homicides for this time of year has dipped to 83, compared with 93 last year. But they acknowledge that the city faces a daunting challenge in trying to reduce the murder rate, and that rampant witness intimidation hinders prosecution. 
 Prof. David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said the police video was a twist in efforts among law enforcement agencies to communicate directly with criminals. To succeed, Professor Kennedy said, such communication must be accompanied by evidence that the police will back up their threats with action.
 ''The key is to be credible,'' he said. By mentioning the arrests of three of the ''Stop Snitching'' stars in the new video, Professor Kennedy said, the police in Baltimore are sending a strong message ''that says, 'Look, there are some things in particular that we won't stand for, and these guys didn't listen, and here's what happened to them.'''
 The Baltimore police are also planning to install surveillance cameras in high-crime neighborhoods. They have recently begun shining spotlights from police helicopters onto drug corners, then quickly dispatching officers to try to identify suspected dealers. The department is also considering putting officers with binoculars atop lifeguard chairs in high-crime areas.
 The videos heartened some who received them. Michael Booth, 36, an unemployed truck driver who described himself as a recovering addict, said he had known many people who had been killed on the streets of Baltimore. 
 ''I believe that it will make a difference,'' Mr. Booth said. ''Before, it was a case where your life was in jeopardy and you would be threatened and you would be scared if you reported violence. But now you feel like the police will step up to the plate and protect you.''
 Darlene Adams, 43, a grandmother who said she had seen dealers filming ''Stop Snitching,'' said of the police video: ''It will send a message to some, but some will think it's a joke. I pray it will make a difference.''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart and Costco

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Choosing Sides Over $9.68 an Hour'' (Business Day, May 4), the annual wage of a full-time Wal-Mart employee -- $17,600 -- was compared with the United States poverty line for a family of three ($15,219) and a family of four ($19,157).
 But it is widely agreed that our poverty thresholds are woefully out of date and no longer represent what working families need to make ends meet. Our research on what it costs such families to afford basic necessities yields values far higher than the poverty lines. For example, in Wal-Mart's hometown, Bentonville, Ark., safe yet modest housing alone costs $6,500 per year; adding in health insurance, child care and other necessities raises the budget for a family with a couple of children to over $30,000.
 This income level provides a much more relevant benchmark against which to judge whether Wal-Mart employees can meet their basic needs.

HEADLINE: Little Common Ground at Arab-South American Summit Talks

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BRASILIA, May 10 

 BODY:
Leaders of South America and the Arab world, two regions that have had relatively little contact with each other but have long chafed at American dominance, gathered here on Tuesday to meet for the first time and to air their list of grievances.
 But the two blocs in attendance at the initial South American-Arab Nations Summit almost immediately voiced profoundly different priorities. In their opening speeches, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria and Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League, focused their criticisms on Israel and the United States and called for greater solidarity with the Palestinians. 
 South American leaders, however, sought to keep the emphasis on economic issues. ''Our great challenge is to design a new international economic and commercial geography,'' the Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said in remarks inaugurating the event on Tuesday morning.
 The conference is a Brazilian initiative, part of a larger effort by the government of Mr. da Silva to project Brazil onto the world stage as a regional power and to secure a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It comes on the heels, however, of some embarrassing foreign policy missteps, like the collapse of Brazil's bid to lead the World Trade Organization and a tiff with neighboring Argentina.
 Attendance fell short of Brazil's initial expectations, further depriving the event of some of its luster. While the majority of South America's 12 presidents are participating, only 7 of the 22 Arab nations that were invited are represented by heads of state or government.
 One of them was the new president of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, who was making his first trip abroad in that capacity. His presence and that of the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, accounted for the extraordinary security precautions that had an estimated 9,000 soldiers and police officers in the streets of the Brazilian capital and shut down normal activities here.
 Behind the scenes, the two blocs struggled to devise a final declaration that would be acceptable to both sides and not damage Brazil's diplomatic aspirations. Diplomats here said the United States and the European Union had expressed concerns to participants at the tone of the draft that the Arab group were pushing with some support from Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, Washington's leading critic in South America.
 On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Mark Regev, expressed hope that ''our many friends in South America'' would help avoid ''some sort of extreme one-sided declaration that has no positive impact on the peace process'' and just encourages militant groups. Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, who is expected to visit Israel soon, said before the conference that he saw ''no reasons for the United States to be concerned.'' 
 As of Monday night, the joint declaration called on Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders and to dismantle its West Bank settlements, including those in East Jerusalem, and included language condemning terrorism, according to a draft made available to The New York Times.
 But it also called for an international conference to define what terrorism is, and endorsed the right of peoples to ''resist foreign occupation in accordance with the principle of international legality and in compliance with international humanitarian law.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Says Fire Chief Must Support Emergency Plan or Leave

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made clear yesterday that he would not tolerate continued disagreement over his new emergency response protocol, saying that the fire chief who publicly criticized it needs to support the new guidelines -- or leave.
 In careful but pointed remarks, the mayor said he was not angry with Chief Peter E. Hayden, who testified on Monday that he thought the protocol was flawed. But, the mayor said, he expected everyone in his administration to back the new procedures.
 ''My job is not to be angry; my job is to make sure that everybody works together,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''There are always going to be differences of opinion. But everybody, in the end, if they want to work for the city, is going to get together and work together and follow the decisions that the mayor was elected to make. I expect that to be the case here.'' 
 Later, in response to another question about Chief Hayden, Mr. Bloomberg added: ''Look, we are going to have everybody working together to protect the people of the City of New York. And anybody that doesn't feel that they can do that doesn't have to -- but they just can't work here.''
 The not-so-veiled threat reflected what Mr. Bloomberg's aides say is his determination to enforce his decision on the protocol, which was made after lengthy deliberations involving the heads of many city agencies, including the Fire Department. Chief Hayden made his disagreement with the decision publicly known first in a newspaper interview, and then in this week's testimony, after he was subpoenaed to appear before the City Council. The chief said he believes that the new policy gives the police too much control at some emergency scenes.
 Yesterday, the chief and the fire commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, presided over a promotions ceremony for firefighters, where they were asked by reporters about Chief Hayden's future. Mr. Scoppetta said he had received no pressure from City Hall to get rid of Chief Hayden, the city's highest-ranking fire officer, who serves at the pleasure of the mayor until June of next year, when his probationary period ends.
 ''No, absolutely not. We have not had that conversation, and I don't feel any pressure to do that,'' he said. ''I think that Pete has made his position clear, both on what the objections were, and now that the document is final, we're going to make it work.''
 If the chief were forced out, he could either retire or accept a demotion in civil service rank to assistant chief, the position he held before being named chief last year. Chief Hayden said he had ''no intention of leaving.''
 ''Certainly, I serve at the pleasure of the mayor, but I think that I put forth a valid argument, and I hope he takes that into consideration moving forward,'' he said. ''We will certainly work within the department to comply'' with the new protocol, he added.
 ''We'll follow the document as it's written, and we will make sure that everybody follows it in the field,'' Chief Hayden said. ''If there are inconsistencies or conflicts in the document that necessitate being addressed as we move forward, we'll bring that to the attention of the Office of Emergency Management.''
 The chief's main objection was the mayor's decision to place the Police Department in immediate command of hazardous materials emergencies until it is determined if terrorism or criminal activity is involved. Doing so, he argued, ''makes no sense'' because firefighters are expected to conduct rescue operations at such emergencies, yet would be subjugated to the police, whose investigative mission may conflict with the fire crews' role.
 Yesterday, taking questions after an economic development announcement at Kennedy Airport, Mr. Bloomberg said he had decided that police and fire commanders would jointly supervise all emergency scenes except those involving hazardous materials, ''based on F.B.I. and C.I.A. intelligence that the most likely terrorist attack would be a haz-mat attack on us.''
 ''I've heard everybody's views, and you can't have a solution that is going to satisfy everybody,'' the mayor said, adding later: ''We've made the decision. And now everybody is going to get on board and make that decision work.''

HEADLINE: CHINA RULES OUT USING SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID E. SANGER; Joseph Kahn reported from Beijing for this article, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 10 

 BODY:
China on Tuesday ruled out applying economic or political sanctions to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, appearing to undercut a crucial element of the Bush administration's evolving North Korea strategy. The announcement comes just as American intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether North Korea is preparing for a nuclear test.
 Echoing President Bush's public comments, the Chinese said in a briefing on Tuesday that they still hoped that talks with North Korea would succeed in disarming the country, even though it has boycotted those talks for 11 months.
 Liu Jianchao, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Tuesday that China rejected suggestions that it should reduce oil or food shipments to North Korea, calling them part of its normal trade with its neighbor that should be separate from the nuclear problem. ''The normal trade flow should not be linked up with the nuclear issue,'' he said. ''We oppose trying to address the problem through strong-arm tactics.'' 
 Beijing's apparent unwillingness to go along with Mr. Bush's backup plan to squeeze North Korea takes away the crucial pressure point that Mr. Bush's aides have been counting on. It also suggests that the strategy of threatening to go to the United Nations Security Council -- which Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has begun to discuss -- could fail.
 China's statement came just days after officials said at least one American intelligence agency had picked up signs that North Korea might be preparing for its first test of a nuclear weapon at Kilju in the northeastern part of the country.
 That evidence is ambiguous, and some in the intelligence agencies, including analysts at the State Department's bureau of intelligence and research, are debating whether the activity they are seeing in satellite images signals that a test is imminent. Even those who find the evidence particularly worrisome caution that the activity could be a ruse.
 Earlier on Tuesday, North Korea's state-run media said the United States was ''making a fuss'' regarding whether North Korea might conduct a test. While it dismissed the reports as ''U.S. strategic opinions,'' the Korean Central News Agency neither denied that that was the country's intent nor threatened -- as North Korea has in past -- to detonate a weapon to prove that it could. 
 President Bush called China's president, Hu Jintao, to discuss North Korea late last week, though the White House gave no details of the conversation. But several current and former American officials noted on Tuesday that the Chinese had consistently resisted pressure to crack down on trade with the North Koreans, and seemed to have made the stability of the North Korean government a top priority. Mr. Bush and his aides have said that disarmament is their top priority, and the president has made no secret of the fact that he detests the North Korea leader, Kim Jong Il, whom he recently called a ''tyrant,'' accusing him of keeping political dissidents in ''concentration camps.''
 ''Our sense is there is a great debate going on in Beijing right now, which is intense and divisive,'' one senior administration official said on Tuesday. ''Their game worked fine when the North Koreans were talking'' with the other five nations -- China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the United States. But now, the official noted, ''North Korea is saying it is a nuclear weapons state, and they say they want to go into mutual arms reduction talks.''
 That is a position very different from the one North Korea was taking a year ago, when the discussion was about agreeing to a de-nuclearized Korean Peninsula. The Chinese, the administration official said, ''know that just getting them back to the talks isn't good enough now.''
 Still, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statements suggest that China's strategy for dealing with North Korea remains basically unchanged despite the concerns about a nuclear test, and despite repeated appeals of the Bush administration urging Beijing to take a tougher line. 
 While Mr. Liu called recent developments related to North Korea's weapons program ''worrying,'' he said both the United States and North Korea had expressed a commitment to resume negotiations and that China had ''not lost hope'' in arranging a new round of talks.
 Some experts with long experience dealing with China on the North Korea issue suggest that Beijing's public stance may be quite different from what it is saying to the North Koreans. ''The Chinese may be feigning indifference,'' said Kurt Campbell, who held a senior defense position in the Clinton administration dealing with Asian issues. ''I believe in private they are putting pressure on the North Koreans not to test because a test would be deeply antithetical to their interests in the region.''
 Inside the Bush administration, policy makers seem divided on the question of whether North Korea is really headed toward a test.
 Among the questions are whether North Korea is bluffing, and whether its leaders have decided that demonstrating their nuclear capacities would serve their purposes better than continued ambiguity about them. These questions are complicated because there is no consensus among analysts about what the satellite imagery of the Kilju area shows.
 One senior official involved in the debate over how to handle North Korea said Monday that a test ''might convince the Chinese that they have to get tough.'' But just weeks ago, others in the administration were expressing concern that a test could be a political shock to the region and might set off an environmental disaster significant radiation leaked from an underground test site. 
 It is unclear whether the North Koreans could interpret China's public statements on Tuesday that it separated trade from nuclear issues as a signal that it would not suffer significant repercussions if it went ahead with a nuclear test. 
 Absent a test, however, it is unclear how the United States could increase pressure on North Korea without Chinese help. China could veto any United Nations resolution, and if it was unwilling to enforce sanctions along its border, any efforts to isolate North Korea would be likely to fail. The World Food Program, citing statistics from the Chinese government, said China's food aid to North Korea soared in the beginning of this year. By the organization's estimate, China sent 146,000 tons of food to North Korea in the first three months of this year, compared with 165,000 tons for all of 2004. 
 Since the United States accused North Korea of violating a pact to end its nuclear weapons program in 2002, China has resisted using trade or economic aid to its impoverished neighbor as leverage to force North Korea to discontinue the effort.
 On a visit to China in late April, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill repeated American arguments that China should squeeze North Korea, cutting down on trade, especially fuel shipments, as a signal of displeasure with its refusal to return to the negotiating table. One senior official said the Chinese made it clear that they were concerned about prompting more instability in North Korea that could send millions of refugees over the Chinese border. 
 North Korea's economy depends heavily on Chinese trade and aid. The United States and its allies stopped providing oil to North Korea in 2002. But Chinese oil shipments have continued, and overall trade between China and North Korea increased 20 percent in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period a year ago.
 Beijing has sent several diplomatic missions to North Korea to urge a return to nuclear talks. President Hu called the talks the ''only correct path'' for North Korea. North Korea has issued contradictory statements about its willingness to resume talks. It has said it will not do so unless the United States drops its ''hostile policy,'' but it also reassured the Chinese that it is committed to continuing talks, officials have said.
 China has also expressed concern about the possibility that North Korea may conduct a nuclear test, but has not specified whether a test would prompt it to impose penalties. ''We object to any action that is contrary to the goal of the six-party talks,'' Mr. Liu said Tuesday. ''A nuclearized Korean Peninsula is not beneficial to any nation.''

HEADLINE: Wanted: Responsible Demagoguery

BYLINE: By MATT MILLER. 
E-mail: mattmiller@nytimes.com -- Maureen Dowd is on book leave until July 6. Matt Miller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and the author of ''The 2 Percent Solution,'' will be a guest columnist for the next four weeks.

 BODY:
You'd never guess from the Democratic hysteria that President Bush's plan to ''progressively index'' Social Security is an idea we liberals may one day want to embrace. So farsighted Democrats who want to (1) win back power and (2) use that power to fix big problems should quit carping about Bush's evil ''cuts'' and punish him instead with what I call Responsible Demagoguery: harsh politics that leaves sound policy intact.
 Why do I say this? Start with this poorly understood fact: Under today's system of ''wage indexed'' benefits, every new cohort of retirees is guaranteed a higher level of real benefits than the previous generation. Workers retiring in 2025, for example, are scheduled to receive payments 20 percent higher in real terms than today's retirees. Today's teenagers are slated to get a 60 percent increase. When Democrats cry about ''cuts,'' they mean trims from these higher levels. 
 A Democrat might ask: Why would we ever change this way of calculating benefits, other than from some Scroogelike desire to slow the rise in future benefits? Well, we probably wouldn't think about it if we weren't on the cusp of the biggest financial crunch in American history. But we are. And with the baby boomers' retirement looming, Democrats need to think beyond Social Security alone to think intelligently about achieving progressive goals. 
 Indeed, if you care about social justice and economic growth, the big policy question for the next generation is this: How do we square the needs of seniors with the needs of the rest of America, at levels of taxation that don't strangle the economy? 
 Those who say today's Social Security structure is sacred are arguing that our top priority -- before we even consider anything else -- must be to guarantee that every senior will enjoy real benefit increases in perpetuity. 
 But why is this fair or wise when there is no ''trust fund'' for the 45 million uninsured, or for the working poor or for poor children? Those who say ''hands off Social Security,'' but who (like me) want government to spend big money on these other needs, are implicitly saying that taxes as a share of G.D.P. will have to rise sharply. 
 Today, thanks to Bush's misguided tax cuts, federal taxes are around 16.5 percent of G.D.P., lower than at any time in 50 years. Even Newt Gingrich admits that taxes must rise as the boomers age. But to pay for a fuller progressive agenda while leaving Social Security and Medicare untouched (and without running crazy Bush-style deficits), federal taxes would need to rise past late-Clinton-era levels, 21 percent of G.D.P., toward something like 28 percent by 2030. 
 Maybe that makes sense. Or maybe it will mean a descent into tax-induced sloth. Or maybe talking about such levels of taxation in the U.S. is a political fantasy. The point is that Social Security is not something to fix in a vacuum. Once Democrats adopt this broader vision, they may find they're open to fair trims in future benefits as part of a blueprint that sustainably pursues progressive goals for all Americans, not just the elderly. 
 We know Democrats aren't making sense here because their chief argument is that ''progressive indexing'' (to prices, not wages) would cut retirement incomes too deeply by 2075. This may be true. But it's a little like worrying that Captain Kirk's phaser may malfunction in that year as well. 
 By 2075, for all we know, genetically engineered seniors may be living in retirement utopias on Jupiter. Or people may be fit and routinely working at age 90. A million things will have changed, just as Social Security's benefit design has changed in the past. If, instead, you look out 20 to 30 years, the benefit trims consistent with Bush's idea are modest (and for low earners, unchanged). If there's a problem, 76 million stampeding boomers will make sure politicians fix it.
 This isn't a case for joining hands with Mr. Bush; it's a case for keeping political opportunism and policy conviction separate in the Democratic mind. Responsibly Demagogic Democrats will blast Bush for wanting to borrow fresh trillions to create dubious new private accounts. But they won't dis ''progressive indexing'' on the merits, even though it's a juicy gazillion-dollar pseudo-''cut.'' 
 I know this is asking a lot. Republicans didn't demagogue responsibly when they caricatured Hillarycare as ''socialist'' back in the 1990's. But being a Democrat may mean being a little better even when you're bad.

HEADLINE: Thinking Inside the Big Box

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
NEXT week, Julia Christensen will begin a cross-country drive to places no other tourist would care to notice. In her 1999 Subaru Forester, Ms. Christensen, a 28-year-old artist, will trawl the American landscape in search of big-box superstores that are now used as churches, schools, racetracks and, in one case, a museum dedicated to Spam, the canned meat. 
 Ms. Christensen, who has made the field of big-box reuse her academic and artistic specialty, has already logged some 20,000 miles during two previous trips over the past two years in pursuit of former Wal-Marts, Winn-Dixies and Kmarts. Along the way, she has become an expert in the ingenious and innovative ways that communities have reclaimed abandoned, architecturally uninspiring megastores. 
 ''It's such a story every time of people being creative and resourceful about filling a huge hole in their town,'' said Ms. Christensen, who posts her findings at her Web site (bigboxreuse.com). ''They're breathing life into these buildings.'' 
 She also lectures and consults on the topic, which was the focus of her recently awarded Master of Fine Arts degree in electronic arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
 Between journeys, Ms. Christensen hunkers down in a three-room graduate-student apartment in a Victorian brick mansion in Troy, N.Y. A Hammond map of the United States dominates one wall of the living room. Her routes so far, snaking from Troy to points south and west and back, are highlighted in pink marker. Over the sofa hang photos of some of her favorite reused superstores: a Wal-Mart turned church in Pinellas Park, Fla., and a 40,000-square-foot former Kmart in Austin, Minn., which, with the addition of some brick gables, has become the Spam Museum. 
 Taped interviews with owners, neighbors, city officials and real estate executives are piled on her desk. Stored in her computers are thousands of photographs of big boxes and surrounding sprawl, some of which she plans to include in a book cataloging the transformations of stores. 
 Ms. Christensen is sought after by church leaders, city officials and developers, who solicit her advice on what to do with these bland structures, and how to cope with the devastating impact the shuttered buildings have on neighborhoods. 
 Still, Ms. Christensen doesn't have an obvious political agenda, or at least she doesn't let on about one. Her goal, she says, is to ''focus on what the people and the communities are making happen now, and not on what a corporation did, so I can connect with all kinds of people.'' 
 As a result, her Web site has become a place for big-box reusers to network. Her presentations, using video, audio tapes and photographs taken on the road, are a kind of performance art. Originally trained as an actress, she tells anecdotes about how a church was carved out of a Winn-Dixie, or how a Kmart became an elementary school. 
 Kimberly M. Huston, president of the Nelson County Economic Development Agency in Bardstown, Ky., said that Ms. Christensen -- who grew up in Bardstown and has lectured there -- encourages her listeners to imagine the potential of big boxes. ''She's been energizing people across the country,'' Ms. Huston said. 
 Bardstown has a Wal-Mart tale of its own, one that helped inspire Ms. Christensen's obsession. Over the past 14 years, two Wal-Marts in the town -- with a population of around 10,000 and some 300 buildings in the National Register of Historical Places -- have closed. One was razed by the county and replaced with a neo-classical justice center; the other is empty. A new 200,000-square-foot Wal-Mart opened last fall on the edge of town. 
 ''Over and over, the question in Bardstown has been, how did this happen? How are we on our third Wal-Mart, in a town riddled with preservationists?'' Ms. Christensen said. ''When the justice center went up, on a site that was sitting empty for eight years, that got me thinking. This is such an interesting reclamation of space.'' 
 When retailers like Wal-Mart outgrow buildings, they usually move to even bigger quarters nearby rather than face the disruption of adding on to their stores. Retail chains are reluctant to sell unused buildings to competitors, which is why about 350 Wal-Marts are currently empty. Mia Masten, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said she wasn't aware of Ms. Christensen's work. She said the company likes to see its buildings recycled because ''they're very versatile.''
 Ms. Christensen isn't the first person to chronicle superstore makeovers. Web sites like www.theboxtank.com and www.sprawl-busters.com, which focus on the darker side of sprawl, have mentioned inventive or bizarre reuse projects. Matthew Coolidge, a project manager for the Center for Land Use Interpretation, an organization in Culver City, Calif., which studies landscape change and sponsors artists, said Ms. Christensen is ''the only one who's looked at the phenomenon systematically, up close and on a national scale.''
 On her trips, Ms. Christensen sleeps in a pup tent or in cheap motels. She spends up to a week at each site, documenting it with digital cameras and interviewing the main players. 
 In her case studies, she has found some common traits, such as the surprising survival of original architectural features. Hormel Foods, the maker of Spam, gutted the Kmart for its Spam Museum and equipped the building with videos, interactive computer screens and dioramas that explain how the meat product is manufactured and marketed. Yet the exposed steel ceiling beams that once loomed over produce aisles are intact.
 Ms. Christensen has also noticed how salvagers keep the roadside and facade signs and the vast parking lots. 
 These projects succeed, many new owners say, simply because people feel comfortable with mall-style architecture. At Calvary Chapel, a nondenominational church in Pinellas Park, Fla., which started out in a Winn-Dixie and has now expanded to an adjacent Wal-Mart, the low-slung architecture is a draw for the 3,000 congregants. 
 ''The generation we live in today, when they look at an old-fashioned steepled church, there's a fascination but also a little bit of intimidation,'' said Bob Corry, an associate pastor. ''If we dolled up our building, we'd be pushing away an element of our community that desperately needs to be welcomed.'' 
 Worshippers like to gather in the building's 80-by-120-foot lobby, which has a grill and a cafe, Mr. Corry said. Next on the construction agenda for the church are a day-care center and, after windows are cut into the store's base, a catering hall. 
 Ms. Christensen says she will return to Calvary Chapel in a few weeks to record the latest stages of its rebirth as a place of worship. But first she will visit sites in Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Texas and Alabama. ''I could be this database that sits here and never moves, but it's been so important to me to go out and investigate,'' she said. ''There's nothing on the Web site I haven't seen with my own eyes.''

HEADLINE: Low Cost and Sweatshop-Free

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia 

 BODY:
At the close of a long, hot day sewing men's shirts, hundreds of young Cambodian women waited anxiously as their British boss jumped onto a cutting table with a bullhorn, worried that he would tell them they had lost their jobs. 
 But instead of delivering bad news, the manager, Adrian Ross, said he would be the host at a company picnic to celebrate the Cambodian New Year on April 15 at the advanced new factory his company had built down the road. ''It's been hard work this year,'' Mr. Ross said. ''Now it's time to have fun.''
 Thanks to an unorthodox labor program backed by the United States and intended to improve working conditions, much of Cambodia's garment industry has been holding its own since the end of the global quota system that parceled out shares of the apparel and textile business country by country. A majority of Cambodia's factories have retained the loyalty of major retailers around the world by appealing not just to their need for low-cost production but also to their desire to avoid the stigma of exploiting poor laborers in distant sweatshops. 
 For 30 years the global quotas -- which were abolished on Jan. 1 -- did not just slow the loss of clothing jobs in advanced industrial nations; they also helped some destitute countries by giving them guaranteed entry into the $400 billion global trade in apparel and textiles. 
 But now, many poor countries are searching for ways to keep their nascent apparel industries functioning in a world of unfettered competition -- one where China has been unleashed and is trying to grab as much of the business as it can.
 Cambodia, while still a very cheap place to produce apparel, has chosen to rely on outside inspectors and to foster unusually strong garment unions that have become an independent political force in a country otherwise awash in corruption and cronyism. The efforts at improvement here may point the way for other nations seeking to avoid a race to the bottom as they struggle to establish or sustain footholds in the global economy.
 Despite the loss of special access to the American market with the end of quotas, the Cambodian government, many garment-factory owners and the unions here are sticking to their higher standards. All agree that these factors have helped Cambodia escape much of the convulsion that is sweeping through the global apparel industry.
 Cham Prasith, the Cambodian minister of commerce who reached the deal with Washington in 1999, said the benefits had gone beyond anyone's expectations.
 ''We are extending our labor standards beyond the end of the quotas because we know that is why we continue to have buyers,'' he said in an interview. ''If we didn't respect the unions and the labor standards, we would be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.''
 And despite the still-unexplained killings last year of the charismatic leader of the garment workers' union and, later, one of his lieutenants, Cambodia's gamble on labor rights appears to be succeeding in keeping a $1.5 billion apparel industry afloat. Sixteen large plants are scheduled to begin production this year, more than replacing about a dozen factories that have failed.
 The surge in China's clothing exports has taken business from rich and poor nations alike. In the United States and Europe, the domestic lobbies for the textile and apparel industries are powerful enough that they have prodded their governments into considering temporary limits on Chinese products.
 But smaller developing countries like Cambodia are without such defenses in the face of the Chinese steamroller. So in addition to taking steps at home, Cambodia, Bangladesh and 11 other poor countries are asking Congress to enact a law that would remove all duty on their apparel exports to the United States and give them a slight edge in competing against China and greater hope of staying in business.
 Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi banker who invented microcredit loans, has personally appealed to lawmakers in Washington to approve the bill -- saying that for many young Asian women, the choice in today's world is either a job in a garment factory or a life on the streets as a prostitute.
 Neb Vicheka, a 31-year-old union shop steward at the Sportex factory here, knows the truth of Mr. Yunus's warning. She is one of the 250,000 garment factory workers in this country, most of them female, and she has seen young women laid off from factory jobs end up as hostesses in Phnom Penh's karaoke bars or beer gardens, a variant of prostitution. 
 A veteran of Cambodia's young labor movement, Ms. Neb represents a modern alternative. She has worked in the garment industry since the first factories opened in 1998 and now earns $90 a month in a country where $45 is considered a living wage.
 She and her sister own their own wooden house on stilts, complete with a small garden. She rides to work on her motorbike and indulges in little luxuries like diamond stud earrings.
 ''It is rare for two women to own their own home in Cambodia,'' she said, sitting on her front porch after a day at the factory. ''But I want more. I want to own my own business and move back to the countryside.''
 Only in the garment industry could Ms. Neb entertain such dreams. In every other sector of the country's economy, the poor are losing ground. Since an international peace agreement signed in Paris in 1991 formally ended Cambodia's two-decade plague of violence -- as a battle zone in the Indochina war, followed by the nightmare of the Khmer Rouge revolution and, with the Vietnamese invasion of 1979, another round of civil strife -- foreign nations and international organizations have spent more than $7 billion to help put Cambodia back on its feet.
 But all that money has failed to stop the deterioration of literacy rates and health care. Except for the garment industry, the epidemic of official corruption here has mitigated nearly all the efforts at improvement, according to new studies by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United States Agency for International Development.
 ''The labor program in the textile industry is more important to Cambodia than any other development program because we know the wages go directly to Cambodian workers and raise their standard of living,'' said Roland Eng, Cambodian ambassador at large in charge of development issues.
 Charles Ray, the American ambassador to Cambodia, said the unintended consequences of the labor activism in Cambodia's garment industry were political as well as economic. The union movement, which now includes teachers and workers in the tourism industries, is fast becoming the most democratic and independent group in the country.
 ''The labor unions for the textile workers are some of the best institutions this country has ever had,'' Mr. Ray said. ''The exploitation of workers cannot be a path to development -- on the contrary, workers have to be treated with respect for development to work.''
 But the price for creating these unions has been steep. Chea Vichea, the leader of the garment workers' union, was shot to death in January 2004. Four months later, one of his top assistants was killed. Chea Mony, the fallen leader's brother, now heads the union.
 Mr. Chea said that the workers were still frightened and that without the involvement of the United States, which helps underwrite the program, and the International Labor Organization, which monitors the factories, his union would have trouble remaining independent. 
 ''Our successes are unheard-of in countries like El Salvador or Guatemala,'' he said, ''but we could lose it all if the I.L.O. doesn't stay to protect us.''
 For all the self-congratulation in this country over the labor situation, there are critics who say that the typical $45-a-month wage is inadequate, given the value generated by Cambodia's garment exports.
 ''Those wages are so low,'' said Kate Frieson, a foreign expert working at the Ministry of Women's Affairs, ''that all these girls can afford after sending home half their paychecks to their family is to crowd into a single room without electricity with four other girls.'' One of every 13 Cambodians depends on these women's wages to survive.
 With the end of quotas, the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia said that one of its great fears was that the unions would demand higher wages just when the industry had to keep costs under control. The factory owners also complain that the unions are overstepping their bounds with wildcat strikes and need to be reined in.
 According to Van Sou Ieng, president of the association, higher labor standards have increased the quality of workmanship and won the attention of international retailers and clothing makers like the Gap, Levi Strauss and Abercrombie & Fitch. Marks & Spencer, the British retailer, buys all the shirts produced by one plant, the New Island factory, in an outlying district of Phnom Penh.
 Gap is by far the biggest buyer of Cambodian garments. Dan Henkle, a vice president of Gap Inc., attended an economic and trade meeting under World Bank auspices here earlier in February and assured Cambodians that his company would remain. Gap officials made it clear, though, that they would continue buying garments from Cambodia only as long as it continued to follow the special labor program.
 ''The presence of the I.L.O.,'' said Kris Marubio, a spokeswoman for Gap, ''was an important factor in our decision to remain in Cambodia.''
 But the biggest problem for the industry today may be all the palms demanding to be greased. With the apparel industry providing nearly 90 percent of the country's export earnings, the factory owners are starting to wield their considerable political influence to push the government into tackling the corruption that has been driving up costs.
 In the last six months, the government has eliminated bureaucratic rules that fed corruption, reducing production costs to $1.10 for each dozen T-shirts, from $2, according to industry officials.
 ''With the high labor standards here,'' Mr. Van, of the manufacturers' association, said, ''you can't be a slave driver so we're limited on cutting labor costs. So why should we have to pay for more corrupt bureaucracy and less reliability?''

HEADLINE: The Pirate Kingdom

BYLINE: By Pat Choate. 
Pat Choate, the author of ''Hot Property: The Stealing of Ideas in an Age of Globalization,'' was the Reform Party's vice-presidential candidate in 1996.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
CHINA is the global epicenter of pirating and counterfeiting. By its government's own estimate, China's domestic trade in bogus goods accounts for $19 billion to $24 billion annually. That is undoubtedly a significant understatement, and it doesn't even include the stolen technologies and phony brands China exports to the rest of the world. Since welcoming China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States has had a historic opportunity to stop the Chinese piracy trade. So far, the Bush administration has failed to seize it. 
 I opposed bringing China into the trade organization, and I don't like the idea of subordinating America's sovereignty to undemocratic international institutions like the W.T.O. But those decisions are behind us, and the worst thing we can do now is to fail to use the limited tools that the W.T.O. provides for protecting our economic interests. 
 On joining the W.T.O., Chinese leaders assumed certain obligations to the other 147 member states. Specifically, as a signatory to the Trade-Related Intellectual Property System, China pledged to accept minimal standards of patent, copyright and trademark protection; to treat foreigners' and its own citizens' intellectual properties equally; and to submit to the W.T.O.'s procedures for settling disputes. 
 Four years later, China has not met its intellectual property obligations, and the United States has failed to leverage the W.T.O. mechanisms that might bring China into compliance. Although China has passed intellectual property laws that accord with W.T.O. requirements, the Office of the United States Trade Representative reported to Congress in last December that enforcement of those laws was inconsistent, ineffective and discriminatory against foreigners. The same report found intellectual property infringement in China to be rampant, with violations worsening. 
 In effect, China has created a Potemkin village of intellectual property protections. Fortunately, the W.T.O. provides a way to confront that problem. If the United States can prove to a three-judge W.T.O. panel that China is out of compliance and is harming intellectual property owners, it can seek damages. If the W.T.O. grants such a judgment, the United States can impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Those monies could then be distributed among American complainants.
 The United States has used these mechanisms in the past. From 1995 to 2000, the Clinton administration filed 13 intellectual property cases at the W.T.O. against other nations. All of them were resolved to the United States' satisfaction. The United States Chamber of Commerce, hardly a protectionist group, has called for the Bush administration to initiate such a case against China at the W.T.O. But the administration remains strangely passive in the face of Chinese pirating and counterfeiting. In fact, this administration has not filed a single intellectual-property case, against any nation, at the W.T.O. since it took office. 
 The United States has paid a high price for those languishing W.T.O. protections. A decade ago, the United States agreed to eliminate all import quotas on textiles in exchange for the developing world's acceptance of intellectual property protections. The United States has kept its side of that deal, sacrificing almost one million domestic apparel and textile jobs to foreign producers since 1994. China, the greatest violator of the W.T.O.'s intellectual property requirements, is also the biggest beneficiary of that arrangement: Chinese producers now supply 25 percent of the clothing in the United States and are expected to provide 75 percent by 2010. 
 The United States should bring an intellectual property case against China at the W.T.O. Then, if China still won't honor its intellectual property obligations, President Bush and Congress will need to reconsider this country's trade relations with China.

HEADLINE: The Young and the Jobless

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There were high fives at the White House last week when the latest monthly employment report showed that 274,000 jobs had been created in April, substantially more than experts had predicted.
 The employment bar has been set so low for the Bush administration that even a modest gain is cause for celebration. But we shouldn't be blinded by the flash of last Saturday's headlines. American workers, especially younger workers, remain stuck in a gloomy employment landscape. 
 For example, a recent report from the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston tells us that the employment rate for the nation's teenagers in the first 11 months of 2004 -- just 36.3 percent -- was the lowest it has ever been since the federal government began tracking teenage employment in 1948.
 Those 20 to 24 years old are also faring poorly. In 2000, 72.2 percent were employed during a typical month. By last year that percentage had dropped to 67.9 percent. 
 Even the recent modest surge in jobs has essentially bypassed young American workers. Gains among recently arrived immigrants seem to have accounted for the entire net increase in jobs from 2000 through 2004.
 Over all, only workers 55 and up have done reasonably well over the past few years. ''Younger workers,'' said Andrew Sum, the center's director, ''have just been crushed.''
 Whatever the politicians and the business-booster types may be saying, the simple truth is that there are not nearly enough jobs available for the many millions of out-of-work or underworked men and women who need them. The wages of those who are employed are not even keeping up with inflation.
 Workers have been so cowed by an environment in which they are so obviously dispensable that they have been afraid to ask for the raises they deserve, or for their share of the money derived from the remarkable increases in worker productivity over the past few years. And from one coast to the other, workers have swallowed draconian cuts in benefits with scarcely a whimper.
 Some segments of the population have been all but completely frozen out. In Chicago, only one of every 10 black teenagers found employment in 2004. In Illinois, fewer than one in every three teenage high school dropouts are working.
 Last month's increase of 274,000 jobs was barely enough to keep up with the increase in the nation's working-age population.
 ''The economy is growing and real output is up,'' said Mr. Sum, who is also a professor at Northeastern. ''But the distribution of income, in terms of how much is going to workers -- well, the answer is very little has gone to the typical worker.''
 The squeeze on the younger generation of workers is so tight that in many cases the young men and women of today are faring less well than their parents' generation did at a similar age. Professor Sum has been comparing the standard of living of contemporary families with that of comparable families three decades ago.
 ''Two-thirds of this generation are not living up to their parents' standard of living,'' he said.
 College graduates today are doing better in real economic terms than college graduates in the 1970's. But everyone else is doing less well. ''If you look at families headed by someone without a college degree,'' said Professor Sum, ''their income last year in real terms was below that of a comparable family in 1973. For dropouts it's like 25 percent below where it was. And for high school grads, about 15 to 20 percent below.''
 It shouldn't be surprising that the standard of living of large segments of the population is sinking when employers have all the clout, including the powerful and unwavering support of the federal government. Workers can't even get a modest increase in the national minimum wage.
 Globalization was supposed to be great for everyone. Nafta was supposed to be a boon. Increased productivity was supposed to be the ultimate tool -- the sine qua non -- for raising the standard of living for all.
 Instead, wealth and power in the United States has become ever more dangerously concentrated, leaving an entire generation of essentially powerless workers largely at the mercy of employers.
 A remark by Louis Brandeis comes to mind: ''We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few. But we can't have both.''

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREANS CLAIM TO EXTRACT FUEL FOR BOMBS

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; Thom Shanker and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 11 

 BODY:
North Korea said Wednesday that it had harvested a nuclear reactor for weapons fuel, the country's latest effort to put pressure on the Bush administration and its allies. 
 But intelligence and Pentagon officials said that as of late Wednesday they had seen no evidence to confirm or disprove the assertion. Outside experts expressed skepticism that North Korea's action, even if confirmed, would significantly increase its weapons stockpile.
 In a statement, North Korea said it had removed 8,000 spent fuel rods from a reactor at its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon as one of several ''necessary measures'' to bolster its nuclear arsenal. 
 In the worst case, experts have said, by removing and reprocessing the fuel rods, North Korea could produce fuel-grade plutonium for one to three nuclear weapons. But their suspicions were aroused because by leaving the rods inside the reactor for another year, North Korea could have obtained a much better yield of weapons fuel. 
 ''There is a lot of symbolism and taunting here,'' one senior administration official said.
 North Korea expelled international inspectors in late 2002, and without them, it is impossible to independently verify its claims. Both outside analysts and administration officials note that North Korean leaders could be bluffing in an attempt to wrest concessions from the United States in long-stalled six-nation negotiations to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. 
 Or, they said, the North Koreans could have pulled the fuel from the reactor early because of technical problems, or because of fears that the United States would order a strike on the reactor, a step that President Bill Clinton considered in 1994, during a previous crisis. 
 The shutdown of the reactor about a month ago, and Wednesday's statement, appear to be part of a North Korean effort to convince the world that it is already a nuclear weapons state, capable of both producing weapons and supplying itself with weapons-grade plutonium. On Thursday, Vice Minister of Unification Rhee Bong-Jo of South Korea said the reactor was closed March 31. 
 North Korea declared for the first time on Feb. 10 that it possessed nuclear weapons. The five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, the country's tightly guarded nuclear complex, was probably shut in early April, intelligence analysts said, based on satellite photos. By late last month a debate broke out in the American intelligence agencies over whether the shutdown was prompted by a need to perform maintenance, or a move to pull the rods out. Last week, two officials, one American and one foreign, reported that a platform and large crates were seen near the reactor. 
 ''They gave me the impression that the unloading had started,'' Selig S. Harrison, a North Korea specialist and the director of the Asia program at the Center for International Policy in Washington, said by telephone Wednesday of meetings he had with North Korean officials in Pyongyang, the capital, from April 5 to 9. 
 Rods can be safely removed from a reactor shortly after a shutdown, nuclear experts said. But then they need to be cooled. After that they need to go through a complex process called ''reprocessing'' to extract weapons-grade plutonium.
 Over the next 18 months, North Korea could produce fuel for one to three bombs from the rods, according to Daniel A. Pinkston, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program of the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
 Removing rods and storing them in water tanks in a building adjacent to the reactor takes about six weeks, Dr. Pinkston said by telephone from California. But it would take at least six months for the rods to cool sufficiently for safe reprocessing. Reprocessing 110 tons of rods from the reactor core would take another year, he estimated. 
 In an interview in Washington on Wednesday, Robert Alvarez, a former senior policy adviser to the Department of Energy who visited the reactor in North Korea 11 years ago, cautioned against racing to the conclusion that North Korea was capable of making the fuel into weapons. 
 ''You have to think about the variables, not just the worst-case scenarios,'' he said. He called the site ''very primitive'' and said a problem with the rods might have forced North Korea to withdraw them from the reactor. ''We saw some problems when we were there,'' he said, ''and we don't know if they have been fixed.'' The rods would be likely to yield some bomb-grade material. The question is how much.
 Recently, American officials have debated whether satellite photos indicate that North Korea is preparing for a first nuclear test. The removal and repacking of earth in an underground tunnel in Kilju, a remote area with no known mining, may indicate that North Korea is preparing a test, officials have said. But they also warn it could be a bluff.
 On Wednesday in Tokyo, J. Thomas Schieffer, the United States ambassador to Japan, entered into that debate. He told officials of New Komeito, a pacifist party, that North Korea appeared to be moving toward a test, but he stopped short of saying they would conduct one. 
 ''I believe they have taken some preparatory steps,'' the ambassador said, according to a United States Embassy official. Referring to the American-led regional effort to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear bombs, he added, ''If there is a test, it would a be serious blow to the process.'' But the State Department was more cautious, with the spokesman in Washington, Richard A. Boucher, when asked whether Mr. Schieffer was indicating a test could be forthcoming, saying, ''I wouldn't quite read as much into his statements as you do.'' 
 Japan is downwind of North Korea and could be affected by an open-air test. North Korea's arsenal of medium range missiles are believed to be intended as a potential threat to Japanese cities or American bases in Japan. On Wednesday night, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan played down North Korea's statement. ''It has been making gamesmanship sort of remarks,'' he said of North Korea, according to Kyodo News Agency. ''The point is we will have to get through to North Korea that returning quickly to the six-party talks and scrapping the nuclear program will best serve its interests.''
 Calls for a negotiated solution came Wednesday from officials in Washington, Beijing and Seoul, South Korea. ''The provocative statements and actions by North Korea only further isolate it from the international community,'' Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, told reporters. ''China obviously has considerable influence that they can use to help get North Korea back to the talks and get North Korea to end its nuclear ambitions.'' On Tuesday, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry ruled out applying economic or political sanctions to pressure North Korea. 
 South Korea also expressed concern. ''Such a move by North Korea runs counter to moves to make the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons,'' South Korea's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lee Kyu Hyun, said in a statement on the ministry Web site. 
 ''North Korea seems to have extracted the fuel rods as a means of gaining advantage in future talks,'' Mr. Rhee, the vice minister of unification, told reporters in Seoul on Thursday, Bloomberg reported. ''Still, its actions may negatively affect efforts to restart the six-party talks.''

HEADLINE: Leaving Out What Will Be Skipped

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 9 

 BODY:
Elmore Leonard is about talked out. The stories about the craft of America's premier crime novelist have become cliches waiting their turn. 
 So why not get the hooptedoodle, as Mr. Leonard calls ''the part that readers tend to skip,'' out of the way? He writes seven days a week in the living room of a nice house in the suburbs here with a No.5 Pilot Pen on unlined yellow paper. He does not use e-mail or a computer. He types the handwritten pages on an I.B.M. Selectric, which occasionally breaks down from daily exertion.
 ''There's one name in the phonebook who repairs typewriters,'' Mr. Leonard said, adding, ''he says he can live on $6,000 a year. He lives in a trailer park.'' 
 That is all he says about the typewriter guy, but with those spare details, the typewriter guy comes alive in the room, full-blown.
 That economy and precision have enabled a career that has lasted more than 50 years. One day ran into the next, one book became another, and now Mr. Leonard is a nearly 80-year-old man who has just written his 40th book. 
 Even though writing comes reflexively to him, there is nothing automatic or tossed off in his books, which use the dyad of character and dialogue to compose mini-epics on human folly, stripped of artifice and adjectives. ''The Hot Kid,'' a robbers-and-lawmen tale set during Prohibition, will be released this week and is getting plenty of love from the critics. Charles McGrath of The New York Times called Mr. Leonard's books ''ruthlessly efficient entertainment machines.'' Writing in The Boston Globe, Stephen King said, ''the old guy's still got plenty of bite.''
 But not in person. To say that Mr. Leonard lacks pretension does not quite get it. He is scary normal, friendly in an absent way. This great American author, one of the best dialogue writers ever, lets people at charity auctions bid for the right to name his characters; Ed Hagenlocker, a ''hard-shell Baptist'' and cotton farmer in ''The Hot Kid,'' got his name that way. ''Why not help them out?'' he said.
 A former writer of ads and industrial films, ''Dutch,'' as his pals call him, published his first novel, ''The Bounty Hunters,'' a half-century ago. Switching from westerns to crime, he became a not-so-overnight sensation with the publication of ''Glitz'' in 1985. Mr. Leonard has written many best sellers, including ''Mr. Paradise,'' ''Be Cool,'' ''Get Shorty'' and ''Rum Punch.''
 If those titles sound familiar to even nonreaders, it is because many of them have been made into movies -- Hollywood producers pull up to the curb almost every time he writes, and ''The Hot Kid,'' with its gun molls, strutting lawmen and so-dumb-they-are-smart hoods will be no exception. Mr. Leonard has won the Grand Master Award of the Mystery Writers of America, but he is no big fan of Hammett and Chandler, preferring the lean-and-mean gait of Hemingway and Steinbeck. Mr. Leonard does not think what he does is very complicated. 
 ''The first part moves along O.K., and then I have to think about the second part, because the second part keeps it going,'' he said. ''And then you've got to get to some new things, say around page 250. There is always those surprises near the end.''
 He wears jeans, sandals and a Detroit Pistons shirt. When he writes, he looks out on a tarp-covered pool and a tennis court beyond. The place smells of pot roast, being looked after by Christine, his wife of a dozen years. He lives in Bloomfield Village, 20 miles north of the city that has supplied endless grit and grist for his stories. His neighborhood has more in common with a John Cheever novel than one of Mr. Leonard's wiseguy librettos.
 His longtime researcher, Gregg Sutter, did the grimy version of the Dutch Leonard tour earlier that day. There was a drive past 1300 Beaubien, a cop shop where the fifth floor is occupied by the homicide division, the holiest of holies and a pivot point for a lot of Mr. Leonard's books. There is the Greek joint down the street with the ouzo and the flaming cheese, where cops went to get hammered after their shifts. Mr. Sutter stopped in front of a dilapidated apartment building in the shadow of the now empty Tiger Stadium. It was the site of a triple homicide, Chaldean money guys ripped off by and then killed by drug dealers. Mr. Sutter, who lives in Los Angeles, but happened to be in town, saw it on the news and went right over. He called Mr. Leonard from the scene.
 ''We got a triple,'' he told Mr. Leonard. The murders, which involved a chainsaw, body parts and a fire to cover up the crime, appeared in ''Mr. Paradise,'' published last year. But Mr. Leonard has seen and heard plenty in his time, so he can sit in a living-room office and create all sorts of mayhem.
 The room includes none of the trophies that men of accomplishment acquire and no grip-and-grin portraits of him with the famous and infamous people he has known. There is just a picture of his agent, H.N. Swanson, who called him up after his first book and said, ''Kiddo, I'm going to make you rich.'' Eighty-four rejections followed, but the now-departed Mr. Swanson ended up being right.
 Mr. Leonard seemed genuinely surprised that ''The Hot Kid'' had the press in a tizzy. ''I kind of thought of it as one of my quieter books,'' he said. Part of the reason that ''The Hot Kid'' works is that it manages to bookend his career in one crisp little novel. The men, both bad guys and good, who ramble through Tulsa and Kansas City in the 1920's and 30's are part gangster and part gunslinger. As such, they are hybrids, embodying his early career as a western writer and his later critically acclaimed run as a crime novelist. He is happy for the good reviews but the approbation is a little beside the point.
 ''I write them to find out what happens,'' he said of his novels. ''I don't write for anybody else.''
 Characters serve as can-openers on plots for Mr. Leonard. Once conceived, they become his masters, shoving him from one scene to the next, until the book ends, usually at about 300 pages. 
 Critics aside, ''The Hot Kid'' came up short. Two hundred and eighty pages. 
 ''I thought it should be longer than 280,'' he said, sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk. ''So I said reset it with one or two lines less per page and make it work. And it came out to 312.''
 Mr. Leonard was less able to count when it came to his drinks, so he has been sober since 1977. At the end of the day, he enjoys a nonalcoholic beer and a single cigarette. He used to chain-smoke, but for the first time in his life, he seems to be aging with a bit of high blood pressure and arterial fibrillation.
 ''I'm turning into an old man all of a sudden,'' he said. ''And I've got hearing aids, but they don't do much good. I have trouble hearing my wife.''
 His wife, picking at the daffodils in the front of the house, said, ''Elmore always says you have to do what you love; otherwise, what's the point?''
 But Mr. Leonard hates that he now takes pills. ''I don't want to live forever,'' he said, having his daily smoke out by the pool. ''What am I gonna do, write another book?''
 He knows the answer is yes.

HEADLINE: Hell From High Water

BYLINE: By Frank McKenna. 
Frank McKenna is the Canadian ambassador to the United States.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
A CRISIS looms on the United States border with Canada, and it could easily be averted with some research and a little patience.
 The problem stems from a body of water in North Dakota known as Devils Lake. The lake has no natural drainage, and because North Dakota has drained surrounding wetlands, it has risen 26 feet since 1993, flooding nearby communities. In Canada, we are sympathetic to the plight of the lake's neighbors, but not to the solution their state has proposed. 
 In June, North Dakota plans to open an outlet that will let Devils Lake water travel into the Sheyenne River and on into the Red River, which flows north into Canada. From there the water will eventually stream into Lake Winnipeg and the Hudson Bay watershed. 
 Devils Lake, a remnant of a shallow glacial sea, is a closed ecological system that has been geographically separate from the surrounding Hudson Bay basin for more than a thousand years. Its salty waters have high concentrations of nitrogen, sulfates and phosphates -- minerals that could cause severe digestive distress if consumed and could be lethal to aquatic life. Because of these contaminants, North Dakota does not allow Devils Lake waters to be used for irrigation. 
 Once the canal is opened, the pollutants will enter the water supply of downstream communities in North Dakota, Minnesota and Manitoba. Moreover, species of fish, plants, parasites and viruses previously confined in Devils Lake, in some cases for millenniums, will spill out into the Sheyenne and Red Rivers. There they could kill the native plants and fish of the larger ecosystem. The consequences for Lake Winnipeg, the largest freshwater fishery in North America, are particularly worrisome. 
 Despite concerns on both sides of the border about maintaining safe water sources, North Dakota has decided to pump out Devils Lake water without undertaking any environmental assessment or establishing ecological safeguards.
 There is a solution to this impending crisis. Nearly 100 years ago, Canada and the United States established the Boundary Waters Treaty. Under that treaty the two governments set up an International Joint Commission to address differences of opinion involving boundary waters. So far, of the 53 issues the two countries have jointly referred to the commission, 51 have been resolved by mutual agreement.
 For over a year, Canada has been requesting that North Dakota put off pumping water while the United States and Canada refer the issue to the commission for a time-limited, independent, scientific review. Both the Canadian and Manitoban governments have stated that they will support the commission's finding, whatever it may be. The governors of Minnesota and Missouri, as well as many other officials, have expressed support for the Canadian request in letters to the United States secretary of state. 
 At their March meeting in Waco, Tex., President Bush, Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada and President Vicente Fox of Mexico pledged to enhance water quality ''by working bilaterally, trilaterally and through existing regional bodies.'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice should demonstrate the strength of that commitment by joining Canada in referring the Devils Lake project to the joint commission.
 If instead the Devils Lake project goes forward without a review, it will damage not only the region's environment and economy, but also North America's most important bilateral water management arrangement. There is a better solution.

HEADLINE: Boston's Catholic Archdiocese May Cut Priests' Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Andrew Bushell contributed reporting from Boston for this article.

 BODY:
Seeking to save money, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is proposing cuts in its pension benefits for priests. 
 The archdiocese says that its pension fund has had poor returns in recent years and has suffered from many of the same problems as corporate America's pension funds. Previously, however, officials have cited general financial strains stemming from the sexual abuse scandal and a resulting decline in contributions from churchgoers. 
 The archdiocese has begun holding meetings to inform priests of the proposed cuts. They include freezing monthly pension benefits at the current level, $1,889, rather than raising them with inflation, and asking some priests in some case to pick up more of their housing costs. 
 Medical benefits would also be reduced and linked to financial need for the first time. Able-bodied retired priests would be steered away from assisted-living quarters, which are expensive, and encouraged to stay in their parish rectories after retiring. Those who collect Social Security or have other assets, say, from a family inheritance, would have to dip into those funds to pay for assisted living and nursing home care that the archdiocese now provides.
 An overview of the pension changes prepared by the archdiocese's consultant, Towers Perrin, was provided to The New York Times by a priest who would be affected by the changes.
 Companies that offer pensions are barred by federal law from reducing benefits that employees have earned. But churches and other religious employers, like hospitals or schools, do not have to comply with the law and are generally free to handle their pension funds as they choose. 
 In Boston, the priests' pension fund is strained in part because the archdiocese made no contributions to it from 1986 to 2002, according to the Towers Perrin documents. Twice a year, at Christmas and Easter, the archdiocese has held fund-raising drives in the parishes for priests' retirements, raising about $4.5 million a year. But for many years the archdiocese has used that money to fill other needs. 
 Archdiocesan officials said they believed at the time that this was a prudent approach to the pension fund, because their actuarial projections showed that the Christmas and Easter proceeds were not needed. The officials say they now understand that their projections underestimated crucial factors like priests' longevity and the inflation of health care costs. They are now using more conservative assumptions, which show that the pension fund is weak and cannot afford the current level of benefits. 
 The Rev. Bob Connors, whom the archdiocese has sent to meet with the priests in small groups and explain the changes, acknowledged that not everyone was amenable. ''It would be silly to say that everyone is happy,'' Father Connors said. ''Some are upset. Some are angry.'' 
 The archdiocese emphasized that it wanted to be responsive to the concerns of the priests and that the pension cuts could change. 
 In November 2004, Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley issued an open letter to all members of the archdiocese, warning them that ''the financial situation of the archdiocese is much worse than most people realize.'' He added, ''The pension plans for laity and clergy are in danger.'' The archbishop said at the time that the overall financial problems were not the direct result of settlement payments to victims of sexual abuse but resulted from a sharp falloff in contributions by churchgoers in the wake of the scandal. 
 Currently, most priests' needs in retirement are being cared for through a combination of pension benefits and Social Security. The archdiocese says a typical priest can expect to receive a Social Security benefit of $950 a month, assuming he works until 72. Although that is older than the normal retirement age for Americans, the archdiocese says it reflects its priests' tendency to stay active late in life. And by waiting until 72 to collect Social Security, any participant in the system can receive a higher monthly benefit.
 Retired priests are free to devise their living arrangements, but every retired priest who lives on his own costs the archdiocese about $6,000 a year more than those who stay in their parish rectories, according to the Towers Perrin documents. 
 Towers Perrin has projected that the value of all the future retirement benefits the archdiocese owes its priests, in today's dollars, is $204.7 million. If the benefit cuts take effect, the total cost would fall to as little as $152 million.
 Even that is not enough to restore the priests' pension fund to solvency. It has assets of $134.4 million. The archdiocese says that in addition to the benefit cuts, new sources of money will be necessary. 
 It is unclear when the cuts, if approved by a committee of clergy, would be made.
 This is not the first time that the priests' pension fund has played an important role in the finances of the archdiocese. On several occasions in the last few years, the archdiocese has sold church-owned real estate to the priests' pension fund to raise cash.
 Companies are not normally allowed to sell their own real estate holdings to their pension funds, because pension money is supposed to be in trust for the exclusive benefit of the work force. Those requirements do not apply to church pension plans, however. 
 Archdiocesan officials say that the transactions were appropriate because the pension fund was able to sell some of the real estate and make a profit. 
 In another case, the priests' pension fund made a $15 million loan to the archdiocese as part of a larger financial package that produced the cash for an $85 million payment to settle sexual abuse claims in 2003.
 An archdiocesan official said that six months later, the archdiocese was able to repay the loan with interest, as well as a $1.5 million fee.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel And Pentagon Are at Impasse Over Nominee

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
The Senate's approval of Navy Secretary Gordon R. England to become the Pentagon's No. 2 official is caught up in a dispute between the Defense Department and the Senate Armed Services Committee about financial conflict-of-interest requirements. 
 The impasse, which has been simmering for months, is approaching a critical point because Paul D. Wolfowitz, the current deputy defense secretary, is planning to leave at the end of this week in preparation for becoming president of the World Bank on June 1. The Pentagon does not want to leave his position vacant or fill it with an acting deputy while the military has nearly 160,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and several major policy issues requiring high-level decisions. 
 At issue is the committee's longstanding requirement that senior officials like Mr. England with pensions from former private employers -- General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin in his case -- buy a special insurance policy to protect the future value of their benefits. 
 Owning such a surety bond avoids putting Mr. England in the position of making decisions that could influence the financial well-being of the companies, both major military contractors, and possibly his own $280,000 annual pension benefits, Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is the panel chairman, said in a telephone interview. 
 But Pentagon officials say that federal law already protects most pensions, and that the committee is the only panel in the Senate to impose such an onerous requirement on the department officials it oversees. 
 ''This is not about an individual nominee or position,'' said Larry Di Rita, the Pentagon spokesman. ''It's about asking people to pay a nontrivial amount of money to serve in the government.'' 
 Until last month, eight senior Pentagon officials, including Mr. England and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, had personally paid for such policies with premiums ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars for a four-year term. But the insurer dropped the coverage last month, fearing that the policies might not meet industry standards. Pentagon officials have so far been unable to find another company willing to fill the breach, except possibly one that would charge about 10 times the previous rates. 
 While top Pentagon aides say Mr. England is willing to pay an increased fee approaching $50,000 for a multiyear policy, Mr. Di Rita said the department was concerned that the costly surety bonds could pose serious problems for the Pentagon in recruiting experienced senior personnel from the private sector. 
 To avoid conflicts of interest, Pentagon officials must divest securities in any of the 34,000 companies that do more than $25,000 a year in business with the Defense Department. But pensions from companies cannot be divested, so rather than force employees to forgo that benefit, the Senate panel in the 1980's created the insurance policy requirement. 
 Mr. Warner, who said the panel had been prepared for three weeks to vote on Mr. England's nomination, spoke to Mr. Rumsfeld on Wednesday to try to resolve the stalemate.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrows to a 6-Month Low

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in March to its lowest point in six months, as consumers cut back on purchases of imports and businesses and farmers increased their sales in foreign markets.
 The monthly trade deficit dropped by 9 percent, to $55 billion, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, a surprise after most analysts predicted $61 billion.
 ''This is good news,'' said Robert E. Scott, economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ''What we're beginning to see over the last three months is a leveling out of the trade deficit. But the numbers have been jumping all over the place so you can't expect it to last.'' 
 Despite this improved figure, the trade deficit was growing at a faster rate than last year, which set an annual record of $617.08 billion.
 The deficit dropped from the $60.6 billion in February despite a $600 million increase in petroleum imports.
 Rising oil prices and the weakening dollar are expected to play competing roles in the volatile trade figures this year.
 Few analysts, however, were willing to credit the weakened dollar for the improved trade picture.
 ''If we were reaping the benefit from a weak dollar, we would be seeing a much stronger growth in our export market,'' said Robert DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup.
 Instead, while exports rose by $1.5 billion, including sales of airplanes, food and a range of capital goods, the biggest reason for the drop in the monthly trade deficit was the $4 billion decline in imports.
 The huge drop in the purchase of imported consumer goods, from automobiles to clothing, confounded many analysts who suggested this may be a result of full inventories and, possibly, a stagnation of wages.
 Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, said that the rise in exports suggested that the long-awaited increase in the foreign appetite for American goods might be picking up.
 ''That's been the biggest problem U.S. manufacturers face: sluggish growth in U.S. export markets,'' Mr. Griswold said.
 The administration says the slow growth in the European Union and Japan is the biggest problem it faces in reversing the trade imbalance.
 Part of the surprise Wednesday was the drop in the deficit with China.
 Analysts had expected the flood of imported clothing and textiles from China to remain strong in March, but the imports dropped by 21 percent from February. Even with that decline, Chinese textile imports for the first three months of this year are up 54 percent compared with the period last year.
 The United States textile industry has persuaded the administration to investigate imposing temporary quotas on the import of Chinese textiles, saying the surge of imports since the lifting of global quotas unduly threatens manufacturing plants and jobs in the United States.
 The timing of the Chinese New Year was cited by other analysts as the reason for the unexpected blip in the trade figures.
 Goldman Sachs analysts said that the United States imported less from China because of the late date of the holiday this year. 
 This was probably ''responsible for a significant drop in U.S. import volume,'' because many businesses in China were shut for an entire week during the month.
 The trade picture with Canada improved almost as much. The United States reduced its deficit with Canada in March by $700 million by increasing exports and reducing consumer purchases, especially imported pharmaceuticals.
 The narrowed trade deficit will increase first-quarter economic growth, according to Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, who cautioned against too much optimism.
 ''It is not clear yet whether the cutback in imports was a result of rising import prices or slower United States growth,'' Mr. Naroff said.
 The new trade data lifted the value of the dollar against major currencies.
 Critics of the administration's trade policies have blamed China for much of the record trade deficit and have called on the administration to be more aggressive in enforcing trade laws.
 The Chamber of Commerce estimates that the United States loses $200 billion a year from pirating and counterfeiting caused by China's weak protection of intellectual property rights.
 Lawmakers in Congress, convinced that China's current system of pegging its currency to the dollar hurts American competitiveness, have introduced legislation to levy tariffs as high as 27 percent against Chinese goods to pressure the China to revalue its currency.
 While refusing to comment on the trade figures on Wednesday, officials at the Treasury Department denied suggestions that China would soon change how it values its currency.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, speaking to reporters, refused to give a date that China might revalue its currency, but said China should do it soon, according to The Associated Press.
 ''The Chinese have made enormous strides in preparing the way for a move to flexibility,'' Mr. Snow said. ''We think they are ready. We think the time to act has come.''

HEADLINE: New York: 'Little' Films Grow Big

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
When the Cannes Film Festival opened yesterday, the first of what could be a long stream of distribution deals was announced: ''Transamerica,'' a comedic road movie starring Felicity Huffman of ''Desperate Housewives,'' will be coming to a screen near you soon. The film is a New York project from beginning to end, written, directed and partly shot in a city that has carved out its own place in the film industry -- a place that only occasionally intersects with what Hollywood likes to call ''the movie business.''
 Culturally vibrant, if economically still fragile, New York has quietly been emerging as the world's primary clearinghouse for a fast-expanding pool of very-low-budget movies. A ragtag posse of former college film series promoters, ex-gofers at major studios and chronically underfinanced filmmakers -- their way paved by the low costs and relative ease of digital technology -- has coalesced here into a commercial brokerage and cinematic salon devoted largely to the ''little'' film. 
 Long a force in the independent film world, the industry in New York suffered a bit of a slump in the 90's as Hollywood studios trimmed Manhattan staff and all but stopped holding big premiere parties in the city. And while the two men who embodied New York filmmaking over the last decade, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the co-founders of Miramax Films, are parting ways with the company they built after a drawn-out battle with the Walt Disney Company, even they are playing a role in the city's new film game. Even as they round up financing for a new company to be based in Manhattan, they are buying the North American distribution rights for ''Transamerica,'' directed by Duncan Tucker and produced by Linda Moran, Rene Bastian and Sebastian Dungan, New Yorkers all, on a budget of about $1 million. ''New York used to be seen as this kind of colonial outpost of L.A.,'' said Mark Urman, head of theatrical distribution for New York-based ThinkFilm, which earlier this year won attention for its ''Murderball,'' an unlikely documentary about quadriplegic rugby players, by screening it at the New Directors/New Films Festival sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art. He expects the picture to compete against Hollywood fare like ''Bewitched'' and ''Fantastic Four'' this summer. 
 Now, Mr. Urman said, filmmakers, many of them based in New York, are increasingly inclined to gamble by shooting their pictures without waiting for a green light from a Hollywood studio, hoping companies like his will find viewers for them. 
 While Hollywood concentrates on selling blockbusters around the globe -- and has crashed the party with well-financed art house divisions like Universal's Focus Features and Sony Pictures Classics, both based here, New York companies like ThinkFilm and Killer Films have emerged as central players in a more guerrillalike industry, reaching far beyond traditional independent production and finance. The latest generation of New York players are creating a system of their own to get movies seen. They win recognition for hundreds of pictures a year via film festival screens and a Rube Goldberg patchwork of local sites, both commercial and nonprofit, garnering just enough exposure to push the movies into the marketplace, including the increasingly lucrative DVD market. 
 ''Transamerica'' opened last month at the TriBeCa Film Festival, which cast its own light on the robustness and growing power of the New York film industry. In its fourth year, the festival sold 135,000 tickets to 700 screenings even as the popcorn index soared: Regal Cinemas, in TriBeCa, peddled more than 5,000 bags a week during the festival, versus its usual 800.
 For the first time in its short history, several pictures that opened at TriBeCa, including a Showtime documentary, ''After Innocence,'' and the Dutch drama ''Simon,'' were picked up for national distribution. Conceived as a civic gesture for a neighborhood down on its luck after the events of Sept. 11, Robert De Niro's brainchild had taken its place in a booming local commercial film culture. 
 ''When we announced what we were going to do, who knew how successful or powerful it was going to be?'' Mr. De Niro said.
 Hollywood studios -- which accounted for about $7.4 billion in worldwide film revenue -- released about 138 pictures last year, according to Exhibitor Relations Company, which tracks box office revenues. In all, more than 500 films are released in domestic theaters in a typical year, many of them by about a dozen Manhattan companies like Think and Killer. 
 Several more players are poised to join the fray, including the Weinsteins' still-unnamed new company and two Time Warner units, New Line and HBO, which have combined to form another independent film distributor in New York. At the end of last month, 2929 Entertainment, a digital entertainment company based here, signed a six-picture deal with Steven Soderbergh, the director of ''Traffic'' and ''Erin Brockovich,'' for six high-definition films that will be simultaneously released in theaters, on DVD and on television.
 ''Ten years ago, the driving force behind the movies we show was Miramax,'' said Graham Leggat, who helps program screenings at Lincoln Center. ''Now there are a number of other distributors.'' The growing echelon of New York distributors appears to be matched by an expansion in the ranks of film being shot here. Last year, 202 movies were filmed at least in part in New York city. And the enactment of a combined city-state tax break of 15 percent has already yielded almost $300 million in new business, according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. 
 The New York distribution companies are also fed by a torrent of new films from around the world. This year, more than 2,600 feature-length pictures were submitted to the Sundance Film Festival, in Park City, Utah, up 29 percent from a year earlier, providing a rough measure of the growth in the pool of films made outside of the studio system.
 As those pictures scramble to be seen, New York -- with its confluence of ethnic communities, film schools, enthusiasts and media outlets -- has forged a cultural ecosystem, processing the pictures and pushing many of them toward commercial release. The New York Times, by some accounts, plays a part in the process: Under longstanding practice, every full-length feature that plays on a New York screen for at least a week is reviewed in the paper.
 If the film business, especially as it is practiced in New York, remains a notoriously chancy affair -- Dan Talbot, longtime head of New Yorker Films, describes it as ''a casino'' -- that has not doused an optimism that was palpable only weeks ago in TriBeCa. 
 During the festival, fans lined up around the block at Stuyvesant High School to see ''The Great New Wonderful,'' a film about the aftermath of 9/11, starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and directed by a Brooklyn native, Danny Leiner. The young crowd buzzed with the sort of anticipation that usually accompanies the opening of a new downtown club. 
 ''Ninety percent of the industry is in L.A.,'' said Mr. Leiner, who now lives there. ''But the 10 percent who are here are among the most creative people making movies.'' 
 A peculiar hallmark of New York's cinematic counterculture is the role that the city's intense, sophisticated audience has played in pushing once-fragile films like ''Open Water'' and ''Garden State'' into prominence. Often, small movies that break out have taken root on a single screen at the Angelika Film Center, Film Forum or Lincoln Center, where an enthusiastic reception has opened the door to a wider audience in other cities and on DVD. That audience seems to renew itself each generation, with fans of newer styles and genres (like Asian horror or Dogme, the Danish-based film movement) joining the aging cineastes who devour sophisticated European fare. And the tribe has grown through the Web, which is alive with blogs and enthusiast sites like indiewire.com that create viral marketing and lead fans elsewhere to order up DVD's of lesser-known films.
 ''If you want to integrate a film into the culture, this is the place you have to start,'' said Michael Barker, who with his partner Tom Bernard established Sony Pictures Classics, a unit of the giant Japanese entertainment company, as one of the most active studio specialty divisions.
 If the current blossoming of New York filmmaking, some of it shot with digital equipment that does not require the time or expense of film, has put an unusually democratic face on the local film culture, some players caution that to make a movie worth seeing still requires sweat and magic. ''The fact is, most of these movies deal in narrative, which should be something that works well in digital form,'' said James Schamus, co-president of Focus Features. ''The fact remains that you can compose a poem with a pencil and a piece of paper, but not everyone can do it.''
 And for many in this reinvented industry, the big dollars that represent a measure of success remain elusive. ''Nobody is making any real money,'' said the New York director Eugene Jarecki, whose documentary, ''Why We Fight,'' won the American Documentary Grand Jury prize at Sundance this year and will be distributed by Sony Pictures Classics. Besides, he said, ''it is less than six degrees of separation between all of us, so we tend to depend on each other as opposed to seeing each other as competitors.''

HEADLINE: Even in Facing the Needle, a Killer Is Master of His Fate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 11 

 BODY:
The videotape was taken earlier this year, during a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether Michael Bruce Ross, a convicted serial killer, is competent to forgo further appeals of his death sentence.
 Tilting back in a chair in a prison cell, Mr. Ross is shown laughing and then offering several enthusiastic thumbs ups to the camera.
 Played over and over on television here in recent weeks, the image of a killer seemingly smiling at death may be the last memory many people in Connecticut have of Mr. Ross. At 2:01 a.m. Friday, he is scheduled to die by lethal injection. He would be the first person executed in New England in 45 years. 
 For some, the video underscores claims that Mr. Ross is mentally disturbed and thrives on the attention surrounding his latest execution date, the second in four months. But his apparent self-assurance during the evaluation and in recent court appearances seems to confirm what judges have concluded: he controls his fate.
 ''He will always hold in his hand the opportunity to change his mind,'' said Christopher L. Morano, the chief state's attorney, whose office prosecuted Mr. Ross. 
 Until the moment the executioner administers the lethal injection into Mr. Ross's arm, he can stop the process by simply saying he wants to appeal.
 ''Under the law, we have no option but to honor that if he does so,'' Mr. Morano said. ''But that doesn't mean we will not do all we can to bring finality for the loved ones of his victims.''
 Mr. Ross, 45, grew up on an egg farm in eastern Connecticut and graduated from Cornell University in 1981 with an economics degree. He was first arrested on murder charges in 1984 and eventually confessed to strangling eight girls and young women and raping most of them. He was sentenced to death for four of the murders.
 His death sentence was upheld last May by the State Supreme Court. Mr. Ross has spent much of the time since then pursuing execution, rather than the array of state and federal appeals he still has available. 
 Many people close to the case expect the execution to go forward on Friday. But execution has seemed imminent before.
 In January, Mr. Ross came within hours of execution before his lawyer, T.R. Paulding, unexpectedly requested a delay. Mr. Paulding, who had helped Mr. Ross seek execution, cited a potential conflict of interest after a federal judge, Robert N. Chatigny, of United States District Court, threatened to suspend his law license for not questioning Mr. Ross's competency more thoroughly. 
 That led to a six-day competency hearing last month in State Superior Court in New London that included testimony from four psychiatrists. Judge Patrick J. Clifford appointed a special counsel, Thomas J. Groark Jr., to argue that Mr. Ross is incompetent.
 All four psychiatrists agreed that Mr. Ross had mental illness that included bouts of depression and narcissistic personality traits. Two said Mr. Ross was seeking to commit state-assisted suicide, and two said his mental health problems did not render him incompetent. 
 Mr. Ross has said he wants to be executed in order to help heal his victims' families.
 Judge Clifford, who had found Mr. Ross competent after a one-day hearing in December, found him competent again after the April hearing. The State Supreme Court upheld that finding on Monday, four months after upholding the earlier competency finding.
 Others who have filed motions to prevent the execution have failed. Mr. Ross dismissed public defenders last year, and except for Judge Chatigny, courts have since ruled that they lack legal standing in the case.
 More motions were filed on Wednesday, with a lawyer representing a sister of Mr. Ross's asking a federal court to review whether Mr. Ross is making his decision voluntarily. The State Supreme Court had rejected the claim earlier in the day. Another suit, filed Wednesday on behalf of state inmates, claims that Mr. Ross's execution would ''cause suicide contagion among suicidal and suicide-prone prisoners.'' Those motions were pending late Wednesday.
 Mr. Ross issued an affidavit Wednesday saying any suits purportedly filed in his interest were ''unwarranted, unauthorized and against my wishes.''
 Mr. Morano, the chief state's attorney, said his office had prepared countermotions in advance, anticipating various legal arguments.
 ''I'm sure that something will pop up that haven't thought of,'' Mr. Morano said. ''We'll be able to respond quickly should that occur.''
 About two dozen death-penalty opponents have spent the week walking the 30 miles from Trinity College in Hartford to Somers, where Mr. Ross is to be executed at Osborn Correctional Institution just south of the Massachusetts border.
 ''A serial killer should not be allowed to dictate public policy,'' said Robert Nave, director of the Connecticut Network to Abolish the Death Penalty, who is leading the march. ''Michael Ross is totally in control.''
 Corrections officials say their plan to administer lethal injection to Mr. Ross is identical to what it was last winter.
 At 2:01 a.m. Friday, the executioner is to begin administering a lethal dose of 2,500 milligrams of thiopental sodium with sodium chloride through an intravenous tube in the arm of Mr. Ross, who will be strapped to a padded table. The executioner will then administer 100 milligrams of pancuronium bromide, followed by potassium chloride.
 Several people are scheduled to witness the execution. Mr. Ross requested three witnesses: Kathy Jaeger, a spiritual advocate who meets with him regularly; one other spiritual adviser; and a freelance writer working on a book about him, Martha Elliott. Several relatives of his victims and five members of the news media will witness the execution.
 Mr. Paulding said that he met with Mr. Ross on Wednesday morning and that his client was determined to be executed. ''He's totally committed to it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The much-reviled estate tax: efficient, fair, painless as possible and misunderstood.

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the co-author (with Philip Cook) of ''The Winner-Take-All Society.''

 BODY:
THE Bush administration has proposed permanent repeal of the estate tax, the tax people pay when they inherit money. Citing overwhelming support even among middle-class voters, some predict that the Senate will soon approve a repeal bill similar to the one the House passed last month.
 But is support for repeal of the estate tax as broad as it appears? Survey respondents are typically told only that repeal of the tax has been proposed and are then asked whether they are in favor of such a move. Although two-thirds or more of respondents in most surveys respond affirmatively, this may tell us only that people find taxes of any sort unpleasant. 
 Well, sure, but that does not mean taxes are unnecessary. The alternative, after all, would be to have no army, which would eventually mean paying taxes to some other government whose army conquered us. 
 Repealing the estate tax would reduce federal revenues by close to $1 trillion from 2012 to 2021, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This shortfall would require at least one of the following steps: raising income taxes, sales taxes or other taxes; further cuts in government services; or increasing the rate at which we borrow from the Chinese, Japanese and others. Additional borrowing would have to be repaid at market rates of interest, however, so the last option would also entail eventual tax increases or service cuts.
 Many opponents of the estate tax argue that the revenue shortfall caused by its repeal will reduce bloated government. But in our current political system, spending cuts are more likely to take aim at basic public services than wasteful pork barrel projects. For example, President Bush, who campaigned as an enemy of government waste, recently proposed a 16 percent reduction in spending for veterans' health care, a 15 percent reduction for education and vocational training, and a 9.6 percent reduction for nutritional assistance for poor mothers with small children. So, unless we are willing to raise other taxes, repeal of the estate tax will entail further cuts in valued services.
 Would voters still favor repealing the estate tax if they took these repercussions into account? To find out, I asked the Survey Research Institute at Cornell to administer two versions of a national telephone survey. In the first, respondents were asked simply whether they favored or opposed the Bush administration's proposal. Typical of the findings in other, similar surveys, these respondents favored repeal by almost three to one.
 In the second version, respondents were reminded that the revenue shortfall from repealing the estate tax would entail raising other taxes, cutting government services or increasing federal borrowing. Strikingly, these respondents opposed repeal by almost four to one. Although the sample sizes in both surveys were small (only 42 in the first group, 66 in the second), the odds of observing such a sweeping reversal by chance are remote.
 If support for the abolition of the estate tax is an illusion, as it appears, is there an affirmative case for retaining this tax? Our basic goal is to pay for government services with a tax system that is as efficient, fair and painless as possible. On all counts, it is difficult to imagine a better tax than the estate tax. Every dollar we collect from it is one less dollar we need to collect from some other tax that is worse in at least one of these dimensions. 
 Among the important advantages of the estate tax is that it has virtually no negative effects on incentives. High income tax rates may discourage effort or investment. But who would become a slacker merely to avoid estate taxes? Because the estate tax enables income tax rates to be lower than they would otherwise be, it actually increases the incentive to invest and take risks.
 Another attraction of the estate tax is that it works like a lawyer's contingency fee. Injured parties who could not otherwise afford access to the legal system can try to recover damages because lawyers are willing to work without pay if their client does not win. Similarly, the estate tax enables us to enjoy valuable public services that we would be happy to pay for if we knew we would end up wealthy, but that we might be reluctant to demand otherwise. With the estate tax, the surcharge kicks in only if we are lucky enough to be one of life's biggest winners.
 The estate tax also provides an incentive for charitable giving, which reduces the need to pay for many public services with tax money. Recent estimates by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute suggest that its repeal may reduce such giving by as much as $15 billion a year. Finally, having estate taxes means paying lower taxes while we are alive, and taxes are generally more painful to the living than the dead.
 Some opponents complain that the estate tax imposes an unreasonable burden on the owners of small businesses and farms. But inheritances of less than $1.5 million ($3 million for married couples) are currently untaxed, an exemption that will rise to $3.5 million ($7 million for couples) by 2009. Far fewer than 1 percent of heirs will ever pay a penny of estate tax; most of the revenue from estate taxes comes from inheritances larger than $10 million.
 Many parents say they dislike the estate tax because they fear it will prevent them from doing all they can to assure that their children are financially secure. Yet current exemption levels allow parents to leave their children more than enough to start a business, finance a premium education, buy a large house in a good school district, and still have several hundred thousand dollars left for a rainy day. 
 On reflection, would a parent really want them to inherit more than that? Old money has long been wary of the corrosive effect of guaranteed wealth on children's ability to set out on successful careers of their own -- a concern that has prompted Warren E. Buffett and others to limit their bequests to their children. But even if Mr. Buffett were to change his mind, he could still leave an after-tax bequest of more than $20 billion under current tax laws.
 In sum, although there are many taxes we ought to reduce or eliminate, the estate tax is not one of them. It is the closest thing to a perfect tax we have. And when the implications of its repeal are in plain view, most people seem to recognize their interest in keeping it. Even among Republicans, 70 percent opposed its repeal in the second version of my survey.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices and Trade Gap Nudge the Market Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A late-session rally fed by falling oil prices pushed stocks slightly higher yesterday, although Wall Street's mood remained tentative amid uncertainty about the economy.
 The drop in oil prices -- coming as the United States reported a larger-than-expected stockpile of oil and gasoline -- removed one big obstacle for stocks. A barrel of light crude settled at $50.45, down $1.62, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 News about the trade deficit, which shrank to its lowest level in six months, also encouraged investors who had feared an economic slowdown. But Michael Murphy, managing director at Wachovia Securities in Baltimore, noted that while the day's economic and corporate news was generally good, the news lately had been mixed, and most buyers were waiting for a clear signal to enter the market. ''People are very hesitant right now to pull the trigger,'' he said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.14 points, or 0.19 percent, to 10,300.25. Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 4.89 points, or 0.42 percent, at 1,171.11, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 8.78 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,971.55.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 0.53, or 0.09 percent, at 595.57.
 Late Tuesday, Cisco Systems reported earnings of $1.5 billion, or 23 cents a share, for the latest quarter, excluding special items, beating Wall Street analysts' expectations by a penny a share. The company, which makes data networking gear, also said its third-quarter sales jumped more than 10 percent, and it expected sales to grow this quarter. Cisco rose 34 cents yesterday, to close at $18.55.
 Eastman Kodak, in the midst of a difficult transition from film-based to digital photography, rose $1.13, to $26.58, after it said its chief executive, Daniel A. Carp, would step down in favor of his second in command, Antonio M. Perez.
 Leading Internet music retailers were down sharply after Yahoo said it would start a subscription-based music store with prices that would undercut competitors' substantially. RealNetworks plunged 21.1 percent, or $1.54, to $5.76; Napster tumbled 26.8 percent, or $1.70, to $4.65; and Apple Computer fell 81 cents, to $35.61. Yahoo rose 82 cents, to $34.88.
 Walt Disney reported strong gains in quarterly revenue and earnings and beat Wall Street's profit forecasts by a penny a share, but the stock fell 28 cents, to $26.67.
 Advancing issues barely outnumbered those declining on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 1.41 billion shares, compared with 1.51 billion on Tuesday.
 Prices of most United States Treasury securities were unchanged or slightly higher. By late yesterday, the price of the benchmark 10-year note had risen 1/32, to 98 14/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 4.20 percent, unchanged from Tuesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.932
High Yield: 3.890
Low Yield: 3.800
Median Yield: 3.869
Total applied for: $40,820,810

The five-year notes mature May 15, 2010.

HEADLINE: Senators Exceed Bush's Budget On Highway Bill by $11 Billion

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Hungry for more road and transit dollars for their states, members of the Senate defied the White House on Wednesday and added billions of dollars to a highway measure, overwhelmingly rejecting the administration effort to keep spending within the limits of the newly passed budget.
 Authors of the $295 billion measure said the 76-to-22 vote to add more than $11 billion to President Bush's plan was justifiable in light of the sorry state of the transportation system. 
 Indeed, the willingness of 33 Republicans to join with Democrats and directly challenge the White House while exceeding budget limits at their first opportunity illustrates the premium that lawmakers continue to place on money for bridges and buses. 
 The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, called the addition a detour toward fiscal irresponsibility, especially because the Senate adopted its spending blueprint less than two weeks ago. 
 ''The position of the president is being, well, it is being more than ignored,'' Mr. Gregg said. ''It is being run over by a bulldozer or maybe a cement mixer or maybe a paver.''
 Yet the Republican-led Senate voted to defeat his objection. Some Republicans bristled at suggestions that they were spendthrifts who were using accounting gimmicks to offset the extra money.
 ''I would challenge anyone to match my conservative performance and credentials,'' said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. ''And yet, I've always said that when you come to this body there are two areas where conservatives are big spenders. One is national defense, and one is in infrastructure.''
 Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee responsible for road money, said, ''We have to have this money for safety, for economic development, for continued growth and the health of our economy.'' 
 Senate leaders would like to pass the bill in the next few days. Should the extra money survive, it could lead to a showdown with the House, which approved less money, and Mr. Bush, who has yet to veto a bill in his years in the White House but has consistently threatened the transportation measure should it come in over his ceiling. 
 Because of disputes over costs, the measure has been unable to clear Congress in the last two years, leaving the aid program operating under extensions of older lower levels. The sixth extension is due to expire at the end of the month, and lawmakers would like to send a bill to the president by then, though that promises to be a difficult deadline.
 In the last Congress, the White House threatened to veto any measure that exceeded $256billion over six years, a sum increased to $284billion in the current budget. But many lawmakers have pushed for more, saying states deserve a greater return on their gasoline tax dollars and have a backlog of priority projects.
 ''This additional funding benefits every state, every city, every county and every town,'' said Senator James M. Jeffords, an independent from Vermont who is a senior member of the highway panel. 
 Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said the Senate proposal was not acceptable, calling it a ''dark cloud that will needlessly delay many important highway and transportation projects around the country.''
 Lawmakers and Senate aides said they expected that the extra dollars would be pared in negotiations with the House. But some influential House members on transportation issues want added money, too, and could move to embrace the Senate total, putting Congress on a collision course with Mr. Bush. The Senate budget vote indicated that it could well override any veto.

HEADLINE: Attention: Deficit Disorder

BYLINE: By Robert E. Rubin. 
Robert E. Rubin, Treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999, is a director of Citigroup.

 BODY:
THE United States has tremendous economic strengths but it also faces great challenges: the need to ensure national security; a newly competitive China and India; serious shortcomings in public education, basic research, infrastructure and other requisites for meeting that competition; and much else. An immediate and critical imperative is to redress fiscal imbalances. 
 Most pressing is the 10-year federal deficit, which most independent analysts project at $4.5 trillion to $5 trillion, assuming that the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 are made permanent and that the alternative minimum tax is adjusted to avoid unintended effects on middle-income taxpayers. And while 10-year numbers can be highly unreliable, deficits are as likely to be higher as to be lower. Over the longer term, Social Security has a 75-year estimated deficit of $4 trillion, while the different components of Medicare, including its new prescription drug benefit, represent a fiscal problem of roughly $20 trillion. 
 Virtually all mainstream economists agree that, over time, sustained deficits crowd out private investment, increase interest rates, and reduce productivity and economic growth. But, far more dangerously, if markets here and abroad begin to fear long-term fiscal disarray and our related trade imbalances, those markets could then demand sharply higher interest rates for providing long-term debt capital and could put abrupt and sharp downward pressure on the dollar. These market effects, plus the adverse impact of continuing fiscal imbalances on business and consumer confidence, could seriously undermine our economy. 
 We have managed to avoid these market effects so far because private demand for capital has been relatively limited, and because the central banks of Japan, China and other countries have provided large inflows of foreign capital. A change in either of those circumstances, or simply a change of market psychology for whatever reason, could, however, turn these interest rate and currency risks into a reality. 
 The tough decisions needed on both spending and revenues will probably require some process whereby the president and leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives and both parties assume joint responsibility for painful political choices. Tax revenues are approximately 16.5 percent of gross domestic product, the lowest level since 1960, and spending is roughly 20 percent. We must have serious spending discipline and entitlement reform -- though any entitlement reforms likely to be proposed would have little immediate effect. 
 But, as BusinessWeek, not an advocate of activist government, said in a recent editorial, ''the deficit morass is due as much to a revenue shortfall as to excessive spending.'' (The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, for example, are estimated to have a 75-year cost of $11 trillion, almost three times the entire Social Security deficit.) And that shortfall is especially pressing given the rapid increases in entitlement costs and the need to finance national security, investments in education and infrastructure and other critical programs. At the same time, revenue-increasing measures must reverse the recent trend of disproportionately favoring upper-income taxpayers.
 The first priority should be to tackle the 10-year fiscal imbalances, which would also be the best way to promote economic growth and minimize the risks I have outlined. Using structural measures to address the 10-year deficits would address our long-term imbalances as well. 
 For example, if the tax cuts for those earning above $200,000 were repealed and the inheritance tax as reformed were continued rather than eliminated, the 10-year projected deficit would be reduced by roughly $1.1 trillion, or almost 25 percent, and the 75-year fiscal reduction would be roughly $3.9 trillion, or approximately equal to the Social Security shortfall. This course of action would be similar to the income tax increases that were combined with spending cuts in the 1993 deficit reduction program, which some predicted would lead to recession but which, instead, was followed by the longest economic expansion in our nation's history. 
 We should also begin a serious bipartisan process on Medicare to identify possible solutions and create public support for action, because doing so is absolutely key to our long-run fiscal health. Despite the focus in Washington today on Social Security, it is a smaller and less pressing problem, and our political system can bear only so much traffic at one time. 
 If we were to address Social Security now, whatever we do must not increase federal deficits and borrowing but instead must improve fiscal conditions and increase national savings in both the short and long terms. The proposal that the administration has embraced -- private accounts plus progressive price indexing of benefits -- would result in additional deficits and borrowing of more than $1 trillion in the first 10 years, more than $3 trillion in the second 10 years, and so on for roughly 50 years. 
 That's because this approach -- which would eliminate only about one-third of the projected 75-year Social Security deficit -- calls for private accounts that would involve immediate and large continuing costs while the savings begin only in the second decade and would grow slowly. While some estimate that after 50-plus years those savings will exceed costs on a cumulative basis, projected savings 50 years out will do nothing to offset the impact of increased deficits on interest rates. After all, if markets took into account 50-year projections of fiscal conditions, interest rates would already be through the roof. 
 Of course, we can continue to close our eyes and hope for the best. There's no way to predict whether that will work for another few months or for many more years. But the odds are extremely low that our fiscal imbalances will solve themselves, and we place ourselves at great peril by not facing these realities. Conversely, if we do address these challenges, then with our flexible labor and capital markets, and our historic embrace of change and willingness to take risks, our prospects over time should be very favorable.

HEADLINE: Going for a Play and Finding a Second Home

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PREUSCH

 BODY:
WHEN Paul and Ann Hill, a pair of retired Atlantans, stopped in Ashland, Ore., in 2001, their only plans involved dinner and a play at the long-running Oregon Shakespeare Festival. 
 But the Hills quickly decided that a change of plans was in order.
 ''We came into this town one day,'' Ann Hill said, ''and bought a house the next.'' 
 The Hills and other theatergoers who have bought homes are among those fueling a boom in second-home sales in arts-centered communities from Taos, N.M., to Lenox, Mass.
 Last year, vacation home sales in the United States rose almost 20 percent, passing one million for the first time, the National Association of Realtors said. And although the traditional second home, a cabin on a lake or at the base of a ski slope, meant trading society for solitude, that's often no longer the case. 
 Towns like Ashland, with a population of 20,000 and a lively business district full of restaurants, shops and art galleries, all set near the confluence of three mountain ranges in the southwestern part of Oregon, attract people like the Hills. Former city dwellers, they want their chance at the quiet life without giving up access to galleries, restaurants and the theater, said John Villani, whose book ''The 100 Best Art Towns in America,'' lists Ashland as No. 2 among towns under 30,000. (Villani ranks Naples, Fla., No. 1 among smaller towns, with Provincetown, Mass.; Taos, N.M.; and Northampton, Mass., rounding out the top five.)
 The big rise in Ashland's real estate sales reflects this phenomenon. In the first three months of 2005, 91 homes were sold in Ashland. The median home price of those sales, $403,700, represented an increase of 32 percent over the first quarter of 2004. 
 ''People come there to see a play, and they fall in love with the town,'' said Roy Wright, an appraiser who has been tracking area real estate for more than 25 years. ''And they walk in one of those real-estate offices downtown and buy a house.''
 The Hills now own a renovated ranch house five minutes from each of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival's three theaters. ''We were kind of looking for the diversity, the curiosity and the culture,'' Paul Hill said. ''We knew the O.S.F. was there, but we had no idea of the scope of it.''
 At the local Starbucks recently, he ran into Armando Duran, who is performing with Catherine E. Coulson in ''By the Waters of Babylon,'' a play by the Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist Robert Schenkkan written for the two actors for this season.
 ''That's the great thing about the theater here,'' Mr. Hill said. ''It's on the street right before you.''
 The festival, whose manicured grounds are just off Ashland's central plaza and Lithia Park, still defines the town. Now in its 70th season, the festival will mount 773 performances on the three stages between February and October. Shakespeare's influence is evident everywhere in Ashland, from hotel linens emblazoned with lines from his works to the music store on Main Street called CD or Not CD.
 But there's more than Shakespeare in Ashland. A walk through the Railroad District east of the main commercial strip reveals glass and pottery studios mixed in with organic food co-ops and restaurants. This is where John Davis opened his Davis & Cline Gallery in 1998. Like many Ashland newcomers, Davis hails from the San Francisco Bay Area.
 ''It's not if you came from California, but when you came from California,'' he said.
 The influx of outsiders seeking second homes has had an explosive effect on housing prices in Ashland and other arts towns across the nation. An example is Taos, where the value of residential real estate sold in 2004 was nearly twice the value of that sold three years earlier. 
 The first American artists arrived in Taos in 1898, when Bert Phillips and Ernest Blumenschein stopped to fix a broken wagon wheel and stayed on. Other artists followed, attracted by the mystical play of the light on Taos Mountain.
 Like so many resort communities in the mountain West, Taos has an economy largely based on tourism. But a recent real estate boom has changed that somewhat, said Steve Fuhlendorf of the Taos Chamber of Commerce. Now the economy is really being driven by new residents, he said, and part of that growth is second-home construction and sales. 
 Construction industries accounted for 65 percent of the total gain in gross receipts for Taos businesses between 2003 and 2004, said the Taos Economic Report, which is published by the chamber and other groups. The number of construction jobs increased by 14 percent between 2001 and 2003, twice the average rate for other sectors in Taos. Real estate agents' incomes have undergone a concurrent jump.
 ''A lot of people have been coming here for many years to vacation and now they've decided its time to stay, so they buy second homes here,'' Mr. Fuhlendorf said.
 Even established resort communities like Aspen, Colo., are finding that the arts, as well as the champagne powder, draw many new residents. A 2004 survey of second-home owners in Pitkin County, home to Aspen, by the Northwest Colorado Council of Governments found that ''opportunities to attend cultural amenities'' ranked a close third to outdoor recreation and open space, far higher than planners expected.
 IT shouldn't be a surprise, said Rachel Richards, a former mayor of Aspen and now a member of the town council. She said that many ski towns try to fill out their tourist seasons by adding summer gallery walks or festivals, but that the arts have always been a part of Aspen. ''It's part of our culture,'' she said. ''It's never been an add-on.'' The town's intellectual history dates back to a 1949 celebration of Goethe undertaken by the Chicago industrialist Walter Paepcke. He envisioned the town as ''an intellectual capital, a Salzburg of America,'' Ms. Richards said. 
 Today, Aspen, a town of about 6,000 that can swell to five times that in summer months, is home to two theater groups, a ballet troupe, a film festival and dozens of galleries. Many of those groups are buoyed by the volunteer work and fund-raising of part-time Aspenites, Ms. Richards said. ''The second-home owners have had a tremendous impact and contribution in supporting our local arts scene,'' she said.
 The same is true in Ashland, where retired professionals offer their time, talents and, often, money to bolster the same institutions that drew them there. ''There's certainly an abundance of opportunities to be helpful in the local community,'' said Jerry Taylor, a retired chief financial officer of a semiconductor firm in San Jose.
 In 1996 he and his wife, Jeanne, bought a second home in the hills west of Ashland with panoramic views of Grizzly Peak and Bear Creek Valley. Five years later, they decided they liked the town so much they moved there full time. Now, Jerry Taylor sits on the board of the Shakespeare festival and Jeanne Taylor on the board of the Ashland YMCA. They have added to the mix of arts-town residents that continues to draw second-home buyers to Ashland. 
 ''If you see people of all different ages, wearing all different kinds of dress, and a lot of dogs,'' said Mr. Hill, the transplanted Atlantan. ''It's a good sign.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Plans Fewer Base Closings Than Once Expected

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday that the Pentagon would recommend closing fewer domestic bases than originally expected because the military had less surplus space and capacity than was initially estimated. 
 While Mr. Rumsfeld refused to discuss details of the recommendations before their planned submission on Friday to Congress, three military officials who have seen the final list or been briefed on it said the Pentagon would recommend closing at least 30 bases and realigning a few hundred more installations or other smaller military facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because Congress had not yet been formally notified. The military earlier estimated it had 20 percent to 25 percent more capacity than it needed. 
 But Mr. Rumsfeld said military officials had found only 5 percent to 10 percent excess capacity once they took into consideration the need to accommodate 70,000 troops returning from Europe, as well as Pentagon agencies moving from leased commercial space to less vulnerable offices on military bases. He also cited the need to preserve the ability to step up operations at ammunition plants and maintenance depots in times of crisis.
 The comments by Mr. Rumsfeld, who was flanked at a news conference by the chiefs of the armed services, suggest that fewer communities across the country will see their local bases completely shut. But the changes will still significantly alter the operations of many of the nation's 425 bases, and the local economies that depend on them.
 Many National Guard and Reserve bases will close and their functions will be consolidated at active-duty installations or other reserve bases. Maintenance depots, research laboratories and hospitals now operated by each of the armed services will be merged. For example, Walter Reed Medical Center, an Army hospital, and the Bethesda Naval Hospital are expected to share some operations. 
 Military chaplains and cooks will be trained at one place, rather than having each armed service train its own. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps will share training ranges and war-fighting centers as part of the Pentagon's goal to train and fight jointly, senior military officials said. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld said the closings and realignments would save about $5.5 billion a year after initial closing costs were paid, and $48.8 billion over 20 years. The previous four rounds of base closings -- in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995 -- saved $29 billion through 2003, but independent military specialists said the Pentagon estimates were plausible given the extensive realignment it aimed to achieve. 
 ''The savings projected by this round seem to be generated more by reorganization than outright closures,'' said Loren Thompson, a military analyst with the Lexington Institute, a consulting firm. ''At present, the military is very inefficiently located and organized. Many facilities are sited in places that made sense a century ago but not now.'' 
 After more than two years of exhaustive study, this round of base closings is an integral part of Mr. Rumsfeld's strategy to revamp the military into a leaner, more agile force. 
 ''The degree with which the services coordinate, integrate and operate together will be increased, and it will include how we manage some of our bases and posts,'' Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld sought to ease fears in many communities that closings could leave thousands of local employees out of work. He cited examples of closed bases that had been converted into commercial airports and economic centers. And he pledged that the Defense Department would provide retraining for workers and economic aid to help offset the immediate economic impact in communities where bases close.
 The Pentagon's recommendations will go to an independent nine-member commission that will hold public hearings and visit bases through the summer. The panel can add or subtract bases from the list, but it needs seven panel members to approve any changes. The panel, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, will present its recommendations to President Bush by Sept. 8.

HEADLINE: Military Base, Awaiting Future, Tries Hard to Assure It Has One

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Jonathan Miller contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
On military bases across the country and in the communities that depend on them, all the dread and anxiety comes into high focus today, when the Pentagon plans to release a new list of recommended base closings and consolidations. 
 The upstate New York city of Rome, like many other military communities, has seen this moment coming for years and has tirelessly prepared for it. Stung by past cuts at Griffiss Air Force Base and even a proposed closing 10 years ago, the community spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in public and private money to sell the complex as an essential cog in a shrinking military.
 The base has reconfigured its mission, cut costs, streamlined operations and secured millions of dollars in new investments. A community action group that sprung up in support of the base has deployed a small battalion of lobbyists, publicists, public policy experts and financial analysts to build a case in Washington for keeping it right where it is. 
 ''Tomorrow, this will kind of validate 10 years of work or put a major hiccup in our efforts,'' Steve J. DiMeo, president of the community development group, Mohawk Valley Economic and Development Growth Enterprises, said yesterday as he anxiously awaited final word. ''But I'm trying to remain optimistic.'' 
 The city's campaign mirrors efforts elsewhere to head off or blunt the cuts to be recommended by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has described this round of base closings and realignments, the first in a decade, as a cornerstone of his plan to streamline the military. He is seeking to cut five to ten percent of base capacity, closing fewer bases than was first expected. [Page A16.]
 Mr. Rumsfeld's proposals go to the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or BRAC, which must prepare a final list by Sept. 8. President Bush and Congress must accept or reject the list by Nov. 7. 
 Every major military installation in the country, including those in the New York region -- 12 in New York, 7 in New Jersey and 1 in Connecticut -- has come under review. 
 States have tried called on high-powered lobbyists. Florida hired William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary, and Dick Armey, the former House majority leader.
 Officials have tried flexing political muscle. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and two other senior Illinois lawmakers warned Mr. Rumsfeld that closing any National Guard base would require the governor's approval. (The Pentagon disagreed.) 
 In the New York region, state legislative and Congressional delegations, in conjunction with their governors and public-private community action groups like the one in Rome, have mounted vigorous campaigns to safeguard their bases.
 Public officials, military analysts and community leaders say that elements of the Griffiss complex -- especially a high-technology research center there -- remain particularly vulnerable in the current round of cuts, as do Niagara Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and the Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst, Picatinny Arsenal and Fort Monmouth in New Jersey.
 The administration of Gov. George E. Pataki has spent $3 million in the past three years to promote New York military installations: About half the money has helped to finance the community action groups and the other half has paid for Washington lobbyists, including the firm of Hyjek & Fix. 
 New Jersey has paid more than $1 million to a Washington lobbyist, Barry D. Rhoads, during the last four years to promote the state's bases, and Connecticut has budgeted more than $1.2 million to save its most important military complex, the naval submarine base in Groton. 
 In these campaigns, advocates have frequently emphasized the economic significance of their base to the surrounding communities: the jobs generated, and the amount of personal income and gross state product produced. But the savviest recognize that the best way to win is to establish their base's relevance to the military.
 In the calculations of base closings, the most important criteria include the military value of a base -- particularly its impact on fighting wars, training and combat readiness -- as well as potential cost savings.
 ''It's apple pie and motherhood in every community,'' said Hank Beck, a leading community advocate for the New York State Air National Guard 106th Rescue Wing, based at Francis S. Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. ''But the decisions that the BRAC commission makes are based on military value.''
 Rome knows only too well what it feels like to be on the Pentagon's list -- and what to do to avoid it. The community lost most of Griffiss Air Force Base in the 1993 round of closings, including an entire bomber wing, costing about 4,500 jobs and spurring the exodus of more than a quarter of the city's population, now about 34,000. 
 In the next round of cuts two years later, the Pentagon recommended the closure of the research center on the base, an economic stanchion of the community. A furious lobbying campaign managed to persuade Washington to drop the center from its final hit list that year.
 Informed by these near-death experiences, Mohawk Valley Economic and Development Growth Enterprises has spent more than half a million dollars since January 2004 in an effort to keep the Rome military complex off the new list. (In addition to the laboratories, the base, now called Griffiss Business and Technology Park, includes a defense finance and accounting services center, and an air defense surveillance unit.)
 But even the head of the development group admits that all this work might not be enough. Should the Pentagon select any element of the Rome base, the group is poised to spend another $1 million to rescue it by redoubling its lobbying, focusing on the base closing commission. 
 ''I've prepared myself for the past several weeks that after Friday, we're going to go forward with a full-fledged fight,'' the group's president, Mr. DiMeo, said in a telephone interview this week.
 He sighed deeply. BRAC, he said, ''is not a good four-letter word.''
 There's a lot at stake for Rome. Some 4,000 people work on the base: about 800 military personnel and 600 contractors work in the laboratory, 400 people in the air defense surveillance unit, about 400 in the finance accounting service center and the rest in other companies, many of which do business with the lab.
 ''It's been on everybody's mind because we know what it tastes like to lose that social and economic fabric in our community, we know what it means,'' said William K. Guglielmo, the president of the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce, in a telephone interview this week.
 The current effort to protect the Rome military complex began immediately after the last round of base closures with the formation of the development group in 1997. Since then, the group has helped the base shift its focus and consolidate its resources around the research center, called the Air Force Research Laboratory. Private firms have moved onto the base and work with the military laboratory.
 The development group has also helped to promote about $182 million in infrastructure improvements using public and private money, Mr. DiMeo said. Another $70 million is earmarked for this year, he said.
 Some functions of the base have been privatized, including electrical and heating systems, and the city has assumed the costs for other services, including road maintenance and fire and police calls, Mr. DiMeo said. ''The Air Force only has to worry about its own facility,'' he said.
 The efforts have produced what Mr. DiMeo called the premier lab of its kind, specializing in command and control communications, surveillance, reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering technology. 
 ''I'm optimistic,'' Mr. Guglielmo of the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce said. ''But having lived through it, gee . . .'' 
 His voice trailed off. At this late hour, it seemed, there was nothing more to do but wait and fret.

HEADLINE: What Slowdown? Retail Sales Bounce Back

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
High gasoline prices did not keep consumers away from shopping malls and restaurants last month, which showed the best advance in retail sales since September, the government said yesterday. 
 The Commerce Department reported that sales climbed 1.4 percent in April, double the median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg News, after a rise of only 0.4 percent in March. 
 Excluding auto purchases, which were bolstered by big discounts, spending grew 1.1 percent in April, the most in six months and far better than a 0.2 percent increase in March. 
 ''Sales at the retail level were strong anywhere you looked,'' said Richard Yamarone, the chief economist at Argus Research. ''This says that the second quarter is starting off, at least in the consumer sector, on very positive footing.''
 Only days ago, most economists were predicting a slowdown based on data released last month: the trade deficit had swelled to a record in February, employment had wavered in March, and orders for big-ticket items like washing machines and computers were flagging. 
 But major reports released in the last week have depicted strength: in addition to the retail sales report, data have shown that the trade deficit shrank significantly in March and that employers hired many more workers in April.
 ''At the very worst, what we're seeing is a complete stabilization of the economy's growth,'' said Anthony Chan, senior economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
 The recent data have been strong enough to make Wall Street worry that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates at a faster pace to keep inflation under control. 
 The sales gains last month were widespread. After declining 2.2 percent in March, clothing purchases surged 2.8 percent, and sales of building materials rose 1.2 percent as construction and remodeling remained strong. 
 General merchandise rebounded 1.5 percent after a 0.7 percent decline in March, even as sales of consumer electronics and sporting goods showed weakness, falling 0.1 and 0.3 percent respectively. 
 Bar and restaurant receipts rose 0.9 percent after falling 0.8 percent in March. 
 The data prompted Morgan Stanley to raise its forecast for second-quarter gross domestic product to 4 percent, versus 3 percent earlier this week. 
 It also predicted that the government would revise first-quarter G.D.P. to 3.7 percent, as opposed to the 3.1 percent it reported last month. 
 ''If those estimates end up being about right, that sure wasn't much of a soft patch,'' Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research bulletin.
 The retail report may have helped offset the news of slower earnings growth at Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer.
 In a separate report yesterday, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for jobless benefits increased 4,000 last week, to 340,000.

HEADLINE: Where Have You Gone, Joe DiMaggio?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
For so many years, America's economy was so dominant on the world stage, so out front in so many key areas, that we fell into the habit of thinking we were competing largely against ourselves. If we fell behind in one area or another -- whether it was math and science skills, broadband capacity or wireless infrastructure -- we took the view that: ''Oh well, we'll fix that problem when we get to it. After all, we're just competing against ourselves.'' 
 In recent years, though, with the flattening of the global playing field, it should be apparent that we are not just competing against ourselves. The opening of China, India and Russia means that young people in these countries can increasingly plug and play -- connect, collaborate and compete -- more easily and cheaply than ever before. And they are. We, alas, are still coasting along as if we have all the time in the world. 
 I helped teach a course at Harvard last semester on globalization, and one day a student told me this story: He was part of a student-run collaboration between students in the U.S. and China. The American and Chinese students had recently started working together by using Skype, the popular, freely downloadable, software that enables you to make free phone calls over the Internet to other Skype users. But what was most interesting, the student told me, was that it was the Chinese students who introduced their U.S. counterparts to Skype. And, he noted, these Chinese students were not from major cities, like Beijing, but from smaller towns.
 On April 7, CNET News.com reported the following: ''The University of Illinois tied for 17th place in the world finals of the Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest. 
 ''That's the lowest ranking for the top-performing U.S. school in the 29-year history of the competition. Shanghai Jiao Tong University of China took top honors this year, followed by Moscow State University and the St. Petersburg Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics. Those results continued a gradual ascendance of Asian and East European schools during the past decade or so. A U.S. school hasn't won the world championship since 1997, when students at Harvey Mudd College achieved the honor. 'The U.S. used to dominate these kinds of programming Olympics,' said David Patterson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery and a computer science professor at the University of California at Berkeley. 'Now we're sort of falling behind.'''
 Earlier this week, a special report on the Indiana University High School Survey of Student Engagement, which covered 90,000 high school students in 26 states, was published. The study noted that 18 percent of college-track seniors did not take a math course in their last year in high school -- and that ''more than a fifth (22 percent) of first-year college students require remediation in math.'' Just 56 percent of the students surveyed said they put a great deal of effort into schoolwork; only 43 percent said they worked harder than they had expected.
 Even though 55 percent said they studied no more than three hours a week, 65 percent of those students reported getting mostly A's and B's.
 ''Students are getting A's and B's, but without studying much,'' Martha McCarthy, the Indiana University professor who headed the study, told me. ''Our fear,'' she added, ''is that when you talk to employers out there, they say they are not getting the skills they need,'' in part because ''the colleges are not getting students with the skills they need.'' Ms. McCarthy said one of the main reasons Indiana did this study is to better inform high school educators about what is going on in their own schools so they can find remedies. All of these shortcomings developed over time, Ms. McCarthy said, but ''we as a nation became complacent about them.''
 America today reminds me of our last Olympic basketball team -- that lackadaisical group that brought home the bronze medal. We think that all we need to do is show up and everyone else will fold -- because, after all, we're just competing with ourselves.
 And we think we don't need to get focused and play together like a team, with Democrats and Republicans actually working together. Well, on the basketball court -- and in a flat world, where everyone now has access to all the same coaching techniques, training methods and scouting reports -- a more focused, motivated team always beats a collection of more talented but complacent individuals.

HEADLINE: Outlook Better For Tax Rebates, Codey Says

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 12 

 BODY:
Two months after warning that New Jersey's abysmal finances afforded him little choice but to water down rebates on property taxes, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey said on Thursday that part of those rebates might end up being preserved, because of a rebounding economy and a record number of new jobs.
 In all, the state is expected to collect $500 million more in revenue than anticipated this fiscal year, mostly from income taxes from people who have enjoyed good years on Wall Street, said John E. McCormac, the state treasurer. But Mr. Codey urged legislators to exercise restraint in allocating any extra dollars, noting that the state's long-term fiscal health was still wobbly, because of rising health care costs, pensions and state debt. 
 ''Just because revenue is up does not mean it's party time at the State House,'' Mr. Codey said in a speech to business leaders at Seton Hall University. ''We must continue to hold the line on spending. We just can't afford an old-fashioned Trenton spending spree.''
 New Jersey's initial budgetary outlook led Mr. Codey to propose the first reduction in state spending in nine years. And with voters set to elect a governor and a new State Assembly in November, just about everyone running for office, Democrat and Republican alike, has embraced a populist mantra: cutting spending and salvaging property tax rebates.
 In March, Mr. Codey surprised many legislators with a $27.4 billion budget proposal that featured spartan recommendations. ''The days of spending like there's no tomorrow end today,'' he said.
 On Thursday, Mr. Codey, a Democrat who is also president of the State Senate, said he had ''not talked about exact figures yet'' with legislators as to how much of the $500 million in extra revenue might go toward restoring the tax rebates, but he said it would ''only be a portion.''

HEADLINE: Miller Urges M.T.A. to Give Repairs First Priority

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
City Council Speaker Gifford Miller said yesterday that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should not proceed with any more planned projects in the city subway system -- like the extension of the No. 7 line and construction of a Second Avenue subway -- until it can finish restoring and updating the existing system.
 Mr. Miller, who is running for mayor, said in a speech to the Greenwich Village Chelsea Chamber of Commerce that the city needed a safe, reliable transit system at a time when the system has suffered from a series of breakdowns, fires and other disruptions. 
 ''Fully funding a comprehensive repair and modernization program to ensure safe, reliable service must be priority No. 1,'' he said. ''So the only responsible choice is to freeze expansion until the M.T.A. meets this first priority and finds real revenue streams for any new projects.''
 Once there is enough money to complete the upgrades, Mr. Miller said, the authority should start expanding, but even then ''we have to make tough choices.'' He said that plans to build a link between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal should be deferred in favor of extending the No. 7 line and building a Second Avenue subway.
 Aides called the speech in Greenwich Village -- to which Mr. Miller rode the subway -- the first in a series of policy statements intended to develop his identity distinct from his role as Council speaker. The speech focused on transportation, they said, because the issue is especially urgent and important to voters.
 Reaction to the proposals -- drafted after consulting transit experts and advocacy groups, including the New York Public Interest Research Group's Straphangers Campaign -- was mixed.
 ''The reality of the situation now is, if we don't protect the expansion projects that have come this far, we're going to lose them forever,'' said Jeremy Soffin, a spokesman for the Regional Plan Association. ''Our first priority needs to be maintaining the current system, but if we fail to expand, our economy is not going to grow. We can't afford not to do these projects.''
 Other experts, however, applauded Mr. Miller. ''A number of us have felt that ensuring that the infrastructure is brought up to a state of good repair, and modernizing it at the same time, needs to happen first,'' said Robert E. Paaswell, the director of the University Transportation Research Center at City College.

HEADLINE: Who's in Charge of Determining U.S. Interest Rates? It May Be Beijing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IN Washington these days, complaining about China has become standard operating procedure. The Bush administration calls on China to allow its currency to rise and Congress talks of punishment if China does not do so.
 Be careful what you wish for.
 As speeches of low-level Chinese bureaucrats are read with care for hints as to just when China will allow its currency to rise, perhaps it would be better for Americans to ponder the impact of China's current policies. 
 Some might wonder just why the American politicians are upset. The way things work now, China sells to the world most everything the world wants and then buys United States Treasury securities. That helps hold down interest rates and stimulates consumer spending.
 You can understand why China might not like to keep doing that forever. Those Treasury securities do not pay much interest, and they are sure to decline in value, measured in Chinese yuan, when that currency rises. But the largest vendor financing program ever has stimulated both the Chinese and American economies.
 In Washington, the theory is that China's keeping the yuan low increases America's trade deficit. But the benefits to United States exporters from a modest rise in the Chinese currency would most likely be small, while the effect of higher interest rates could be larger if China cut back on its purchases, particularly if other Asian central banks decided that they, too, wanted to sell dollars. 
 If that were to happen, the impact could be acute in the housing market. Investors in housing stocks have been nervous for some time, happy to see ever-higher profits but worried that the good times must end someday and fearful that they could be left holding the bag when that happens. 
 One stock where those conflicting emotions have played out is Pulte Homes, a home builder active in 27 states. Last fall, its share price fell when it reported problems in Las Vegas, which was perhaps the most overheated market in America. But price cuts there got homes selling again, and the stock has resumed its ascent.
 Pulte filed its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, disclosing that its inventory of land continues to grow. Some of that land is owned, while the rest is controlled via purchase options that give Pulte the right to walk away -- forfeiting what it paid for the option -- if home sales soften.
 Kathleen Shanley, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit, points out that Pulte's inventory of land is concentrated in areas where home prices have been rising rapidly and that the company's cash flow is negative, even as profits soar, because of all the land it is buying. Pulte has been borrowing money even as it buys back stock at high prices.
 When things were at their worst in Las Vegas, Pulte was seeing cancellations of home purchases that amounted to 75 percent of new sales. ''The risk of similar, and perhaps more prolonged, regional downturns should not be ignored,'' Ms. Shanley wrote in a note to clients.
 Rising interest rates could be a cause of such downturns. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages would be relatively immune, although they could find it harder to sell if they needed to, and the flow of cash from mortgage refinancings would dry up. But many buyers, particularly in some of the hottest markets, have resorted to floating-rate mortgages, some of them paying only interest. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has less power over interest rates than he once did. Perhaps the real decision maker will be Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, as he weighs the pressures to free his currency and stop accumulating Treasury securities.
 In the words of Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, ''Hu's in charge here.''

HEADLINE: Pataki Puts His Terror Adviser Downtown

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he would appoint James K. Kallstrom, his senior adviser on counterterrorism, to oversee security at the former site of the World Trade Center, and that Stefan Pryor, a senior vice president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, would become its new president, replacing Kevin M. Rampe, who has resigned. 
 In a speech to the Association for a Better New York, Mr. Pataki took pains to portray the situation downtown as one that has moved from a dreaming and planning process to active construction. 
 The governor, who has been on the hot seat in recent weeks over the stalled progress at the site, said that a new design for the Freedom Tower would come out in a month, and that a design for the cultural building planned for the site would be revealed next week. 
 Mr. Pataki also stressed that work on the World Trade Center transportation hub and the demolition of the former Deutsche Bank would happen on schedule, and that he would try to win Goldman Sachs back downtown. The investment bank recently pulled back on its plans to build a new headquarters across the street from the site.
 ''Goldman, downtown is your home,'' Mr. Pataki said yesterday, directing his attention to a group of Goldman Sachs executives who had been placed at a table front and center before the governor's podium. ''You belong here.'' The executives sat stone faced and declined to applaud along with others in the room at less-well-placed tables.
 Goldman Sachs scrapped its plans to build a $2 billion tower when the state refused to back down from a plan to bury West Street-Route 9A in a tunnel with a mouth that would have opened at its doors. The state subsequently dropped the tunnel plan, which the governor had once embraced; yesterday he denounced it as expensive and time-consuming. 
 The governor also strongly hinted yesterday that the role of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation would shrink over the coming months, ceding power to other authorities and boards.
 For instance, Mr. Pataki announced the appointments of both Mr. Kallstrom and his chief of staff, John P. Cahill, who is charged with overseeing the entire development process, before mentioning Mr. Pryor's new job. Later, at a news conference, Mr. Pataki said he was not sure whether the state and city would fill the four open spots on the development agency's 12-member board, and added that it ''has always been viewed as an interim agency.'' 
 Almost in passing, the governor said for the first time that he supported a plan to build a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River, giving New Jersey commuters another way into Manhattan. 
 The remarks were greeted warmly. Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said it ''means that there is unequivocal bistate support for a project that could be the most important project the Port Authority has undertaken in a generation.'' Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey of New Jersey thanked Mr. Pataki for ''his support of this important regional transportation project.''
 Mr. Pataki stressed early in his speech that the Freedom Tower would be redesigned to incorporate security concerns raised for months by Police Department officials. ''I am pleased to announce that the N.Y.P.D. has reviewed the preliminary redesign and has determined that the building can be constructed in a manner that will provide the appropriate level of security,'' he said. 
 On Wednesday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly wrote in a letter to Larry A. Silverstein, the tower's developer, that ''the preliminary information shared with us indicates that the alterations currently under consideration'' would meet security standards, according to a spokesman for Mr. Kelly. 
 Mr. Pataki also announced a financial package for various components of the site, including $300 million for the memorial fund, $1 billion in Port Authority funds for a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport, and $70 million to restore the TriBeCa section of Hudson River Park. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, who spoke last week of a ''culture of inertia'' in Lower Manhattan, said in a telephone interview, ''I think there is now a sense of urgency, deadlines and getting the job done that there hasn't before.''

HEADLINE: Army's Top Recruiter Says 2006 May Be Biggest Test

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
The Army's top recruiter, already struggling to meet his quotas this year, said yesterday that 2006 would be even harder, and perhaps the toughest year for recruiting since the all-volunteer force began in 1973.
 Maj. Gen. Michael D. Rochelle, in a telephone interview, said the Army would most likely start its fiscal year this October with the smallest pool of recruits ready for boot camp in at least a decade. He said that by then, only 9.9 percent of the roughly 80,000 new active-duty soldiers the Army needs next year to replenish the ranks in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere were expected to be in the pipeline. 
 Normally, as the Army begins its recruiting year, it has a goal of having already-signed contracts with one in every three of the year's expected arrivals -- a cushion that helps recruiters through the slow winter months. But this year, the Army started with one in five, and if General Rochelle's prediction is correct, next year will begin with only one in 10. 
 The general said that prospect was ''not a bright picture'' and blamed a variety of factors, from the war in Iraq, to an improving economy, to family members and friends of applicants who he said often dissuade recruits from joining.
 ''The challenges we're now facing truly are America's challenge to address,'' he said.
 General Rochelle said he was still ''cautiously optimistic'' about meeting the current year's goal of 80,000 active-duty soldiers, even though the Army had recruited only 35,926 soldiers as of April 25, more than halfway through the fiscal year. 
 Most recruits, he said, typically enlist during the summer as new high school graduates make future plans. But some former Army recruiting officials and outside military analysts said the Army appeared to be entering what some of them call a ''death spiral,'' a cycle of shortfalls that can take years to overcome.
 Beth J. Asch, a senior economist specializing in military personnel at the RAND Corporation, a military-financed research organization, described the general's prediction as ''near disastrous.''
 She said the reduced pool of enlistees would force the Army's 7,500 recruiters, already struggling under intense pressure, to find applicants, verify that they are qualified and send them to boot camp in 30 days or fewer. In 2004, recruits typically waited 110 days to report to boot camp after signing up; as of March, that had dwindled to 50 days. 
 ''It's comparable to having no savings account,'' Ms. Asch said. ''They'll be living month to month.'' 
 In interviews over the past five months, recruiters have said they already feel rushed to push recruits to boot camp as quickly as possible. They said the accelerated pace often leads recruiters to overlook or illegally conceal psychological problems and police records that might make a recruit ineligible.
 Various forms of cheating, or breaking Army rules to enlist unqualified applicants, have been on the rise. Army statistics showed 325 closed cases of substantiated improprieties in 2004, up from 199 in 1999, the last year the annual active-duty recruitment goal was missed.
 The expected decline in the number of ready recruits at the beginning of next year could also waste military resources and limit combat strength, said some former recruiting officials. 
 ''This has ramifications and ripple effects throughout the entire Army,'' said Col. Greg Parlier, who oversaw the Army's internal recruiting strategy and research unit from 1998 to 2002 before retiring in 2003. 
 ''It means the training base becomes very inefficient because you have underused capacity -- a bunch of drill sergeants sitting around.''
 The last major recruiting shortfall, in the late 1990's, he said, forced 2 of the Army's 10 active divisions to be listed at the military's lowest level of combat readiness. He predicted that similar problems would occur if the recruiting lag continued.
 ''It means positions in combat units cannot be filled in a timely manner,'' he said. 
 In yesterday's interview, General Rochelle said that in addition to increased enlistment bonuses and a retooled advertising campaign, another incentive was introduced nationally on May 9. 
 That new incentive allows recruits to sign up for an eight-year program, earning a student loan repayment of up to $18,000 in return for 15 months of active duty and 24 months in the Reserve or National Guard. The remainder of the time could be spent in AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps.
 General Rochelle, who has overseen recruiting since 2002, also went into greater detail about the Army's plans for a one-day suspension of recruitment on May 20 so recruiters can be retrained in military ethics. He said that everyone in the Recruiting Command would view a video he produced that calls for strict adherence to the Army's core values, and the rules governing which tactics can and cannot be used to persuade someone to enlist. They will also have to join in discussions of ethical issues.
 The Army occasionally suspends recruiting after accidents to give safety training. But this would be the first time in at least two decades when a hiatus was called for ethics training. The unorthodox move is necessary, General Rochelle said, because news reports have highlighted violations at the lower levels of the command. 
 Allegations of abuses, including the recruitment of a mentally ill young man in Ohio and a recruiter in Houston who threatened to arrest an applicant if he failed to join, General Rochelle said, ''were flying just below my radar.''

HEADLINE: Huge Projects Look to Silver For Support

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Never have the fates of the city's two biggest developments -- a proposed $2.2 billion football stadium on the West Side and the downtown rebuilding effort -- been more intertwined than they are today.
 City and state officials are struggling to counter perceptions that plans to reconstruct the World Trade Center site are in disarray. The city is considering a package of tax breaks and cash incentives to lure companies to empty space in Lower Manhattan. And Gov. George E. Pataki said in a speech yesterday that he would work with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver on a new incentive program to lure out-of-state companies downtown. 
 But according to civic leaders, downtown landlords and political officials, the city's downtown effort has as much to do with the proposed 75,000-seat stadium for the Jets, and possibly the Olympics, as it does with rejuvenating the financial district.
 The linchpin of both developments is Mr. Silver, an outspoken advocate for his downtown district who holds a pivotal vote on the stadium when it faces its last political hurdle, possibly as early as Wednesday. Satisfying his concerns in Lower Manhattan, according to various officials, could soften his resistance to the stadium, the Bloomberg administration's highest priority, in the coming vote.
 For at least a month, talks have been held between Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and Mr. Silver over a package of tax breaks and rent subsidies to entice companies to Lower Manhattan, which continues to suffer from relatively high vacancy rates and the possible loss of a financial stalwart, Goldman Sachs.
 According to people familiar with the talks at City Hall, the two sides are at odds over some elements of the incentive package. Mr. Silver said he might issue his own proposal next week if the city did not move more quickly.
 Mr. Silver insisted that there was no linkage between commercial incentives for Lower Manhattan and his vote on the stadium, which, he said, has ''got to stand on its own.''
 He was furious last month when Goldman pulled back from plans to build a $2 billion headquarters downtown and began to look at Midtown locations, blaming City Hall for not attending to its concerns. 
 ''They're too focused on the West Side and they're losing sight of what's important downtown,'' Mr. Silver said of the Bloomberg and Pataki administrations at the time. ''The revitalization of downtown should be their No. 1 priority.''
 City officials say they hope that they can quickly address Mr. Silver's longstanding issues downtown and get his vote for the stadium project at the Wednesday meeting of the Public Authorities Control Board, which must approve the project before the Legislature can appropriate a $300 million subsidy for it. The governor and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, control the two other votes on the board, whose decisions must be unanimous.
 The mayor has said that the city's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games has no chance of success unless the board approves the project before the International Olympic Committee meets on July 6 to pick the host. 
 But both Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have said they see no reason to make a decision on the stadium before July. More recently, Mr. Silver said the board should not review the matter while there were outstanding legal challenges, which might not be resolved until June 2. People on both sides of the issue expect the stadium decision to be postponed.
 At this point, Mr. Silver said, ''the stadium does not make sense to me.'' He has raised questions about traffic congestion in the surrounding area on game days and has expressed concern that commercial development on the West Side could hurt rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
 With time running out on the stadium, Mr. Doctoroff, the architect of the city's Olympic bid, has intensified discussions with Mr. Silver about a downtown incentive program. Mr. Silver said he favored the elimination of the commercial rent tax and a sales tax abatement for companies that move downtown.
 Mr. Silver said he also wanted a cash subsidy for new commercial tenants based on the square footage they rented. It would resemble a now-expired federal program instituted after Sept. 11, 2001, that offered residential tenants cash to sign new leases downtown. According to several executives briefed by city officials, the Bloomberg administration is reluctant to put up as much money as Mr. Silver wants.
 Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for Mr. Doctoroff, said the talks were preliminary and were focused on the tools the city had available to make downtown more attractive.
 But even as the debate between city officials and Mr. Silver continues, some real estate brokers and civic leaders say that the problems downtown have less to do with money and tax breaks than with transportation, security and the inconvenience of working next to the trade center area.
 Rents are 35 percent cheaper downtown than uptown, brokers said. Despite getting $1 billion in tax-exempt Liberty Bonds, Goldman Sachs stepped back from plans to build a $2 billion headquarters downtown.
 ''It's not about money,'' said Bettina Damiani, project director of Good Jobs New York, an advocacy group. ''Companies don't base their location decisions on tax breaks and giveaways. Companies are concerned about safety, transportation and getting employees to and from work. Solve that and Lower Manhattan will bounce back.''
 Mr. Silver added: ''Money helps, too. That's what it's really about.''

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real-estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialouge with such pure love for the athletics of acting? (1:45). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a supsected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it too suffers from fundmental mistmatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winner (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, childs-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt,'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked.'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at East 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)

'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. Closing tomorrow at the Houseman. Reopening June 9 at the Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street. (Neil Genzlinger)

'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Genzlinger)

'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women (1:25). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR' Henry Adam's play starts out as a humorous, trenchant fable on how fear of terrorism can distort individual lives, not to say nations, but something mysterious happens after intermission: it mutates into a sitcom. The actors Ronny Jhutti and Mark McDonnell are very much worth watching, though. Part of Brits Off Broadway (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)

'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)

'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette)

* 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'LES BELLES SOEURS' There is a good John Waters movie hiding inside Michael Tremblay's all-woman play. This likable comedy about a New England woman who wins a million trading stamps wants to be a farce but is just a collection of observations searching for a shape (1:30). Center Stage NY, 48 West 21st Street, (212)330-8650, closing at Center Stage on Sunday. The production moves to the Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village for performances on May 21 and 22. (Anita Gates)

'CHANTECLER' A version of Edmond Rostand's fable about a rooster and his role in the cosmos, looks like a family show and bills itself as a family show, but it's pitched way over the heads of the age group that would most enjoy its colorful costumes. But Cory Einbinder, the director, manages to make a smattering of scenes memorable: a parade of mutant roosters; a ridiculous trio of toads (2:20). Teatro La Tea, at Clemente Soto Valez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, second floor, (212)353-3101. (Genzlinger)

'THE PURSUIT OF PERSEPHONE' A musical inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's college romance with Ginevra King, jams 26 songs into two and a half hours -- which feels even longer. The evening's most entertaining moments are the drag routines by the Triangle Club, a fraternity to which Fitzgerald belonged when he was at Princeton (2:30). Prospect Theater Company, at the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, (212)352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)

'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Margo Jefferson)

'PERSEUS' Performed in ancient Greek, ''Perseus'' tells the story of the son of Zeus who slew the serpent-headed Medusa and saved Andromeda from a sea monster. The production has the flamboyant pageantry and occasional ridiculousness of a low rent runway show (1:40). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, (212)475-7710, closing on Sunday. (Jason Zinoman)

'PRIVILEGE' Paul Weitz's delicate if uneven comedy examines the collateral damage sustained by the family of a disgraced titan of Wall Street. Humanizing a world normally glimpsed only it tabloid flashes, the play is also, and most memorably, a touching hymn to the sustaining bonds of fraternal affection. Conor Donovan and Harry Zittel are terrific as the sons of the fallen businessman (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, (212)246-4422, closing on Wednesday. (Isherwood)

'SISTERS, SUCH DEVOTED SISTERS' Mixing fact and fiction as the transvestite Bernice Hindley, the actor Russell Barr tells a dark and caustic tale of life on the underside in Edinburgh. He was funniest, though, when riffing on a collection of eccentrics from Bernice's -- and presumably his own -- family. Part of Brits Off Broadway (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Stevens)

'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' A lot of story and actors have been crammed into this musical version. Unfortunately, that seems to have left little room for other crucial ingredients, like panache (2:30). Wings, 154 Christopher Street, (212)627-2961, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes). A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)

'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)

'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali). A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)

* 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, 6 hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott)

'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish). This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes). A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of an extremely hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

'DOUBLE DARE' (not rated, 81 minutes). This new documentary about (stunt) women who like to roll cars, throw punches and jump from gaspingly tall heights is another reminder of how tough it is for the second sex to make it in Hollywood. (Dargis)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes). This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

* 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)

* 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes). Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)

'THE GIRL FROM MONDAY' (not rated, 84 minutes). Like so many science fiction fantasies, this deadpan comedy, which is ''Brave New World'' Lite, begins with a witty premise, then stumbles all over itself trying to tell a coherent, original story. (Holden)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes). In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)

* 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish). The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)

'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)

'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes). Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creepshow, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes). A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes). This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)

'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes). A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in for the filmmaker to do the same. (Dargis)

'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes). The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)

'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes). Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

* 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)

'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott)

* 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis)

'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (not rated, 99 minutes). Gregg Araki, one-time bad-boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a little league coach. Superb performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)

'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)

'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)

'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)

* '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean). A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)

* 'A TOUTE DE SUITE' (not rated, 96 minutes; in French). This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)

'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott)

'WALK ON WATER' (not rated, 104 minutes). The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Dana Stevens)

'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (not rated, 45 minutes). A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)

'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (ne O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)

Film Series

'FIRST NATIONS/FIRST FEATURES' (Through May 23) The Museum of Modern Art's 25-film showcase of the first films of directors from indigenous cultures around the world. This weekend's offerings include ''Pathfinder'' (1987) from Norway, the story of a Sami boy who witnesses his family's murder, and two Maori features from New Zealand: ''Te Rua'' (1991) and ''Mauri'' (1988). 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400; $10, $8 for 65+, $6 for students. (Anita Gates)

'ONCE UPON A TIME: SERGIO LEONE' (Today through May 22) A cold-blooded henchman and a nameless drifter? It must be Leone (1929-89), auteur of the so-called spaghetti western. BAM Cinematek begins its 10-day Leone tribute with Henry Fonda in ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' (1968) today and tomorrow, then Clint Eastwood in ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964) on Sunday. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100; $10. (Gates)

'PORGY AND BESS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image is screening the only existing 35-millimeter print of Otto Preminger's 1959 musical masterpiece about life on Catfish Row.

Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; $10, $7 for students, $6 for members, $5 for children and 65+. (Stevens)

'WELCOME DANGER' (Through May 17) Film Forum's four-week Harold Lloyd festival winds up with his 1929 comedy about a mild-mannered botanist helping track down a Chinatown drug lord. This was a huge hit as a talkie-silent hybrid, but Lloyd kept the original silent. This is it, in a new 35-millimeter restoration of that silent, unseen for 75 years. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

TREY ANASTASIO (Tonight and Tomorrow) This leader of the now defunct jam band Phish has spent recent down time joining proteges onstage and recording a stripped-down guitar album, ditching the studio filigree of his previous solo outing. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)485-1534, $38. (Laura Sinagra)

THE BRAVERY (Monday and Tuesday) Currently braving a bit of a backlash, this muscular band was New York's Next Big Post-Strokes thing until rumored ego issues provoked skepticism among downtown fans. Monday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $16.50. Tuesday at 9 p.m.,Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

BRITISH SEA POWER, FEIST (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Brighton band puts a dreamy spin on vaguely gothic new wave with its insistent baritone vocals and bright guitar lines. Onstage it favors military garb and vertiginous hats, suggesting the ominous human forest in ''Macbeth.'' 8:30 p.m. tomorrow, 8 p.m. Sunday, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, (212)533-2111, $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)

BRAVE OLD WORLD: 'SONGS OF THE LODZ GHETTO' (Tonight, Tomorrow and Sunday) This accomplished klezmer group theatrically melds street and cabaret songs from the wartime Poland's Lodz ghetto within the musical frames of original Brave Old World compositions. In Yiddish, with optional projected English subtitles. Friday and Saturday at 9 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 9 p.m., Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212)362-2590, $20. (Sinagra)

COLDPLAY (Tuesday) The piano-playing arena rock melodist Chris Martin brings themes of recent fatherhood to bear on his band's latest collection, which picks up the tempo a bit, but does not spawn a song to rival the band's timeless misfit cri de coeur, ''Yellow.'' Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)496-7070, tickets available through special arrangement on coldplay.com. (Sinagra)

* CRAZY TITCH, J2K, DJ CAMEO (Saturday) Another invasion from London's booming grime scene, this one led by the rowdy rhyme-spitter Crazy Titch; here's hoping the crowd is as manic as the performers. 11:30 p.m., Crash Mansion, 199 Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212)982-7767. $5 before 1 a.m. Sunday morning, $8 after. (Kelefa Sanneh)

THE CRYSTAL METHOD (Tomorrow) This duo specializes in loud, straightforward D.J. sets that aim to conjure up the raucous energy of hard rock. 10 p.m., Spirit, 530 W. 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)268-9477, $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sanneh)

LILY CUSHMAN CULHANE (Sunday) This singer-songwriter's tracks recall the trip-pop favored by wistful optimists like Dido and Jem. Her honeyed jazzy vocal technique sets her apart. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212)420-1466, $7. (Sinagra)

DONNA THE BUFFALO AND HACKENSAW BOYS (Tonight) Donna the Buffalo's good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country, also dipping into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $18. (Jon Pareles)

DOVES, MERCURY REV (Wednesday and Thursday) The Doves bring a rough ''Madchester'' dance pedigree to their sweeping guitar pop, making the trio's music slightly edgier than other big- room British acts like Coldplay. Enduring space-rockers Mercury Rev open. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $30.(Sinagra)

DR JOHN: 'ALL BY HISSELF' (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and May 20-21 and May 25-29) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. 8 p.m., except May 20-21 and May 27-29 when shows are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455, $50. (Pareles)

DOC WATSON (Wednesday) Doc Watson is the embodiment of a mountain-music heritage. He's an understated master of a rural repertory that spans blues, bluegrass, country and ragtime, and he's a flatpicking guitar whiz whose leads rush by like a pine-scented breeze. 7 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Pareles)

EL VEZ (Tomorrow) Most Elvis imitators are corny; El Vez is conceptual, merging Presleyana, Mexican-American in-jokes and bad puns to simultaneously honor and twist the Presley legacy. 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Pareles)

GANG OF FOUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) In a season of reunions, the legendary British post-punk sloganeers Gang of Four bring their angular dance-rock back onto a circuit rife with young imitators. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $25. (Sinagra)

* THE GOOD LIFE (Tonight) This band is the quieter project from singer-songwriter Tim Kasher (who also leads the knotty emo act Cursive); expect to hear hushed, densely written songs from the strong recent Good Life CD, ''Album of the Year'' (Saddle Creek), on which the pairings are even sadder than the splittings. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $14.(Sanneh)

PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK PRESENTS 'THE WALL' (Tonight and Tomorrow) Philadelphia's Paul Green and his real-life ''School of Rock'' are featured in the recent documentary ''Rock School'' (NewMarket). There the little shredders play Frank Zappa. Here they assay Pink Floyd's opus. 7 p.m., TriBeCa Rock Club, 16 Warren Street, (212)766-1070, $10. (Sinagra)

DAVID GRISMAN (Wednesday) Before phrases like ''new acoustic music'' or ''bluegrass revival'' were being bandied around, David Grisman was picking his mandolin in what he named ''dawg music,'' a perfectly noncommital moniker for string-band music that cheerfully picked its way through country, bluegrass, jazz, klezmer, Brazilian choros and whatever else Mr. Grisman finds engaging. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212)840-2824, $30 to $50. (Pareles)

GYPSY MUSIC OF ROMANIA: TARAF DE HAIDOUKS (Tomorrow) Hailing from the village of Clejani, Romania, this Roma music outfit showcases deft fiddle, accordion and cimbalom arrangements of whirlwind dance music and traditional ballads. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824, $25 to $40, college students with ID, $15.(Sinagra)

* NEIL HAMBURGER (Tonight) This meta-comedian, who bills himself as ''America's funnyman,'' excels when the audience hates him (or pretends to); tonight, he may well find himself face to face with a roomful of fans, armed only with repulsive punchlines, awkward silences, and an ill-fitting suit. Expect a magical night. 8 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733, $8. (Sanneh)

HEARTLESS BASTARDS (Wednesday) The southern Ohio singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom's primal yowl gets her compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. Her power trio's hungry stomp is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10.(Sinagra)

THE HOLD STEADY (Thursday) With smart swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $13 in advance $15 at the door. (Sinagra)

KASABIAN (Monday and Tuesday) Don't let their namesake, Charles Manson's getaway driver, fool you. The band's mix of classic rock and electronic music is perfectly harmless. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)

PETER MURPHY (Monday) This goth rock heartthrob and leader of 80's dark side pioneers Bauhaus has a cult audience that of late has followed him on forays into Middle Eastern sonics. His most recent record is a poppier bid. 11:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $35. (Sinagra)

THE PHARCYDE (Tonight) With the departure of the memorable potheads Slimkid and Fatlip, these California backpack rappers' goofy mid-90's charm waned well before the turn of the century. But the two founders, Imani and Bootie Brown, still release albums and will perfrom with a band late and off the beaten track. 11 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718)797-3007, $14. (Sinagra)

WILLY PORTER (Monday) An impressive purveyor of rapid-fingered acoustic guitar technique, Mr. Porter has developed a gentle vocal style that smartly softens what might otherwise seem overly crafty. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, $20. (Sinagra).

PURPLE CITY AND FRIENDS, THEODORE UNIT (Tomorrow) An offshoot of Cam'ron's Harlem's hip-op crew the Diplomats', Purple City performs material from its new record, along with the Ghostface Killah side project Theodore Unit and the Bed Stuy story-rapper Spec Booge. D.J. sets by the mix tape mavens DJ Mighty Mi and DJ Catchdubs. 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $12, $14 at the door. (Sinagra)

JOEY RAMONE BIRTHDAY BASH (Thursday) This annual event turns lingering grief over the 2001 death of the Ramones frontman into a kinetic celebration of the band's legacy. Guests include the younger punks like the Bouncing Souls as well as veterans like the Dictators' Andy Shernoff and Lunachick Theo. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, 212-777-6800, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)

SAMITE (Tomorrow) This Ugandan singer and storyteller surrounds his gentle voice with the twinkling intricacies of his kalimba (thumb piano), marimba or lintungu (lyre). 8 p.m. Satalla, 37 West 26th, (212)576-1155, Chelsea, $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (Thursday) The Boss made ''The Rising'' after the towers fell, beating the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer to the notion of reverse-collapse by four years. Mr. Springsteen's spare ''Devils and Dust'' (Sony) charts the way back down, meditating with other soul-searchers at the crossroads of humanism and religion. 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900, $75 and $85, sold out. (Sinagra)

STING (Tonight) This adult-contemporary pop superstar's most recent material continues to explore aging, romance and rich-guy guilt over lush world-music-inflected instrumentation. Joss Stone, the young English blues belter and current star of a summer Gap ad, opens. 8 p.m., Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $33 to $86. (Sinagra)

SUPAGROUP (Wednesday) Known for their raucous stage show, this AC/DC-loving Louisiana four-piece tears through its countrified punk and riff-raff metal repertory with the kind of abandon that more manicured garage bands lack. 10 p.m., Snitch, 59 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)727-7775, free. (Sinagra)

U2 (Tuesday and Wednesday) After 2000's thrilling ''All that You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) and the ''Vertigo'' tour itself focus on what humans can live without: namely ICBM's and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the vivid resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900, $51.50 to $167, sold out. (Sinagra)

VELVET REVOLVER (Tomorrow) Comparing the druggy baritone of the former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weilland to the feral howl of vintage Axl Rose is unfair. But even without Axl, the former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash and crew are still aces at groovy, scruffy metal. 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Pkwy., Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $65. (Sinagra)

YO LA TENGO: THE SOUNDS OF SCIENCE (Wednesday) The Hoboken indie-rock icons known for rendering both the quiet spaces and explosive pathos of committed love perform an original score to the short films of the oceanographer Jean Painleves. 8 p.m., Rose Theater at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)258-9800, $40. (Sinagra)

Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080. 5:30 p.m. Cover: $30, with a $10 minimum at a table. (Holden)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

JOHN ABERCROMBIE GROUP (Through tomorrow) With the lineup that accompanies him this week -- Mark Feldman on violin, Joey Baron on drums, Marc Johnson on bass -- Mr. Abercrombie, a guitarist, has made the recent albums, ''Cat 'n' Mouse'' and ''Class Trip,'' two of his best. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Ben Ratliff)

* JD ALLEN TRIO (Wednesday) A tenor saxophonist with an enigmatic, elegant and hard-driving style, putting an original spin on a Wayne Shorterish idiom. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934, no cover. (Ratliff)

PATRICIA BARBER (Through Sunday) A dry, smart, passionate and original singer-songwriter-pianist. Tonight and Sunday at 8 p.m., tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455, cover, $50 tonight and tomorrow, $35 Sunday, and a two-drink minimum all nights. (Ratliff)

* ANDY BISKIN'S GOLDBERG VARIATIONS (Through Sunday) That's Goldberg as in Rube Goldberg. Andy Biskin, a jazz clarinetist with a low-key sense of humor, composed a series of pieces around Goldberg's elaborately wacky inventions, and also animated the original drawings. So what you get is a dozen jazz tone poems scored for sextet, with film accompaniment, about how to grow hair on balding men or how to light a cigar in a speeding car. It's an all-ages piece of work, and kids are especially welcome at the matinee performances. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., and tomorrow and Sunday at noon, Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery at Bleecker, East Village, (212)614-0505, $15, $10 for children under 12. (Ratliff)

* PETER BROTZMANN CHICAGO TENTET (Wednesday) In the last decade, Peter Brotzmann, the German saxophonist, has become a father figure for American free-jazz musicians. His Tentet has a revolving cast but usually includes some of the cream of the Chicago scene (like the saxophonist Ken Vandermark); this week it also has musicians from Germany, Norway and Sweden. Its music is far from completely free, making shrewd use of conducting and arrangements -- a good thing for Mr. Brotzmann, whose bellowing tone could rip a hole in the wall. 8 and 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7501, $15. (Ratliff)

GERALD CLAYTON GROUP (Tomorrow) A young pianist, the son of the bassist John Clayton, here leads a band including some excellent musicians -- the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, the saxophonist Tim Warfield and the drummer Obed Calvaire. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063, $15. (Ratliff)

JACK DEJOHNETTE WITH FODAY MUSA SUSO AND JEROME HARRIS (Tonight) Mr. DeJohnette, one of the great jazz drummers to come along since the 1960's, collaborates with the Gambian kora player Foday Musa Suso; they'll play music from a new album, ''Music From the Hearts of the Masters,'' released on Mr. DeJohnette's own label, Golden Beams. 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, cover, $25. (Ratliff)

* MARTY EHRLICH'S DARK WOODS FIVE (Wednesday) One of the saxophonist/clarinetist Mr. Ehrlich's best-sounding groups, comprised of all-wood instruments: Mark Feldman on violin, Erik Friedlander on cello, Alan Jaffe on guitar and Mark Helias on bass. 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 9th Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177, $8. (Ratliff)

* 'ESSENTIALLY ELLINGTON' CONCERT (Sunday) By the time you get to Avery Fisher Hall, 15 high school jazz bands have been through semifinals, playing Ellington before eminent judges to earn a spot among the top three that you'll hear in concert. The ''Essentially Ellington'' international high school jazz-band contest, produced and organized by Jazz at Lincoln Center -- this is the 10th annual -- is designed to be fun to watch, and it's also a reliable indicator of just how good the next crop of professional jazz musicians will be. 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, 65th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)721-6500, $20. (Ratliff)

CURTIS FULLER QUINTET (Through tomorrow) The trombonist formerly from Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers still soulfully showing how it's done. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7000 , cover, $20. (Ratliff)

BENNY GOLSON QUARTET (Through tomorrow) The tenor saxophonist Mr. Golson, in his mid-70's, is an unlikely jazz hero: upbeat, fascinated with technique, a nonpurist who has spent equal time among the different aesthetic dispositions of East and West Coast jazz. 9, 11 and 12:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662, cover, $25. (Ratliff)

ANDREW HILL 'RETRO' QUARTET (Wednesday and Thursday) The pianist Andrew Hill is one of the most mysterious composers of modern jazz, not just for his fraught harmonies and layered rhythms but for his periodic disappearances from the scene. But he's come back over the last decade, leading a number of bands; this is a quartet with the saxophonist Greg Tardy, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Leroi Jones. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30. (Ratliff)

BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Hutcherson is one of the great individual voices and better composers in jazz, and he's a vibraphonist, making him triply rare. After 40 years, he still sounds current. The band includes pianist Mike LeDonne, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. 9 and 11 p.m. Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037, cover, $30. (Ratliff)

JUILLIARD JAZZ ORCHESTRA: 'CELEBRATING ELLINGTON' (Through Sunday) A band featuring students in Juilliard's Institute for Jazz Studies, conducted by Victor Goines and featuring the singer Vanessa Rubin and the saxophonist Frank Wess. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 5th Floor, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)258-9800, cover, $30. (Ratliff)

BIRELI LAGRENE'S MUSIC OF DJANGO REINHARDT (Through Sunday) Mr. Lagrene, a Sinti Gypsy like Django Reinhardt and one of the most talented guitarists to have adopted his style, is a more sensitive, temperate musician than many of his fellow Djangophiles; this is his sextet. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8, 10 and 11:30; Sunday at 8 and 10. Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212)582-2121, cover, $32.50, today and Sunday, $35 tomorrow, with a $10 minimum. (Ratliff)

* LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PLAYS THAD JONES (Thursday) The trumpeter and composer Thad Jones, who died in 1986, always deserves a second look. A member of Count Basie's orchestra during the 1950's and early 60's, he decamped to form his own big band which played weekly shows at the Village Vanguard, starting a new large-ensemble jazz tradition. Jazz at Lincoln Center's gleaming band takes on his music, with the saxophonists Jerry Dodgion and Billy Harper and the bass trombonist Douglas Purviance, as guests; Vincent Gardner, one of Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's trombonists, presents new arrangements of the old tunes. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)721-6500. $30 to $150. (Ratliff)

JOE LOVANO WITH MULGREW MILER, GEORGE MRAZ, PAUL MOTIAN: MUSIC OF THAD JONES (Tuesday through Thursday) It's the fascinating band from Mr. Lovano's last two albums, with the pianist Mulgrew Miller subbing for Hank Jones. They're playing Thad Jones pieces all week (there are some on Mr. Lovano's new album ''Joyous Encounter''), stylistically rolling the last 50 years of jazz history around. 7:30 and 9:30, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)258-9800, cover, $30. (Ratliff)

BILL McHENRY TRIO (Tuesday) Like players decades ago, the tenor saxophonist Mr. McHenry puts his big, round sound before anything else; he likes playing slowly and choosing his moves, guided compositionally by Ornette Coleman and emotionally by Don Byas. 9:30 p.m., Nublu, 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, East Village, www.nublu.net, cover, $5. (Ratliff)

MISHA MENGELBERG (Through Sunday) The legendary Dutch jazz pianist, a practitioner of wise mischief, in a series of collaborations. Tonight with Frances-Marie Uitti and Ikue Mori; tomorrow with Mark Feldman; Sunday with John Zorn. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C at 2nd Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com, $15. (Ratliff)

* BEN MONDER QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) Ben Monder has played nearly unsurpassable modern jazz guitar with any number of actual jazz groups. But what he plays in his own group comes from another planet: it is exploratory, meditative, and a little eerie, with Theo Bleckman often singing wordlessly on top of the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, (212)576-2232, cover, $20. (Ratliff)

ROY NATHANSON QUARTET (Sunday) The saxophonist Mr. Nathanson was always the principal composer of the long-running band the Jazz Passengers, and his pieces often included bits of jokes and stories; here, with a band including the violinist Sam Bardfeld, the bassist Tim Kaya and the drummer Gerald Cleaver, he's focusing on new pieces that more deeply combine spoken narratives with music. 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177, $8. (Ratliff)

STEVE NELSON QUARTET (Through tomorrow) One of New York's best jazz musicians for a long time now, and one of the best parts of Dave Holland's quintet, Mr. Nelson brings his own band to the stage, with the pianist Mulgrew Miller, the bassist Robert Hurst and the drummer Lewis Nash. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-3626, cover, $20. (Ratliff)

OREGON (Wednesday and Thursday) Celtic music, jazz, swing and classical guitar get all mixed up in the music of Oregon, a band that's been around since 1970. The band rarely comes around anymore, and the lineup is as it has been, more or less, for ages: Ralph Towner on guitar, Paul McCandless on oboe, Glen Moore on bass, Mark Walker on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, Midtown, (212)582-2121, cover, $27.50. (Ratliff)

GRETCHEN PARLATO (Monday) The jazz singer Ms. Parlato is a newcomer of great promise: in standards, bossa novas and originals, through long tones and subtle inflections of rhythm, she deeply enters the musical field of her band. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, cover, $15. (Ratliff)

(Ratliff)

TIM RIES'S THE STONES PROJECT (Through Sunday) Having toured twice as tenor saxophonist with the Rolling Stones, Mr. Ries has put together an album, ''The Stones Project,'' with a revolving crew of musicians including Charlie Watts, Keith Richards and Ron Wood.

(Ratliff)

JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) The violinist Ms. Scheinman has made some eclectic and carefully composed records. But as these more low-key weekly gigs prove, at bottom she's a killer player, with the street musician's trick of getting attention by the power of the single, perfect note. Next week she appears with the guitarist Adam Levy. 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177 , $8. (Ratliff)

VISION CLUB: CHARLES WATERS' GOLD SPARKLE TRIO/MARTY EHRLICH (Tomorrow) The Gold Sparkle Band has been in New York since the late 80's; it channels the East Coast jazz avant-garde of the mid-1960's. Mr. Ehrlich, one of the musicians who bridged the avant-garde with the jazz tradition in the 70's and 80's, is always exploring a worthwhile avenue with a different band.

Gold Sparkle at 9:30 p.m., Mr. Ehrlich at 11 p.m. Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)696-6681 or www.visionfestival.org, $15. (Ratliff)

Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Tonight and Tomorrow) Impressive endurance, at the very least, is a hallmark of the Bronx Opera, which for 36 seasons has been offering young professionals in fully staged opera productions, on a minimal budget, with occasionally pleasing results. 8 p.m., Lovinger Theater, Lehman College, Bedford Park Boulevard West and Goulden Avenue, in the Bronx, (718)960-8833, $15 to $30.

'FAUST' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In a revelatory performance, James Levine cuts through the hokum of Gounod's ''Faust'' and captures the music's dignity and elegance. And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially Rene Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the Met's new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble. Though the conductor Steven Crawford takes over for tomorrow evening's performance, Mr. Levine returns on Wednesday. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $145 and $215 remaining tomorrow, sold out on Wednesday but returns may be available. (Anthony Tommasini)

'LOST CHILDHOOD' (Wednesday) Yehuda Nir's harrowing Holocaust memoir makes a strange choice for an opera, but Janice Hamer, a composer, and Mary Azrael, a librettist, have made it into one, and the results may be powerful. 7:30 p.m., Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (646)505-4445, $20. (Allan Kozinn)

'TOSCA' (Monday and Thursday) For some, the draw is Franco Zeffirelli's lavish and historically authentic production. For others, the main attraction comes on Thursday, when the soprano Aprile Millo makes one of her now-rare Metropolitan Opera appearances in the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above), $26 to $170. (Midgette)

(Kozinn)

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., St. Malachy's Church, 239 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, $20. (Eichler)

CERDDORION (Sunday) The vocal ensemble celebrates its 10th anniversary with a program of the very early (Josquin, Monteverdi) and the very new, including works it commissioned in the past year and a new piece by David Lang. 7:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $25, $50 for a VIP ticket including a post-concert reception.

SARAH CONNOLLY (Monday) If this recital is anything like as good as her New York recital debut three years ago, one should run, not walk, to hear this fine British mezzo present a program that ranges from Haydn, Brahms and Reynaldo Hahn to Korngold and Kurt Weill. 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $32.

EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow) Maybe period instrument groups have been devoting too much thought to timbre and too little to sex: in the quest for greater authenticity, Frederick Renz has assembled an all-woman orchestra to play works Vivaldi wrote for the young ladies in his charge at Ospedale della Pieta, in Venice. 8 p.m., St. James Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212)280-0330, $35. (Kozinn)

The new comes with the actual commencement the next morning, ushering in celebrations of the school's centenary. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406, free but tickets are required. (Oestreich)

MADAME VERA GALUPE-BORSZKH (Tonight and Tomorrow) You don't have to love opera to roar with laughter at Madame Vera, although the diva (by day, the director and voice coach Ira Siff) would frown at a term as crass as ''spoof'' for her brilliant send-ups of the singer's art. 8 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212)864-5400, $30, $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)

ANTON NEL (Wednesday) At his recital debut, in the late 1980's, this pianist was polished if interpretively predictable, but encounters since then suggest that he has grown considerably. Here he tackles a hefty program that runs from Mozart to John Corigliano. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $15. (Kozinn)

NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Neeme Jarvi, who takes over as music director next season, ends this one with a program of Beethoven's Triple Concerto (with the Eroica Trio) and Mahler's Fourth Symphony. 8 p.m., State Theater, New Brunswick, N.J., (800)255-3476, $24 to $82. (Oestreich)

Judith Clurman is the artistic director. 7:30 p.m., Lexington Avenue at 55th Street, (212)868-4444, $20 and $30. (Oestreich)

QUEEN'S CHAMBER BAND (Tuesday) An early-music group goes mostly modern, with premieres by Jose Bernardo, Robert Baska, Marshall Coid, Ray Bono and Joseph Fennimore. And oh, yes, there's Bach, from ''The Art of Fugue.'' 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $25, with half price for students and 65+. (Oestreich)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 5 West 53rd Street (212)265-1040. (Grace Glueck)

* ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.'' (Holland Cotter)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. Also at the design museum: ''Hella Jongerius Selects: Works From the Permanent Collection.'' 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Michael Kimmelman)

* SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Nunez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquin Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)

MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST,' through May 29. Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Kimmelman)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. (See above.) (Smith)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Smith)

THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944.8639. (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24.

(Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

* JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to five minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through May 28. (Johnson)

Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212)865-0783, through May 22. (Smith)

* 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery,125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)

* RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)

Galleries: SoHo

JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212)925-4338, through May 21. (Smith)

* '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLINT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith)

DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the hand-made and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)

'COLLAGE: SIGNS AND SURFACES' Joseph Cornell, Romare Beardon, Jess, Robert Rauschenberg and other big names in collage history are on hand for this show of works by more than 70 artists. But many of the most intriguing works are by lesser knowns, like Arch Connelly's pearl-encrusted ''Self Portrait'' and Michael Cooper's ''16 Yellow Things,'' a gridded arrangement of a ticket stub, a Lego block and 14 other small, more or less yellow items. Pavel Zoubok, 533 West 23rd Street, (212)675-7490, through May 21. (Johnson)

IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child-star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)

WILL DUTY Mr. Duty uses a computer and scanned photographs to generate subtle, flickering compositions of stars, bars and flames, but he translates the imagery by hand and pencil onto paper, to dense, richly sensuous effect. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, through May 21. (Johnson)

ANDRE ETHIER A young Canadian artist makes his debut with small macabre paintings that are tender of touch and hot of color and suggest fairy tales gone wrong. Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, (212)206-6411, through May 21. (Smith)

ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)

JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212)352-2238, through May 27. (Johnson)

'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith)

NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree braches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)

JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing, animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers.

Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)

* AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock-coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)

Last Chance

'CAN I GET A WITNESS' This tough little group show has a casual, camped-out feel and polymorphous themes, touching on childhood, gender roles and spiritual queasiness, neo-existential as well as evangelical.

SEYMOUR LIPTON: 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST SCULPTOR' His Ab Ex luster dimmed with the arrival of Minimalism, but Lipton (1903-86) vigorously explored his basic theme of humanity and its spiritual challenges until his last years.

HEADLINE: Supermom Is a Bargain

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''The Economic Unit Called Supermom'' (Week in Review, May 8), an effort is made to put a money value on the work of Supermom. 
 One part of her unpaid salary should be easy to calculate. When she is working at the book fair, the plant sale, the frozen food sale or in filling out order forms for wrapping paper, candles and other fund-raising sales, only part of her time is work for the school. Some of her time, and in some cases, most of her time, she is working for free for companies that make profits from these sales. 
 Schools get only a percentage of the money made in these sales, and when Supermom thinks she is devoting her time to the school, she is actually helping the companies make more money. This becomes clear when you learn about the incentives that companies give her and her kids -- free books, T-shirts -- and compare that with how much was sold. I am sure the cost to the companies is much less than paying Supermom for her work time.

HEADLINE: Scholarly Exchange Should Be Protected

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Professors in Britain Vote to Boycott 2 Israeli Schools'' (news article, May 8):
 The American Association of University Professors strongly objects to the resolution passed by the British Association of University Teachers and calls for its repeal. 
 We defend the free exchange of ideas among academics without regard for government policies. We have taken this position with respect to boycotts of South African universities under apartheid and toward Cuban faculty exchanges since the United States imposed an economic embargo. 
 Scholars must be free to work with one another across national boundaries. Academic associations and governments shouldn't use political or ideological litmus tests to block scholarly exchanges. 
 We have formally asked the British University Teachers Association to rescind its resolution boycotting Haifa University and Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

HEADLINE: 'The Calamari Wrestler'

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:

Opens today in Manhattan
Directed by Minoru Kawasaki
In Japanese, with English subtitles
Not rated, 95 minutes
 When Koji Taguchi (Akira) wins a championship wrestling match, his delight is cut short by the intervention of a giant squid (a rubber-clad Osamu Nishimura), whose slithering tentacle swipes the Championship Belt. The remaining nine appendages proceed to whip Mr. Taguchi into stunned submission as hysterical announcers explain why his signature reverse-inverted full nelson is useless against slippery cephalopods. Meanwhile, Mr. Taguchi's fiancee, Miyako (Kana Ishida), is wondering why the squid wrestler is making her heart rate rise to an alarming level.
 Goofy, bizarre, yet surprisingly coherent, ''The Calamari Wrestler'' veils sharp social commentary with irreverent humor and corny romance. The production values are erratic, the acting barely adequate, and the effects more cheesy than special -- somewhere between ''The Muppets'' and ''Godzilla'' -- but the film possesses a good-natured charm.
 ''I can't love a squid! How will he support me?'' Miyako wails to her eye-rolling sister, while the source of her angst perfects his wrestling moves at the Monhonji Temple. The local monks have devised a novel (and obviously psychic) training regimen, highlighted by a firm whack on the head whenever their client drifts into a soft-focus daydream of himself entangled with a naked Miyako. ''If you relapse into desires, ailments will return,'' the monks warn. He's a man trapped in a squid's body -- how much worse could his health become? 
 ''The Calamari Wrestler'' draws a convincing parallel between the anxieties of post-World War II Japan and what the film calls the ''utter chaos'' of the country today. Minoru Kawasaki, the director, and Masakazu Migita, who wrote the screenplay from Mr. Kawasaki's original story, have staged a sneaky critique of Japan's declining economy and low public morale with a narrative that centers on flagging national spirit. With refreshing directness, the filmmakers also take aim at the hive culture of corporate Japan, and the subversive urge to break free.
 The squid wrestler may be all too obviously a man in a rubber suit, but he's also an individual whose appearance ultimately emboldens others. And as the cast of characters swells to include a wrestling octopus and a boxing insect, the message is clear: individualism in Japan may require serious physical transformation.

HEADLINE: Always Low Wages. Always

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week Standard and Poor's, a bond rating agency, downgraded both Ford and General Motors bonds to junk status. That is, it sees a significant risk that the companies won't be able to pay their debts. 
 Don't cry for the bondholders, but do cry for the workers. 
 Standard and Poor's downgraded G.M. and Ford sooner rather than later because it believes that the public is losing interest in S.U.V.'s. But the companies were vulnerable because they still pay decent wages and offer good benefits, in an age when taking care of employees has gone out of style. In particular, they are weighed down by health care costs for current and retired workers, which run to about $1,500 per vehicle at G.M. 
 So the downgrade was a reminder of how far we have come from the days when hard-working Americans could count on a reasonable degree of economic security.
 In 1968, when General Motors was a widely emulated icon of American business, many of its workers were lifetime employees. On average, they earned about $29,000 a year in today's dollars, a solidly middle-class income at the time. They also had generous health and retirement benefits. 
 Since then, America has grown much richer, but American workers have become far less secure. 
 Today, Wal-Mart is America's largest corporation. Like G.M. in its prime, it has become a widely emulated business icon. But there the resemblance ends. 
 The average full-time Wal-Mart employee is paid only about $17,000 a year. The company's health care plan covers fewer than half of its workers. 
 True, not everyone is badly paid. In 1968, the head of General Motors received about $4 million in today's dollars -- and that was considered extravagant. But last year Scott Lee Jr., Wal-Mart's chief executive, was paid $17.5 million. That is, every two weeks Mr. Lee was paid about as much as his average employee will earn in a lifetime. 
 Not that many of them will actually spend a lifetime at Wal-Mart: more than 40 percent of the company's workers leave every year.
 I'm not trying either to romanticize the General Motors of yore or to portray Wal-Mart as the root of all evil. GM was, and Wal-Mart is, a product of its time. And there's no easy way to reverse the changes.
 What should be clear, however, is that the public safety net F.D.R. and L.B.J. created is more important than ever, now that workers in the world's richest nation can no longer count on the private sector to provide them with economic security. 
 When they reach 65, most Wal-Mart employees will rely heavily on Social Security -- if the privatizers don't kill it. And many Wal-Mart employees already rely on Medicaid to pay for health care, especially for their children.
 Indeed, a growing number of working Americans have turned to Medicaid. As the Kaiser Family Foundation points out, that's why children have for the most part retained health coverage, despite a sharp decline in employer-based health insurance since 2000. 
 Yet our current political leaders are trying to privatize Social Security and reduce benefits. And they are slashing funds for Medicaid even as they give big tax cuts to people like Mr. Lee.
 The attack on the safety net is motivated by ideology, not popular demand. The public isn't taken with the vision of an ''ownership society''; it seems to want more, not less, social insurance. According to a poll cited in a recent Business Week article titled ''Safety Net Nation,'' 67 percent of Americans think we should guarantee health care to all citizens; just 27 percent disagree. 
 The question is whether the public's desire for a stronger safety net will finally be seconded by corporations that haven't yet adopted the Wal-Mart model of minimal benefits and always low wages. 
 Last year Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s chief executive, gave a speech about the costs of America's ''Kafkaesque'' health care system that sounded a lot like my recent columns. And his company has made it clear that it likes Canada's system: in 2002 the president of General Motors of Canada and the head of the Canadian Auto Workers signed a joint letter declaring that ''it is vitally important that the publicly funded health care system be preserved and renewed.''
 But according to The Journal Register News Service, which covered Mr. Wagoner's speech, he ''stressed later to reporters that he was not proposing a national health care plan.'' Why not?

HEADLINE: Charges Fly After a Plan to Bring Video to 100 Million Falls Through

BYLINE: By LOWELL BERGMAN; Jeff Kearns, Helene Blatter and Yi Jia contributed reporting from Berkeley, Calif., for this article.

 BODY:
Jianping Qu was 35 years old when he arrived in the United States a decade ago, a veteran of the rough and tumble of China's marketplace. He has said he left after allegations of fraud in a real estate deal led to a 90-day ''detention'' by the authorities in Shanghai.
 By 2004, Mr. Qu (pronounced Chu) was a wealthy man. He had accumulated at least $100 million in cash in his personal accounts and another $300 million in the accounts of his Silicon Valley companies, in which he is both the dominant shareholder and chief executive. In a court filing in his divorce in 2003, Mr. Qu gave his annual salary as $40.1 million, making him one of the highest-paid chief executives in America. 
 But his only major partner and customer, New World Development, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate based in Hong Kong, now accuses Mr. Qu and his company of defrauding it of $700 million for a system that never worked. Mr. Qu counters that New World never held up its end of the deal to gain the full approval of the Chinese authorities for his technology. 
 The first of a series of court cases is set to go to trial next month in California. It will be the first time, experts say, that allegations on this scale of fraud and misappropriation of funds involving China's exploding economy will be presented in a United States courtroom. The bitter dispute also raises the issue of whether the scramble to cash in on the vast economy in China has blinded some companies to the business risks. 
 New World, whose stock fell sharply after it announced last year that its $700 million investment was worthless, says it paid Mr. Qu and his company, PrediWave of Fremont, Calif., to deliver a system that would provide interactive video services, like video on demand, to 100 million cable subscribers in China. What made PrediWave's system so attractive to New World was that it did not require a two-way cable system. Rewiring in the United States cost more than $100 billion. PrediWave said it could provide the same service over the basic one-way cable prevalent in China and most of the developing world.
 From the beginning of the partnership, said Dennis Ellis of the Los Angeles law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, New World's spokesman and lead counsel in the United States, Mr. Qu was engaged in ''looting'' New World's investment, duping the company into believing he would provide it with a commercially viable system. ''We were defrauded,'' Mr. Ellis said. 
 Mr. Qu, who is known as Tony, declined repeated requests for an interview made through his lawyer and PrediWave's general counsel, Vincent Lin. Mr. Lin said that Mr. Qu had been ''traveling in Asia'' for much of the last year ''trying to recoup his reputation in the business community.''
 Mr. Lin, who works out of PrediWave's mostly abandoned headquarters, insisted that the company and Mr. Qu were victims of a ruthless decision by New World to cut them out of ''the billions that can be made in China'' in favor of a more politically acceptable partner.
 A crucial element in the case is the role of the managing director of New World's technology subsidiary, Douglas Chan Wing-tak, who made the deal with PrediWave and appears to have approved all the spending on the company and Mr. Qu. In e-mail messages obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Chan urges Mr. Qu to accept cash bonuses of up to $38 million. Just before the deal unraveled in April of last year, Mr. Chan called on Mr. Qu to accept another $25 million bonus, writing: ''I feel very strongly on this. As the captain of our 'ship,' you are worth every penny of it.''
 Mr. Chan was forced to resign last summer. He did not return phone calls or messages left with his lawyers in Hong Kong.
 Even Mr. Ellis conceded that the technology had the ''promise'' of revolutionizing the cable industry in developing countries like China.
 In a traditional two-way system, using what is known as ''true video on demand,'' or V.O.D., the customer, through a set-top box, signals the supplier to deliver a movie or other programming, using one path to order and another to receive. Even with a two-way system, the delivery can be bogged down when many customers order the same programming at the same time. 
 PrediWave, relying on its own technology, claims to have solved both the problem of having one pathway and the potential for jamming of the pipeline. This is accomplished, the company says, through continuously broadcasting bursts of electronic data in a compressed format. 
 To market a technology like the PrediWave system in China requires approvals from regional governments as well as the central authorities in Beijing. New World was equipped to gain the required approvals. 
 After the government put down pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989, New World rushed in to invest in the country, passing other companies on their way out. That led to a valuable network of high-level political connections. Today, New World operates everything from bridges to electric power plants in China. In Hong Kong, its hometown, the company moves hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong commuters every day on its bus lines and ferries to office towers, including some it owns. 
 The founder and chairman of New World, Cheng Yu-tung, 79, is a school dropout who turned a jewelry store and a few smart investments in real estate and gold into a fortune now worth an estimated $2.7 billion. Mr. Cheng's son, Henry Cheng Kar-shun, is New World's chief executive. He, in turn, chose his college friend, Mr. Chan, to run New World TMT, the technology and telecommunications subsidiary. Mr. Chan had already made hundreds of millions of dollars for New World in a major Internet investment before he discovered Mr. Qu. 
 Impressed with the demonstrations of the PrediWave system by Mr. Qu and his engineers, Mr. Chan signed an agreement with the company in April 2000 and committed over $100 million the first year. 
 In an e-mail message sent after that initial investment, Mr. Chan told Mr. Qu that China was the first step in a plan to ''secure a beachhead in the fight to dominate the global V.O.D. market.'' And Mr. Chan assured PrediWave that all the approvals in China would be forthcoming through ''good friends at the appropriate levels in the Chinese government, based on friendship over the years.''
 As late as January 2004, Mr. Cheng, the New World chairman, accompanied by Mr. Chan, visited Mr. Qu at his headquarters. Mr. Cheng and his son declined to be interviewed. 
 Mr. Lin points to that 2004 visit and a sheaf of documents as proof that the bonuses and perks given Mr. Qu were approved by New World executives. 
 Mr. Ellis maintains that Mr. Chan approved the bonuses without ''the knowledge or authorization of New World.'' 
 Asked why bonuses were paid when the PrediWave system had not produced any revenue, Mr. Ellis theorized that Mr. Qu ''somehow corrupted and somehow compromised officials of New World'' while scheming to create board resolutions and documents because ''he knew the day this started'' that litigation would come. 
 But, Mr. Ellis added, there was no evidence that Mr. Chan profited personally. Mr. Ellis described Mr. Chan as a ''gambler'' who ''got in over his head,'' adding, ''If you are a gambler, you keep doubling your bet because it's the only way out of it.'' As to a business plan, Mr. Ellis said that it was ''in many ways a handshake deal.''
 While an American judge has ordered Mr. Chan to give a deposition, his lawyers in Hong Kong say this is ''new legal territory'' and are not sure whether he will testify. 
 Mr. Ellis said that it was only after the deal collapsed that investigators working for the company learned that Mr. Qu had not only been detained in Shanghai in 1994, but that there was also an outstanding detention order on file as well as a judgment for about $90,000.
 Mr. Lin scoffs at the charges and then notes that documents that look official can be bought in China. To bolster his case, he points to documents Mr. Qu has filed in court from what appears to be a Chinese government agency that states that he has no criminal record. The documents were also submitted to the United States government, according to Mr. Lin, before Mr. Qu was granted citizenship last August.
 Mr. Lin insisted that New World would ''look foolish'' in the forthcoming trials because the PrediWave system was demonstrated successfully in China. He cited tests in Fujian as well as other provinces, and pointed to a Web site for Fujian Cable TVNet Service Company, which currently advertises the PrediWave system and service. 
 An operator for Fujian said the PrediWave system complete with set-top box was available for about $9 a month, providing six V.O.D. channels with movies and sports as well as 14 digital channels. The service has been offered since October 2002, the representative said. 
 But pirated DVD's of first-run movies are readily available in China for a dollar a copy, making a video-on-demand system that would cost several times that a month less attractive. The chief technical supervisor of the Fujian cable system, Hu Bufa, said the PrediWave system worked well in demonstrations. ''I think PrediWave's technology is a breakthrough,'' he said. But, in practice, he said, the quality of the set-top boxes and other gear was poor. 
 In addition, he said, the failure of the central government to adopt a format that works best with the PrediWave technology limits its commercial viability, although he acknowledged that a thousand boxes are in use.
 While Mr. Ellis acknowledged that the PrediWave system appeared to work well in trials, he insisted that it was Mr. Qu's responsibility to make the system work in the marketplace. 
 As to Mr. Lin's fear that his former partner would find a new politically connected partner, Mr. Ellis confirmed that New World had an active partnership with the government-owned China Aerospace to provide ''interactive satellite services.'' But Mr. Ellis said that deal would not include the PrediWave technology. 
 Mr. Lin defends the $100 million or more in bonuses and perks for Mr. Qu as justified because of Mr. Qu's dedication to his work, the sacrifice to his health and family and a desire by New World to retain his services. 
 Mr. Qu is to return to the United States and testify in a pretrial deposition in San Francisco on Monday.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on May 13 about the legal battle over $700 million invested in PrediWave, a Silicon Valley company, by New World Development, a company based in Hong Kong, misstated the reason for the 90-day detention of Jianping Qu, PrediWave's founder, in Shanghai. According to documents provided by lawyers for PrediWave and Mr. Qu after the article was published, he was detained because of a fight that broke out between his staff and a client at his real estate office, not because of fraud allegations. While he was accused of fraud in another business deal, that case was later dismissed.

HEADLINE: House Releases Iraqi Papers On Strategy for Oil Sales

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER and CRAIG S. SMITH; Judith Miller reported from New York for this article and Craig S. Smith from Paris. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
A House committee yesterday disclosed Iraqi documents that it said provided new information on what has long been seen as a campaign by Saddam Hussein to secure international support at the Security Council in exchange for lucrative oil contracts under the United Nations oil-for-food program. 
 The documents, released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in advance of hearings planned for Monday, showed that Iraqi intelligence officials focused on French and Russian officials as part of what the Iraqi memos and letters described as a deliberate strategy to overcome sanctions and create divisions on the Security Council. 
 As the new details were released in Washington, two politicians from France and Britain reacted angrily to renewed accusations that they took bribes from Mr. Hussein's government. 
 In London, George Galloway, a British legislator who had met at least twice with Mr. Hussein, most recently in 2002, said he would testify in Washington before a Senate subcommittee, which on Wednesday said he had received the rights to buy millions of barrels of Iraqi oil. 
 In Paris, Charles Pasqua, a French senator and former interior minister, said ''there's nothing new in this report,'' and suggested that the repetition of statements implicating him was politically motivated.
 The investigations by the House and Senate panels are among several inquiries into the oil-for-food program, under which Mr. Hussein's government was allowed to sell some oil, despite United Nations sanctions, in order to buy food, medicines and other necessities. 
 The documents from the Iraqi Intelligence Service released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee also listed French and Russian individuals, companies and political parties that the Iraqi agency said were sympathetic to Iraq and powerful enough to advance its interests. One memo stated that while an Iraqi official offered financial assistance to the re-election campaign of President Jacques Chirac of France, the offer was rejected.
 According to one of the documents, Mr. Hussein personally ''ordered the improvement of dealing with France'' in early 2002. A memo dated May 6, 2002, described a reported meeting between an unnamed Iraqi intelligence official and Roselyn Bachelot, whom the memo described as a French parliamentarian and ''official spokeswoman'' for Mr. Chirac's re-election campaign.
 The memo stated that Ms. Bachelot noted that ''the subject of Iraq will be the first in the priorities and concerns of French politics on the condition that Mr. Chirac wins.'' It also stated that Ms. Bachelot assured the agent that France would ''use the right opposition (veto) within the Security Council against any American decision regarding the attack on Iraq,'' and would ''work throughout the upcoming period to lift sanctions.'' The Iraqi agent, for his part, conveyed to Ms. Bachelot that ''Iraq is prepared to offer financial support to Chirac, for his election campaign.'' The memo said a campaign officer later ''expressed gratitude'' then added, ''(but he apologized) because they do not require the money.''
 Lisa Miller, a spokeswoman for the House committee, said the Iraqi memos came from the thousands of documents that were collected by Charles A. Duelfer, the top American arms inspector. She said the Iraqi intelligence service memos were provided to the committee by the Central Intelligence Agency, and then translated by a member of the Iraq Survey Group that Mr. Duelfer led.
 The Iraq Survey Group issued a voluminous report in 2004 concluding that Mr. Hussein's government had used the oil-for-food program to try to weaken United Nations sanctions and finance weapons purchases. The report also charged that Mr. Pasqua and Mr. Galloway had received the right to buy Iraqi oil. It also said that Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party in Russia had received oil allocations, accusations that both he and the party denied.
 The House committee yesterday released a letter signed by Mr. Zhirinovsky on his party's stationery to the effect that a company called Nafta Moscow was to receive rights to buy up to 2.5 million barrels of oil under the program.
 Ms. Miller said that House committee staff members had met with diplomats from the French and Russian Embassies late last year to seek cooperation in its investigation, but none had been forthcoming. Neither the French nor Russian Embassies responded to requests for comment. 
 In an interview yesterday in Paris, Mr. Pasqua said there had never been any substantial proof to back up the memos and statements that were disclosed Wednesday by the Senate committee, and he repeated his earlier denials that either he or his supporters had received anything from the oil-for-food program.
 ''What I don't accept is taking at face value what has been said by the Iraqis without evidence to support it,'' Mr. Pasqua said.
 At least one member of the Iraq Survey Group offered a similar caution about the memos from Iraq's intelligence service that the House released on Thursday. ''You must be skeptical of their claims,'' the investigator said. ''Iraqi agents may have exaggerated or misconstrued statements by people they met with to make themselves look more active and effective.'' 
 Mr. Pasqua said the United States ''wants to prove that the positions taken by France before the war were dictated by economic interests.'' But he said that people who made such claims were out of touch with French politics: Mr. Pasqua broke with Mr. Chirac in 1998 and since then has had little influence at Elysee Palace.
 In a statement issued by his spokesman in London, Mr. Galloway also criticized the Senate panel for not having interviewed him before it accused him of receiving rights to buy up to 20 million barrels of oil. ''I repeat once more, I have never traded or benefited from any oil deals with Iraq,'' he said.
 Following Mr. Galloway's initial denials of the Senate panel's charges, a spokesman for the committee said that its chairman , Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, had invited Mr. Galloway to appear at a hearing on May 17.
 On Thursday, Mr. Galloway said in the statement relayed by his spokesman: ''I'll be there to give them both barrels -- verbal guns, of course, not oil -- assuming we get the visas. I welcome the opportunity to clear my name. My first words will be 'Senator, it's a pity that we are having this interview after you have found me guilty. Even in Kafka there was the semblance of a trial.'''

HEADLINE: Britain Backs Penalties if Iran Restarts Nuclear Program

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Helene Fouquet contributed reporting from Paris for this article, and Nazila Fathi from Tehran.

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12 

 BODY:
As the European Union warned Iran against resuming its nuclear program, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday that Britain would support American moves to invoke United Nations Security Council countermeasures ''if Iran breaches its obligations and undertakings.''
 The threats reflected increasing worries among European leaders that Iran might revive nuclear enrichment activities suspended since last November, a move the Europeans are eager to forestall. 
 Mr. Blair spoke at a news conference a day after the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany -- the European countries negotiating with Iran on behalf of the 25-nation European Union -- sent a letter to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, warning that any resumption of nuclear work ''would bring the negotiating process to an end.'' If the negotiations fail, the dispute will be referred to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and thereafter to the Security Council, an official in the British Foreign Office said. ''The Iranians are fully aware of the implications of any decision to resume the nuclear program,'' the official said. Under Foreign Office rules, officials speak on condition that they not be identified by name. 
 The European foreign ministers' letter, which was also signed by Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, offers Iran high-level negotiations with European foreign ministers within two weeks to seek a way out of the impasse. 
 Two European diplomats said Thursday that a meeting could take place next week, possibly in Tehran. The letter said, ''We welcome Iran's continued voluntary suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and emphasize that sustaining the suspension, while negotiations are under way, is essential for the continuation of the overall process'' of negotiation agreed in discussions last year.
 In recent days, Iranian officials have suggested that the country is on the brink of reactivating one of the plants where uranium enrichment was suspended last November.
 The United States says Iran is developing a nuclear weapons program -- a suspicion shared by the European Union. But Iran maintains its program is intended to develop nuclear power generating stations.
 Mr. Rowhani, the Iranian negotiator, said Wednesday that Iran would resume part of its ''enrichment activities in the near future,'' Reuters reported. But in remarks on Thursday after meeting with Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Kislyak, Mr. Rowhani did not allude to a date for the resumption of enrichment activities.
 Another British Foreign Office official said Thursday that European negotiators believed that Iran had written its own letter, for delivery to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, formally stating its intention to resume enrichment.
 ''We are working on the assumption that it will be handed over and will declare their intention,'' the official said.
 If that happens, ''it's a whole new ballgame,'' the official said.
 In Vienna, Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Thursday that the agency had ''not received not any official notification from Iran regarding their intention to restart the conversion facility.''
 At the news conference in London Mr. Blair was asked whether he would support the American-led drive to seek Security Council penalties for Iran. Until now, the Europeans have favored incentives, including potential trade deals, to prevent the Iranians from developing a program that they say is their sovereign right.
 ''We certainly will support referral to the United Nations Security Council if Iran breaches its obligations and undertakings,'' Mr. Blair said. 
 But he qualified his remarks by saying, ''Quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies, but those international rules are there for a reason, and they've got to be adhered to.''
 Responding to a question about the possibility of American military action against Iran, Mr. Blair said, ''We have got to make sure this diplomatic process works, and we'll fight very hard to do that.'' Britain was the United States' steadfast Western ally in the invasion of Iraq, but Mr. Blair's support of President Bush and his handling of the period leading to the war cost him dearly in last week's election. The news conference was Mr. Blair's first since then. 
 The letter to Iran, the contents of which were first reported Thursday in The Washington Post, said European officials were ''concerned by the statements made by a number of senior Iranian officials suggesting that some activities covered by the voluntary suspension might soon be restarted.''
 ''Iran should be in no doubt that any such change to the suspension would be a clear breach'' of earlier agreements, the letter said. ''It would bring the negotiating process to an end. The consequences could only be negative for Iran.''
 In the letter, the Europeans said they were ''ready for further discussions in the field of nuclear fuel supply for Iran's power generation program.''
 ''We are also ready to discuss further a political and security framework.'' 
 Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, said Thursday that Iran would lose benefits secured in previous negotiations if it resumed nuclear activities.
 ''Those unquestionably will be lost because they were part of the negotiations taking part in the context in which Iran had agreed to maintain its suspension of uranium enrichment and related activity,'' Mr. Straw said in a radio interview.
 ''The problem is that what is incontrovertible is that there is a 20-year history of them failing to disclose aspects of their activities,'' he said.
 And in Paris, Cecile Pozzo di Borgo, a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, urged Iran to refrain from resuming its nuclear activities and said France supported continued discussions.
 In Tehran, the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Western countries on Thursday against ''bullying'' Iran. But in much more conciliatory remarks, President Mohammad Khatami said Iran expected its talks with Britain, France and Germany to become more serious.
 ''We expect to get out of this indecisive situation in the talks with our European friends,'' he said. ''These talks must not become an excuse to delay Iran's activities and eventually deprive us from mastering peaceful nuclear technology.''
 ''We have clearly stated our demands and if our European friends look at them objectively and beyond external pressures, we must be able to reach a logical solution,'' he added.

HEADLINE: China Says U.S. Criticisms Impeded North Korea Arms Talks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 12 

 BODY:
A senior Chinese diplomat on Thursday accused the Bush administration of undermining efforts to revive negotiations with the North Korean government and said there was ''no solid evidence'' that North Korea was preparing to test a nuclear weapon.
 The comments by Yang Xiyu, a senior Foreign Ministry official and China's top official on the North Korean nuclear problem, were noteworthy because the Chinese authorities very rarely speak to journalists about the issue. The comments reflect growing frustration in Beijing with the Bush administration. 
 Even as the White House presses China to find a solution to the nuclear issue, Chinese officials say, it has hurled insults at North Korea and given its leaders excuses to stay away from the bargaining table. 
 ''It is true that we do not yet have tangible achievements'' in ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program, Mr. Yang said in an interview. ''But a basic reason for the unsuccessful effort lies in the lack of cooperation from the U.S. side.''
 Mr. Yang said that when President Bush referred to the North Korea leader, Kim Jong Il, as a ''tyrant'' in late April, Mr. Bush ''destroyed the atmosphere'' for negotiations, undoing weeks of efforts to persuade North Korea that the United States would bargain in good faith.
 China, which has used its diplomatic clout to try to broker a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis, has struggled to restart six-nation negotiations, which stalled nearly a year ago. 
 Mr. Yang said formally on Thursday what diplomats here had been whispering for months: personal attacks against Mr. Kim by Mr. Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other top administration officials had caused a ''loss of face'' for North Korean officials and created big obstacles to reaching any negotiated solution.
 He urged the Bush administration to find some ''informal channel'' to talk with North Korean diplomats, perhaps over coffee or a meal, to build confidence. American officials have resisted any direct contact with North Koreans outside the six-nation talks. Mr. Yang said that without some new gestures the obstacles to resuming negotiations could prove insurmountable.
 ''I know the U.S. is reluctant to have even informal contacts'' with North Korea, he said. ''But as the world's superpower, I would hope it can show more flexibility and sincerity to make a resumption of talks possible.''
 The Beijing government is determined to head off a looming confrontation between the United States and North Korea, which it fears could prompt a regional nuclear arms race and shatter the stability that has underpinned China's own economic rise.
 But the prospects for a negotiated solution have diminished after the recriminations between the United States and North Korea and warnings by American officials that North Korea has accelerated its development of nuclear bombs and may be preparing to test a nuclear device.
 Mr. Yang said China would be ''very concerned'' about a nuclear test. But he said he doubted North Korea would take that step now, adding that China had made it ''very, very clear'' to North Korea that a test or any other provocative display of its nuclear capability would have serious consequences.
 North Korea ''understands the consequences very clearly,'' Mr. Yang said. ''I do not think we should reach the conclusion that there will be a test.''
 Some American and Chinese analysts have speculated that North Korea may have made preparations for a test in full view of American spy satellites to create a sense of urgency about its nuclear program and lay the groundwork for demanding greater concessions if negotiations resume. But others say they believe North Korea is determined to become a full-fledged nuclear power and is prepared to weather penalties that may be imposed as it pursues that goal.
 The United States and China worked closely together to organize multiple rounds of talks with North Korea that also included South Korea, Japan and Russia. Not since the two countries coordinated strategies against the former Soviet Union in the 1980's have they cooperated on a diplomatic project for such an extended period.
 But tensions have risen as North Korea has appeared to be continuing to develop its nuclear arsenal and has resisted returning to the talks. Bush administration officials contend that China must begin using more economic and political leverage to pressure North Korea. China has rejected ''strong-arm tactics'' and suggested, usually in private, that the United States stop demonizing North Korea.
 Mr. Yang expressed some puzzlement as to why the United States had pushed China to cut off oil or fuel supplies to North Korea -- part of its lifeline of support for the government, which is in need of money -- at the same time that it professed to want to resume negotiations.
 ''If you look at history you cannot find many successful cases in which sanctions achieved a successful result,'' he said.
 Mr. Yang disputed an account of a meeting he held with Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill that was carried last week in The Washington Post. In that account, Mr. Yang was quoted as rejecting American demands to cut off North Korea's fuel supplies, but as indicating that China might withhold food aid as a way of forcing North Korea to resume talks.
 Mr. Yang said Thursday that he did not discuss those options with Mr. Hill. He said he did not see the need for any penalties, involving food, oil shipments or other measures, as long as the talks moved ahead.

HEADLINE: Pirro Is Seen As G.O.P. Knight In Dented Armor

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
Leading Republicans in New York and Washington are in near-total agreement that Jeanine F. Pirro, the three-term district attorney of Westchester County, is their dream candidate to challenge Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2006.
 Or to be state attorney general next year. Or to be governor, if the Republican incumbent, George E. Pataki, does not run for a fourth term. Now if only they could persuade Ms. Pirro to go along. 
 A law-and-order Republican who is a proven vote-getter among Democrats and independents and who supports abortion rights, Ms. Pirro, 53, is emerging in Republican circles as the best hope for victory in a state race next year, assuming that Mr. Pataki and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani do not run.
 In spite of some aggressive coaxing, which has included a phone call from President Bush's 2004 campaign manager, Ms. Pirro has refused to commit to anything thus far. Even her own bid for re-election this fall is up in the air: Some of her advisers have suggested that she forsake another run for local office and focus on her state ambitions, instead of running a ceaseless campaign, for district attorney in 2005 and then for statewide office in 2006.
 Ms. Pirro, who says she will announce her plans in the next two weeks, sounded in an interview like a candidate for re-election, as she elaborated on her goals for Westchester. She declined to comment about next year's races, saying she was focused on 2005.
 Yet according to several friends and political confidantes, Ms. Pirro is wary of committing to a state race because she is not sure how she would finesse the potential complications.
 Well, one complication, really: her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., who is a lobbyist in White Plains. He was convicted in 2000 of income tax fraud and served 11 months in federal prison. Ms. Pirro sought and won re-election while he was still imprisoned. While some voters were deeply skeptical that Ms. Pirro was an innocent bystander, given that she had signed her husband's fraudulent tax returns, she was returned to office, although by a relatively close margin of votes, as Westchester voters apparently separated her record from her husband's.
 Whether voters in the rest of New York would do the same is an open question, Ms. Pirro's advisers acknowledge. Muddying matters further is a lawsuit brought by Mr. Pirro that charges a reputed mobster with slander. The reputed mob figure was caught on tape saying that Mr. Pirro had shared details about an investigation by his wife's office. Ms. Pirro said this week that she had asked federal prosecutors to investigate the claim. 
 Ms. Pirro has never been implicated in any of her husband's dealings, and she has always maintained that neither of them brings work home.
 ''Her critics will try to use Al against her, no doubt,'' said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester Republican and an ally of Ms. Pirro's. ''But people recognize that she is an independent woman who should be judged on her own outstanding work.''
 Another Republican close to Ms. Pirro, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of offending her, said Ms. Pirro knew that her husband's baggage was heavy. 
 ''When the rest of the state realizes that the candidate has a convicted felon for a husband, they will never go for her,'' this adviser said. ''Being district attorney is an easy win for her. But she needs to think much longer and harder about '06.''
 For her part, Ms. Pirro dismissed the suggestion that voters would look askance at a candidate whose spouse had a criminal record.
 ''Shame on anyone who thinks that I should be considered on anything other than who I am,'' Ms. Pirro said. ''I've worked very hard in a man's world, for many, many years, to get where I am, to be an agent of change. For anyone to suggest that I should be judged on anyone else is a disservice to the electorate.''
 The intensifying focus on Ms. Pirro comes as Republicans keenly -- or obsessively, as Democrats would say -- seek a viable challenger to Senator Clinton.
 An outright defeat is hard to imagine, Republicans acknowledge, given Mrs. Clinton's approval rating of about 70 percent in New York. But even damaging her in an aggressive campaign could pay dividends, Republican strategists say, if it weakens Mrs. Clinton's prospects for a 2008 presidential bid.
 Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and President Bush's campaign manager last year, recently called Ms. Pirro and urged her to run for the Senate, her advisers said. Deputies of Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, also pointed to Ms. Pirro as a natural choice against Mrs. Clinton during a meeting with New York Republicans last week.
 Some New York Republicans say that Ms. Pirro might just beat Mrs. Clinton at her own game: appealing to voters as a middle-of-the-road politician who has broken through glass ceilings using a style evocative of an iron hand in a velvet glove.
 Yet Ms. Pirro cannot match Mrs. Clinton's breadth of experience on economic, defense and foreign policy issues, and she is less widely known, although she is often a guest on cable news programs.
 Her background better suits that of the state's top law enforcement officer, her advisers say, though they acknowledge concerns about the voters' acceptance of an attorney general whose husband spent time in prison.
 Ms. Pirro is known politically as someone who runs to win, not merely to trip up an opponent like Mrs. Clinton. And, displaying her political savvy, she left herself some wiggle room when asked, during an interview whether she would pledge to serve out a full term, through 2009?
 ''Certainly I would do whatever was most appropriate for the people of Westchester County,'' Ms. Pirro said. ''I would fully intend to do that.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Urges the North To Rejoin Talks on Weapons

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 12 

 BODY:
A day after North Korea claimed to have extracted weapons-grade fuel from a nuclear reactor, South Korea on Thursday strongly urged North Korea to re-engage in disarmament talks but said it was not time to take the issue to the United Nations Security Council.
 South Korean officials said they believed that North Korea's declaration was a negotiating ploy in its standoff with the United States and that negotiations could still resolve the nuclear crisis.
 Asked about the possibility of going to the Security Council, Foreign Minister Ban Ki Moon told the South Korean news media that there had not yet been ''consultation among the relevant parties.'' 
 Mr. Ban, who was on a tour of Uzbekistan with President Roh Moo Hyun, said his government preferred to focus its efforts on the stalled six-nation negotiations over the North Korean nuclear crisis. ''There, we should find solution through negotiation,'' he said. ''Referring it to the United Nations Security Council is not desirable until all diplomatic efforts are completely exhausted.''
 At a news conference here, Lee Bong Jo, the deputy minister of unification, described North Korea's declaration as a move to increase pressure, ''thereby simultaneously strengthening its negotiating power.''
 Even as North Korea stepped up pressure on the Bush administration, the reluctance of South Korea -- one of the United States' closest allies in this region -- to push North Korea appeared to limit Washington's choice of sticks.
 On Tuesday, the day before North Korea's announcement, China also said that it opposed applying economic or political sanctions to pressure the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
 South Korea and China, in keeping with their long-standing positions that politically and economically engaging North Korea is the best way to avert a collapse and to encourage reform, have long opposed punitive actions, like a quarantine to prevent the smuggling of nuclear materials, economic sanctions and going to the Security Council.
 The two countries, along with Russia, another participant in the six-nation talks, are North Korea's biggest trading partners, and sanctions or a quarantine would be ineffective without their cooperation. The sixth participant in the talks, Japan, is the only one backing Washington's calls for tougher actions.
 Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, Washington's lead negotiator on North Korea, is scheduled to arrive here on Friday for talks.
 American officials have said in the last week that North Korea might be preparing for its first test of a nuclear weapon, basing their assessment on satellite photographs of the North -- though, they have said that the activity observed in Kilju, in the northeastern part of the country, could be a ruse by North Korea to strengthen its hand in negotiations.

HEADLINE: A Push for a Central American Trade Pact

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
President Bush tried to kick-start his campaign to win passage of a stalled free trade agreement on Thursday by welcoming the presidents of five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic to the White House.
 Mr. Bush praised the economic pact with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua as essential not only to expanding trade among free markets but also in strengthening democracy and security in the Western Hemisphere.
 ''Today a part of the world that was once characterized by oppression and military dictatorship now sees its future in free elections and free trade,'' said Mr. Bush, standing with the leaders. 
 The six countries, since the end of civil wars of the late 1970's and 1980's, have moved closer to the United States, with some sending troops to Iraq. In promoting the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta, the administration is underlining what it sees as its importance for national security.
 Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told the Central American leaders at a meeting on Wednesday that he appreciated their military cooperation.
 ''Today, the threat to Central American and Caribbean security comes from an antisocial combination of gangs, drug traffickers, smugglers, hostage takers, and terrorists,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''It is increasingly clear that they can be effectively combated and are being combated only by close cooperation among nations.'' 
 The visit with the president on Thursday was the high point of a unusual weeklong lobbying effort by the nations' leaders who traveled around the United States and to Washington.
 At the same time, the World Bank released a report prepared at the request of the United States and the countries, showing the benefits of the trade agreement for all signatories but warning that on its own Cafta ''is unlikely to lead to substantial economic development.''
 According to the report, Cafta would increase the levels of trade and should promote greater levels of foreign and domestic investments. Especially attractive for foreign investors would be the changes in regulations covering trade in services, government procurement and intellectual property rights in Central American countries and the Dominican Republic. But to ensure substantial gains in development, the report said, these countries would have to make major investments in ports, roads and education.
 Creating a free trade zone for textiles stretching from North Carolina through El Salvador is part of the allure of Cafta. Textile exports are larger now than the region's shipments of traditional products like coffee and sugar. This week the administration won support for Cafta from a United States textile trade association but it has failed to crack the opposition of the sugar industry.
 Even with this top-level push, Cafta faces an uphill battle. The administration does not have the votes to pass the trade pact even though the agreement was signed a year ago.
 Democrats say they want the administration to renegotiate the accord to include labor and environmental provisions, saying that workers need greater assurances that trade will not undercut them. Others said they want the administration to come up with a clearer vision of how the United States can be more competitive.
 Some Democrats have questioned why the administration is putting such an emphasis on a trade deal with six small, mostly impoverished countries when the United States' major trade problems and disputes are with China, Europe and Japan.
 The administration views such talk as protectionism and says Cafta will increase American exports of manufactured goods and agricultural products. The agreement would eventually eliminate or cut tariffs on American exports to the region while making permanent the tariff-free status of the Cafta countries.
 Rob Portman, the new United States trade representative, said this week that the momentum in Congress was turning in favor of Cafta.
 Democrats and some Republicans disagreed.
 At a news conference on Thursday, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, described the visit of the Cafta leaders as ''unprecedented and desperate lobbying.''
 Pointing to the nation's record trade deficit, Mr. Dorgan said, ''Cafta is where Congress draws the line on America's failed trade policies.''
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. sent workers from the Cafta countries on a tour across the United States mirroring the one undertaken by the leadership. Using the slogan ''Cafta We Don't Hafta,'' the workers said the trade deals would push down wages in the region and the United States.

HEADLINE: Threats on the Nuclear Horizon

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman (''Brussels Sprouts,'' column, May 11) claims to know the ''ridiculously obvious'' solution to the problem of nuclear proliferation: a halt to economic intercourse with potential nuclear weapons states.
 But in fact, state leaders do not see these terrible weapons as ''nuclear carpets'' to be traded away for the right price. Indeed, they are insulted by suggestions that they sell out their national security and national honor, and they react by redoubling their commitment to the chosen course.
 Only a few leaders really want the bomb, but those who do want it want it badly. Short of removing nuclear aspirants from power, the only hope for persuading them to change direction begins with acknowledging the strong impulses for security and identity that lie behind their policy.

HEADLINE: A Struggling German Retailer Picks a New Chief to Try to Stem Losses

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 12 

 BODY:
Thomas Middelhoff, the German executive who abruptly left the helm of the media giant Bertelsmann three years ago, was named Thursday as chief of KarstadtQuelle, a German retailer struggling to right its flagging mail-order catalog business.
 Mr. Middelhoff, 52, had been chairman of the nonexecutive supervisory board of KarstadtQuelle since June 2004, during which time the retailer sold holdings in DSF Deutsches Sport Fernsehen, a German TV sports channel, and Home Shopping Europe, to stem losses and reorganize 85 large department stores. 
 KarstadtQuelle owns 180 department stores, 32 sporting goods outlets and 305 specialty shops, but 56 percent of its sales come from its catalog business. 
 At a news conference at the company's headquarters in Essen, Mr. Middlehoff said he had ''taken the job not to break up and destroy KarstadtQuelle, but to turn the company around,'' said Michael Scheibe, a KarstadtQuelle spokesman.
 The appointment of Mr. Middelhoff came as KarstadtQuelle reported that sales fell 8.4 percent in the first quarter, to 2.97 billion euros ($3.8 billion), largely because of a 9.5 percent decline at its Quelle and Neckermann catalog businesses. The businesses have struggled in Germany's stagnant economy and the loosening of the country's restrictive retail shopping hours, which had artificially supported catalog sales.
 ''He isn't the ideal candidate for KarstadtQuelle because he lacks extensive retail experience,'' said Mark Josefson, an analyst in Frankfurt at the brokerage firm Kepler Equities, who has a buy recommendation on the retailer's shares. ''But having said that, he does have a proven record of turning around businesses and will probably make things happen faster.''
 As chief executive at Bertelsmann from November 1998 through July 2002, Mr. Middelhoff nudged the staid company and its owner, Reinhard Mohn, a distant relative of Bertelsmann's founder, to sell a 25 percent stake to a Belgian investor, Baron Albert Frere, and his Canadian partner, Paul Desmarais, who have the option of listing their shares and taking the private media company public. 
 While some of Mr. Middelhoff's Internet initiatives, like Bertelsmann's online book seller, BOL.com, ultimately were aborted, Bertelsmann's market value increased by more than $10 billion during his tenure as the company invested in America Online stock, a 50 percent stake in AOL Europe and ownership of mediaWays, an Internet service company for businesses that Bertelsmann later sold to Telefonica of Spain.
 While at Bertelsmann, Mr. Middelhoff also earned a reputation for challenging German conventions by introducing English as the official company language, dropping the use of traditional courtesy office titles like ''Herr Doktor,'' and lending $60 million to Napster and its founder, Shawn Fanning. In October 2000, Mr. Middelhoff told journalists on a visit to New York that while he carried a German passport, he was at heart an American.
 Mr. Middelhoff abruptly resigned after disagreements with the Mohn family.
 At KarstadtQuelle, Mr. Middelhoff faces the challenge of turning around a retailer that reported a 1.63 billion euro loss in 2004, down from a profit of 107.6 million euros in 2003. At the news conference, Mr. Middelhoff said he planned to streamline decision-making channels at KarstadtQuelle, a holding company that presides over four independent companies, each with its own executive boards.
 To accomplish that, Mr. Middelhoff said he planned to downgrade the legal structure of the four subsidiary businesses to permit direct reporting between the holding company's executives and the company's operating units. 
 KarstadtQuelle named Hero Brahms, a member of the supervisory board, to succeed Mr. Middelhoff as chairman and announced the departure of another executive board member, Arwed Fischer, who had been responsible for the catalog business. 
 Responsibility for the catalog business will be assumed by the chief financial officer, Harald Pinger.
 ''In light of the dimension of the problems in the catalog businesses, we had to act fast and I am pleased to say that Thomas Middelhoff accepted our offer because he was always our first choice,'' Mr. Brahms said.
 In addition to his previous duties as KarstadtQuelle's supervisory board chairman, Mr. Middelhoff led the corporate investment arm of Investcorp, a company with close ties to investors in the Persian Gulf that is listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.
 As KarstadtQuelle's chief executive, Mr. Middelhoff succeeds Christoph Achenbach, who left the company in April after the supervisory board refused his request for a five-year contract extension, Mr. Middelhoff's spokesman, Hannes Bahrmann, said.
 Mr. Middelhoff has been a director of The New York Times Company since 2003.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Seeks to Shut Dozens of Bases Across Nation

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The Pentagon on Friday recommended closing nearly 180 installations and offices, including 33 big bases, from Hawaii to Maine in the first major restructuring of the nation's vast military network in a decade. 
 Ranging from tiny Army Reserve centers to sprawling Air Force bases that have been the economic anchors of their communities for generations, the proposed closings, consolidations and reductions of more than 800 military facilities in all, which could cost several thousand civilian jobs nationwide, sent shock waves across all 50 states. The plan also underscored the Pentagon's far-reaching effort to revamp the armed services into a leaner, more agile force. 
 In the New York area, the Pentagon wants to shut the Navy's submarine base in Groton, Conn.; the Army's Fort Monmouth in New Jersey; and the Air National Guard Station in Niagara Falls, N.Y. The Groton base had the largest single loss of jobs in the proposal.
 Other bases proposed for closing include some familiar names in military history, including Fort McPherson in Georgia, the Pascagoula Naval Station in Mississippi and Fort Monroe, Va. And in South Dakota, the state's second-largest employer, Ellsworth Air Force Base, would be shut. 
 The military also wants to move thousands of military and civilian workers out of leased commercial high-rise buildings near the Pentagon in Northern Virginia to more secure locations at bases around the country. 
 Closing bases, though, does not mean shrinking the military, just rearranging it.
 ''Our current arrangements, designed for the cold war, must give way to the new demands of the war against extremism and other evolving 21st-century challenges,'' Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said. The plan is proposed to save $48.8 billion over 20 years. 
 The Pentagon sent its findings on Friday to the independent Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or Brac, which will spend the summer reviewing them in public hearings and installation visits. Mr. Rumsfeld will testify to the panel on Monday. 
 If the past four base-closing rounds are a guide, most of the Pentagon's plan will prevail: previous commissions have endorsed 85 percent of the recommendations. And Congress and two past presidents have approved the panel's plans. 
 While the list of proposed closings and consolidations was smaller than initially expected because of the planned return of troops from Europe, the reaction from communities and their political leaders was furious and intense. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, attacked the Pentagon's plan to close the base in Groton, a submarine base since 1916 that stands to lose more than 8,000 military and civilian jobs.
 ''It is shortsighted,'' Mr. Lieberman said in a statement. ''It is cruel and unusual punishment that Connecticut does not deserve and our national security cannot afford.'' 
 Lawmakers and local officials in Maine, one of the hardest-hit states with three closings, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, vowed to challenge the Pentagon's plans that would cost nearly 7,000 military and civilian jobs.
 ''In arriving at these inexplicable decisions, the Defense Department and the Navy must have been operating in a fog so thick they couldn't even see the facts in front of them,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. 
 The recommendation to close Ellsworth revived an issue from one of the most fiercely contested Senate races last fall. 
 During the campaign, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, appeared outside the base with John Thune, the Republican challenger, and promised to use his clout to spare Ellsworth if South Dakotans turned Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, out of office. Mr. Thune won. On Friday he called the Pentagon's decision ''flat wrong.''
 Pentagon officials said that politics played no role in a process that made military value the top priority. President Bush's home state, Texas, for instance, would gain a net total of 6,150 military and civilian jobs if the military's recommendations stand. But inside the state, there are winners and losers. The redeployment of 11,000 soldiers from the First Armored Division in Germany to Fort Bliss would be partially offset by the closing of 15 installations, including the Red River Army Depot and Ingleside Naval Station. 
 California, which in the past four rounds had 29 bases closed or realigned, got off relatively lightly this time, losing only about 2,000 military and civilian positions under the proposal, including 1,630 positions at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, which would be shifted to an expanded medical center in San Antonio. 
 Since the last round of base closings 10 years ago, Congress approved provisions that make it harder for the independent, nine-member commission to add a base to the Pentagon's list. Now, seven members must approve the addition of a base to the list instead of a simple majority, which remains the standard to drop an installation from the list or make any other alteration. 
 The commission, headed by Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs, must present its recommendations to Mr. Bush by Sept. 8. The president and Congress must then accept or reject the list by Nov. 7. Once Congress approves the decisions, the Pentagon must begin to carry them out within two years and complete them by 2011. 
 This round's proposal to close 33 major bases and reduce another 29 is roughly in line with the four previous rounds -- in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995. But this year's list recommends 775 minor base closings or consolidations, more than three times the total number of changes to smaller bases in the four previous rounds combined. 
 Christopher Hellman, a military analyst with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a research group in Washington, said roughly three-quarters of these smaller installations belonged to the National Guard and Reserve. ''This would indicate a desire on the part of the Pentagon to better integrate these units into the active force,'' Mr. Hellman said in a statement. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld said on Thursday that the military had only about 5 percent to 10 percent excess capacity once it took into consideration the space it would need to accommodate 70,000 troops returning from Europe and Pentagon agencies moving from leased space, as well as the need to preserve the military's ability to surge operations at ammunition plants and maintenance depots in times of crisis. The Pentagon had earlier estimated it had 20 percent to 25 percent more capacity than it needed.
 Even with fewer closings than once expected, Mr. Rumsfeld said the proposed changes would save about $5.5 billion a year after initial closing costs were paid, and $48.8 billion over 20 years. The previous four rounds of base closings saved a total of $29 billion through 2003, according to the Government Accountability Office, leaving some base-closing specialists to question the Pentagon's analysis. 
 ''The math doesn't add up,'' said David Berteau, a former Pentagon official whose responsibilities included overseeing base closings and who was a consultant for the State of California this round. 
 But Defense Department officials who worked on the base-closing process for the last two years said that much of the savings would come from merging maintenance depots, arsenals and similar functions that each armed service now does on its own. New pilots from all services flying the Joint Strike Fighter would train at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. In the Washington area, the Pentagon plans to close the existing Walter Reed Army Medical Center and build a $1 billion national military center with the same name on the campus of the naval medical center in Bethesda, Md. 
 Each service has proposed consolidating functions to improve efficiencies. The Army would move its armor center from Fort Knox, Ky., to Fort Benning, Ga., home of the infantry school, to create a Maneuver Center there. The Army would close 176 Army Reserve centers and 211 Army National Guard facilities, but it would build 125 multiservice Reserve centers in places better suited to help their flagging recruiting efforts. 
 ''By closing or divesting ourselves of inefficient facilities and moving to places where we have better demographics and constructing joint facilities, I think we give better opportunity to the members of the Reserve component, make it more convenient and give them more choices,'' said Lt. Gen. H Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau. 
 The military services planned for what they need to fight adversaries 20 years from now. The Air Force projected having 20 percent fewer fighter jets but possible new threats in the Pacific, so it has proposed alterations to 75 percent of its 154 installations. ''We saw this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reset our forces,'' said Maj. Gen. Gary Heckman, co-director of the Air Force's base-closing analysis.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Choice to Oversee Site Relishes Big Challenges

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
John P. Cahill has panted his way through the Ironman Triathlon in Lake Placid, N.Y., which involves a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bike ride, capped off by a 26.2-mile run. (Lest those decimal points sound insignificant, think just how hard that last 0.2 of a mile must be.)
 Out of his sneakers, Mr. Cahill, 46, has served in a series of senior posts in the Pataki administration, most recently as Gov. George E. Pataki's chief of staff, struggling with any number of challenging state issues and keeping things running day in and day out. And when he is not out training, or troubleshooting for the governor, Mr. Cahill and his wife, Kim, are raising four children, including 10-year-old twins. 
 ''Someone said to me the other day that I sound like a person that likes a lot of pain,'' he said this week.
 But this week Governor Pataki gave Mr. Cahill a new assignment that could test even a man of his capacity for endurance, multitasking, and maybe even masochism. The governor appointed Mr. Cahill as his new development chief in Lower Manhattan and made him responsible for getting the state's struggling efforts to rebuild the World Trade Center site back on track after a series of embarrassing setbacks. 
 If the news of the appointment was greeted in most quarters with mild interest that another in a line of Pataki allies is in charge of a big project, in the halls of the Capitol and among some major players downtown, it was taken as a sign of the governor's renewed determination to set things right downtown. 
 Confidence in the project has been shaken in recent weeks, first after Goldman Sachs & Company announced it was abandoning plans to build a headquarters there, saying officials had been unresponsive to some of its needs, and then by the news that the project's centerpiece, the Freedom Tower, must be redesigned to address security concerns raised by the Police Department.
 In choosing Mr. Cahill to sort things out, Mr. Pataki was sending a message, as well as surrendering a trusted subordinate. Mr. Cahill is not only the governor's right-hand man -- his official title has been secretary to the governor, but he is essentially chief of staff -- but he is also one of the closest associates the governor has who still works in the administration. 
 The two men have a long history. When Mr. Cahill joined the firm of Plunkett & Jaffe after graduating from Pace Law School in 1985, he was dispatched to work on his first case with a more senior attorney: Mr. Pataki. Soon after Mr. Pataki became governor, he brought Mr. Cahill to Albany, where he worked as a counsel at the Department of Environmental Conservation, then as its commissioner, then as a senior adviser to the governor and finally as chief of staff.
 So, amid the competing players and interests in Lower Manhattan, he will be seen as having the full confidence, and the ear of, the governor. 
 ''The message with Cahill is that he speaks for the governor,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents business and investment leaders. ''But he is also somebody who dives in. He is not above the fray.'' 
 And, with most politicians believing that Mr. Pataki does not intend to seek a fourth term in 2006, Mr. Cahill will have a short time to start showing results.
 Still, some Democrats questioned how the appointment would change things, noting that Mr. Pataki and his appointees have been in charge all along. ''I guess he really shook things up, appointing his own chief of staff,'' said Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., a Queens Democrat. ''As the Who said, 'Meet the new boss -- same as the old boss.''
 Mr. Cahill has a reputation for being approachable, but also fiercely loyal to the governor. Staff members say that they like working for him. Some opponents say he can be tough to deal with at times -- one placed him in the ''warrior faction'' of Mr. Pataki's aides, who are not afraid to fight to get their way -- but several people who have worked with him said he remains professional, businesslike and fair, even after scrapes. 
 Some credit Mr. Cahill with helping Mr. Pataki solidify his credentials as an environmentalist after his first environmental commissioner, Michael D. Zagata, was attacked by some environmental groups who felt he was too pro-industry (and embarrassed the administration by taking a state vehicle on Florida vacations).
 Mr. Cahill was brought in by Mr. Pataki ''to help build his environmental reputation and instill and aura of professionalism in the commissioner's office, and that's what he did,'' said John Stouffer, legislative director for the Atlantic chapter of the Sierra Club. 
 Mr. Cahill said that what he has tried to do in past negotiations for the governor, and what he will try to do in Lower Manhattan, is to bone up on the issues from all sides. ''What you try to do is understand where the other side is coming from,'' he said. ''If I've had any success, it's because of my ability to listen and understand.''
 Indeed, at the speech in which Mr. Pataki announced his appointment, Mr. Cahill was seen huddling with, and listening to, Daniel L. Doctoroff, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding.
 ''There will be no shortage of people with opinions downtown,'' Mr. Cahill said. ''That's a challenge, but it's also probably its greatest strength. At the end of the day, that's what's going to make this project a success.''

HEADLINE: Business Inventories Were Up 0.4% in March

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Businesses increased inventories by 0.4 percent in March as total sales accelerated sharply, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
 The March increase in the total amount of goods held on shelves and back lots followed a 0.5 percent gain in February. But a portion of the February inventory growth reflected an unwanted accumulation as sales fell 0.5 percent during February. 
 In March, sales at all levels of business rebounded 0.7 percent, the best showing since a 1.2 percent sales jump in December. The increased sales helped to slow the growth in inventories. 
 In other economic news, the Labor Department reported that the prices of imported goods rose 0.8 percent in April, the slowest pace in three months. The slowdown occurred as oil prices last month retreated from record highs. Import prices had surged by 2 percent in March, the largest gain in nearly 15 years.
 Also Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed a larger-than-expected drop in confidence, with the index falling at midmonth to 85.3, down from 87.7 in April. One component -- consumers' expectations about the future -- fell sharply to 73.7, down from 77 in April.
 Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said he believed that consumer confidence would stabilize now that oil prices had fallen by about $10 a barrel from their highs of a month ago.
 But he said the weakness recently in consumer confidence was likely to translate into a reluctance to spend over the next two to three months.
 Fears that the economy could be entering another period of significantly slower growth have eased somewhat in recent days as the government reported that job growth and retail sales rebounded sharply in April after weaker-than-expected readings in March.
 Analysts have forecast that the initial 3.1 percent estimate for overall economic growth in the first quarter, the slowest performance in two years, will now be revised upward to 3.5 percent or even better. Part of that optimism is based on a report this week that the trade deficit, which subtracts from growth, narrowed significantly in March.
 The report on business inventories showed that the overall 0.4 percent increase in stockpiles was led by a 0.6 percent rise in inventories held by manufacturers, the same increase for this group as in February. Inventories held by retailers rose 0.3 percent, down slightly from a 0.4 percent gain in February. Wholesale inventories were up 0.4 percent in March, compared with a 0.6 percent rise the previous month.
 The 0.7 percent gain in sales in March was led by a 1.3 percent jump in manufacturing sales, a rebound after a 1.5 percent drop in February.

HEADLINE: For Shipyard and Region, Shock and Vow to Fight

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK; Katie Zezima contributed reporting from Boston for this article.

DATELINE: KITTERY, Me., May 13 

 BODY:
For 32 years, Wayne Countryman has worked at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard here, and he has certainly heard the rumors before, whisperings and worries that the shipyard might end up on the Pentagon chopping block.
 But Mr. Countryman, a 57-year-old pipe fitter for nuclear submarines, was still stunned when the news came on Friday that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had recommended shutting down Portsmouth, the country's oldest naval shipyard and an employer of some 4,800 people from Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
 ''We're patriotic up here,'' said Mr. Countryman, scooping coleslaw off his plate during lunch at the Crooked Lane Cafe, which perches on the Piscataqua River just outside the gates of the 205-year-old shipyard. ''We feel like we are doing something for the country. It's more than just a job to these people.'' 
 Mr. Countryman joined hundreds of shipyard workers to rally in protest on the windy waterfront on Friday, hours after the Pentagon's announcement. And like the devastated mayors, councilmembers, Chamber of Commerce officials, and legislators from across Maine and New Hampshire, he said he was most taken aback because people here consider the Portsmouth yard to be state of the art.
 Long gone are the wooden sailing ships it built when it was founded. In their place are nuclear-powered submarines, which workers at the shipyard refurbish and refuel.
 ''We're smaller. We're neater. We're cheaper. We do anything the Navy wants,'' he said. ''Most of us have traveled to help other shipyards out, all the way to Pearl Harbor. I think the country is being betrayed here. If they are going to close this place, they are cutting off their nose to spite their face.''
 Indeed, everyone here was buzzing about the bitter irony that just one day earlier, the secretary of the Navy gave Portsmouth a commendation for meritorious service, proclaiming that its workers ''consistently and superbly performed their mission while establishing a phenomenal record of cost, schedule, quality and safety performance.''
 Across the country, communities grappled with similar threats to cherished bases, integral to their lifeblood and livelihood. South Dakota faced the closure of Ellsworth Air Force Base, the state's second-largest employer. In Mississippi, the possible demise of the Naval Station in Pascagoula, long a protectorate of Senator Trent Lott, threatened economic shock. Connecticut faced the loss of the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, along with the loss of thousands of jobs.
 Portsmouth narrowly avoided being shut down in the 1995 base-closing round. But military officials said on Friday that the Navy will be building and operating fewer ships over the next 20 years and that Portsmouth became a casualty of the smaller fleet. The Navy will still have shipyards in Norfolk, Va.; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Bremerton, Wash., on Puget Sound. 
 After first deciding to close either Portsmouth or Pearl Harbor, the Navy chose Portsmouth because closing it would still leave one shipyard on the East Coast, in Norfolk, according to officials briefed on the plan.
 ''The claim they've been making all along is it's not enough work to justify having four public yards and one of them has to close,'' said Representative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine. ''Essentially they said two of the yards, Puget and Norfolk, had other kinds of activities that made them inappropriate to close, and it came down to Hawaii versus Portsmouth.''
 In the towns surrounding the Portsmouth shipyard, which has a payroll of $318 million, the closure would undoubtedly affect both the shipyard workers and the businesses that rely on them. The shipyard offers stable, skilled and high-paying blue-collar jobs, which would be hard to replicate in towns like Kittery and Sanford, Me. And with several other bases in New England also on the closure list, Portsmouth workers said they feared they might find that the only jobs in their field require moving out of the region.
 ''My husband will probably have to leave the field,'' said Wendy Tapley, whose husband, Brian, 44, has been an assistant fire chief at the shipyard for more than 25 years, with an income his wife called crucial to their ability to raise their two children. ''But I don't know what he will do. He gets paid more than what he would be able to make in the private or the municipal sector.''
 Ms. Tapley, who owns an insurance agency in York, Me., and whose father and two grandfathers ''worked on the yard,'' said her business would also ''one way or another feel the effects'' of the base's closing.
 And Mark Miller, owner of the Crooked Lane Cafe, said: ''I think it's probably going to be a slow bleed. Real estate will be up for sale, and the vacuum will be filled by affluent people. We will lose the blue-collar flavor of the area.''
 The Pentagon does not leave communities stranded when they are faced with base closings. It assigns special teams to each place to help plan how to convert closed bases into new enterprises. The Pentagon also has money for worker retraining and various benefit programs for civilians who lose their jobs. Earlier this year, Kittery received a $175,000 federal grant to study the effect of the shipyard's closing.
 But on Friday, local officials including the governors of Maine and New Hampshire vowed to fight to persuade the military to reconsider; Mr. Rumsfeld's recommendations now go to a base-closing commission.
 ''This is not over,'' said Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire.
 Mayor Evelyn Sirrell of Portsmouth, N.H., said at a news conference that she would ask residents to write letters to Washington and that she and other local officials would try to invest more public money in the lobbying effort.
 ''The president must decide,'' Mayor Sirrell said. ''We've got to get to him.''
 To demonstrate that anything is possible, two retired shipyard workers at the news conference held up the front page of the Portsmouth Herald from 1964; its headline: ''Local Shipyard to Close.''
 But some shipyard workers were treating the closure as inevitable. ''Once we're on the list, it's going to be hard to get off,'' said Scott Veilleux, 43, another pipe fitter, who had been laid off from the shipyard in the 1990's and started working there again about six years ago. ''Working for the Defense Department is a volatile trade. You never know what could happen. I survived the last time. I'll survive.''

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Trust Funds

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Don't be discouraged by this week's report that traffic congestion is worse than ever across America. Relief is on the way from Congress, thanks to one of the designated 3,800 ''high-priority projects'' in the new highway bill. It's a new transit system guaranteed to free you from bumper-to-bumper traffic, as long as you have a horse.
 This addition to the nation's transportation infrastructure is the brainchild of Representative Rick Boucher, a Democrat from the southwestern Virginia mountains that Daniel Boone traversed on the way to Kentucky. Mr. Boucher secured $750,000 of highway money for the ''construction of horse trails and assorted facilities'' in Jefferson National Forest. 
 When I expressed doubts to Mr. Boucher that these new horse trails would ease traffic on the roads, he replied, ''That's fair to say.'' He didn't expect any commuters to use them. But he insisted this really wasn't an unusual use of money from the highway trust fund, and he had a point.
 The trust fund was set up with the simple idea of making drivers pay for their roads by taxing the gasoline they bought. It worked at first, giving drivers wide-open Interstate highways, but eventually new drivers clogged the lanes, and the trust fund didn't yield enough money to build new roads or even maintain the existing ones. 
 The highway money dwindled partly because Congress didn't raise gas taxes to compensate for inflation and the higher fuel efficiency of cars, and partly because the trust fund kept getting raided. Gas taxes have been diverted to museums, a symphony hall, a riverside promenade, downtown landscaping projects, snowmobile trails and suburban transit systems that haven't been much more effective than horse trails in reducing road congestion. 
 As urban traffic got worse and roads deteriorated, highway planners kept hoping that drivers' anger would force Congress to raise gas taxes and reduce pork, but the planners eventually accepted political reality. They gave up on the trust fund to build new roads and turned to another source of money: tolls collected directly from drivers. 
 You might keep this history in mind during the debate about another trust fund's problem, the $11 trillion long-term deficit facing Social Security. Democrats are counting on the program's popularity to force Congress to raise taxes to preserve it, but if politicians were too afraid of voters' wrath to add a few pennies to the gasoline tax, should you count on them to vote for far more painful increases? 
 If they don't, the only way to preserve the promised benefits is to cut federal spending, a notion that seems quaintly utopian when you look at how hard Congress has fought the White House's attempts -- futile, so far -- to keep the highway bill within the budget. The highway cuts demanded by the administration are chump change compared with what will be needed to pay for the baby boomers' retirement.
 Around 2020, Congress must borrow money or find budget savings equal to the cost of the entire highway bill (about $50 billion per year in today's dollars) to cover the cash shortfall of Social Security. And then the budget cuts get worse each year as the annual shortfall quintuples over the following decade.
 Maybe before then Congress will somehow turn frugal or work up the nerve for big tax increases or, miraculously, set aside the surplus that baby boomers are currently paying into the trust fund. But right now Congress spends the cash as fast as it gets it (and tosses i.o.u.'s to the Social Security Administration). The Social Security trust fund is essentially a slush fund, as an economist, Lawrence Hunter, told the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday.
 He and other experts urged the committee to stop raiding the fund and find a way -- personal accounts or some other scheme -- to save the money, but the Democrats on the committee were in no mood for such drastic measures. ''No matter what any of you say,'' Representative Charles Rangel told the economists, most people ''believe that their benefits are guaranteed, and their kids believe it, and their grandkids believe that they are entitled to this benefit.''
 The part about the grandkids isn't quite right, at least according to polls showing young people's skepticism about getting their promised checks. Nearly half of them have already started their own retirement accounts. They, like the drivers now paying tolls for roads that aren't being built with their gas taxes, seem to understand a lesson about trust funds managed by Congress: be prepared to pay your own way.

HEADLINE: French Economist to Lead World Trade Organization

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Pascal Lamy, a French economist and former European trade commissioner, was set on Friday to become the next head of the World Trade Organization, the global body that establishes and enforces international trade laws.
 An energetic diplomat with a deep understanding of the issues and players involved in trade, Mr. Lamy is expected to elevate the profile of the W.T.O. when he takes over as director general on Sept. 1.
 His first task will be to revive the global trade talks known as the Doha round, which are aimed at helping developing nations, in particular. More broadly, Mr. Lamy will face increasing skepticism about the benefits of trade as rich and poor nations struggle to keep up with changes brought about with the increasing speed of globalization. 
 Mr. Lamy became the choice of the 148-member body after his last rival dropped out on Friday. He said through a spokeswoman, Catherine Ray, that he would have no comment on Friday.
 The W.T.O.'s general council will make Mr. Lamy's selection official at a meeting on May 26.
 A social democrat at home, Mr. Lamy is considered something of a political anomaly in the world of trade, which may account for his selection. He won the support of the industrialized nations because of his ambitious agenda to expand trade and enforce trade rules in his five years as the European trade commissioner. Under his stewardship, the European Union won a string of crucial victories before the W.T.O.'s judicial panels to enforce global trade laws.
 At the same time, he became the preferred candidate of most developing countries because of his attempts to develop trade agreements to meet the needs of poorer nations. Of particular note was his role persuading the European Union to begin reducing its agricultural subsidies, especially for food exports that undercut poor nations. For his efforts he was strongly criticized by his own government for giving away too much in the agricultural debates.
 In trying to define his philosophy, Mr. Lamy, who is 58, says he believes in ''globalization by the rules or managed globalization.''
 ''Trade is good and it is a necessity, but it is not sufficient for economic development and poverty alleviation,'' Mr. Lamy said in an interview this month. ''It's fine in theory to open up markets, but someone has to push for the full benefits of all nations.''
 In contrast to the closed-door selections of heads of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Lamy was chosen in a relatively open contest with candidates from Brazil, Mauritius and Uruguay.
 Each man -- no woman was in the contest -- was nominated by his country and then presented his platform, which was posted on the W.T.O. Web site. Then, in a series of three rounds, a committee polled every delegation in private to determine which candidate was preferred. Mr. Lamy came out on top in each round.
 The other remaining candidate, Carlos Perez del Castillo of Uruguay, announced on Friday that he was withdrawing from the race.
 Mr. Lamy's term runs for four years and is renewable for one term.
 He will succeed Supachai Panitchpakdi, who steps down at the end of August. He was appointed this week as the new head of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
 The United States trade representative, Rob Portman, praised the selection of Mr. Lamy and predicted that he would be '' a strong public advocate for the W.T.O. as an institution and for open markets.''
 Despite major disputes with the United States over American steel supports, European opposition to hormone-raised beef, export subsidies and government supports to Boeing and Airbus, Mr. Lamy developed a collegial relationship with Robert B. Zoellick, who was Mr. Portman's predecessor as trade representative.
 As representatives of the two most powerful economies, the two men were routinely credited with -- or blamed for -- shaping the terms of the trade round now under negotiation.
 When the United States voiced support for Mr. Lamy in April, there was concern that this was a trade-off for French support of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, as president of the World Bank.
 But at a news conference this year, Mr. Zoellick, now deputy secretary of state, said that there was no deal and that the United States was ''very comfortable'' with Mr. Lamy's candidacy.
 ''I obviously consider Commissioner Lamy both as a friend and a very accomplished trade leader,'' Mr. Zoellick said.

HEADLINE: Pentagon's Plan Brings Relief and Dismay

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Jason George contributed reporting from Oceanport, N.J., for this article, and David Staba from Niagara Falls, N.Y.

 BODY:
No state in the New York metropolitan region escaped unscathed from the Pentagon's list of recommended base closings yesterday, but if measured against expectations, New York came out ahead, New Jersey broke even and Connecticut lost badly.
 The list called for shutting the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Conn., the state's single major military installation and one of its prime economic pillars. By the Pentagon's calculations, closing the naval base would eliminate nearly 8,500 military and civilian jobs.
 The Pentagon also recommended closing three of Connecticut's Army Reserve stations and scaling back the Air Guard Station at Bradley International Airport. In all, the recommended measures would cost the state 8,586 jobs, a tally exceeded, according to Pentagon calculations, in only one other state: Maryland, with 9,293. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said the Pentagon's decision to close the naval base was ''cruel and unusual punishment that Connecticut does not deserve.'' 
 For decades, the naval base and the nearby Electric Boat shipyard have been mainstays of the Connecticut economy, and by the early 1990's, the cluster of defense industries in southeastern Connecticut was perhaps the single largest employer in the region, said John Markowicz, chairman of the Subase Realignment Coalition, which is made up of business and government officials who have been campaigning to keep the base open.
 Since then, the defense work force there has been slashed and surpassed in numbers by the casino industry's. But a study released this month by Gov. M. Jodi Rell said that the naval base, a related submarine school and a shipyard still contribute about $3.3 billion to the state's economy and support 31,500 jobs.
 The list is not final. It goes to the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or BRAC, which can add or subtract bases before submitting a final roster by Sept. 8. President Bush and Congress must accept or reject that list by Nov. 7. In the meantime, many of the targeted bases and the communities that rely on them will lobby fiercely for a reprieve.
 In New Jersey, the Pentagon's biggest target was Fort Monmouth, a major military base whose proposed closing would end 5,272 jobs.
 The list also urged closing or realigning several small bases in New Jersey, but adding more than 1,800 positions to the work force at four bases, including Picatinny Arsenal and Fort Dix. In total, the state would have a net loss of 3,760 jobs, the Pentagon said.
 ''It's a mixed bag,'' said Alex Formuzis, a spokesman for Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey.
 The prevailing sentiment yesterday in the Jersey Shore communities surrounding Fort Monmouth was less calm. ''Obviously it's not a good day,'' said Mayor Maria Gatta of Oceanport, N.J., where many businesses draw clients from the base. ''We're not going to sit back and say, 'Thank you very much.' We're going to work hard to get off this list.''
 The heaviest blow in New York was the recommended closing of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, which is Niagara County's second-largest employer and home to the 914th Air Lift Wing and the 107th Air Refueling Wing. Personnel would be sent to bases in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine and Texas. According to the Pentagon, the move would cost 642 jobs, although a local advocacy group created to promote the base says it employs more than 3,000 people.
 Merrell A. Lane, chairman of the group, estimated that the base generates $150 million a year for the state's economy. ''The way things are in western New York,'' he said, ''it would be a real struggle to absorb the loss of another employer.''
 The Pentagon also recommended closing or shrinking 11 other small bases or military offices around New York, including the dissolution of a finance and accounting unit at Griffiss Business and Technology Park, in Rome, and trimming 137 jobs in a neighboring high-tech military research laboratory.
 Still, the feeling among many public officials was that the state had dodged a bullet.
 ''We are all relieved,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer said. ''The glass is 3/4 full, which is a lot better than we thought it would be at the beginning of the week.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the effect of the Pentagon's base-closing plan on the New York region misstated the rank of Connecticut among states in the number of jobs that would be lost. It is first, not second, with a projected loss of 8,586 jobs. The article also misstated the effect on Maryland. That state would gain 9,293 jobs, not lose them.

HEADLINE: Rebuffing Bush, 132 Mayors Embrace Kyoto Rules

BYLINE: By ELI SANDERS

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 13 

 BODY:
Unsettled by a series of dry winters in this normally wet city, Mayor Greg Nickels has begun a nationwide effort to do something the Bush administration will not: carry out the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.
 Mr. Nickels, a Democrat, says 131 other likeminded mayors have joined a bipartisan coalition to fight global warming on the local level, in an implicit rejection of the administration's policy. 
 The mayors, from cities as liberal as Los Angeles and as conservative as Hurst, Tex., represent nearly 29 million citizens in 35 states, according to Mayor Nickels's office. They are pledging to have their cities meet what would have been a binding requirement for the nation had the Bush administration not rejected the Kyoto Protocol: a reduction in heat-trapping gas emissions to levels 7 percent below those of 1990, by 2012. 
 On Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg brought New York City into the coalition, the latest Republican mayor to join.
 Mr. Nickels said that to achieve the 7 percent reduction, Seattle was requiring cruise ships that dock in its bustling port to turn off their diesel engines while resupplying and to rely only on electric power provided by the city, a requirement that has forced some ships to retrofit. And by the end of this year the city's power utility, Seattle City Light, will be the only utility in the country with no net emissions of greenhouse gases, the mayor's office said.
 Salt Lake City has become Utah's largest buyer of wind power in order to meet its reduction target. In New York, the Bloomberg administration is trying to reduce emissions from the municipal fleet by buying hybrid electric-gasoline-powered vehicles.
 Nathan Mantua, assistant director of the Center for Science in the Earth System at the University of Washington, which estimates the impact of global warming on the Northwest, said the coalition's efforts were laudable, but probably of limited global impact.
 ''It is clearly a politically significant step in the right direction,'' Dr. Mantua said. ''It may be an environmentally significant step for air quality in the cities that are going to do this, but for the global warming problem it is a baby step.''
 Mr. Nickels said he decided to act when the Kyoto Protocol took effect in February without the support of the United States, the world's largest producer of heat-trapping gases. On that day, he announced he would try to carry out the agreement himself, at least as far as Seattle was concerned, and called on other mayors to join him. 
 The coalition is not the first effort by local leaders to take up the initiative on climate change. California, under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, is moving to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and Gov. George A. Pataki of New York, also a Republican, has led efforts to reduce power plant emissions in the Northeast. But the coalition is unusual in its open embrace of an international agreement that the Bush administration has spurned, Mayor Nickels's office said, and is significant because cities are huge contributors to the nation's emission of heat-trapping gases. 
 Michele St. Martin, communications director for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the Kyoto Protocol would have resulted in a loss of five million jobs in the United States and could raise energy prices. 
 Ms. St. Martin said President Bush ''favors an aggressive approach'' on climate change, ''one that fosters economic growth that will lead to new technology and innovation.'' 
 But many of the mayors said they were acting precisely out of concern for the economic vitality of their cities. Mr. Nickels, for example, pointed out that the dry winters and the steep decline projected in the glaciers of the Cascade range could affect Seattle's supply of drinking water and hydroelectric power. 
 The mayor of low-lying New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, a Democrat, said he joined the coalition because a projected rise in sea levels ''threatens the very existence of New Orleans.'' 
 In Hawaii, the mayor of Maui County, Alan Arakawa, a Republican, said he joined because he was frustrated by the administration's slowness to recognize the scientific consensus that climate change was happening because of human interference.
 ''I'm hoping it sends a message they really need to start looking at what's really happening in the real world,'' Mayor Arakawa said. 
 Mayor Nickels said it was no accident that most cities that had joined were in coastal states. The mayor of Alexandria, Va., is worried about increased flooding; mayors in Florida are worried about hurricanes. 
 But Mr. Nickels has also found supporters in the country's interior. Jerry Ryan, the Republican mayor of Bellevue, Neb., said he had signed on because of concerns about the effects of droughts on his farming community. Mr. Ryan described himself as a strong Bush supporter, but said he felt that the president's approach to global warming should be more like his approach to terrorism. 
 ''You've got to ask, 'Is it remotely possible that there is a threat?''' he said. ''If the answer is yes, you've got to act now.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Puts Limits On Clothing From China

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, reacting to a flood of Chinese clothing imports since January, announced on Friday that it would impose new quotas on cotton shirts, trousers and underwear.
 Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, said late Friday that the administration was invoking its right to impose quotas, or safeguards, because the imports were disrupting the American market.
 Mr. Gutierrez said in a statement that his action ''demonstrates this administration's commitment to leveling the playing field for U.S. industry by enforcing our trade agreements.'' 
 Retailers had gone to court to block quotas, arguing that they would raise the prices of clothing for consumers. Since Jan. 1, the prices of imported Chinese apparel have dropped as the volume has increased.
 The quotas will take effect when the administration notifies China of its decision and discussions are held about the size of the limits. China has warned that it will resist any attempt to limit its textile and apparel exports.
 Pressure was building on the administration to slow Chinese imports even before the global textile quota system ended on Jan. 1. Since then China's booming textile and apparel industry, unhampered by quotas, has grown significantly in some of the few areas where the American industry still produces mass-market clothing.
 Since Jan. 1, Chinese exports of cotton trousers to the United States have grown by 1,500 percent and shipments of cotton knit shirts are up 1,350 percent, according to trade figures. At the same time, the United States textile industry has lost 16,000 jobs and 18 factories have closed, according to reports.
 The American textile industry petitioned the administration to slow the surge of the imports, asking Washington to invoke clauses in the agreement it signed with Beijing when China joined the World Trade Organization.
 With the action on Friday, the United States will limit growth in Chinese imports of cotton shirts, trousers and underwear to 7.5 percent a year. 
 ''The fast action to reimpose quotas by the Bush administration today has saved thousands of textile jobs in this country and we are extremely grateful,'' said Cass Johnson, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations.
 The announcement came one day after President Bush met with the leaders of five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic to promote a trade pact with these nations that has stalled in Congress.
 The textile industry has opposed the pact, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, as another threat to the American industry, but Mr. Johnson's group broke with the other trade associations and endorsed the pact, known as Cafta, this week.
 Kimberly Elliott, a trade specialist at the Institute for International Economics, said that the administration reached a quick decision in favor of the American textile industry in part to win more support for Cafta.
 ''The administration has been working the link between the safeguards and Cafta for some time, but I think they would have done this eventually even if Cafta didn't exist,'' Ms. Elliott said. ''If the administration is going to take a hit from China for this, it might as well get some benefit for Cafta.''
 The European Union has also begun investigations into the huge increases in imports of inexpensive Chinese textiles and apparel with an eye toward imposing quotas as well.
 Pascal Lamy, the former European trade commissioner who was picked on Friday to become the new head of the World Trade Organization, warned last week against imposing quotas. 
 He said that the trade body had been easing out the quota system over the last decade and that all countries had been given ample opportunity to prepare for the changes.
 But the lawmakers in Congress say that it is China that fails to follow the rules. Several bills are being debated that would impose penalties on China for currency manipulation, violating intellectual property rights and following other forbidden practices like giving lenient loans and export tax rebates.

Pentagon Proposes Closing Nearly 180 Military Bases.
The Pentagon recommended closing nearly 180 installations and offices from Hawaii to Maine, in the first major restructuring of the nation's vast military network in a decade.
 Ranging from tiny Army Reserve centers to giant Air Force bases that have been the economic anchors of their communities, the proposed closings, consolidations or reductions of some 800 military facilities and the loss of 26,000 military and civilian jobs sent shock waves across all 50 states.

HEADLINE: A More Private Jordan Fades From the N.B.A.

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
In the last image of Michael Jordan bouncing a basketball, he is wearing the blue, black, white and gold jersey of the Washington Wizards, a uniform that never fit.
 Two years after Jordan retired, for the third time, as a player, and was fired by the Wizards owner Abe Pollin, he is only as tangible as the bronze statue of him outside the United Center in Chicago. 
 The team with which everyone associates him -- the Bulls -- lost in the first round of the National Basketball Association playoffs to the team -- the Wizards -- that disassociated itself from him. 
 Now Washington is on the brink of elimination, trailing by 3-0 to the Miami Heat, and Jordan's connection to the playoffs is fading farther into the background. 
 At 42, he retains his magnetic marketability and reigns as the nation's most recognizable sports celebrity. But Jordan has slipped into a new, more private life in Chicago. He declined to be interviewed for this article.
 Jordan continues to wait for the right opportunity and price to buy an N.B.A. team. In the meantime, he has taken up a new sport: motorcycle racing.
 He is not riding professionally, but in January 2004, Jordan formed his own team -- Michael Jordan Motorsports Suzuki -- that now supports three riders on the growing road-racing circuit. 
 Jordan was at a race in Birmingham, Ala., on the weekend the playoffs began and is expected to be at today's event in Sonoma, Calif. 
 ''M.J. is an enthusiast,'' Kenny Abbott, Jordan-Suzuki's general manager, said by phone yesterday morning in Sonoma. ''Everything he does he is thinking about motorcycles, the race team and how can things be better. He's very involved on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis.''
 Though Jordan grew up riding dirt bikes and watched Nascar races in North Carolina, he is not the ultimate gear-head. 
 ''He's not going to ask us what kind of sprocket size we're using or about a fuel injection map,'' Abbott said. ''He'll look at the suits, the colors, the apparel. He thinks more about the image, the energy, where we're at in the lap charts, how the race will shape up.''
 Ever the strategist, Jordan motivates just by his presence in the paddock, Abbott said. 
 ''Michael just has that way about him where he can walk into a room and the energy changes,'' he said. ''It's like, 'Hey, M.J.'s here.' There's a nervousness, is everything picked up and cleaned up? Then it's like, 'M.J.'s here!' He's everybody's best friend, says hello to everybody, doesn't leave anybody out. He doesn't micromanage, but he wants what he wants.'' 
 Jordan is still searching for a basketball team for which he can be the majority owner. He thought he might get that chance with the Wizards, where he was a minority owner, but Pollin did not want him as part of management. 
 Since 2003, Jordan has tried to purchase the Milwaukee Bucks (owner Herb Kohl decided not to sell) and to become involved with the Charlotte Bobcats franchise. Although Jordan spoke with Robert Johnson, the owner of the Charlotte expansion team, his role with the team would not have been as significant as he wanted. 
 ''I think there's not an owner in the N.B.A. -- and that includes Abe -- who would not want the greatest basketball player in the world to be part of the league,'' Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, said in a telephone interview recently. ''I know as a friend, that same competitive zeal he has would show in the way he would manage his organization.''
 David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, is eager to have Jordan back in the league, but he said no teams were for sale. ''I call him a value shopper; he's not going to be involved in any situation unless it meets certain economic parameters, and he hasn't found that yet,'' Stern said. 
 Meanwhile, Jordan has spent more time watching other basketball teams in Chicago -- those of his sons, Jeffrey, 16 and Marcus, 14. 
 Bill Wennington, Jordan's former teammate in Chicago, has a son who plays in the same A.A.U. league as Jordan's sons. ''Michael would sit up in the high corner of the bleachers, usually with a bodyguard,'' Wennington said recently. 
 Jordan attended a few Bulls games this season and would stop in the locker room to hang out with the team trainers. John Paxson, the Bulls' general manager and a former teammate, spoke with Jordan during the season and the playoffs.
 ''I just think he has other things he wants to be doing,'' Wennington said. 
 Jordan owns restaurants, oversees his clothing brand with Nike, and still has six other endorsement contracts. In a rare appearance, Jordan showed up at the Final Four in St. Louis to cheer North Carolina to the national championship. 
 In 2002, Jordan's wife, Juanita, filed for divorce shortly after Jordan admitted to an extramarital affair. Jordan filed suit against his former lover, Karla Knafel, for extortion, a case that is at the Illinois Supreme Court. He and Juanita reconciled. 
 But Jordan's private life had no effect on his public appeal, said Henry Shafer, the vice president of At Q Marketing Evaluations on Long Island, a company that measures the popularity of athletes. Jordan's popularity continues to supersede that of any other athlete, Shafer said.
 Jordan's absence also has not substantially hurt the N.B.A.'s appeal.
 ''The N.B.A. does not need Michael; with the television ratings, and the league's success, it shows there is life after Michael Jordan,'' said Bob Williams, president of Chicago-based Burns Entertainment Sports Marketing. ''He lifted the N.B.A. to a level it has never been to and may never get to again -- but for now, the N.B.A. manages just fine without Michael.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A sports article on Saturday about Michael Jordan's fading connection to the N.B.A. misstated the name of a Long Island company that measures the popularity of athletes, as well as the surname and title of the official who commented that Jordan's private life had no effect on his public appeal. The speaker was Henry Schafer (not Shafer), executive vice president of Marketing Evaluations/The Q Scores Company, not vice president.

HEADLINE: The Mystery of the Insurgency

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AMERICAN forces in Iraq have often been accused of being slow to apply hard lessons from Vietnam and elsewhere about how to fight an insurgency. Yet, it seems from the outside, no one has shrugged off the lessons of history more decisively than the insurgents themselves.
 The insurgents in Iraq are showing little interest in winning hearts and minds among the majority of Iraqis, in building international legitimacy, or in articulating a governing program or even a unified ideology or cause beyond expelling the Americans. They have put forward no single charismatic leader, developed no alternative government or political wing, displayed no intention of amassing territory to govern now. 
 Rather than employing the classic rebel tactic of provoking the foreign forces to use clumsy and excessive force and kill civilians, they are cutting out the middleman and killing civilians indiscriminately themselves, in addition to more predictable targets like officials of the new government. Bombings have escalated in the last two weeks, and on Thursday a bomb went off in heavy traffic in Baghdad, killing 21 people. 
 This surge in the killing of civilians reflects how mysterious the long-term strategy remains -- and how the rebels' seeming indifference to the past patterns of insurgency is not necessarily good news for anyone.
 It is not surprising that reporters, and evidently American intelligence agents, have had great difficulty penetrating this insurgency. What is surprising is that the fighters have made so little effort to advertise unified goals.
 Counter-insurgency experts are baffled, wondering if the world is seeing the birth of a new kind of insurgency; if, as in China in the 1930's or Vietnam in the 1940's, it is taking insurgents a few years to organize themselves; or if, as some suspect, there is a simpler explanation. 
 ''Instead of saying, 'What's the logic here, we don't see it,' you could speculate, there is no logic here,'' said Anthony James Joes, a professor of political science at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia and the author of several books on the history of guerrilla warfare. The attacks now look like ''wanton violence,'' he continued. ''And there's a name for these guys: Losers.''
 ''The insurgents are doing everything wrong now,'' he said. ''Or, anyway, I don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.''
 Steven Metz, of the Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, said the insurgency could still be sorting itself out. Yet, he said, ''It really is significant that even two years in there hasn't been anything like any kind of political ideology or political spokesman or political wing emerging. It really is a nihilistic insurgency.'' 
 He warned that this hydra-headed quality could make the insurgents hard to crush, even as the lack of unity makes it unlikely they will rule Iraq. ''It makes it harder to eradicate the insurgency, but it also makes it more difficult for insurgents to gain their ultimate objective -- if that is to control the country,'' he said.
 That no one knows if that is the objective is, by historical standards, one of several remarkable, perplexing features of this fight.
 A clear cause -- one with broad support -- is usually taken for granted by experts as a prerequisite for successful insurgency. 
 But insurgents in Iraq appear to be fighting for varying causes: Baath Party members are fighting for some sort of restoration of the old regime; Sunni Muslims are presumably fighting to prevent domination by the Shiite majority; nationalists are fighting to drive out the Americans; and foreign fighters want to turn Iraq into a battlefield of a global religious struggle. Some men are said to fight for money; organized crime may play a role. 
 This incoherence is something new. ''If you look at 20th-century insurgencies, they all tend to be fairly coherent in terms of their ideology,'' Dr. Metz said. ''Most of the serious insurgencies, you could sit down and say, 'Here's what they want.'''
 In Iraq, insurgent groups appear to share a common immediate goal of ridding Iraq of an American presence, a goal that may find sympathy among Iraqis angry about poor electricity and water service and high unemployment.
 Average Iraqis may distinguish among the groups within the insurgency and their tactics. Still, the insurgents haven't publicly proposed a governmental alternative, and their anti-American message has been muddied by their attacks on civilians and by the election of an Iraqi government that has not asked the Americans to leave. 
 If the insurgency is trying to overthrow this regime, it is contending with a formidable obstacle that successful rebels of the 20th century generally did not face: A democratically elected government. One of the last century's most celebrated theorists and practitioners of revolution, Che Guevara, called that obstacle insurmountable. 
 ''Where a government has come to power through some form of popular vote, fraudulent or not, and maintains at least an appearance of constitutional legality,'' he wrote, ''the guerrilla outbreak cannot be promoted, since the possibilities of peaceful struggle have not yet been exhausted.'' 
 The insurgents' choice of adversary is unusual. But the recent surge in violence at least follows a time-tested pattern. The insurgents are apparently trying to swamp any progress toward stability with evidence and images of chaos. The killing in that time of at least 250 policemen, soldiers and recruits also fits a pattern, since insurgents have customarily made targets of accused collaborators to isolate a regime. Less obvious is the goal in the killing of some 150 civilians. 
 The relationship between insurgents and the general population is always complex. Mao Zedong famously postulated that guerrillas move among the people as fish move through water. But he also warned that ''a revolution is not a dinner party,'' and many insurgents, including the Vietcong, effectively used terror -- often selectively applied -- against civilians to compel segments of the population into at least passive support.
 From his experience fomenting Arab revolt against the Turks, T.E. Lawrence concluded that insurgents needed only 2 percent active support from the population, and 98 percent passive support. 
 What is curious about the Iraqi tactic is that it appears aimed at creating active opposition. The insurgency is powered by Sunnis; the civilians they have killed have been overwhelmingly Shiites and Kurds. The goal appears to be to split apart the fragile governing coalition and foment sectarian strife. 
 Yet if the insurgents achieve all-out civil conflict, the likely losers are the Sunnis themselves, since they are a minority. Having governed for decades in Iraq, Sunnis are accustomed to the whip hand and may simply assume they will be able to regain control. Or perhaps they are betting that chaos will lead to partition, allowing Sunnis to govern themselves.
 David Galula, author of a systematic 1964 study, ''Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice,'' noted the effectiveness of force and intimidation as tools of an insurgency. But he added a crucial caveat: ''There is, of course, a practical if not ethical limit to the use of force; the basic rule is never to antagonize at any one time more people than can be handled.''
 That was one of several mistakes that the Communist rebels made in Greece in the late 1940's. Once the country was liberated from the Germans, the Communists had no majority cause, and they chose to confront a democratically elected government. Lacking much industry, Greece had few proletarians, and the peasants were not particularly restive.
 Not that the Communists cared. They had contempt for the peasants and alienated them further by extorting food and reinforcements through threats and executions. They burned villages in hopes of making the peasants a burden on the American-backed government and crippling the Greek economy. 
 THE guerrillas benefited from support from the Communist dictatorships to Greece's north. Then, in July 1949, Tito shut the Yugoslav border, eliminating Yugoslavia as a sanctuary. But Professor Joes argued that, by then, the insurgents were doomed anyway. ''They had already shot themselves in the feet and both knees,'' he said. In Iraq, American and Iraqi troops have embarked on an offensive in the west partly in hopes of cutting off what the military command says is a flow of foreign fighters and materiel across the Syrian border. But military experts say that without stationing thousands of troops along the border, the military has little chance of closing it off. 
 If the immediate objective of the insurgents is relatively limited -- not to topple the government and drive the Americans out now but to pin them down and bleed them -- that at least would have solid precedents. As the counterterrorism expert Bruce Hoffman noted in a paper for Rand last year, ''For more than 30 years, a dedicated cadre of approximately 200 to 400 I.R.A. gunmen and bombers frustrated the maintenance of law and order in Northern Ireland, requiring the prolonged deployment of tens of thousands of British troops.'' Yet the I.R.A. is still far from its larger goal: to drive the British out.
 Among Iraq's insurgents, the jihadists are one group that has suggested a sweeping goal. They want to establish a new caliphate -- a religious regime with expansive boundaries. For them, the destruction and chaos in Iraq may represent creative forces, means of heightening the contrasts among sects, religions and whole civilizations. Searching for parallels, several experts compared the insurgents in Iraq to the violent anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. That movement took root among the alienated and uprooted who could find no place in modern society. 
 Yet it may prove to be one of history's humbling lessons that history itself fails to illuminate the conflict under way in Iraq. No one really knows what the insurgents are up to.
 ''It clearly makes sense to the people who are doing it,'' said Dr. Loren B. Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. ''And that more than anything else tells us how little we understand the region.''

HEADLINE: The Day After Peace: Designing Palestine

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
HIS sense for Palestinians' nostalgia, for their attachment to the land, even for what their cities actually looked like -- that would all come much later. On a Saturday in January last year, in his design studio in Santa Monica, Calif., all Doug Suisman had to go on were some maps and aerial photographs, an adrenaline spike supplied by a deadline, and the grandeur of his commission: design the state of Palestine. 
 Even by the standards of these vivid, unpredictable days in the Middle East, the proposition seems hubristic: As part of a two-year, $2 million inquiry to determine whether Palestine could succeed, the Rand Corporation turned to Mr. Suisman, a hip if civic-minded architect with sparse background in the region, to envision the state. He had been to Israel once, in 1972, and he had never visited the major Palestinian cities. 
 Rand had judged that for all the attention lavished on the possible borders between Israel and a notional Palestine, no one had expended much imagination on the structure of the latter. Palestine had persisted as a dream or nightmare, as an abstraction to occupy diplomats and politicians, not as a concrete challenge for urban planners. Yet both the American president and the Israeli prime minister had now called for the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. If the world was serious about a two-state solution, Rand reasoned, someone had to start planning Palestine, particularly since its population was about to surge. The alternative -- a failed, impoverished and angry ward on Israel's doorstep, if not in its living room -- posed a problem, a danger, for the world. 
 Rand, an independent nonprofit think tank with a reputation for dispassion and a record of advancing the space program and the military, has concluded that the challenge can be met. It has delivered up a gimlet-eyed survey of life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that shows how far Palestinians are from viable statehood: the crippled, dependent economy, the ''corrupt, nonrepresentative and authoritarian rule,'' the inadequate water supply, the pressure of Israeli occupation. It has suggested a long list of improvements, which it says would cost $33 billion over 10 years. And it has twinned its appraisal with a second study, a vision of what might be, the vision that Mr. Suisman eventually dreamed up that Saturday in his studio. 
 Steven N. Simon, one of the leaders of the Rand study, recruited Mr. Suisman after sounding out several urban planners about a possible design. Mr. Suisman, who has designed public spaces and transit systems, principally around Los Angeles, was ''the most enthusiastic,'' Mr. Simon said. ''He saw the potential in a way that maybe only a naif can.'' 
 Rand, where the analysis is meant to be astringent, not romantic, has now bet heavily on naivete. It has presented Mr. Suisman's idea of Palestine to the White House, the European Union, the World Bank and others, as well as to the Palestinians and Israelis. The idea has captured the attention, and imagination, of at least some Palestinian policymakers. 
 At its most prosaic, the proposal calls for a mere connecting of the dots, for a high-speed train and fiber-optic network curving through the West Bank and Gaza to link the main Palestinian cities and towns. Yet it amounts to a reimagining not only of the landscape, fractured as it is by checkpoints and army positions after years of conflict, but also of the Palestinian experience. In place of Palestinian political and social fragmentation, Mr. Suisman proposes the most modern and swift of connections. In place of the Palestinian condition of near paralysis, he posits a state of motion. He calls it ''the Arc.'' It is a glimpse, seen so rarely these days, of a reconciling land, post-conflict, post-occupation, post-terrorism.
 When Mr. Suisman finished a recent presentation to Palestinians in a darkened meeting room in Ramallah, on the West Bank, Jihad al Wazir, the deputy finance minister, broke the silence by saying he had tears in his eyes.
 ''I was very moved,'' Mr. al Wazir said later. ''It had that beauty of simplicity of design, and coherence, and comprehensiveness.'' Some of the Palestinians' own planners, he said, ''were lost in the details, without a unifying framework or a vision for a future of the Palestinian state.''
 When he was initially considering the maps, Mr. Suisman did not dwell on past or present details. He thought about what was coming, in particular the projection by Rand's analysts that the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza would almost double in the next 15 years, to 6.6 million, from 3.6 million. 
 TO brainstorm, Mr. Suisman recruited Robert Lane of the Regional Plan Association in Manhattan, an old friend from Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. The two were searching for what their mentor, Klaus Herdeg, had taught them to think of as ''formal structure'': not a state's boundaries, but the patterns of human life as shaped by its setting. 
 The world thinks of the West Bank as lacking a clear political boundary, but, as the two men discovered, it actually suffers from too many of them. The planners were daunted by the crazy quilt of Israeli settlements and Palestinian towns, overlaid with patchwork zones of Israeli or Palestinian control. Mr. Lane recalled being astonished at ''how disaggregated and discontinuous this landscape was -- how incoherent.''
 So, to remove layers left by decades of war and politics, they put tracing paper over the maps and began copying core elements: the major population centers, the main roads, the high ground. Then they laid the sheets over one another to find common shapes. They noticed the line of mountain ridges sweeping from north to south along the West Bank. They noticed how Palestinians had clustered in towns along the western faces of the ridges, where rainfall off the Mediterranean was more abundant.
 ''About midway through the day,'' Mr. Suisman recalled, ''we were looking at the patterns, and I said, 'This sounds crazy, but I think we've got to do this' -- and I just drew a line.''
 His high-speed railway would run for 70 miles along the West Bank ridges, linking Jenin in the north with Hebron in the south. The railway would then slip like a fishhook through the Negev desert to attach the West Bank to the Gaza Strip, running 130 miles in all and establishing the connection between the two territories that development officials consider essential to a Palestinian economy. Alongside the railway, Mr. Suisman proposes stretching a water conduit, a trench for fiber-optic cable, power lines, a toll road and a strip of parkland. 
 He would site the train stations at a distance from existing city centers, connecting each pairing with other public transportation. The idea was to create new frames for housing and businesses, to accommodate the expanding population while preserving open space. He compares his crosshatched line to an embryo's backbone and, inevitably, an olive branch.
 The Rand studies were prompted by California-based donors hoping to see an end to the conflict. Carol and David Richards, financed the detailed study of the viability of a Palestinian state. Mr. Richards said he acted after Mr. Bush came out in favor of a two-state solution. 
 ''I'm a supporter of Israel, but I think their occupation of the West Bank is hurtful to Israel,'' said Mr. Richards, a former mutual fund manager who is now a private investor. ''The policy is wrong, and we as Americans have condoned it and supported it.'' 
 The Arc grew out of a proposal by another donor, Guilford Glazer, that Rand design a new Palestinian city to accommodate any returning refugees of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war and their descendants. Born in Knoxville, Tenn., in 1921, Mr. Glazer, a real estate developer, was partly inspired by the model of the Tennessee Valley Authority, believing the Palestinians would benefit from a project of similar scale. (Rand estimated that the Arc would cost about $6 billion, and that it would help the Palestinians power their economy by employing 100,000 to 160,000 Palestinians a year for five years.) When the Arc is built, he said, ''it'll be too precious to lose, and it'll cause them to resist violence.''
 From the start, Mr. Suisman shied away from Mr. Glazer's ''hub'' model of a single new city. Such creations, like Washington or Brasilia, can take decades to mature and soak up national resources in the meantime. Mr. Glazer signed off on his more linear approach.
 Through the eyes of anyone steeped in the conflict, the Arc can look like pure fantasy. Israel plans to unilaterally withdraw its settlers and soldiers later this year from Gaza. Yet the two sides are barely speaking, and the internally divided Palestinian leadership has not decided what to do with the existing infrastructure.
 Rand conjures visions of tourists, businessmen and freight landing at a new seaport and at Gaza's airport, and then being whisked in minutes to places like Bethlehem and Nablus. It foresees eventual links to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and major Israeli cities. But citing arms smuggling and terrorist intent, Israel shows no sign of releasing control of the crossings to Gaza and the West Bank.
 Writing in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, the columnist Meron Benvenisti called the Arc ''a fable for adults.'' He said its assumptions of a Palestinian state with border control would never be realized. ''All the plans laden with goodwill and positive attitudes,'' he wrote, ''turn into bittersweet legends that come down to wondering what might have been, if only.''
 The people from Rand are a little cynical about how cynical some of those steeped in the conflict are. ''They're just so totally aware of where every roadblock is,'' said C. Ross Anthony, Rand's director of global health and another leader of the survey team, referring to some local planners. ''So the idea of a simple line is not something that would immediately come to their minds, because they're immersed in the details of the day to day.''
 Mr. Suisman and the Rand analysts also sought to stay above the bog of the region's politics, focusing not on what a peace agreement might look like but on how life might be lived on what they called ''the day after peace.''
 But when Mr. Suisman finally traveled to Israel and the West Bank this year, in February and March, he learned how little stock people there put in claims of neutrality. Rand's very attempt to avoid politics made its proposal politically suspect. Accustomed as they are to international support and advice, Palestinian officials did not object in principle to an outsider's proposal -- a Jewish outsider's proposal, no less. ''I didn't know that he is Jewish, but for me it doesn't make any difference,'' said Ghassan Khatib, the minister of planning. ''There are many Jewish people living outside who have objective views.'' 
 The problem was in the details of the plan and in its packaging. Mr. Suisman was startled to come under sharp questioning when he presented the Arc to the Palestinian officials most intent on the political details, the lawyers and analysts of the Negotiations Support Unit of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Was it just a coincidence, he recalled being asked by one, that his plan fit so perfectly with what she called Israel's annexation strategy for the West Bank?
 In fact, it was a coincidence. Rand had tried to duck the question of the settlements, one of the most incendiary issues of the conflict: ''We have chosen for the purposes of this study to set the question of Israeli settlements aside,'' reads the Arc proposal. But for Palestinians, to avoid the settlements is to endorse them. Some of the lawyers thought the Arc could help Israel hold onto much of the West Bank by guiding Palestinian development eastward, away from the boundary with Israel. They thought that Rand, which has not been a player in Palestinian-Israeli relations, was simply out to advertise itself by grabbing a piece of the high-profile action. Mr. Suisman and the other Rand presenters also came across as alarmingly slick. 
 One policy adviser of the Negotiations Support Unit said the Rand team should have been more politically alert. Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted by the P.L.O. to comment publicly, he said the Americans should have realized that Palestinians reflexively associated any transportation plan with systems of Israeli control, because Israel is already building tunnels and bypasses to connect Palestinian enclaves without disturbing the settlements. 
 After the tense initial meeting, some of the lawyers invited Mr. Suisman to dinner at one of Ramallah's sleekest restaurants, Darna. They smoked shisha pipes and eventually Mr. Suisman pulled out maps, spread them on the table and tried to allay their fears by discussing ways to more tightly connect the western towns of the West Bank to the Arc.
 Mollified in part, members of the unit ultimately produced an internal response detailing pros and cons of the Arc. The lawyers were most pleased with elements of the proposal that supported Palestinian negotiating positions, including its advocacy of a West Bank-to-Gaza link. 
 Israel also responded cautiously to the idea, which Rand presented to officials in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. David Siegel, the spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said, ''The report has many elements that are positive, and we support the development of a Palestinian economy.'' 
 He said the main issue was the ''free flow of goods and people,'' but added, ''This is contingent upon political and security reforms that need to take place.'' Rand is also pressing for an overhaul of Palestinian security.
 Both sides have reason to question the studies' success at staying above the political fray, because, in the end, they have inescapable political implications, particularly since they are presented as ice-cold analytical conclusions. ''What of course is great about the whole thing is that it's Rand that's doing it,'' said Dr. Ziad Asali, president of the advocacy group the American Task Force on Palestine, citing the importance placed on a viable sovereign Palestine. ''It's not exactly Peace Now or some fringe group. This is the establishment giving this credibility.''
 Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, calls Jerusalem the country's eternal and indivisible capital. But Rand's analysts determined that ''without a credible sovereign presence in Jerusalem, the new state of Palestine will suffer a serious legitimacy deficit among its people'' that ''will make the emergence of good governance and a stable state problematic.'' On the other hand, the studies swat away a central Palestinian demand with a mere footnote. For refugees of the 1948 war and their descendants, Palestinians claim a right of return to their original homes in what is now Israel. But Rand's analysts briskly observed, ''Such a return, if it happens at all, is likely to be small.'' Rand estimated that some 630,000 of them would return to a state of Palestine, however.
 ON the ground in Ramallah, Mr. Suisman was pleased to see one of his assumptions confirmed. On his fourth visit to the city, he persuaded his colleagues to let him see the downtown, instead of just shuttling between offices. 
 ''I was like, 'Yes, it exists!''' he said. ''There was a vitality to it, and I felt, O.K., the focus that we had on revitalizing the historic centers, and connecting them to the stations, was right.''
 By then, Mr. Suisman was sensing firsthand the political intensity his tracing paper had elided. He was surprised by the emotion with which Palestinians talked about flowers and olive trees, and by all the black-and-white photographs he saw. 
 ''It's so much about the past with the Palestinians,'' he said. ''For me, the past is a very powerful influence, but it can also be a trap.'' Impressed at first with the command of history of those he met, Mr. Suisman quickly tired of the litanies. He recalled listening to an Israeli acquaintance citing an event from 1949. ''By the end of it I said, 'You know, all I can say is, I'm new to this,' I said, 'and I dropped in here by parachute from the outside. But this much I've learned in two trips: the minute that I hear a historic date cited, I know we're going nowhere in the conversation.''' 
 Nigel Roberts, the World Bank director for the West Bank and Gaza, said there was surprisingly little long-range thinking about Palestine. ''It's clearly a long, long way from where we are today,'' he said of the Arc. ''But you have to have these templates of what the future could look like so you can work backward from that.''
 Mr. Suisman said he was delighted that his idea had not disappeared into a drawer. ''As a planner you get used to many ideas not taking root,'' he said. He and other members of the Rand team are careful to say that they are hoping only to help the Palestinians in their own internal planning, not to substitute for it. 
 Mr. Khatib, the planning minister, said of the Arc, ''In principle it's an attractive approach.'' The Rand team has briefed him twice on the proposal, and the minister said his planners wanted to suggest further modifications, including giving more priority for development to the western side of the West Bank. 
 Mr. Suisman is also to visit Gaza this month. He said he wanted to ''to see the rest of the place, having lived it for a year and a half in my imagination.'' He paused and smiled. ''I guess that's very Palestinian, in a way.''

JOHN EVANS: COLLAGES
Introduction by Robert M. Murdock
The Quantuck Lane Press
($75, hardcover)
 Beginning in 1964, painter John Evans made a collage every day on the page of a bound sketchbook and stamped each collage with the date. On pages opposite some images he would write personal notes on domestic or world events, his daily activities, or even the weather.
 Filling numerous books, he continued this practice through the year 2000 -- the millennium -- which seemed to him an appropriate end date. In their daily production, his collages form both a personal diary and a universal commentary on urban life in the late 20th century.
 Evans's collages are mini-time capsules that mark the end of the Vietnam War, the fiscal crisis in New York City during the 1970's, the burgeoning economy, club scene and art market of the 1980's, and the AIDS crisis with its devastating effect, particularly on the art world. The artist's vantage point has always been New York's East Village, where he has now lived for more than 40 years. That neighborhood in itself has represented a hotbed of social and political unrest: poverty, crime, drugs, the Tompkins Square riots, and an active but short-lived gallery scene during the 80's.

HEADLINE: Meet The Poor Republicans

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week the Pew Research Center came out with a study of the American electorate that crystallized something I've been sensing for a long time: rich people are boring, but poor people are interesting.
 The Pew data demonstrated that people at the top of the income scale are divided into stable, polar camps. There are the educated-class liberals -- antiwar, pro-choice, anti-tax cuts -- who make up about 19 percent of the electorate, according to Pew. And there are business-class conservatives -- pro-war, pro-life, pro-tax cut -- who make up 11 percent of voters. 
 These affluent people are pretty well represented by their parties, are not internally conflicted and are pretty much stuck in their ways. 
 But poorer voters are not like that. They're much more internally conflicted and not represented well by any party. You've got poor Republicans (over 10 percent of voters) who are hawkish on foreign policy and socially conservative, but like government programs and oppose tax cuts. You've got poor Democrats who oppose the war and tax cuts, but are socially conservative and hate immigration. These less-educated voters are more cross-pressured and more independent than educated voters. If you're looking for creative tension, for instability, for a new political movement, the lower middle class is probably where it's going to emerge. 
 Already, we've seen poorer folks move over in astonishing numbers to the G.O.P. George Bush won the white working class by 23 percentage points in this past election. Many people have wondered why so many lower-middle-class waitresses in Kansas and Hispanic warehouse workers in Texas now call themselves Republicans. The Pew data provide an answer: they agree with Horatio Alger.
 These working-class folk like the G.O.P.'s social and foreign policies, but the big difference between poor Republicans and poor Democrats is that the former believe that individuals can make it on their own with hard work and good character. 
 According to the Pew study, 76 percent of poor Republicans believe most people can get ahead with hard work. Only 14 percent of poor Democrats believe that. Poor Republicans haven't made it yet, but they embrace what they take to be the Republican economic vision -- that it is in their power to do so. Poor Democrats are more likely to believe they are in the grip of forces beyond their control.
 The G.O.P. succeeds because it is seen as the party of optimistic individualism.
 But when you look at how Republicans behave in office, you notice that they are often clueless when it comes to understanding the lower-class folks who put them there. They are good at responding to business-class types and social conservatives, but bad at responding to poor Republicans.
 That's because on important issues, the poor Republicans differ from their richer brethren. Poor Republicans aspire to middle-class respectability, but they are suspicious of the rich and of big business. About 83 percent of poor Republicans say big business has too much power, according to Pew, compared with 26 percent of affluent Republicans. If the Ownership Society means owning a home, they're for it. If it means putting their retirement in the hands of Wall Street, they become queasy. 
 Remember, these Republicans are disproportionately young women with children. Nearly 70 percent have trouble paying their bills every month. They are optimistic about the future, but their fear of their lives falling apart stalks them at night.
 Poorer Republicans support government programs that offer security, so long as they don't undermine the work ethic. Eighty percent believe government should do more to help the needy, even if it means going deeper into debt. Only 19 percent of affluent Republicans believe that.
 President Bush has made a lot of traditional Republicans nervous with his big-government conservatism. He's increased the growth of nonsecurity domestic spending at a faster rate than Lyndon Johnson and twice as fast as Bill Clinton. But in so doing, he's probably laid down a welcome mat to precisely these poorer folks. 
 Even so, Republicans have barely thought about how to use government to offer practical encouragement to the would-be Horatio Alger heroes. They've barely explored their biggest growth market. If Republicans can't pass programs like KidSave, which would help poor families build assets for education or retirement, then Hillary Clinton, who is surprisingly popular with poor Republicans, will take their place.

HEADLINE: More Closings Ahead, Old Bases Still Wait for Hopes to Be Filled

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 

 BODY:
From the wood-paneled office that once belonged to Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, Tony Hall enjoys a million-dollar view at the shuttered naval station on Treasure Island. He can see the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower and the newly restored Ferry Building in San Francisco.
 The problem is that 12 years after the base was selected for closing, the Navy has moved out but has not handed over ownership. That has left Mr. Hall, the executive director of the city's Treasure Island Development Authority, with a prime piece of real estate in San Francisco Bay but no way to build the housing, hotels, marinas and nature trails planned for it.
 ''It's the military holding us hostage on our own lands,'' said Mr. Hall, who works in a building leased from the Navy. ''There's no reason why they should be delaying turning this island over.'' 
 Even as the recommended base cuts announced by the Pentagon on Friday create new waves of anxiety and lobbying, many city officials across the United States continue to wait on the promises of smooth redevelopment and new civilian uses that came with the previous rounds. 
 Although those base closings were designated a decade or more ago, about 219 square miles of former military property have still not been transferred to local authorities, about 28 percent of the total, the Government Accountability Office reported in January.
 Certainly there are many success stories, as bases have become college campuses, nature preserves and business parks. Just across the bay from Treasure Island, the former Presidio Army installation is a national park as well as headquarters to George Lucas's film company. In one of the most heralded transformations, the Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, which closed in 1994, has generated an estimated $4 billion in economic activity, including $1.1 billion from the construction of homes and commercial properties. 
 But there are also places where the delays have rendered former bases into near ghost towns, as the facilities have been closed and the military personnel relocated while the property remains underused. Much of the land is available for lease from the military, but uncertainty about the future of the leases often makes it difficult to attract long-term tenants and jobs on par with those that disappeared. 
 The G.A.O. report said 72 percent of the civilian jobs lost at closed or realigned bases had been recouped, but Leslie Little, development services director for the City of Alameda, on the east side of San Francisco Bay, said many of the new jobs were a far cry from the ones local officials had dreamed about. More than 14,000 civilian and military jobs were lost when the Alameda Naval Air Station closed in 1997.
 ''It's very quiet, extremely quiet, out here,'' said Ms. Little, whose office is on the four-square-mile base, only one-tenth of which has been turned over to the city. ''You can bring your kids out here and teach them to drive.''
 In Weymouth, Mass., about 400 acres of a former naval air station remain in the Navy's hands as local officials try for the third time in eight years to agree on a development plan. In Savanna, Ill., most of a closed Army depot has been set aside for a nature preserve along the Mississippi River, but of the remaining 3,000 acres marked for development, only 390 have been transferred because of cleanup problems.
 ''It's been painful,'' said David M. Ylinen, executive director of the Jo-Carroll Depot Local Redevelopment Agency in Savanna. ''People don't get serious until you can give them ownership.''
 A great deal of the hardship has been in California, which in past years has taken the biggest hit in base closings, losing 26 military installations since 1988 and accounting for about half of the military personnel cuts nationwide.
 Of the 23 major bases closed in the state, nearly half of the land, about 53 of the 113 square miles, has yet to be conveyed to the new owners, according to an analysis commissioned by several California agencies charged with developing the bases.
 The analysis, completed in December by Economic and Planning Systems Inc., a consulting company, tried to quantify the losses to the state from the land not being transferred. If developed, the unconveyed property would generate $17 billion in real estate value, $190 million a year in taxes to the state and $142 million a year to local governments, the firm estimated. In addition, more than 20,000 units of housing would become available in a state already starved for housing.
 Though reports like the one in January by the Government Accountability Office offer upbeat assessments of many base transfers, the dashed expectations associated with such lost opportunities have soured many officials to the entire process.
 ''There are two problems that feed into it,'' said Leon E. Panetta, a former California congressman and past White House chief of staff who is co-chairman of a base retention commission created by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. ''One is the military is extremely efficient at shutting a base down and locking the gate. The other is it is extremely inefficient at assisting the community in getting the property for redevelopment. Their mission is to go to war and take the hill, and that's what they focus on.''
 That said, there is plenty of blame to be shared for the delays, Mr. Panetta and others said.
 Ron Plaseied, a base closing manager for the Navy in California, said the military ''has always been an easy target to point the finger at.'' Mr. Plaseied said that each base closing has posed different problems and followed different timetables but that the goal for the Department of Defense has been constant.
 ''Our objective is to make sure the taxpayers are properly compensated for the divestiture of our real estate,'' Mr. Plaseied said. He added, ''We are as motivated as everyone else.''
 At Treasure Island, Mr. Hall complains about the Navy but acknowledges that the City of San Francisco contributed to the problems by growing too comfortable with the status quo, which has included millions in revenue from subleasing much of the Navy's property. In Weymouth, it is the Navy that has grown impatient, suggesting it might place the former air station on the auction block because of local officials' indecision about the development plan.
 ''We don't think we will get another chance, in all honesty, if this plan doesn't pass,'' said Terry N. Fancher, executive director of the South Shore Tri-Town Development Corporation, the agency created to develop the property.
 The biggest obstacle to handing over military bases from Maine to California has been cleaning up the environmental problems, which include unexploded ordnance and industrial pollution from shipbuilding. 
 Through 2003, the Department of Defense had spent about $8.3 billion on cleanup operations and estimated it would require an additional $3.9 billion. In some cases, military officials are trying to work out deals that would allow the new owners to take on the cleanup duties to help speed them up.
 ''One of the things that tends to frustrate folks is the time it takes to reach agreement,'' Mr. Plaseied said. ''We have a number of different entities involved. Trying to bring all of those different entities together at once and have some sort of collaborative process takes time.''
 But critics of the military suggest there might be more to the delays. Mr. Hall says he suspects money has come into play in the case of Treasure Island, where the Navy and city officials are still at odds over the value of the land, the cost of the environmental cleanup, possible revenue sharing from the future development and whether some state tidelands regulations apply to the property.
 Mr. Hall points to the sale in February of the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Southern California. In an online auction, the Lennar Corporation, a developer based in Miami, paid $649.5 million for the base, above the minimum bid but below what some people had hoped. In authorizing the latest round of closings, Congress put new emphasis on seeking market value for the land, and Mr. Hall fears that standard might be applied retroactively.
 ''Back in the early 90's, the thought was to return the land to these local communities at no cost or low cost,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Since that time, you know what has happened to land prices all across the United States. The waiting game serves the military better than it does the local communities.''
 Constructed with dredged sand and gravel on the shoals north of Yerba Buena Island for the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939, Treasure Island was intended to become San Francisco's airport when the exposition closed. 
 But with the outbreak of World War II, the 403-acre island was turned over to the Navy in early 1941. Its Art Deco administration building, designed to double as an airport terminal, instead became an administration center for the war in the Pacific. It is slated to become a hotel or conference center, but even now Mr. Hall's office holds a desk and leather chairs used by Admiral Nimitz.
 Mr. Plaseied said the Navy had no interest in holding on to Treasure Island or the other bases, and he rejected as ''entirely incorrect'' the suggestion that it was dragging its feet. But while saying the El Toro model ''is currently not being contemplated'' for Treasure Island, he said ''that would be an option'' if the Navy and the city were unable to reach a deal.
 ''It doesn't take an experienced real estate person to go out and tell us the property is valuable,'' he said. ''All you have to do is look at the view of San Francisco.''

HEADLINE: The Evolution Of Reluctant Capitalists

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
WEST VILLAGE HOUSES was once the ugly duckling of Greenwich Village, a huge postwar project of 42 brick walk-ups that look squat and plain among the imposing 19th-century warehouses and brownstones. The architecture is so unremarkable that the project was recently redlined out of a proposed West Village historic district.
 But now this subsidized housing development, put up at a time when much of the West Village was considered the haunt of criminals and prostitutes, is being transformed into a real estate swan, a co-op just down the street from some of the most expensive real estate in the city. In the next decade or so, it may turn many of its middle-income renters into millionaires.
 At a time when tenants of other middle-income projects worry about being forced out of their apartments by landlords looking to make a killing, the West Village Houses may be the ultimate tenant success story, in which tenant activism, political organizing and an unexpected stroke of luck -- along with more than $40 million in city subsidies -- saved the day. 
 But as many of these lifelong Greenwich Village tenant-activists contemplate a future as bourgeois property owners, the unity that helped bond the tenants has begun to crack. Former friends pass each other on the street without making eye contact. Dissidents are bitterly angry about election rules that they say were stacked against them. Supporters of the plan are worried that the deal of their dreams could be derailed at any moment. It's a ''pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,'' said one message on the tenants' Web discussion group. ''No Deal is Perfect, Get a Grip, Stop Bellyaching and Start dancing in the Streets.'' Although the plan is likely to be approved, there is still dissension. Renters occupying three-bedroom apartments, most with private gardens or cathedral ceilings, have threatened to sue, saying their proposed allocation of co-op shares -- and thus their (below-market) purchase price and maintenance -- is too high. And a rump group of tenants, some of whom are uncomfortable joining the ranks of owners of luxury apartments, fret about the way negotiations were conducted, the details of the deal and whether the purchase price could have been lower, allowing more tenants to buy, as well as what will happen to those who can't buy.
 Matthew Horovitz, a television producer for the National Basketball Association, is so worried about the opposition that he is running for the tenant association board for the first time. ''People are extremely anxious that petty obstructionist concerns might screw up an opportunity of a lifetime,'' he said. He is thrilled at the thought of buying. ''It would be an ecstatic, once in a lifetime experience to buy this apartment at this price,'' he said. 
 Mr. Horovitz may soon be able to buy his two-bedroom apartment on West Street facing the Hudson River for about $170,000, just down the street from Morton Square, a new riverfront development where the asking price on a two-bedroom apartment with a view is about $2.7 million. He moved into the project with his mother when he was 12, when the development opened in 1976.
 Harry Lewis, a psychologist and former downtown poet, said he was born ''a red diaper baby,'' raised by socialist parents, and still yearns to keep the old sense of community that once permeated the West Village Houses.
 ''We started out trying to keep this viable, friendly middle- and working-class community intact,'' he said. ''It has pretty much split around four or five different factions, mostly based on the money you can make owning your apartment.''
 He said that once the possibility arose of buying apartments that could later be sold at market rates, members of the tenants association who raised questions about the deal were shut out of negotiations-- a point that is in dispute.
 Still, Mr. Lewis, who lives in a three-bedroom duplex apartment with his wife, Estelle Press, a nurse midwife who teaches at the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing of the City University of New York, and their 14-year-old daughter, is considering buying, as are many who have raised questions about the deal. ''I am not opposed to people making money, I have matured beyond that point,'' he said. ''But you are seeing a bunch of people who have gotten a windfall, and people are tearing at each other.''
 The deal, which is still pending before the state attorney general's office, is complex. But essentially it would allow tenants to buy their apartments far below market prices -- as little as $165,000 for a typical two-bedroom apartment, and $330,000 for three-bedroom duplex apartments with private gardens or cathedral ceilings. If sold at market prices, the apartments would be $800 to $1,200 a square foot, or about $1.5 million for a three-bedroom, brokers said. 
 Owners would be able to resell at gradually higher prices. After 12 years, they could sell to anyone, at full-market prices. A large flip tax, between 15 and 25 percent of the gain, would help pay off a city mortgage. 
 Tenants unable or unwilling to buy would be protected by below-market rent-stabilized rents for 12 years. They could buy later, but at higher prices.
 The changes in the complex are happening at a time when the western edge of the West Village, with the cachet of the new Richard Meier towers and the new Hudson River Park, is in huge demand. 
 ''Everyone wants to be there,'' said Jill Meilus, a broker for the Corcoran Group. Even walk-ups can command a high price. A small but fully renovated one-bedroom apartment on Charles Street, up five flights of stairs, recently went to contract near the asking price of $820,000, in two days. 
 Those who buy during the initial offering period can resell them three months later for nearly 17 percent more, and then another 11 percent more each year. With the apartments selling far below their market value, getting bank loans should be easy, brokers say. ''At $165,000, you would have to have a pulse to get a mortgage,'' said Darren Sukenik, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 West Village Houses wasn't always such a sure thing. It was the troubled offspring of a protest movement against urban renewal in the West Village led by Jane Jacobs, the writer and critic on urban life.
 In the early 1960's, a plan to demolish a 14-square-block swath of the West Village and replace small stores and warehouses with high-rise buildings was stopped by community protests. And over the next decade, a community group, the West Village Committee, set out to design and build subsidized apartments imbued with Ms. Jacobs's ideas of urban life, on the site of a portion of the High Line elevated rail structure.
 The buildings were to be co-ops, 420 apartments built in five- or six-story walk-ups, where neighbors could get to know one another while walking up the stairs. Many of the buildings, on six separate sites between Morton Street and Bank Street near the river, had communal gardens in the rear.
 But the project was delayed, and by time it got started, costs had risen and there were cutbacks. A plan for floor-to-ceiling windows, and an exposed concrete frame, was replaced by plain flat brick fronts with small windows. 
 When the project was completed in 1974 and put on the market, the economy was sluggish. Four-bedroom apartments were $10,000, and they didn't sell. The city foreclosed and turned the project over to a private sponsor as a rental development.
 The building was run under the state's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, in which sponsors agreed to limit rents and their profit in exchange for low-cost financing and tax abatements for at least 20 years. Tenants had to meet strict income guidelines but were allowed to stay on after their incomes rose, if they paid a surcharge of up to 50 percent on their rents.
 In the last 20 years, scores of projects in other parts of the city have been moved out of the program, each creating a potential crisis for the subsidized tenants living there, as, in most cases, their legal rent protections came to an end.
 So in 2002, when the project's owner, a group headed by Andrew Farkas, a scion of the Alexander's department store family, who is the former chairman and chief operating officer of the Insignia Financial Group, sent the tenants a letter announcing a plan to take the housing out of Mitchell-Lama, the tenants were ready.
 Katie Bordonaro, a Latin teacher at the Village Community School who was president of the tenants association and went on to lead the co-op negotiations, said she and other tenant leaders spent years organizing, raising money and talking to city officials, because they knew that at some point their landlord would probably want to leave the Mitchell-Lama program. 
 ''We figured we should be prepared and know who the politicians are,'' she said. ''We had $50,000 in the bank from dues and contributions for legal fees.''
 She had even led the unsuccessful effort to block the construction of new luxury housing now known as Morton Square as a threat to affordable housing in the neighborhood. 
 Many tenants feared the worst, a doubling or tripling of rents or even evictions, because the land would be worth so much with the buildings demolished. 
 Mr. Farkas and his associates declined to comment about the negotiations, but in their first letter to tenants announcing their withdrawal from the subsidy program, they indicated that they were willing to negotiate.
 Eventually what appeared to be a firm, but difficult, deal was negotiated among the owner, the city and Ms. Bordonaro and the tenants' lead lawyer, Carole Ule, to sell the property to the tenants for co-op conversion.
 The cost was steep. The tenants agreed to pay $126 million for the project, which had two mortgages totaling $93 million on record, and the city agreed to forgive $19 million in interest that the owner eventually would have had to repay. To make it more affordable, the city agreed to provide a tax abatement worth about $1.5 million a year for 12 years and eliminate all interest on a $12 million city mortgage for up to 30 years.
 Those who didn't buy would see their rents rise immediately by 48 percent, while buyers would have to pay high maintenance costs, $2,400 a month for a three-bedroom. Some of the maintenance fees would go to a special fund to cover the rent increases due for low-income tenants.
 Then, everything changed. Last fall, while lawyers were working on the co-op conversion papers, they discovered that the project's owners had taken a city tax abatement, under a program known as J-51. But this program requires that rental units be protected by rent stabilization. 
 When Ms. Ule and Ms. Bordonaro quietly raised the issue with the owners, the owners said they were unaware that their managers had filed for the J-51 benefit, and they disputed the validity.
 Frank Marino, a spokesman for Mr. Farkas, said that ''the owner did not become aware'' of the tax abatement until last November, long after the first agreement. 
 In a second round of negotiations, Mr. Farkas's group dropped the price by $10 million. The 48 percent rent increases were eliminated. Apartment prices were cut 5 percent and maintenance on three-bedrooms was cut 30 percent.
 Suddenly apartments that seemed painfully expensive to middle-income people became more and more affordable. Despite the lower cost, the city maintained the same level of subsidies.
 City officials said most of the benefits it will provide to the co-op would have been given to the project if it had remained in the Mitchell-Lama program, and will be paid over many years, rather than all at once. 
 ''This really is a landmark,'' said Shaun Donovan, the commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''We have preserved affordable housing for at least the next decade, and that is a win for the administration, it is a win for the residents, and a win for the neighborhood.''
 To make the second deal possible, the tenants agreed to let Mr. Farkas's group buy the units that tenants do not buy, and resell up to 51 of them at market prices without flip taxes or limits on prices. This reduced the size of the co-op's mortgage and lowered maintenance but allowed the owner to make a significant potential profit on these units. 
 Many tenants hail Ms. Bordonaro as the savior who through her dedication and persistence preserved their home. But throughout the negotiations, some members of the tenant board complained that talks were conducted in secret, and that neither board members nor tenants were kept informed about what was going on. Over the course of a few months, six members of the 13-member board resigned. 
 ''Many of us believed we could have gotten a much better deal from the owners, but that is over now,'' said Will Creed, an interior landscaper, who was vice president of the association and a member of the negotiating committee before he resigned in November. 
 Mr. Creed and three other board members submitted a joint resignation letter, complaining that the first deal had sacrificed the interests of too many tenants who could not afford it. Later he learned that the tenant lawyer and board president had already discovered the J-51 and had begun making inquiries about it. His wife, Jessica Tomb, a business consultant on accounting software who was also a board member who resigned, said, ''We felt the board had morphed into being solely a sponsor organization and no longer represented all of the tenants.''
 Other tenants were mystified by how shares were allocated to different apartments. Residents of three-bedroom apartments complained that four-bedroom apartments, of roughly the same size but different configurations had much lower prices. 
 Tenants in top-floor three-bedroom duplexes, who have cathedral ceilings but have to climb many stairs, complained that they were paying more than tenants of ground-floor duplexes that had private rear gardens. 
 The allocations were made by Douglas Elliman, which was once owned by Mr. Farkas's company, and which managed the complex. But the methodology used was not disclosed in the co-op plan's preliminary filing, leading to continuing suspicion that politics were at play. 
 ''I'm paying 2.3 times what a two-bedroom pays, and I have to walk up two more flights and I don't know why,'' said Thomas Dercks, a former Wall Street executive. 
 He noted that three board members, including Ms. Bordonaro, lived in three-bedroom apartments with gardens, while no board members lived on the upstairs three-bedrooms.
 But Ms. Bordonaro said that Douglas Elliman made the allocations without direction from the board and that board members who had resigned were upset because they had been consistently outvoted on the board. Negotiations over shares are continuing.
 New board elections are set for later this month, but only after lengthy and acrimonious debate over election procedures.
 Jules Demchick, the developer of Morton Square, the luxury high-rise fought by some residents of the West Village Houses, said the evolution of the militant tenants to owners is something to see. 
 ''This is one to watch over time, it is a really a study in social science,'' he said. ''People take a political position based on their current circumstance. As their circumstance changes, their position changes, along with the things they will be concerned about.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article last Sunday about a plan for tenants to buy their apartments at the West Village Houses in Manhattan referred incorrectly in New Jersey copies to the position of two tenants, Will Creed and Jessica Tomb. They argued that tenants might have been able to negotiate a better deal -- not that they themselves opposed it.

 EARLY in this chronicle of an emerging Latino United States, someone in Tijuana trying to make his way north remarks to Hector Tobar, ''I think that the border will disappear before we lose the desire to cross.'' ''Translation Nation: Defining a New American Identity in the Spanish-Speaking United States'' crosswires de Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America'' with Che Guevara's ''Motorcycle Diaries'' as Tobar makes the journey from West Coast to East, from America's future into its past, from Hollywood's ''seamier half'' -- is there another half? -- to Texas, Florida and New York, with stops in the heartland of Nebraska and Idaho, where a Hispanic America proves as enduring as it would seem unlikely. ''Today,'' Tobar notes, ''Los Angeles and California are quietly exporting their people and their way of life eastward across the continent.''
 Tobar's book is a triumph of observation. In one account after another, from that of the couple who work in a Tyson chicken plant in Alabama, where the author goes ''undercover'' as a factory worker, ''hoping to see America through the innocent eyes of the wandering migrant,'' to the story of the marine from Guatemala who dies in the Persian Gulf, Tobar vividly and movingly captures the conflict between the immigrant ideal to which America has always aspired and the presiding white culture's deep ambivalence about the immigrant presence.
 While Tobar is an impressive reporter -- the former national Latino affairs correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, he is now the paper's Buenos Aires bureau chief -- ''Translation Nation'' is often most compelling when it's telling his own story, which begins in Los Angeles, ''my tierra,'' he calls it, ''my homeland.'' Los Angeles -- ''the place to which I will always return'' -- is the nerve center for Tobar's quest. For Latinos, it's the ultimate American city, a city of immigrants in a country of them, trafficking in identity, reinvention and the opportunity for people to recast themselves in the image of their hopes. 
 When Tobar was a young boy, the image of his hopes bore more resemblance to the Lakers basketball star Jerry West than to the revered Che, for Tobar's leftist parents and other Latinos a Jesus-like martyr whose hold on their imaginations was mythic. But as Los Angeles grew increasingly Hispanic over the next 40 years, Tobar was increasingly pulled back to the roots of his Guatemalan family. Che became a more complicated symbol, both of an oppressive immigrant past and of a utopian future that America at once promised and betrayed. Growing up, Tobar wrestled with notions of identity, and he still does. When he returns to Alabama, ''liberated of all disguises,'' four years after his reporting trip, he goes to the new Roman Catholic church the Latinos have built, and decides to take communion. Should he surrender to his ''middle-class squeamishness'' and receive the wafer in his hand, or open his mouth to the priest's offering like ''a real hombre''? In a moment he decides: ''I opened my mouth.''
 Tobar's life, and the life of a Spanish-speaking United States, contain the paradoxical story of the American dream -- pockmarked by the realities of racism and economic exploitation -- that transforms its aspirants and is in turn transformed by them. If ''Translation Nation'' is haunted by how America's border will disappear before the desire to cross it does, Tobar is more preoccupied with the border than with the desire. Therein lies what is most conspicuously absent from his otherwise fine book. 
 ''What it means to be an American citizen,'' Tobar writes, ''and what makes you a citizen, has been a fluid concept throughout this country's history. . . . Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the time when most modern American political institutions were being founded, the dominant strain in political philosophy had it that only property owners were qualified to vote or hold office.'' True enough, but as those institutions have evolved so has the idea of citizenship. It is typical of ''Translation Nation'' that Tobar defines being an American not in terms of what it means but in terms of what it doesn't. Too many stories here, including that of Tobar's own parents, duck the question: Why is the desire to cross the border stronger than the border itself? 
 ''Even if they catch us 100 times,'' that man in Tijuana goes on to say, ''we're going to get in one day.'' After finishing ''Translation Nation,'' the reader remains uncertain whether the determination to try 101 times is something that Tobar somehow finds too incomprehensible or unimportant to talk about, or whether he considers it an intangible too troublesome to contemplate for everything it insinuates. 
 For all the ways that America routinely fails its promise, it's also, uniquely, a country defined by an idea rather than by common territory or tradition. It wouldn't undercut Tobar's eloquent complaint about the injustices of the nation that so many Latinos sacrifice so much to adopt as their own -- if anything, it would inform it -- to acknowledge that, in a world of countries that build borders to keep people in, America has felt compelled to build borders to keep out the millions and millions of people for whom its allure involves more than just a better job.

HEADLINE: The Premier Theater for Premieres

BYLINE: By TREY GRAHAM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
JOYCE CAROL OATES'S play ''The Tattooed Girl'' had its premiere there last year. Wendy Wasserstein introduced ''Third,'' a one-act she has since expanded for Lincoln Center. Tony Kushner came for the initial reading of ''Caroline, or Change.'' And next year Ariel Dorfman will present a new play, ''Picasso's Closet,'' there, while Richard Greenberg, the author of ''Take Me Out,'' will stage his new work ''Bal Masque.'' 
 What theater could play host to all these well-connected productions? Of all places, Theater J, an intimate 236-seat space at the D.C. Jewish Community Center. Despite a staff of just seven and a yearly budget of less than $1 million, Theater J and Ari Roth, its artistic director, offer a rare mix of professional polish, thoughtful dramaturgy and nervy experimentation -- all in a spot just far enough off the New York radar for a playwright to relax. ''Ari wants work that is contemporary, political, different, experimental,'' Mr. Dorfman said. ''He's not afraid of his audience not liking what they discover." 
 Mr. Dorfman's sprawling seven-character play about Picasso's time in occupied France is not every producer's dream material. The nonlinear work reflects the painter's prismatic style as it explores individual responses to political repression, military occupation and, yes, terror. 
 ''Playwrights hear the word 'no' an awful lot,'' Mr. Roth said. ''To be able to say 'yes' to the things that you most passionately and personally believe in is the extraordinary privilege here.'' 
 Ms. Oates, who worked closely with Mr. Roth on ''The Tattooed Girl,'' was attracted by his dramaturgical instincts. As a coach, she said, ''he's remarkable. Not just good or excellent, but outstanding. It was as if, in a way, it was his play, he cared so much, which is really unusual. And he's got a great sense of humor.'' 
 Brought up on the Chicago street David Mamet memorialized in ''The Old Neighborhood,'' Mr. Roth taught playwriting at the University of Michigan before moving to Washington with his wife, Dr. Kate Schecter, who works at the World Bank. He calls himself an ''unrequited playwright with Kushneresque ambition'': he received praise for ''Born Guilty'' and ''Love and Yearning in the Not-for-Profits,'' but he acknowledges that ''I'm not universally beloved'' among Washington's critics. And he worries that has had an effect on Theater J's backers and board. ''They trust me more now as a producer than as a producer-playwright,'' he said ruefully. ''I don't know what my fortunes hold as a playwright anymore.''
 His bruises may have helped him in his dealings with other writers, though. At a time when Ms. Wasserstein was inching back into a more public life after a health crisis and a professional dry spell, for instance, Mr. Roth was careful not to over-publicize her plays ''Third'' and ''Welcome to My Rash.'' ''We were able to offer Wendy a kind of sheltered space to work in,'' Mr. Roth said. ''I guess you could say we specialize in artists with war wounds.'' 
 For Mr. Roth, who has been artistic director since 1997, Theater J is as much a mission as an artistic home. Its attempt to reclaim what he calls ''the distinctive urban voice and social vision that are part of its Jewish cultural legacy'' is rooted in his experience as the disillusioned child of progressive Zionists. That also inspired many meet-the-artist programs; ''Peace Cafe'' discussions about controversial plays are organized with a local Palestinian-born restaurateur who is on the theater's governing council.
 ''Ari doesn't see the play stopping in the theater itself,'' Mr. Dorfman said. ''He's turned the lobby and the building itself into a place of exchange and interchange and discussion. As a playwright, you want people to take your dilemmas home with them. You don't want them leaving them behind in the seats.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Theater J at the District of Columbia Jewish Community Center and its artistic director, Ari Roth, misidentified the employer of Dr. Kate Schecter, Mr. Roth's wife. It is the American International Health Alliance; she no longer works for the World Bank. The article also misstated the heritage of a restaurateur, Andy Shallal, who helps organize discussions about controversial plays. He was born in Iraq; he is not Palestinian.

FREAKONOMICS
A Rogue Economist Explores
the Hidden Side of Everything.
By Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.
242 pp. William Morrow. $25.95.
 A FEW years ago, a young economist named Steven D. Levitt became briefly notorious for collaborating on a research paper that contained a strikingly novel thesis: abortion curbs crime. What Levitt and his co-author claimed, specifically, was that the sharp drop in the United States crime rate during the 1990's -- commonly attributed to factors like better policing, stiffer gun laws and an aging population -- was in fact largely due to the Roe v. Wade decision two decades earlier. The logic was simple: unwanted children are more likely to grow up to become criminals; legalized abortion leads to less unwantedness; therefore, abortion leads to less crime.
 This conclusion managed to offend nearly everyone. Conservatives were outraged that abortion was seemingly being promoted as a solution to crime. Liberals detected a whiff of racist eugenics. Besides, what business did this callow economist have trespassing on the territory of the criminologist? Economics is supposed to be about price elasticities and interest rates and diminishing marginal utilities, not abortion and crime. That is what makes it so useful to undergraduates seeking relief from insomnia. 
 Levitt has strayed far from the customary paddock of the dismal science in search of interesting problems. How do parents of different races and classes choose names for their children? What sort of contestants on the TV show ''The Weakest Link'' are most likely to be discriminated against by their fellow contestants? If crack dealers make so much money, why do they live with their moms? Such everyday riddles are fair game for the economist, Levitt contends, because their solution involves understanding how people react to incentives. His peers seem to agree. In 2003, Levitt was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal, bestowed every two years on the most accomplished American economist under 40. 
 ''Freakonomics,'' written with the help of the journalist Stephen J. Dubner, is an odd book. For one thing, it proudly boasts that it has no unifying theme. For another, each chapter begins with a quotation from the under-author (Dubner) telling us how great the over-author (Levitt) is: a ''master of the simple, clever solution,'' a ''noetic butterfly'' (!), ''genial, low-key and unflappable,'' etc. Yet a little self-indulgence can be tolerated in a book as instructive and entertaining as this one. (''Freakonomics'' grew out of a profile Dubner wrote about Levitt in The New York Times Magazine, where I am also a contributor, but we've never met.) 
 The trivia alone is worth the cover price. Did you know that Ku Klux Klan members affixed a ''kl'' to many words (thus two Klansmen would hold a ''klonversation'' in the local ''klavern'') or that the secret Klan handshake was ''a left-handed, limp-wristed fish wiggle''? In the mid-1940's, a Klan infiltrator began to feed such intelligence to writers for the radio show ''The Adventures of Superman,'' who incorporated it into the plotline, thereby making the Klan look ridiculous in the eyes of the public and driving down its membership. Levitt uses the rise and fall of the K.K.K. to illustrate the power of hoarded information. He finds a parallel in the world of real estate, where brokers employ code words in advertisements to let potential buyers know that an apartment can be bought for less than its listing price. ''Spacious'' and ''great neighborhood'' are associated with a low closing price, whereas ''state of the art'' and ''maple'' are associated with a high price. 
 Sometimes Levitt seeks out his raw material, and sometimes -- as with a stack of spiral notebooks kept by a Chicago crack gang -- it falls into his lap. These notebooks, obtained by a graduate student, Sudhir Venkatesh, who spent a scary period all but living with the gang, contained sales figures, wages, dues, even death benefits paid to families of murdered members over a four-year period, at the peak of the crack boom. By analyzing them, Levitt and Venkatesh were able to work out the organization of the crack business, which turned out to be rather like that of McDonald's. The leader of the gang did fairly well, making around $100,000 a year (tax free). But the gang's ''foot soldiers,'' who sold the crack on the streets, cleared only $3.30 an hour -- less than the minimum wage. For this pittance they ran a one-in-four risk of being killed during the period in question, worse than the odds for a Texas death-row inmate. Why would anyone take such a job? Like other ''glamour professions,'' the crack trade is best viewed as a tournament, Levitt observes. You have to start out at the bottom to have a shot at the top job. 
 Levitt is happiest grappling with questions that have the potential to overturn the ''conventional wisdom.'' ''Where did all the criminals go?'' proved to be the perfect instance of such a question. The sudden and precipitous crime drop in the 1990's took everyone by surprise. Plenty of plausible-sounding hypotheses were put forward to explain it. But when Levitt turned an economist's eye to the data, he found that most of the supposed causes -- innovative policing strategies, stricter gun control, a strong economy, the aging of the population -- had a negligible effect. Others could be shown to play a limited role: increased imprisonment seemed to account for a third of the crime drop; the crash of the crack market for 15 percent; the hiring of more cops for another 10 percent. 
 And the balance? Here is where Levitt and his collaborator, John Donohue of Stanford Law School, showed unsettling originality. Since abortion was legalized in 1973, around a million and a half women a year have ended unwanted pregnancies. Many of the women taking advantage of Roe v. Wade have been unmarried, poor and in their teens. Childhood poverty and a single-parent household are two of the strongest predictors of future criminality. As it happens, the crime rate started to drop in the early 1990's, just as children in the first post-Roe cohort were hitting their late teens, the criminal's prime. Hence Levitt and Donohue's audacious claim: the crime drop was, in economists' parlance, an ''unintended benefit'' of legalized abortion. 
 A controlled experiment to test the truth of this theory is obviously out of the question. In ''Freakonomics,'' however, Levitt does the next best thing, teasing out subtle correlations that render the abortion-crime link more probable. (States like New York and California that legalized abortion before Roe v. Wade, for example, showed the earliest drops in crime.) In the social sciences, that is about as close as you can get to demonstrating causation. To insulate himself from the charge that he is advocating abortion as the cure for crime, Levitt does a little cost-benefit calculation. Suppose, for the sake of argument, we say a fetus is worth one one-hundredth of a person. Even then, he shows, the number of averted murders would not justify the number of abortions. This is clever but disingenuous. Anti-abortion groups do not hesitate to cite undesirable consequences of abortion. Why shouldn't abortion rights advocates get to cite its desirable consequences, like a drop in crime resulting from fewer unwanted children? 
 Economists can seem a little arrogant at times. They have a set of techniques and habits of thought that they regard as more ''rigorous'' than those of other social scientists. When they are successful -- one thinks of Amartya Sen's important work on the causes of famines, or Gary Becker's theory of marriage and rational behavior -- the result gets called economics. It might appear presumptuous of Steven Levitt to see himself as an all-purpose intellectual detective, fit to take on whatever puzzle of human behavior grabs his fancy. But on the evidence of ''Freakonomics,'' the presumption is earned.

HEADLINE: A Guide Through the Government Maze

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SHE was helping others get into the game, but did she have what it takes to be a player herself?
 That self-posed challenge, Ann Kayman says, was among the reasons she went in 2002 from working as a New York City economic development official to running a small start-up business. Another reason, she says, was her desire to return to the private sector, though not to the world of corporate law, which she had practiced earlier for a dozen years but had lost interest in.
 As a senior vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation from 1998 to 2002, Ms. Kayman helped businesses get started or expand. ''I would connect a business with any resources I could find, and I saw hundreds of companies start up,'' she said. Eventually, she caught the entrepreneurial bug herself. ''I wondered if I could do it.'' 
 Today, Ms. Kayman is the owner and chief executive of the New York Grant Company, which helps companies find and apply for government subsidies and incentives meant to foster business development.
 From a utilitarian 30-by-30-foot office on Fulton Street in Lower Manhattan, Ms. Kayman, 44, and seven employees mine the maze of federal, state and municipal programs that provide tax exemptions and abatements, reduced-interest loans, job training grants and energy cost discounts. 
 They determine which programs their clients may qualify for, advise them on steps needed for compliance, prepare the often extensive documents they need and make sure the applications do not fall into bureaucratic crevices. So, like more than a few former public officials, Ms. Kayman has woven strands of her government experience into a private-sector career.
 When she joined the New York Grant Company in September 2002, it was four months old, having been founded by a businessman, Salim Ismail, with a timely focus -- and a built-in limitation. Its specialty was helping Lower Manhattan businesses obtain grants and loans from programs that had been established to foster the area's financial recovery after the Sept. 11 attack. That was still its focus when Ms. Kayman came on board, she said recently. 
 But most of those programs were temporary, so the company would have to have a wider scope if it was to be more than a way station in her career.
 She began expanding, first by seeking aid beyond that connected to 9/11, steering her Lower Manhattan clients to programs that predated the attack. ''We also began representing clients in Midtown,'' she said. A current client, for example, is redeveloping a building and adjacent property near Times Square. ''We've gotten initial approval for them for real estate tax incentives that will be worth millions of dollars,'' she said. 
 Her company now also writes program proposals that nonprofit groups, like arts and social service organizations, submit in seeking financing from foundations, corporations and government agencies. 
 Ms. Kayman bought the New York Grant Company from Mr. Ismail in 2003 for ''several hundred thousand dollars,'' using up all her savings, she said. Since the company began, she said, it has helped about 850 businesses and nonprofit groups obtain $40 million. The company's revenues last year were about $2 million, she said, providing a ''decent, not huge'' profit.
 Some government agencies and nonprofit groups provide free help to people seeking to form or expand small businesses, but Ms. Kayman said she did not see them as competition because ''they don't give the kind of intensive'' assistance her company does. 
 Intensive assistance was what one client, Joshua Aaron, president of a technology consulting firm in Lower Manhattan, said he needed when his company suffered sharp losses after the terrorist attack. The New York Grant Company helped his firm, Business Technology Partners, obtain $350,000 from various 9/11 aid programs. ''I don't think we would have had the resources and time to follow the process'' required to get the aid, he said. ''We were concentrating on rebuilding our core business.''
 While with the city, Ms. Kayman helped administer the same 9/11 recovery programs that the New York Grant Company was assisting its clients with. The city's Conflicts of Interest Board said that joining the company would not pose a conflict for her as long as she did not deal with the agency she had left for a year. Ms. Kayman said she had heeded that and other strictures.
 As might be expected, her company has obtained for itself the kind of government aid it seeks for its clients -- in its case, $25,000 from a program that provided incentives for businesses to move into Lower Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Saving the Tract House

BYLINE: By Karrie Jacobs. 
Karrie Jacobs, an architecture and design critic, is writing a book about housing in America.

 BODY:
Frank Nolan, casually dressed in an olive drab polo shirt and blue jeans, occupied a white leather Brno chair set off by the room's gleaming Philippine-mahogany paneling. ''One never wants to come across as a design snob, especially as it pertains to one's neighbors,'' Nolan said gingerly. ''We know that having a good neighbor is so much more important than what color they paint their house or how they choose to landscape. But there just seems to be a great disparity between the potential that we see in this neighborhood and then what you actually do see when you drive down the street.''
 Nolan's house was one of 120 built in the 1960's by the developer Joseph Eichler in a San Fernando Valley subdivision called Balboa Highlands, 26 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Nolan and some of his neighbors want to have their neighborhood designated a historic district, which won't quite create an enclave of unsullied 60's modernity but will keep the threat of McMansions at bay. 
 It may also confuse some of the neighbors, who may not have thought that buying a 60's tract house would entail accepting a small role in Modernist architectural history. Stuart Frolick, who bought a house that had been radically altered by a previous owner, an engineer, told me, unapologetically, that he can't afford to return the house to its original state. Besides, his wife isn't into Modernism. ''She would like to gingerbread the place up,'' Frolick said, ''and I resist.''
''We clocked over 500 people coming through our neighborhood,'' Adriene Biondo said recently. ''We had vintage cars cruising up and down the street that day. People were tuned into the oldies station. It was a really exciting moment.'' Biondo, a short, roundish 49-year-old with the breathy voice of a chanteuse, was talking about the 2000 ''How Modern Was My Valley'' tour as if it happened yesterday. Sponsored by the Modern Committee, which she heads -- a furiously active branch of the city's dominant preservation organization, the Los Angeles Conservancy -- the tour brought a flood of tourists into the neighborhood. It also focused attention on the architecture about which Biondo is most passionate: the homes, including her own, built by Eichler.
 Eichler, who was responsible for the construction of some 11,000 homes, mostly in the San Francisco Bay area, was the last and most successful of a breed now largely extinct. In the years after World War II, commercial home-builders all over the country, but particularly in the West, began experimenting with new methods of construction and new styles of architecture. Abraham Levitt and his sons applied mass-production methods to building thousands of tiny ranch houses and Cape Cods on Long Island. Other developers, trying to remake the American dream, combined ideas from European Modernists -- simple geometric forms, functionalism, flexible space -- with a New World elan. 
 Balboa Highlands was constructed as a solidly middle-class neighborhood -- the houses typically had several bedrooms and measured 2,200 square feet -- at a time when some California home-builders believed that buyers craved the drama of L.A.'s experimental Case Study houses, built between 1945 and 1966 under the direction of Arts and Architecture magazine. The most famous Case Study house -- the one made into an icon by Julius Shulman's photo of two young women, seated in an all-glass living room, who appear to be floating above the Hollywood Hills -- was built in 1960 on a budget of $13,500, roughly the price of a standard tract house at the time. 
 Eichler worked with a handful of prominent California architects, including A. Quincy Jones, who designed a Case Study house. But Eichler's success perhaps owed less to the architects he employed than to his crack publicity photographer, Ernie Braun, who concocted and promoted a sophisticated but casual lifestyle. Braun's photos of the Eichler houses showed families dividing their time between sunny rooms and perfectly groomed backyards, the adults seemingly as likely to skip rope as the children. What Eichler sold from 1948 until the late 1960's wasn't architecture but happiness.
Each housing development Eichler erected represented a variation on the same program for happy family life. In the Balboa Highlands tract, the clean wood-and-concrete-block facades were designed to conceal the interior from the street. But inside, a whole world opens up: behind the front door of each house is an open-air atrium. Frank Nolan and his partner, Jaime Flores, have transformed theirs into a Zen garden carpeted with smooth round stones. A door from the atrium leads into the house itself, and it is easy to grasp the appeal of Eichler's plan: light-flooded rooms, exposed beams that support an elegantly simple roof and floor-to-ceiling glass intended to further the notion that interior and exterior are one and the same, a central tenet of California Modernism. Out back are a verdant yard with a swimming pool, a giant bronze Buddha and, in the distance, the Santa Susanna Mountains, green from months of rain. 
 Nolan, an elementary-school teacher, and Flores, a graphic designer, so impeccably restored their house that it probably looks better than it did when it was completed in 1964. Biondo's house is equally well preserved, painted pistachio green to match her 1956 Oldsmobile Rocket. But just down the block are Eichlers that have been altered to suit a more conventional suburban aesthetic. At one address, Eichler's A-frame model, distinguished by an unenclosed peaked roof over the front door -- the architects intended it as a car port -- is covered with a new red-clay tile roof and a line of classical columns out front. Another house has been stuccoed over, the roof turned into a giant gable, like the prop from a lesson about the properties of isosceles triangles. 
 While pitched preservation battles in most cities are usually fought over beloved public buildings, in Southern California they often center on private homes -- especially when those homes were designed by California's great midcentury architects, like Richard Neutra, R.M. Schindler and John Lautner. These battles tend to get thorny, pitting as they do the sacred rights of the property owner against equally deep-seated, and often rather abstract, notions of historic value. The city's Historic Preservation Overlay Zone ordinance, which Biondo and Nolan said they hope will protect their neighborhood, tries to split the difference by rewarding, but not demanding, compliance from homeowners.
 Enacted in 1979, the H.P.O.Z. ordinance makes it difficult, though not impossible, to alter the facade of a house that is considered a ''contributing'' part of a protected neighborhood; that is, one that preserves the building's original features. But it also allows for the continued existence of ''noncontributing'' buildings in the neighborhood. The owners of ''renovated'' houses don't have to change a thing if they don't want to -- but they get a break on their property taxes if they do.
 There are currently 20 H.P.O.Z.'s in Los Angeles County. Some are clusters of Victorian houses or bungalows. Currently, just one consists of postwar architecture: Mar Vista, a tract of 52 modest, rectangular houses just east of Venice Beach, became an H.P.O.Z. in 2003. A 1948 collaboration between the populist architect Gregory Ain and the landscape designer Garrett Eckbo, Mar Vista is a lush oasis of 1,100-square-foot homes laid out as efficiently as cabin cruisers. The little houses originally sold for $12,000 and now fetch as much as $950,000.
 The movement to preserve and restore Eichler homes has been going strong for at least a decade in Northern California, nurtured by a San Francisco-based organization known as the Eichler Network. But nationally, postwar tract houses are just beginning to receive the attention of the preservation community. As Ken Bernstein, director of preservation for the Los Angeles Conservancy, pointed out, ''Only about 15 percent of Los Angeles has ever been looked at.'' The Getty Conservation Institute, he said, is now working with the city planning department to survey the remaining 85 percent.
 Bernstein said he strongly believes that the conservancy should back the H.P.O.Z. effort in Balboa Highlands, as it did in Mar Vista. ''Both were examples of really bringing the tenets of Modernism to the masses in an affordable manner,'' he explained. ''And both also are uniquely intact, surprisingly intact, given the vagaries of the real-estate market here in L.A. and the pressures that you see upon individual neighborhoods. And we also felt that if steps weren't taken soon, they could become more significantly threatened in the future.''
Some of the early Eichler-home buyers are still in Balboa Highlands. Edgar Law, who earned his degree in architecture, bought his house in 1969 because, he said, ''it has principles that I believe in.'' He was referring to the openness of the design, though he and his wife, Fay, as African-Americans, also benefited from one of Eichler's political principles: he had a nondiscrimination policy, which was not the norm in 1960's suburban Los Angeles. John Hora, a cinematographer, bought his house in 1966. ''It was so weird-looking that I wasn't going to get out of the car,'' he told me, taking a break from his yard work. ''But I walked in, and I was converted.''
 Balboa Highlands was one of the last projects Eichler completed before his foray into urban development in the mid-60's nearly bankrupted him. Within a decade, the neighborhood he had envisioned had begun to change. The Valley's citrus groves gave way to ever more houses. By the 80's, the real money was in newer homes, mostly Mediterranean and Spanish models. 
 The buyers for Eichlers by this time were mainly immigrants from the Middle East, Asia or Russia. They had probably never seen those Ernie Braun photos, and they dealt with the idiosyncratic look of the Eichlers by hiding it. They wanted their houses to look like other houses in the area: stuccoed and columned. 
 Nolan and Flores, who bought their home in 1993, were among the first of an influx of design connoisseurs. They were also the ones, together with Biondo, who circulated the petition to have their neighborhood considered for H.P.O.Z. status. Most people, Flores said, even those whose homes had been significantly altered, ''were O.K. with the idea of the H.P.O.Z. as long as it was to improve the neighborhood.'' Hoping that some owners of extreme renovations would try to undo the damage, he tried to stress that ''contributing'' houses in the H.P.O.Z. would receive tax benefits. One couple, Flores recalled, didn't like the implication that houses in the original style were somehow more important: ''They were like, 'Why?''' But for many, the tax breaks just aren't enough of an incentive to pay for restoration. 
 Though roughly two-thirds of homeowners eventually signed the petition, the H.P.O.Z. status of Balboa Highlands remains uncertain. The ''historic resources survey,'' conducted for the city's Cultural Heritage Commission to determine how many of the houses in the district will be considered ''contributing,'' can't be done because the office in charge of the surveys recently lost its financing. And while Biondo holds out hope that the H.P.O.Z. designation is not far off, she is careful to modulate her zeal. ''I don't want people to feel pressured to do anything,'' she emphasized. 
 Economics may apply the pressure for her. Houses in Balboa Highlands were originally priced at $30,000. In 1966, Hora paid $42,000 for his, which, he noted, was not cheap. In 1993, Nolan and Flores paid $260,000. It was a pretty good deal. The Eichler cachet, combined with prevailing real-estate trends, has driven prices up to more than $600,000 for a fixer-upper and more than $700,000 for a house that has been well restored.
 The H.P.O.Z. is meant to appeal to and attract a new type of homeowner. The designation doesn't just protect the look of the neighborhood; it's also an advertisement. ''I think bringing in like-minded people is really key,'' Biondo explained. ''That's been the change over the last eight years, wouldn't you say?''
 ''Oh, yes,'' Nolan agreed.
 Biondo continued, ''We try very hard, when the house goes on the market. . . . ''
 ''The word goes out,'' Nolan said.
 ''It goes out,'' Biondo affirmed, nodding her head decisively.

HEADLINE: Profane Note Is Left For Federal Judge

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 14 

 BODY:
Someone taped a profane, derogatory note to the window of a restaurant where a federal judge, whose mother and husband were killed earlier this year, was dining Friday night, the authorities said.
 The note did not specifically name the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow of Federal District Court, but the authorities believe it was probably intended for her, said John O'Malley, assistant chief deputy for the United States Marshals Service in Chicago. 
 Mr. O'Malley declined to comment further, saying it could compromise the judge's protection.
 Witnesses said they saw a man tape the note to the window of the restaurant, according to the police. Federal marshals were on duty inside and outside the building, a spokesman for the police said.
 Judge Lefkow has been under federal protection since her husband and mother were killed in the couple's home in Chicago in February.
 In March, an unemployed electrician from Chicago committed suicide near Milwaukee after leaving a note confessing to the murders. He was angry with Judge Lefkow for dismissing a malpractice suit he had filed, the authorities said.
 In an unrelated case, a white supremacist, Matthew Hale, was sentenced to 40 years in prison last month for soliciting Judge Lefkow's murder.

HEADLINE: Bay Street to Open With a U.S. Premiere

BYLINE: By MARGO NASH

 BODY:
AS the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor prepares to open for the season, Emma Walton, one of its founders, recalled the year of its founding, 1991.
 ''People thought we were crazy to start a theater in the middle of the recession,'' said Ms. Walton, who is the theater's director of education and programming for young audiences. She added that even her father, the celebrated designer and director Tony Walton, was skeptical. 
 But the theater, whose other founders are Sybil Christopher and Stephen Hamilton (who is married to Ms. Walton), has more than persevered. It has gained a reputation as a place where playwrights can develop their work away from the pressures of New York City.
 Among the many plays originating at Bay Street are Joe Pintauro's ''Men's Lives,'' in 1992; ''Blue Lights,'' in 1994, by Cynthia Ozick; and, in 1995, ''By the Sea, By the Sea, By the Beautiful Sea,'' by Mr. Pintauro, Terrence McNally and Lanford Wilson.
 Bay Street's plays have moved from the 300-seat theater on the Long Wharf in Sag Harbor to theaters on and off Broadway and across the country. For example, ''Men's Lives'' was later produced at the Pope Theater Company in Florida, and ''By the Sea'' was produced by the Manhattan Theater Club. In 2000, two plays had second lives -- ''Love, Janis,'' off Broadway, and ''Hedda Gabler,'' on Broadway.
 The production of ''The Boy Friend'' in 2003, which was the directorial debut of Julie Andrews, will be produced by the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., this summer, and the show will later have a national tour.
 Meanwhile, Bay Street has consistently attracted big-name actors like Richard Dreyfuss, Alec Baldwin, Cherry Jones, Dianne Wiest and Kate Burton and top directors like Sidney Lumet. 
 This year's season continues in this tradition. The American premiere of ''Japes'' by Simon Gray, author of ''Butley'' and ''Otherwise Engaged,'' opens the schedule on May 24. Francesca Faridany, Matt McGrath and Sam Robards star in the drama, which is about two brothers who share the house where they grew up and love the same woman.
 The season continues with ''No Time for Comedy,'' by S.N. Behrman; ''Sleuth,'' by Anthony Shaffer; and the musical ''Pippin.''
 Sam Robards, who was nominated for a Tony award in 2002 for his performance in Arthur Miller's ''The Man Who Had All the Luck,'' said ''being at Bay Street is like a little bit of a homecoming.''
 ''It's so beautiful out there,'' said Mr. Robards, the son of Lauren Bacall and Jason Robards. ''My mom used to have a house in Amagansett, and she had quite a few friends in the area.''
 Ms. Christopher, who, like the other founders, lives in Sag Harbor, is Bay Street's producing director. She recalled that when the founders were choosing the first play for the first season, Mr. Hamilton, the theater's executive director, suggested doing ''Men's Lives,'' Mr. Pintauro's adaptation of Peter Matthiessen's book about South Fork fishermen.
 She remembered that she thought no one would be interested in a play about fishermen.
 ''But we put it on, and it was a huge success,'' she said. The moral of the story, she said, is ''to read everything. Don't be put off about the subject matter. 'Men's Lives' addressed something terribly important to this area.''
 Bay Street Theatre productions are at Long Wharf in Sag Harbor, at the corner of Bay and Main Streets. Information: (631)725-9500.

HEADLINE: Surfing for Investments, and Ending Up in Idaho

BYLINE: By GRACE LICHTENSTEIN

 BODY:
AS the passion for investing in real estate has intensified, the Internet has become a crucial tool for investors. It allows them to sit at home in New York or Los Angeles and type in search words that lead them to another world, seemingly infinite in possibilities for house shopping. 
 To make sure that those shoppers discover him, Steve Barbey, a real estate agent from Boise, Idaho, has spent $100,000 on Web addresses related to Boise and its surrounding area. He has bought 800 domain names,, paying $50,000 for a single address: BoiseRealEstate.com.
 According to Ron Jackson, editor of Domain Name Journal, it is not unusual for a real estate professional to own a dozen or more names. But Saul Klein, a San Diego consultant who helps real estate agents become Internet-savvy, said that only a few seem to have amassed hundreds. 
 Mr. Barbey's strategy seems to be paying off. Last year, he said, he got more than 1,000 solid leads via the Internet, including 80 from investors who were not locals looking for homes. Some investors have bought homes without ever setting foot in Idaho.
 Four years ago, Mr. Barbey moved with his wife, Laurie, and two young children from Los Angeles to the Boise suburbs. His wife had relatives there and they loved the area. At first he thought he might put his high-technology skills to work devising sales and marketing plans for real estate offices. 
 But one glance at the galloping pace of home sales prompted him to go directly into the market and become a broker. He is now a partner with John Davidson, a native of Boise and a broker specializing in the suburb of Eagle. 
 Since then, Mr. Barbey has been busy selling houses -- he did $13 million in Idaho residential sales last year -- and rolling out sites for his main dot-com addresses. 
 Mr. Barbey's goal is to channel Web surfers to his sites. For example, anyone who types ''idahorealestate.com'' into a Google search box lands on a page owned by Mr. Barbey that directs visitors to his main site, yourIdahohome.com. 
 ''Different search engines -- Google, MSN, Yahoo, etc. -- use different algorithms to determine Web site ranking on the search results pages,'' he said. He wants his Web address to ''show up on the first screen and preferably toward the top,'' he said. 
 His Web site, www.youridahohome.com, caught the attention of Al Lorenzen, a project manager for a credit card company in the San Francisco Bay area. It was ''well laid out and user friendly,'' Mr. Lorenzen said. He reached it surfing Realtor.com and the Multiple Listing Service (run by the local Board of Realtors). 
 Mr. Lorenzen got in touch with Mr. Barbey, who outlined a strategy to zero in on rental property in Mr. Lorenzen's price range. The agent followed up with photos and a DVD narrated by Mr. Davidson, his partner, and suggested a property management company. They traded faxes and FedEx packages. Within a few months, Mr. Lorenzen had paid cash and closed on a $125,000 house in a Boise subdivision. 
 Mr. Lorenzen said he had decided to buy real estate as an alternative to stocks and bonds. ''If I was smarter, I would have pulled all of my money out of the stock market four years ago,'' he said. He was inspired to move forward with the Idaho brokers because, he said, they ''can speak in complete sentences'' and ''answered every question I had about the Boise area.''
 Another client, Dr. Robert Eitches of Beverly Hills, Calif., said that he has never even been to Idaho. But Dr. Eitches, an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at U.C.L.A., bought three houses in the Boise region through Mr. Barbey. He conducted all business by e-mail, telephone, fax and FedEx.
 Mr. Barbey ''showed'' Dr. Eitches 12 properties via the Web and helped him make offers on four; three were accepted. The broker then helped to arrange mortgages on the houses, after 25 percent was put down. ''I did it because the stock market is unreliable'' as a ''retirement nest egg,'' Dr. Eitches said. ''In 15 years they'll probably be earning me $1,500 to $2,000 a month each.''
 Before investing in Boise, Mr. Lorenzen and Dr. Eitches investigated other areas closer to home. Mr. Lorenzen was interested in Las Vegas (the fastest growing city in the United States, according to the Census Bureau) but said he could not find a broker there who was as willing or knowledgeable as Mr. Barbey.
 Moreover, he decided the Boise area, with a population of 338,800, was a better bet for investing. Housing prices in Las Vegas in 2004 spiraled up 50 percent, making it overheated in the eyes of trackers like Richard DeKaser, the chief economist for the National City Corporation in Cleveland, while Boise's real estate is regarded as fairly priced. Boise has been highly ranked recently for its job creation, its affordability and its business climate, according to Shirl Boyce, a vice president of the Boise Valley Economic Partnership. 
 Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the National Association of Realtors, said Boise was expected to do better than the nation as a whole in 2005. Characterizing it as a small city with potential, Mr. Yun said that although existing home sales were up by more than 20 percent in 2004, ''there 's still much more room to grow in Idaho compared to West Coast cities from San Diego to Seattle.'' 
 Mr. Barbey and Mr. Davidson, like others in their region, already use traditional methods to compete for commissions in the Boise-area market. 
 The capital of Idaho, Boise is also the industrial, white-collar and medical hub of a relatively isolated area -- Salt Lake City is about 300 miles away; Portland, Ore., 343. When Mr. Barbey arrived, there was already a spurt in residential building, notably in Meridian and Eagle.
 Some of the highest-priced homes are in Eagle, where Mr. Barbey, 32, sits in front of a triple-screen computer monitor and fields e-mail messages from potential buyers, most of them local buyers looking for new homes. The view from his office window of the tree-lined North Fork of the Boise River and surrounding forest is a soothing contrast to the one he had from his office at Blue Falcon Networks in Los Angeles. 
 ''It sat in the old, decrepit part of downtown,'' he said. ''Outside there were trash, vagrants, honking horns and the occasional gunshot.'' His daily commute was 90 minutes each way in California; in Eagle, it is 5.
 Located directly northwest of Boise proper, Eagle has about 14,000 people, and the average home price last year was $340,000, compared with $193,000 for the Boise region in general, according to Chris Mooney, executive vice president of the Ada County Association of Realtors.
 Nor is Eagle's prosperity an accident, according to Mayor Nancy Merrill. About a decade ago, she said, the town asked itself, ''What do we want to be when we grow up?''
 A 25-year master plan mandated large single-family home lots, plenty of open space and subdivisions with clubhouses, swimming pools, walking paths and extensive landscaping, which have lured executives and their families to its expansive new homes. These people are his target market, Mr. Barbey said, as well as the investors he hopes to lure from the Internet.

HEADLINE: Banking on Fins and Scales

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
A STRAY shark now and again on the Delaware River is one thing. But now comes Genny and Button, gracefully sliding down their rocky outcropping and into the pool at the West African River Experience at the aquarium here, where finishing touches are being put on a $40 million renovation and expansion.
 Despite their heft -- about 3,000 pounds each -- the two hippos glide and flip and often seem to smile at those peering at them from the underwater viewing area.
 ''Actually, they are not so friendly to humans,'' said Lynne Fulton, the curator of birds and mammals at what will now be called the Adventure Aquarium. ''You really want to be careful around them. It's exciting to have them here. It's a whole different kind of thing.'' 
 Twenty years ago, when state and city officials first announced that an aquarium was coming to the Delaware River waterfront, the real excitement was not over a simply a school of fish in a tank, but the promise that Campbell Soup would build a new headquarters nearby and that some other part of Camden's industrial heritage may be resurrected from decades of urban decay.
 It took seven more years, until 1992, for the aquarium to be built. Campbell never did make good on its word, however, and in fact has cut back on its operations here since then. 
 Though the waterfront now features Campbell Field, a minor league baseball stadium sitting in the shadow of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, and the Tweeter Center, a music venue, its promise as a commercial and residential Valhalla has hardly been fulfilled given the two decades of assurances. 
 As for the aquarium, after eight months of construction and expansion, the refurbished facility is scheduled to open on May 25 with similar hopes. While not a dismal failure, the original aquarium run by the state -- and somewhat clumsily named the Thomas H. Kean New Jersey State Aquarium at Camden -- seemed guided more by good intentions than good economic policy.
 Acknowledging that a commercial company would operate more efficiently -- and profitably -- the state granted development rights to Steiner and Associates, an Ohio-based firm that owns an aquarium in Newport, Ky., near Cincinnati. The expansion is being financed by a $3.3 million grant and a $15 million loan from the Delaware River Port Authority, $10.6 million from the Camden recovery board, and $5 million from Steiner. The agreement also has Steiner paying maintenance costs on the former aquarium's $8 million debt.
 As an enticement, the state also granted development rights to Steiner for a 30-acre property between the aquarium and stadium. Under the terms of the agreement with the state, Steiner must invest at least $135 million on that land within 13 years of the reopening of the aquarium.
 ''A developer like Steiner wants a centerpiece that is exciting and then will go out and do the retail and restaurants and commercial space we need on the waterfront,'' said Judi London, executive director of the Camden Waterfront Marketing Bureau.
 Although construction equipment is still scattered around the site, the aquarium's executive director, Greg Charbeneau, says that all the attractions, from a 550,000-gallon shark tank to the African penguin exhibit to the rest of the West African River Experience -- complete with porcupines, crocodiles and a free-flight aviary -- will all be ready on time.
 ''It's an intangible thing, creating a new look and a new act,'' said Mr. Charbeneau, who was vice president for husbandry at the old aquarium and curator of SeaWorld of Orlando, Fla. ''We're going to have to have entertainment and education, both real and accidental, to have a successful time here. Our goals are tough. We want to break the cycle of people only coming to museums and zoos once every three to five years.''
 In a country trying to resurrect its troubled cities -- abandoned over the past several decades by both industry and large chunks of middle-class residents -- the 1980's and early 1990's could perhaps be called the dawning of the age of aquariums. The National Aquarium in Baltimore --in that city's renovated Inner Harbor -- opened in 1981 and attracted 1.6 million visitors its first year. Other cities also seized on the notion of aquariums. From 1990 to 1992 alone, aquariums opened in New Orleans, Chattanooga and Newport, Ore., and old ones were retooled in San Diego and Chicago. 
 In a sense, the original aquarium in Camden was ill-conceived, concentrating on fish found in and around New Jersey waters in one huge tank surrounded largely by educational exhibits. The state-financed attraction drew 1.2 million visitors its first year, but then attendance dropped to 695,000 in 1993 and to 500,000 by 1994. ''It had the gray-fish problem,'' Mr. Charbeneau said. ''Unfortunately, most fish from New Jersey aren't colorful. So even after they did something about that in the middle 1990's, it just wasn't viewed as an exciting place. It wasn't so much that anyone did anything wrong, but its resources were limited.''
 This time around the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences -- which had operated the entire aquarium -- will oversee the Adventure Aquarium's educational programs only and answer to Steiner and Associates. Its signature program will involve working with students from the beleaguered Camden public schools in an effort to help many of them go on to college through an internship program.
 ''We accomplished some truly amazing things,'' said Brian DuVall, president and chief executive of the academy. ''We have wonderful educational opportunities. We established a regular market in a place where there was no destination before. That is not easy to do. We know that the aquarium served more than seven million people since 1992, but there are extreme challenges to building up to the volume that would make this facility fly.''
 In addition to the aquarium, Steiner plans to open an array of restaurants and retail shops -- and perhaps housing on the adjacent 30-acre lot.
 For now, Mr. Charbeneau is hoping that features like the hippos and the open-air aviary in the West African River exhibit will make the aquarium more than just another place to look at fish. In addition, there will be a walk-through tunnel beneath the shark exhibit -- along with the opportunity to dive in a special tank and touch a shark for a cost of $115, in addition to the entry fee of $16.95, and $13.95 for children (the old prices were $12.95 and $9.95 for children). 
 As an added enticement, the entrance to the new aquarium will face the river -- and overlook the historic section of Philadelphia -- rather than the hardscrabble Camden cityscape. ''The new aquarium will try to take advantage of everything it can,'' Ms. London said. ''Why not have the entrance on the river? It's a beautiful view to start out with.'' 
 As she put it: ''I'm counting on it that we finally have the anchor we need to move forward on the waterfront. It's been a long time in coming.''

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Seeks Mayor With Stomach For Cost Cuts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, May 14 

 BODY:
The candidates for mayor of Pittsburgh are handing out the usual campaign buttons and lawn signs, and one distributed pillboxes bearing his name. But another last month wielded perhaps the most appropriate prop of all: a chainsaw.
 The next mayor will almost certainly have to cut spending drastically to help pull the city out of its worst financial crisis since the collapse of the steel industry in the 1980's. 
 Pittsburgh has $1 billion of debt; it has been reduced to no-frills budgets -- this year's did not even include money to fix potholes; and it has two quasi-governmental boards that have a tight hold on the city's purse strings.
 Seven Democrats and one Republican are running to succeed Mayor Tom Murphy, who is not seeking a fourth term.
 ''Right now I'd be happier with anything but what we've had,'' said Jim Mannella, 48, a lifelong Pittsburgh resident. 
 Winning the Democratic primary, set for Tuesday, has typically been enough to become mayor in this city of about 330,000 people, where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to one.
 Mayor Murphy, 60, the son of a steelworker, likened the city to ''the little engine that could'' and ambitiously tried to move it beyond its industrial past. He helped keep two of Pittsburgh's sports teams in town with new baseball and football stadiums, and shepherded through the Andy Warhol Museum and a convention center.
 But his plans to revive the city's downtown were never realized. Two developers backed out, and two major department stores closed. The city's tax base continued to shrink along with its population, which has dropped by nearly half since the 1950's.
 Mayor Murphy periodically patched up budgets with layoffs, more borrowing and sales of city property. But by the end of 2003, the city's finances were so bad that the state stepped in to stave off bankruptcy. Its bonds briefly fell to junk status, and it had the worst credit rating of any major American city.
 Whoever wins the election is going to have to preside over about $270 million in cuts over the next five years in a city with an annual budget of around $400 million.
 The three Democrats who have dominated the race have talked of reducing their own pay, privatizing some city services and trimming the number of City Council members.
 Bob O'Connor, 60, a businessman who served three terms on the City Council, including two as president, is considered by many to be the favorite. Mr. O'Connor has been endorsed by the Democratic Party, the police union and most City Council members.
 ''Bob may be the perfect person to swallow the medicine with a smile rather than treat it like castor oil,'' said Bill Green, a Republican political consultant.
 Another candidate, William Peduto, 40, is a member of the City Council and was among the first to call for the state bailout. He hoisted a chainsaw in the air last month, joking that he would use it to cut the city's budget.
 And Michael Lamb, 42, the prothonotary of Allegheny County, has offered to put his elected position -- overseeing civil court records -- on the chopping block as part of an effort to consolidate government and save money.

HEADLINE: THE POLL RESULTS

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
To discover how Americans regard class and where they place themselves, The Times conducted a nationwide survey in March. The poll uncovered optimism about social mobility. It found differences in the views of rich and poor in some areas, including the likelihood of achieving the American dream. The poll was followed by interviews with respondents, including the four people pictured above, chosen to represent different economic groups. MARJORIE CONNELLY


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''A Land of Opportunity''More than ever, Americans cherish the belief that it is possible to become rich. Three-quarters think the chances of moving up to a higher class are the same as or greater than 30 years ago. Still, more than half thought it unlikely that they would become wealthy. A large majority favors programs to help the poor get ahead.Compared with their social class when growing up, people said their current class was:LOWER: 16%NO ANSWER: 2%HIGHER: 45%SAME: 38%Compared with 30 years ago, is the likelihood of moving up from one social class to another:LESS: 23%NO ANSWER: 2%GREATER: 40%SAME: 35%The federal government should tax estates worth:OVER $3.5 MILLION: 20%NO ANSWER: 7%NOT AT ALL: 50%OVER $1 MILLION: 23%Is it possible to start out poor, work hard and become rich?Graph tracks yes or no answers since 1983.How likely is it that you will ever become financially wealthy?ALREADY RICH: 1%NO ANSWER: 1%SOMEWHAT: 34%VERY: 11%NOT AT ALL: 22%NOT VERY: 30%Compared with European countries, is moving up from one social class to another:HARDER: 13%NO ANSWER: 16%EASIER: 46%SAME: 26%Do you favor or oppose programs that make special efforts to help people get ahead who come from low-income backgrounds, regardless of gender or ethnicity?OPPOSE: 10%NO ANSWER: 6%FAVOR: 84%Note: Numbers may not add up to 100 because of rounding.

It shows who's on top, who's at the bottom and who's in the middle. The box at right shows how poll respondents described their class versus where they actually fell on the same income-education spectrum. Given a choice of five classes, the better-off poll respondents shunned the top (upper class) and the poor shunned the bottom (lower class). Most everyone placed themselves in the middle three classes: working, middle and upper middle.Where People AreThe shaded rectangles show the proportion of Americans over 25 at each income and education level.In the middle are mostly people without college degrees whose household income is $30,000 to $100,000.Graph tracks education levels (less than high school, high school or equivalent, some college or two-year degree, Bachelor's degree and Graduate degree) and household income ($150,000+, $149,999-$100,000, $99,999-$75,000, $74,999-$50,000, $49,999-$30,000, up to $29,999) that creates top, bottom and middle.Where People Think They AreHow poll respondents across the income-education spectrum most commonly described their class.Very few respondents called themselves lower class or upper class -- 7 percent and 1 percent.People with four-year college degrees tended to consider themselves middle class even if they earned little. So did people making over $50,000 but with no college degree.Mobility Losing SteamThe movement of Americans to different income groups has leveled off and may have actually slowed.

HEADLINE: South Korea Pushes to Engage the North, Rejecting U.S. Notion of a Quarantine

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
For Bush administration strategists, a quarantine of North Korea means searching trucks, trains and planes for nuclear materials smuggled out of that impoverished country. 
 But South Korea, an advocate of engagement, has already set up its own ''quarantine'' of the North. An outbreak of bird flu this spring at chicken farms near Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, forced South Korea to spray disinfectant on the steadily growing stream of buses and trucks crossing the border.
 In April, when the two Koreas conducted their first zoo exchange, veterinarians quarantined the contribution from the Pyongyang Central Zoo -- Asiatic black bears, African ponies and Siberian weasels. 
 This quarantine gap highlights a wider policy gap between Seoul and Washington.
 Bush administration officials are frustrated with an 11-month-long boycott by North Korea of talks on its nuclear program and concerned that it may test a nuclear weapon. As a result, they are debating whether to seek United Nations authorization to empower nations to search cargoes leaving or entering North Korea for nuclear-related materials.
 China, along with South Korea, one of the most important players in any quarantine of North Korea, is reluctant to pressure its neighbor to drop its nuclear weapons program. But if North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, Beijing's thinking could change rapidly. 
 South Korea, on the other hand, takes a different tack, seeking to enhance security on the divided peninsula by reaching out to North Korea, promoting trade, investment and economic interdependence. The quarantine of zoo animals imported from North Korea was adopted as a health measure to help nurture an experiment -- road traffic between the Koreas.
 Whether it is zoos trading llamas and hippopotamuses from South Korea for North Korean bears and lynx, or sending South Korean firefighting helicopters to douse fires on the northern side of the demilitarized zone that divides the countries, parts of the long fortified border now look less like the Berlin Wall and more and more like Swiss cheese.
 ''Pressuring them, containing them won't work, they won't budge,'' Ihm Seon Thaek, a South Korean bulldozer operator, said one recent morning as he awaited a bus to take him to his job at a new industrial park run by South Koreans in Kaesong, North Korea. ''The solution is to have many Kaesongs. To have a lot of human contact.''
 Opened in December, Kaesong uses power and telephone service supplied by South Korea, and employs nearly 2,000 North Koreans and several hundred South Koreans. On the east coast, buses take an average of 19,000 South Korean tourists a month across the demilitarized zone to a North Korean resort -- almost double the level of a year ago.
 Cooperation between Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea has progressed in fits and starts since a June 2000 summit meeting, when Kim Dae Jung, then president of South Korea, traveled to Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader. Last July, relations went into a deep freeze, after North Korea protested South Korea's airlift to Seoul of about 460 North Korean defectors stranded in Vietnam.
 But now, perhaps in reaction to the threat of increased American pressure, North Korea is responding again to Seoul's overtures. In March, in the highest level meeting since 2000, South Korea's prime minister, Lee Hae Chan, met with Kim Yong Nam, the No.2 man in North Korea's hierarchy. Meeting at the Asia-Africa summit conference in Indonesia, the two posed amiably for photos and agreed to resume high-level talks.
 In a first step, sports officials from the North and South met at Mount Kumgang, North Korea's mountain resort, to discuss the South's proposal to rebuild gymnasiums in the North and for both sides to create joint cheering sections for international sport events.
 Then, a South Korean agricultural quarantine team drove to Kaesong to devise strategies to counter bird flu, an epidemic that forced North Korea to destroy 218,000 chickens this spring. Although the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has since announced that the bird flu outbreak had been contained, South Korea plans to ship to the North about $700,000 worth of testing kits, disinfectant sprayers and quarantine vehicles.
 By 2008, South Koreans should be able to travel by train from Seoul to Beijing through North Korea to attend the Olympics, South Korea's unification minister, Chung Dong Young, recently told the National Assembly. Foreseeing no ''technical'' problems to traveling by rail through the North Korea, he noted that the South had submitted a plan to the North to spend $25 million to build six rail stations in North Korea.

Korean Talks Set to Resume
 (By The New York Times) TOKYO, May 14 -- The two Koreas will renew their official dialogue on Monday, reviving a high level process frozen last summer after North Korea protested the airlift of about 460 North Korean asylum seekers from Vietnam to Seoul. 
 Meeting in Kaesong, North Korea, for two days, the delegations will be led by vice ministers. North Korea is expected to renew its appeal for 500,000 tons of fertilizer, almost double the annual level of recent years.
 In turn, South Korea is expected to ask the North to return to six-nation talks over its nuclear program and for a resumption of Red Cross-supervised visits between family members separated since the Korean War ended in 1953.
 At the same time, North Korea's state-run press attacked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In recent days, Ms. Rice has declared that North Korea is a sovereign nation, while also noting that the United States has a strong military precence in the Western Pacific.
 ''Rice's reckless remarks self-expose that her loudmouthed recognition of the sovereign state and the like were nothing but a ruse to conceal the U.S. attempt at bringing down the regime of the D.P.R.K. and mislead the public opinion,'' a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said in comments reported Saturday by the official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

HEADLINE: The Fine Art of Getting It Down on Paper, Fast

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
Imagine yourself a senior partner in a large accounting firm that has just hired a promising analyst from a top-tier college. You negotiate a generous salary and spend a fortune moving the new employee to an office in a distant city -- only to find that he can't write a lick. He crunches numbers well enough and clearly knows the principles of accounting. But like many otherwise bright, well-educated people, he was never trained to express his thoughts in words. The blood drains from your face as you read that first audit report, which is so poorly structured as to be unintelligible.
 These kinds of disappointments have a long history in the corporate world. Companies once covered for poor writers by surrounding them with people who could translate their thoughts onto paper. But this strategy has proved less practical in the bottom-line-driven information age, which requires more high-quality writing from more categories of employees than ever before. Instead of covering for nonwriters, companies are increasingly looking for ways to screen them out at the door. 
 This was clearly the subtext message of a report released last year by the National Commission on Writing, a panel of educators convened by the College Board. At the heart of the report -- titled ''Writing: A Ticket to Work or a Ticket Out'' -- is an eye-opening assessment of corporate attitudes about writing, surveying members of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives from the nation's leading corporations. 
 The findings, though given a positive gloss, were not encouraging. About a third of the companies reported that only one-third or fewer of their employees knew how to write clearly and concisely. The companies expressed a fair degree of dissatisfaction with the writing produced by recent college graduates -- even though many were blue-chip companies that get the pick of the litter. 
 The poor writing found among both new and established employees has turned business leaders into champions of education reform and of the No Child Left Behind Education Act, which aims to strengthen public schools and erase the achievement gap between rich and poor children. But persuading schools to improve math and reading instruction, even in exchange for federal dollars, has proved difficult. Persuading schools to rethink the teaching of writing -- those that teach it at all -- is going to be a lot harder. 
 The depth of the resistance to common-sense writing reforms became clear in April, when the National Council of Teachers of English attacked the College Board for adding a writing segment to the SAT, the college entrance exam required by an overwhelming majority of America's four-year colleges and universities. The test, which consists of a brief, timed essay and a multiple-choice section, has already put schools and parents on notice that writing instruction needs to improve.
 The English teachers, however, have other ideas. The group questioned the validity of the tests and trotted out the condescending notion that requiring poor and minority students to write in standard English is unfair because of their cultural backgrounds and vernacular languages. This is sadly reminiscent of the ''Ebonics'' proposal of the 1990's, in which misguided educators supported the appalling notion that street slang was as good or better than the standard tongue and should be given credence in student work produced for school.
 The council also tried to discredit the idea of timed writing tests. The report seemed to suggest that the only way to judge writing was to consider student work that had been rewritten and edited over longer periods of time. Long-term projects are important, but they do not cover all of the kinds of writing that students will be called upon to produce either in college or in their lives. On the contrary, substantive writing on demand for reports, correspondence and even e-mail is now a common feature of corporate life.
 The teachers also seemed to feel that only other English teachers were qualified to judge what good writing is. The evidence suggests, however, that most teachers have never taken a course in how to teach effective writing and that many don't know how to produce it themselves. 
 The blame lies not with the teachers, however, but with an American educational system that fails at every level to produce the fluent writers required by the new economy. To change that, the state colleges of education that produce most teachers will need to improve writing instruction courses and require all students to take them. The time devoted to writing instruction in kindergarten through 12th grade needs to be more skillfully used and doubled, at the very least. 
 The English teachers are right when they note that we live in a test-obsessed culture that puts far too much weight on the SAT. The test is supposed to be used as one element among many in deciding who enters college. But the test developers have performed an important service by bringing writing to the top of the national agenda.
 What we need now is a revolution in writing instruction, not just another test prep exercise.

HEADLINE: Market Day, Via France

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
UNFURLING his Paris-based company's red, white and blue canopies here, Sebastien Bensidoun was ready to show off the French-flavored market, with its vendors and stalls of homegrown vegetables and fruits.
 As the executive vice president of Bensidoun USA, which manages open-air farmers' markets throughout France, Mr. Bensidoun recently kicked off the company's second season in this city.
 On the early spring morning in this newly renovated downtown, the market served as a colorful counterpoint to the sleek new discount retailers and luxury high-rise buildings surrounding the market site, which is on Main Street in the City Hall parking lot, where it operates only on Wednesdays. 
 ''It's the globalization of open-air markets,'' said Mr. Bensidoun, 31, whose father started the company in 1953. The French-run farmers' markets indeed reflect a larger global marketing trend, with companies from abroad settling in locally. Earlier this month, Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, completed its purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer division, after the announcement that it plans to move its worldwide headquarters to Purchase from Beijing.
 The market's European style is unusual in the county, where similar enterprises have a distinctly hometown American feel, said Ted Lawson, coordinator of economic development for White Plains. The International Market, as it is called, provides shoppers with ''an eclectic mix'' of products, he said, noting, however, that the French marketing company agreed in its deal with the city to give precedence to local growers and merchants. 
 White Plains chose Bensidoun USA after learning from city planners in Chicago that the presence of farmers' markets in several different neighborhoods there stimulated economic development. ''They told us it uplifted the downtown,'' Mr. Lawson said. Most of the vendors last year in White Plains were locally based, he said, although one, a perfume maker, was from Europe, and another sold olive oil from a grove in Portugal.
 Bensidoun USA, which manages some 65 markets in Paris and northern France, moved several years ago to extend its reach to the United States. Today, it also runs 11 open-air markets in the Chicago area, and has just added another market in Stamford, Conn. 
 THE primary goal for White Plains is to draw more shoppers downtown, where a $1.6 billion rebuilding effort is under way, Mayor Joseph M. Delfino said. After a shopping spree at the new $350 million City Center complex across Main Street, what better way to end the day than with a purchase of fresh spinach and a crusty loaf of homemade bread at the open-air market, the mayor reasoned.
 He frequents the market himself; his favorite items are the French pastries made by New York City nuns who belong to Fraternite Notre Dame, a Catholic religious order and charitable group. ''You can always find me at the market at lunch hour on Wednesday,'' he said. 
 On the recent opening day, Israel Wengerd, a Mennonite farmer from Lewisburg, Pa., was selling fruits and vegetables in seven stalls. Across the aisle, Olivia Hill of Newburgh, N.Y., was selling homemade preserves and relishes.
 Mr. Bensidoun said the company, which will lease and oversee about 40 stalls in White Plains on Wednesdays, expects to draw its customers from the city's large daytime population, which swells to 250,000 with office workers from surrounding areas. The company charges $30 a day for a 13-by-6-foot stall that sells food, and $53 to a vendor with nonfood merchandise, he said.
 Several municipalities, like Greenburgh and New Rochelle, oversee their own markets. But some towns and villages have hired a local consulting firm to select vendors and manage the site. Community Markets, an Ossining-based management company, is a consultant for farmers' market groups in Ossining, Bronxville, Hastings-on-Hudson, Mount Vernon, Pleasantville, Rye and Tarrytown.
 According to a report from the United States Department of Agriculture in 2000, the number of farmers' markets in the nation grew to 2,863 in 2000 from 1,755 a decade earlier. By last year, numbers showed that New York was home to about 7 percent of the markets, according to other studies.
 In recent decades consumers have been seeking fresher merchandise, said Robert A. Lewis, the Brooklyn-based chief marketing representative for the state's Department of Agriculture and Markets. Some 10,000 acres of land are being farmed in the state because of farmers' markets in the New York region, he noted.
 He said that whether open-air markets have a European flair or are packaged locally, they tend to recall an earlier, less-frantic way of doing business.
 ''It's an opportunity to mingle with one's neighbors in kind of a time warp, part of an anti-mall movement,'' he said. ''It reminds people of another era of social interaction that was easier, more leisurely.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 5, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 15 about an outdoor market in White Plains incorrectly described an order of nuns who sell French pastries there. The Fraternite Notre Dame is not recognized by the Vatican and is not Catholic.

HEADLINE: The Future Of Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Matt Miller's May 11 column fails his ''responsible demagoguery'' test. 
 While he mocks Democrats' projections of benefit cuts for 2075, such projections for the distant future pale next to President Bush's deficit projections for the infinite future, which have become a staple of the Social Security debate. Furthermore, under President Bush's latest plan, middle-income workers would see large benefit cuts in just 15 years, even though currently scheduled benefits could be fully covered by their Social Security taxes.
 Mr. Miller's projection that the federal budget will take up 28 percent of G.D.P. by 2030 is driven by the assumption that United States health care costs will grow even further out of line with those in the rest of the world. Perhaps this is true, but people more responsible than Mr. Miller would be tackling the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, rather than beating up on middle-class retirees.

HEADLINE: Suffolk and Brookhaven Buy 300 Acres of Farmland

BYLINE: By Stewart Ain

 BODY:
Suffolk County and the Town of Brookhaven paid $13.4 million Wednesday to acquire the development rights to 11 farms totaling 300 acres, ensuring that the property will remain farmland and not be sold to developers.
 Steve Levy, the county executive, said that since he took office in January 2004, the county has bought development rights to 520 acres. 
The development rights acquired most recently were for farms in the towns of Brookhaven, Riverhead and Southold.
 Mr. Levy said there are 5,000 acres of farmland and open space that the county has identified for acquisition because of environmental or economic importance. The amount paid for the development rights is based on an appraisal that considers market forces and the property's location.
 ''These farmers are under tremendous pressure to sell off to developers,'' he said. ''They could get a check for millions of dollars.''
 He added, ''It's a lot cheaper for us to buy development rights than to buy the property outright.''
 Michael E. White, chairman of the Long Island chapter of the New York League of Conservation Voters, said he was pleased that Mr. Levy had ''reinvigorated the acquisition program.'' 
 ''The preservation program keeps farmers farming,'' Mr. White said. ''Farming is a critical part of our economy.''
 Suffolk is the largest producer of agriculture products by dollar value of any county of the state. Last year, that figure totaled $200 million from farms involved in growing sod, nursery and vegetable products.
 Mr. Levy said that farming was also important to the tourism industry because ''so much of North Fork tourism involves visits to wineries in the spring and summer and the pumpkin harvest in the fall.''

HEADLINE: Class in America: Shadowy Lines That Still Divide

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT and DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
There was a time when Americans thought they understood class. The upper crust vacationed in Europe and worshiped an Episcopal God. The middle class drove Ford Fairlanes, settled the San Fernando Valley and enlisted as company men. The working class belonged to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., voted Democratic and did not take cruises to the Caribbean.
 Today, the country has gone a long way toward an appearance of classlessness. Americans of all sorts are awash in luxuries that would have dazzled their grandparents. Social diversity has erased many of the old markers. It has become harder to read people's status in the clothes they wear, the cars they drive, the votes they cast, the god they worship, the color of their skin. The contours of class have blurred; some say they have disappeared.
 But class is still a powerful force in American life. Over the past three decades, it has come to play a greater, not lesser, role in important ways. At a time when education matters more than ever, success in school remains linked tightly to class. At a time when the country is increasingly integrated racially, the rich are isolating themselves more and more. At a time of extraordinary advances in medicine, class differences in health and lifespan are wide and appear to be widening. 
 And new research on mobility, the movement of families up and down the economic ladder, shows there is far less of it than economists once thought and less than most people believe. In fact, mobility, which once buoyed the working lives of Americans as it rose in the decades after World War II, has lately flattened out or possibly even declined, many researchers say.
 Mobility is the promise that lies at the heart of the American dream. It is supposed to take the sting out of the widening gulf between the have-mores and the have-nots. There are poor and rich in the United States, of course, the argument goes; but as long as one can become the other, as long as there is something close to equality of opportunity, the differences between them do not add up to class barriers.
 Over the next three weeks, The Times will publish a series of articles on class in America, a dimension of the national experience that tends to go unexamined, if acknowledged at all. With class now seeming more elusive than ever, the articles take stock of its influence in the lives of individuals: a lawyer who rose out of an impoverished Kentucky hollow; an unemployed metal worker in Spokane, Wash., regretting his decision to skip college; a multimillionaire in Nantucket, Mass., musing over the cachet of his 200-foot yacht.
 The series does not purport to be all-inclusive or the last word on class. It offers no nifty formulas for pigeonholing people or decoding folkways and manners. Instead, it represents an inquiry into class as Americans encounter it: indistinct, ambiguous, the half-seen hand that upon closer examination holds some Americans down while giving others a boost.
 The trends are broad and seemingly contradictory: the blurring of the landscape of class and the simultaneous hardening of certain class lines; the rise in standards of living while most people remain moored in their relative places.
 Even as mobility seems to have stagnated, the ranks of the elite are opening. Today, anyone may have a shot at becoming a United States Supreme Court justice or a C.E.O., and there are more and more self-made billionaires. Only 37 members of last year's Forbes 400, a list of the richest Americans, inherited their wealth, down from almost 200 in the mid-1980's.
 So it appears that while it is easier for a few high achievers to scale the summits of wealth, for many others it has become harder to move up from one economic class to another. Americans are arguably more likely than they were 30 years ago to end up in the class into which they were born.
 A paradox lies at the heart of this new American meritocracy. Merit has replaced the old system of inherited privilege, in which parents to the manner born handed down the manor to their children. But merit, it turns out, is at least partly class-based. Parents with money, education and connections cultivate in their children the habits that the meritocracy rewards. When their children then succeed, their success is seen as earned.
 The scramble to scoop up a house in the best school district, channel a child into the right preschool program or land the best medical specialist are all part of a quiet contest among social groups that the affluent and educated are winning in a rout.
 ''The old system of hereditary barriers and clubby barriers has pretty much vanished,'' said Eric Wanner, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a social science research group in New York City that recently published a series of studies on the social effects of economic inequality. 
 In place of the old system, Dr. Wanner said, have arisen ''new ways of transmitting advantage that are beginning to assert themselves.''

Faith in the System
 Most Americans remain upbeat about their prospects for getting ahead. A recent New York Times poll on class found that 40 percent of Americans believed that the chance of moving up from one class to another had risen over the last 30 years, a period in which the new research shows that it has not. Thirty-five percent said it had not changed, and only 23 percent said it had dropped.
 More Americans than 20 years ago believe it possible to start out poor, work hard and become rich. They say hard work and a good education are more important to getting ahead than connections or a wealthy background.
 ''I think the system is as fair as you can make it,'' Ernie Frazier, a 65-year-old real estate investor in Houston, said in an interview after participating in the poll. ''I don't think life is necessarily fair. But if you persevere, you can overcome adversity. It has to do with a person's willingness to work hard, and I think it's always been that way.''
 Most say their standard of living is better than their parents' and imagine that their children will do better still. Even families making less than $30,000 a year subscribe to the American dream; more than half say they have achieved it or will do so. 
 But most do not see a level playing field. They say the very rich have too much power, and they favor the idea of class-based affirmative action to help those at the bottom. Even so, most say they oppose the government's taxing the assets a person leaves at death.
 ''They call it the land of opportunity, and I don't think that's changed much,'' said Diana Lackey, a 60-year-old homemaker and wife of a retired contractor in Fulton, N.Y., near Syracuse. ''Times are much, much harder with all the downsizing, but we're still a wonderful country.''

The Attributes of Class
 One difficulty in talking about class is that the word means different things to different people. Class is rank, it is tribe, it is culture and taste. It is attitudes and assumptions, a source of identity, a system of exclusion. To some, it is just money. It is an accident of birth that can influence the outcome of a life. Some Americans barely notice it; others feel its weight in powerful ways.
 At its most basic, class is one way societies sort themselves out. Even societies built on the idea of eliminating class have had stark differences in rank. Classes are groups of people of similar economic and social position; people who, for that reason, may share political attitudes, lifestyles, consumption patterns, cultural interests and opportunities to get ahead. Put 10 people in a room and a pecking order soon emerges. 
 When societies were simpler, the class landscape was easier to read. Marx divided 19th-century societies into just two classes; Max Weber added a few more. As societies grew increasingly complex, the old classes became more heterogeneous. As some sociologists and marketing consultants see it, the commonly accepted big three -- the upper, middle and working classes -- have broken down into dozens of microclasses, defined by occupations or lifestyles.
 A few sociologists go so far as to say that social complexity has made the concept of class meaningless. Conventional big classes have become so diverse -- in income, lifestyle, political views -- that they have ceased to be classes at all, said Paul W. Kingston, a professor of sociology at the University of Virginia. To him, American society is a ''ladder with lots and lots of rungs.''
 ''There is not one decisive break saying that the people below this all have this common experience,'' Professor Kingston said. ''Each step is equal-sized. Sure, for the people higher up this ladder, their kids are more apt to get more education, better health insurance. But that doesn't mean there are classes.''
 Many other researchers disagree. ''Class awareness and the class language is receding at the very moment that class has reorganized American society,'' said Michael Hout, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. ''I find these 'end of class' discussions naive and ironic, because we are at a time of booming inequality and this massive reorganization of where we live and how we feel, even in the dynamics of our politics. Yet people say, 'Well, the era of class is over.'''
 One way to think of a person's position in society is to imagine a hand of cards. Everyone is dealt four cards, one from each suit: education, income, occupation and wealth, the four commonly used criteria for gauging class. Face cards in a few categories may land a player in the upper middle class. At first, a person's class is his parents' class. Later, he may pick up a new hand of his own; it is likely to resemble that of his parents, but not always.
 Bill Clinton traded in a hand of low cards with the help of a college education and a Rhodes scholarship and emerged decades later with four face cards. Bill Gates, who started off squarely in the upper middle class, made a fortune without finishing college, drawing three aces. 
 Many Americans say that they too have moved up the nation's class ladder. In the Times poll, 45 percent of respondents said they were in a higher class than when they grew up, while just 16 percent said they were in a lower one. Over all, 1 percent described themselves as upper class, 15 percent as upper middle class, 42 percent as middle, 35 percent as working and 7 percent as lower.
 ''I grew up very poor and so did my husband,'' said Wanda Brown, the 58-year-old wife of a retired planner for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard who lives in Puyallup, Wash., near Tacoma. ''We're not rich but we are comfortable and we are middle class and our son is better off than we are.''

The American Ideal
 The original exemplar of American social mobility was almost certainly Benjamin Franklin, one of 17 children of a candle maker. About 20 years ago, when researchers first began to study mobility in a rigorous way, Franklin seemed representative of a truly fluid society, in which the rags-to-riches trajectory was the readily achievable ideal, just as the nation's self-image promised.
 In a 1987 speech, Gary S. Becker, a University of Chicago economist who would later win a Nobel Prize, summed up the research by saying that mobility in the United States was so high that very little advantage was passed down from one generation to the next. In fact, researchers seemed to agree that the grandchildren of privilege and of poverty would be on nearly equal footing. 
 If that had been the case, the rise in income inequality beginning in the mid-1970's should not have been all that worrisome. The wealthy might have looked as if they were pulling way ahead, but if families were moving in and out of poverty and prosperity all the time, how much did the gap between the top and bottom matter?
 But the initial mobility studies were flawed, economists now say. Some studies relied on children's fuzzy recollections of their parents' income. Others compared single years of income, which fluctuate considerably. Still others misread the normal progress people make as they advance in their careers, like from young lawyer to senior partner, as social mobility.
 The new studies of mobility, which methodically track peoples' earnings over decades, have found far less movement. The economic advantage once believed to last only two or three generations is now believed to last closer to five. Mobility happens, just not as rapidly as was once thought. 
 ''We all know stories of poor families in which the next generation did much better,'' said Gary Solon, a University of Michigan economist who is a leading mobility researcher. ''It isn't that poor families have no chance.'' 
 But in the past, Professor Solon added, ''people would say, 'Don't worry about inequality. The offspring of the poor have chances as good as the chances of the offspring of the rich.' Well, that's not true. It's not respectable in scholarly circles anymore to make that argument.''
 One study, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, found that fewer families moved from one quintile, or fifth, of the income ladder to another during the 1980's than during the 1970's and that still fewer moved in the 90's than in the 80's. A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics also found that mobility declined from the 80's to the 90's.
 The incomes of brothers born around 1960 have followed a more similar path than the incomes of brothers born in the late 1940's, researchers at the Chicago Federal Reserve and the University of California, Berkeley, have found. Whatever children inherit from their parents -- habits, skills, genes, contacts, money -- seems to matter more today.
 Studies on mobility over generations are notoriously difficult, because they require researchers to match the earnings records of parents with those of their children. Some economists consider the findings of the new studies murky; it cannot be definitively shown that mobility has fallen during the last generation, they say, only that it has not risen. The data will probably not be conclusive for years.
 Nor do people agree on the implications. Liberals say the findings are evidence of the need for better early-education and antipoverty programs to try to redress an imbalance in opportunities. Conservatives tend to assert that mobility remains quite high, even if it has tailed off a little. 
 But there is broad consensus about what an optimal range of mobility is. It should be high enough for fluid movement between economic levels but not so high that success is barely tied to achievement and seemingly random, economists on both the right and left say.
 As Phillip Swagel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, put it, ''We want to give people all the opportunities they want. We want to remove the barriers to upward mobility.'' 
 Yet there should remain an incentive for parents to cultivate their children. ''Most people are working very hard to transmit their advantages to their children,'' said David I. Levine, a Berkeley economist and mobility researcher. ''And that's quite a good thing.''
 One surprising finding about mobility is that it is not higher in the United States than in Britain or France. It is lower here than in Canada and some Scandinavian countries but not as low as in developing countries like Brazil, where escape from poverty is so difficult that the lower class is all but frozen in place.
 Those comparisons may seem hard to believe. Britain and France had hereditary nobilities; Britain still has a queen. The founding document of the United States proclaims all men to be created equal. The American economy has also grown more quickly than Europe's in recent decades, leaving an impression of boundless opportunity.
 But the United States differs from Europe in ways that can gum up the mobility machine. Because income inequality is greater here, there is a wider disparity between what rich and poor parents can invest in their children. Perhaps as a result, a child's economic background is a better predictor of school performance in the United States than in Denmark, the Netherlands or France, one recent study found.
 ''Being born in the elite in the U.S. gives you a constellation of privileges that very few people in the world have ever experienced,'' Professor Levine said. ''Being born poor in the U.S. gives you disadvantages unlike anything in Western Europe and Japan and Canada.''

Blurring the Landscape
 Why does it appear that class is fading as a force in American life? 
 For one thing, it is harder to read position in possessions. Factories in China and elsewhere churn out picture-taking cellphones and other luxuries that are now affordable to almost everyone. Federal deregulation has done the same for plane tickets and long-distance phone calls. Banks, more confident about measuring risk, now extend credit to low-income families, so that owning a home or driving a new car is no longer evidence that someone is middle class. 
 The economic changes making material goods cheaper have forced businesses to seek out new opportunities so that they now market to groups they once ignored. Cruise ships, years ago a symbol of the high life, have become the ocean-going equivalent of the Jersey Shore. BMW produces a cheaper model with the same insignia. Martha Stewart sells chenille jacquard drapery and scallop-embossed ceramic dinnerware at Kmart. 
 ''The level of material comfort in this country is numbing,'' said Paul Bellew, executive director for market and industry analysis at General Motors. ''You can make a case that the upper half lives as well as the upper 5 percent did 50 years ago.'' 
 Like consumption patterns, class alignments in politics have become jumbled. In the 1950's, professionals were reliably Republican; today they lean Democratic. Meanwhile, skilled labor has gone from being heavily Democratic to almost evenly split.
 People in both parties have attributed the shift to the rise of social issues, like gun control and same-sex marriage, which have tilted many working-class voters rightward and upper income voters toward the left. But increasing affluence plays an important role, too. When there is not only a chicken, but an organic, free-range chicken, in every pot, the traditional economic appeal to the working class can sound off key.
 Religious affiliation, too, is no longer the reliable class marker it once was. The growing economic power of the South has helped lift evangelical Christians into the middle and upper middle classes, just as earlier generations of Roman Catholics moved up in the mid-20th century. It is no longer necessary to switch one's church membership to Episcopal or Presbyterian as proof that one has arrived.
 ''You go to Charlotte, N.C., and the Baptists are the establishment,'' said Mark A. Chaves, a sociologist at the University of Arizona. ''To imagine that for reasons of respectability, if you lived in North Carolina, you would want to be a Presbyterian rather than a Baptist doesn't play anymore.''
 The once tight connection between race and class has weakened, too, as many African-Americans have moved into the middle and upper middle classes. Diversity of all sorts -- racial, ethnic and gender -- has complicated the class picture. And high rates of immigration and immigrant success stories seem to hammer home the point: The rules of advancement have changed.
 The American elite, too, is more diverse than it was. The number of corporate chief executives who went to Ivy League colleges has dropped over the past 15 years. There are many more Catholics, Jews and Mormons in the Senate than there were a generation or two ago. Because of the economic earthquakes of the last few decades, a small but growing number of people have shot to the top.
 ''Anything that creates turbulence creates the opportunity for people to get rich,'' said Christopher S. Jencks, a professor of social policy at Harvard. ''But that isn't necessarily a big influence on the 99 percent of people who are not entrepreneurs.''
 These success stories reinforce perceptions of mobility, as does cultural myth-making in the form of television programs like ''American Idol'' and ''The Apprentice.''
 But beneath all that murkiness and flux, some of the same forces have deepened the hidden divisions of class. Globalization and technological change have shuttered factories, killing jobs that were once stepping-stones to the middle class. Now that manual labor can be done in developing countries for $2 a day, skills and education have become more essential than ever.
 This has helped produce the extraordinary jump in income inequality. The after-tax income of the top 1 percent of American households jumped 139 percent, to more than $700,000, from 1979 to 2001, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which adjusted its numbers to account for inflation. The income of the middle fifth rose by just 17 percent, to $43,700, and the income of the poorest fifth rose only 9 percent.
 For most workers, the only time in the last three decades when the rise in hourly pay beat inflation was during the speculative bubble of the 90's. Reduced pensions have made retirement less secure.
 Clearly, a degree from a four-year college makes even more difference than it once did. More people are getting those degrees than did a generation ago, but class still plays a big role in determining who does or does not. At 250 of the most selective colleges in the country, the proportion of students from upper-income families has grown, not shrunk. 
 Some colleges, worried about the trend, are adopting programs to enroll more lower-income students. One is Amherst, whose president, Anthony W. Marx, explained: ''If economic mobility continues to shut down, not only will we be losing the talent and leadership we need, but we will face a risk of a society of alienation and unhappiness. Even the most privileged among us will suffer the consequences of people not believing in the American dream.''
 Class differences in health, too, are widening, recent research shows. Life expectancy has increased over all; but upper-middle-class Americans live longer and in better health than middle-class Americans, who live longer and in better health than those at the bottom. 
 Class plays an increased role, too, in determining where and with whom affluent Americans live. More than in the past, they tend to live apart from everyone else, cocooned in their exurban chateaus. Researchers who have studied data from the 1980, 1990 and 2000 censuses say the isolation of the affluent has increased.
 Family structure, too, differs increasingly along class lines. The educated and affluent are more likely than others to have their children while married. They have fewer children and have them later, when their earning power is high. On average, according to one study, college-educated women have their first child at 30, up from 25 in the early 1970's. The average age among women who have never gone to college has stayed at about 22.
 Those widening differences have left the educated and affluent in a superior position when it comes to investing in their children. ''There is no reason to doubt the old saw that the most important decision you make is choosing your parents,'' said Professor Levine, the Berkeley economist and mobility researcher. ''While it's always been important, it's probably a little more important now.''
 The benefits of the new meritocracy do come at a price. It once seemed that people worked hard and got rich in order to relax, but a new class marker in upper-income families is having at least one parent who works extremely long hours (and often boasts about it). In 1973, one study found, the highest-paid tenth of the country worked fewer hours than the bottom tenth. Today, those at the top work more.
 In downtown Manhattan, black cars line up outside Goldman Sachs's headquarters every weeknight around 9. Employees who work that late get a free ride home, and there are plenty of them. Until 1976, a limousine waited at 4:30 p.m. to ferry partners to Grand Central Terminal. But a new management team eliminated the late-afternoon limo to send a message: 4:30 is the middle of the workday, not the end.

A Rags-to-Riches Faith
 Will the trends that have reinforced class lines while papering over the distinctions persist? 
 The economic forces that caused jobs to migrate to low-wage countries are still active. The gaps in pay, education and health have not become a major political issue. The slicing of society's pie is more unequal than it used to be, but most Americans have a bigger piece than they or their parents once did. They appear to accept the tradeoffs. 
 Faith in mobility, after all, has been consciously woven into the national self-image. Horatio Alger's books have made his name synonymous with rags-to-riches success, but that was not his personal story. He was a second-generation Harvard man, who became a writer only after losing his Unitarian ministry because of allegations of sexual misconduct. Ben Franklin's autobiography was punched up after his death to underscore his rise from obscurity.
 The idea of fixed class positions, on the other hand, rubs many the wrong way. Americans have never been comfortable with the notion of a pecking order based on anything other than talent and hard work. Class contradicts their assumptions about the American dream, equal opportunity and the reasons for their own successes and even failures. Americans, constitutionally optimistic, are disinclined to see themselves as stuck.
 Blind optimism has its pitfalls. If opportunity is taken for granted, as something that will be there no matter what, then the country is less likely to do the hard work to make it happen. But defiant optimism has its strengths. Without confidence in the possibility of moving up, there would almost certainly be fewer success stories.

ABOUT THE SERIES

This is the first in a series of articles examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent more than a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of unbounded opportunity.

Tomorrow: Class Is a Matter of Life and Death

An interactive graphic lets you see where your education, income, occupation and wealth place you. Also, a closer look at income mobility, full results of The New York Times poll, and a forum for reader responses.


GRAPHIC: Photos: ERMA GOULART -- SELF-DESCRIBED CLASS: LOWER
Hartford, W.Va. Ms. Goulart, 67, a widowed retiree with a high school education, strung beads for a jewelry maker, worked for sewage and coal companies, and owned a restaurant. ''I worked hard for what I have,'' she said. She sees unfairness. ''The rich get more benefits and tax breaks and the poor people don't,'' she said. ''Being raised poor, it was kind of hard,'' she recalled. She helped bring up her 11 siblings and now does the same for her disabled sister's children. ''I think the American dream is to help people,'' Ms. Goulart said.
MAURICE MITCHELL -- SELF-DESCRIBED CLASS: WORKING
Wilson, N.C. Mr. Mitchell, 37, manages his family's septic tank company, earning up to $75,000 a year. ''I hold the mortgage to my home,'' he said. ''I have the vehicle I want.'' A high school graduate, he never married but has two sons. ''I'm able to raise my children in a manner so they won't be picked on or laughed at in school.'' He said he believed that ''a man can start with nothing and work hard and get somewhere.'' But the ''gap between rich and poor will never close,'' he said. ''It's hard to get wealthy if your family isn't.''
STEVE SCHOENECK -- SELF-DESCRIBED CLASS: MIDDLE
Fergus Falls, Minn. Mr. Schoeneck, 39, is an accounting manager for an electrical utility. He and his wife, a preschool teacher, both college graduates, earn $85,000 a year. They have two daughters in school and a son, a sophomore at M.I.T. ''You always have the opportunity to try and move forward financially,'' he said. ''For me, the American dream is to earn a reasonable living and to be able to spend quality time with my family and my friends in a community that cares. Over all, I've achieved the American dream. I'm happy.''
BARBARA FREEBORN -- SELF-DESCRIBED CLASS: UPPER
 Northville, Mo. Ms. Freeborn, 47, a marketing executive, and her husband, a business owner, earn more than $150,000 a year. To her, the rich get ''preferential treatment, where they don't have to pay for things.'' But she sees many opportunities to make money now, ''in technology and health care and finance.'' Still, she said, America has changed since her parents' generation. ''I don't think they really aspired to have more than the house with a porch and to come home and have dinner.'' Today, she said, ''everybody wants more.'' (Photographs by FRED R. CONRAD/The New York Times)(pgs. 26, 27)Drawing

HEADLINE: The Empire Strikes Back

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
I spy for dead empires. It's my way of coping with the imperial ambitions of the living. I spy for Venice, Vienna, Istanbul: any imperial city that has lost its global reach.
 May I recruit you? We'll dress like American tourists, sip drinks on the terrace of the Gritti Palace and wave to passing groups of fellow agents disguised as Germans, Britons and Japanese. We'll wink knowingly at Russian impostors and counterfeit Swiss. No one will be the wiser, except possibly ourselves.
 The dead imperial city is a global place unto itself, an international state of mind built and operated by the curious and doubtful: it is the republic of the inner life. Let others struggle to become a superpower. We prefer the underpower, in superunderwear. Our undercover mission is to form alliances and pacts with the poets and dreamers who have preceded us. We work for them. 
 Of all the great imperial cities, Venice is the most intact. Its enduring integrity is as scandalous as the fact of its existence. 
 A swamp is not supposed to produce a great city, much less the most dazzling archipelago. Despite the decay of centuries, and partly because of it, Venice is remarkably unchanged from the day in 1797 when the last doge took off his hat.
 We start with Venice because Venice is our home. The information network was born there, at almost precisely the moment that Columbus stepped into the New World. That event precipitated the slow decline of Venice as a maritime power. The opening of Atlantic trade routes eventually enabled Genoa to overtake Venice as a center of international trade.
 But in 1490, two years before the Italian explorer sailed into the Caribbean, something occurred in Venice that would transform the relationship of European minds to the world. Aldus Manutius founded the Aldine Press. Whether you are reading these words on the printed page or on a computer screen, your access to them is a consequence of that event. While Gutenberg is fairly credited with the invention of movable type, it was Manutius who devised the first mass-distribution system of the information age. The technology of humanism stems from him.
 Smaller typefaces, reduced page sizes, longer print runs, bulk marketing to universities: such innovations produced more than books. They also produced literacy. People had to learn how to read the texts they could now afford to buy. Literacy, in turn, produced independence of mind. People of moderate means now had access to the ideas of Aristotle, Plato, Herodotus, Aristophanes and other classical authors who made up the core of Aldine's list. The Inquisition was not pleased, but the Venetians didn't care as long as the inquisitors agreed to pay for all the books they planned to burn.
 But the inner life needs more than books. It also craves what psychologists call implicit learning: the attainment of insight that occurs when we're not consciously focused on an object of study. Implicit learning is contingent on context, or situation. Fleeting stimuli from the outer world gives rise to enduring perceptions from within.
 The Romantics celebrated the natural environment for its power to induce insight. Quite a few of them reviled cities for presenting so many distractions that reflection becomes impossible. The truth is that certain kinds of learning benefit from the distractions that cities offer. The concept of the flaneur, or city wanderer, is based upon this principle. While taking in the sights of Berlin, Paris or Vienna, the flaneur is secretly spying on the self.
 ''Death in Venice'' is a great spy story. Aroused by a ''personal and lyrical experience'' while visiting Venice in 1911, Thomas Mann set out to discover what he wanted and why he wanted it. He imagined that he wanted classicism, a style that stands for the official reality of the public realm. Like Palladio's facade for the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, classicism represents the restraint of feeling by harmonious proportion.
 Mann was less than careful in choosing what he wished for, however. The classical facade turned out to be a doorway to the realm of unmanageable passion where his protagonist would meet his death. The entrance into Venice opens a secret doorway into the self, and though Mann felt compelled by social convention to give his story the appearance of a tragic ending, there is no evidence that he regretted walking through the door. So perhaps he chose carefully after all.
 The story can also be read as a guidebook, a Baedeker of the threshold between our inner and outer worlds. For every step Mann takes in the world of reality, his private eye surveils an equal measure of his psyche. Punching through the membrane of the reassuringly familiar, the spy uncovers a previously hidden recess of the world within. The result is a map where subjective perception and objective reality appear to merge.
 Millions have ''mapped'' themselves in Venice, and although the city map has changed little, ''nothing can be said here . . . ,'' as Mary McCarthy wrote, ''that has not been said before.'' Seldom has familiarity bred greater contempt, or more fear. Gosh, I might be unoriginal! To be the cliched Venetian tourist is surely a fate worse than death, unless you are Katharine Hepburn and willing to fall into a canal while the camera is rolling.
 But (and this has also been said millions of times before) I find it incredibly liberating to know that original insights are not possible in Venice. What matters is not that your insights are original but that they are yours. Fear of familiarity is the first membrane you must break through to make them so. At that point, you are not over the threshold. You are on it. And vice versa.
 An empire must do more than acquire and maintain foreign territories. It must colonize minds as well. It fell to the architects and artists of Venice to perform this psychological task. As Garry Wills has written, the Venetian empire was more than a political and economic system. It was a state religion. The function of the city was to translate the religion into a visual and spatial code. Geography was key. The code had to represent the religion's global mastery of time and space.
 The Piazzetta, the traditional gateway to Venice, symbolically encompasses the visitor within the city's cosmopolitan sphere. The Doge's Palace, for example, is a fusion of architectural styles from east, north and south. For this reason, Ruskin called it ''the central building of the world.'' The Doge's chapel, St. Mark's Basilica, is as much a political edifice as a religious one. The basilica's Byzantine style looks eastward: it embodied the city's view of itself as the Third Rome, Constantinople's heir to the imperial authority of the ancient world.
 On the exterior of the basilica, symbol and material become one. The walls are encrusted with booty brought back from Venice's imperial exploits in the eastern Mediterranean: sculptures, columns and decorative panels. Secular equivalents of the relics of St. Mark interred beneath the altar inside, these precious stones reinforced the legitimacy of the city's global ambitions. We never wanted this loot for ourselves, heaven forbid. The saints made us do it.
 By 1591, when the architect Jacopo Sansovino's exquisite library was completed, the imperial ethos had found more sophisticated ways to express itself. People were willing to accept representations of the past instead of ramming raw chunks of it into the walls. This was a huge convenience, because by then a new past had been invented for much of Italy, and eventually Venice had to go along with it. Rome was back!
 Renaissance classicism came late to Venice. The city's Byzantine roots, while spurious, died hard. The adjustment required a change in outlook as well as geography, but this meant adjusting to the likelihood of its own decline. Recasting itself as a Renaissance city implicitly acknowledged that the Mediterranean was turning into a backwater of the Atlantic. Who wanted to face that? It was like New York having to face the rise of L.A., or the United States trying to cope with the perception that the Old World has left the New behind as an embodiment of Enlightenment ideals. Ouch!
 But the tough could still go shopping. And no city has ever excelled like Venice at moving the merch. The key is knowing how to move minds. An empire of the inner life must be absolute, nothing must be excluded. Every emotion, mood and pattern of thought must be symbolically accounted for. Range, rather than depth, is the guiding principle. Every fantasy has been anticipated, often pictorialized by genius. And if genius isn't available, excess will do.
 If heaven is a golden dome, we will equip St. Mark's Basilica with a minimum of five golden domes, so a wandering eye will not miss the point. But it could be that heaven is draped with green and white damask. 
 In that case, we will add tassels and fringe and figure out how to turn marble into drapes. To heighten the celestial impression, we will include an image of hellish suffering, Titian's ''Martyrdom of St. Lawrence.'' Hugh Honour has written that ''apart from Raphael,'' Titian's work is ''the first successful nocturne in the history of art.'' It's impossible to imagine that a surveillance society like Venice would let itself be outdone in the business of depicting nightmares. So long as the pieties are observed, the most horrific fantasies can be represented.
 Hospitals will not suffice to treat the sick. There must be a statue of the Plague, and she must be surrounded by a church called Health. Special masks will be designed for specialized plague doctors. Featuring long beaks and painted-on glasses, the masks bring to mind Walt Disney by way of Hieronymus Bosch. Dried botanicals placed inside the beak enable the physician to inhale pleasing aromas while attending the mortally stricken.
 Absolutism is a symptom of histrionic personality disorder; that is to say, an absolute empire is absolutely hysterical. One must be the center of attention, or all hell breaks loose. Forget La Serenissima. Venice is Maximum Hysterissima. Its function is to embed the mind, or to seduce, as we once put it. The city was a Casanova before the man himself was born.
 The death of the empire did not diminish Venice's seductive powers. It enhanced them. Soft power is even more enticing without a gun pointed at your head. And the generation of soft power has been Venice's specialty since its empire collapsed.
 It's often assumed that the Industrial Revolution bypassed Venice, and that accounts for much of its charm. There are no cars, no trains. The bell towers have not given way to belching smokestacks. But in fact the empire would not have been possible without the technology to produce ships. The Arsenale, the Venetian shipyard, is generally considered to be Europe's first factory.
 And there can be little doubt that what followed the Industrial Revolution had its start in Venice. While the rest of the Continent was catching up to the Arsenale, Venice was retooling to produce the concept of contemporaneity. In the 19th century, Venice was Manchester's significant other, the refuge for romantic souls who recoiled from the industrial cities of the north. Some of Europe's most influential imaginations were fertilized by the city in decay. Ruskin argued passionately, and with alarming success, that Victorian architects should ornament the machine age with designs inspired by Venetian Gothic. The modern psychological novel derives as much from Proust's morbid obsession with Venice as from his observations of Belle Epoque society.
 The 20th century saw the conversion of Venice into what it is now: the world's leading showcase for advanced taste in art, architecture and motion pictures. When the Biennale took up quarters within the Arsenale, the onetime bastion of hard power became a distribution center for the soft. Eat your heart out, Genoa, if you still have one. These developments anticipated the techniques later adopted by other cities set on transforming themselves into centers of cultural consumption.
 But Venice intuitively grasped another aspect of contemporaneity. It didn't have to recruit you to its cause. You enlisted the instant you signed your passport. Like it or not (and implicit learning works best when you don't even know you're doing it), you became, at the least, a fellow traveler in the cause of fellow traveling. Fasten your seat belt: you're changing history simply by boarding the plane.
 Disembedding without re-embedding: that's Ulrich Beck's definition of the impact of globalization on individual consciousness. The traditional roles that have defined our identities in modern society are dissolving along with modern society itself. You're not just (a) an auto mechanic, (b) a talk-show host, (c) a housewife or (d) a red state or blue state. You're also, and mainly, an (o), for ''other'': an alternative to any identity imposed on you by social circumstances. Any experience that calls this identity into question: that is where you actually live. That's what qualifies you to participate in what Beck calls ''cosmopolitan republicanism,'' the fluid network of global affinities now emerging.
 Venice presents this network in microcosm. It is at once a stand-in for traditional social roles and a training ground for those unwilling to be trapped by them. Casanova managed to escape the city's prison. But the reason to visit Venice is to discover how much harder it must have been to break the imperial spell.

An empire must do more than acquire and maintain foreign territories. it must colonize minds as well. this task fell to the architects and artists of Venice. (Photographs by Massimo Vitali)The Venice Biennale: As the overheated art market continues to sizzle, it seems as if every city from S-o Paulo to Beijing now has a biennial -- Newark, anyone? -- but the one in Venice is still Mecca. Part fashion week, part spring break (the band Pulp played on the Grand Canal a few years back), the canal-carved city attracts the who's who of the global art world to schmooze, booze and take in some world-class work. The 51st Venice Biennale opens on June 12 with an impressive international roster selected by two seasoned curators, Maria de Corral and Rosa Martinez. Corral heads up the Italian pavilion at the Giardini, and Martinez is in charge of the show at the Arsenale, where emerging talent is showcased. Herewith, a list of the highlights, from the pavilions at the fair to poolside at the Hotel Cipriani.
MUSEO DRIVE: While 71 countries are represented (welcome, Afghanistan and Albania!), there are some essential pit stops on this world tour. Francesco Vezzoli, a fashion favorite, is screening his film ''Trilogia della Morte,'' inspired by Italian art-house cinema and sponsored by Prada, at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini. Ed Ruscha is representing the United States, while work by Gilbert and George s will be on display at the British stall. There's finally a Chinese pavilion,t headed by Cai Guo-Qiang, the large-scale installation artist known for over-the-top pyrotechnics. Check out the collaboration between Olafur Eliasson and the star architect David Adjaye at the pavilion for the Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary.
GET A ROOM: Fast! Things fill up quickly, so don't expect to find a last-minute deal at Hotel Cipriani (Giudecca, 10
011 39 041 520 7744). But do stop by the hotel's pool, to press the flesh with art-world titans like David Zwirner and Larry Gagosian. Hotel Gritti Palace t (Campo Santa Maria del Giglio, San Marco, 2467
011 39 041 794 611) exudes Old World hauteur and is a favorite among museum trustees. The terrace, where Jay Jopling threw a bash at the last Biennale, is a prime perch for power-broking. The Bauer Hotel (Campo San Moise, San Marco, 1459
011 39 041 520 7022) is another command post. The gallery owner Jeffrey Deitch rents a palazzo for his near and dear (including Mariko Mori, who is presenting her ''Wave UFO'' t project at the fair).
CAFE SOCIETY: Harry's Dolci, on the island of Giudecca, is the spot for long, inebriated lunches alfresco. ''Everybody goes to Alla Madonna for the great fish,'' the gallerist Barbara Gladstone says of the always-packed seafood restaurant (Calle della Madonna, San Polo, 594). She also likes Da Fiore (Calle del Scaleter, San Polo, 2202a), which foodies consider the town's top restaurant, with its feathery-light gamberetti fritti (fried shrimp) and sardines.s The artist Francesco Vezzoli prefers Corte Sconta t (Calle del Pestrin, Castello, 3886) for its delightful food and lovely garden. Despite the hidden location, the rest of the art-world intelligentsia, including David Zwirner and the New Museum of Contemporary Art director, Lisa Phillips, all end up there, too.
A DRINKING LIFE: Your art pilgrimage wouldn't be complete without the proverbial Bellini s at Harry's Bar, near Piazza San Marco. ''It's expensive and intense, but I always go at least once,'' Deitch admits. Last call in this town is typically 1 a.m., which is kiddie hour for the starving-artist set. For late-night revelry, everyone ends up at Haig's Grill in Campo Santa Maria del Giglio. Here's a tip: Buy a couple of bottles of wine there before closing time and join the bacchanal that continues outside. The student square, the Santa Margherita, is another gathering place for hipster art stars like Vik Muniz and Ernesto Caivano.
STRICTLY V.I.P.: Each country throws some kind of shindig, so the social side of the Biennale often trumps the art part. ''It can feel a little like the Cannes film festival,'' Deitch says. The Bloomberg party for the British pavilion in 2001 was spectacular. ''They took over an island and rehabilitated various old ruins,'' Phillips recalls. The dinner for Gilbert and George on June 8, to be thrown by the Lehmann Maupin, White Cube, Sonnabend, Bernier/Eliades and Thaddaeus Ropac galleries, should be a boldface blowout. Francesca von Habsburg, along with Simon de Pury and Giovanni Volpi, will give a party for the artist Janet Cardiff's tome, ''The Walk Book,'' s at the Palazzo Volpi. Expect plenty of groovy Europeans clamoring to get in. And then, of course, there will be all those private yacht parties.
OLD MASTERS: Gladstone escapes the contemporary-art-world corridors and heads to the island of Torcello to see the mosaics at the Cathedral of Santa Maria dell'Assunta, specifically ''The Madonna and Child,'' s a masterwork from the 12th century. Zwirner visits the Accademia to take in the bold brushwork of Titian.
CANAL PLUS: After the festivities in Venice, the conga line heads north to Switzerland, where Art Basel and big business begin (June 15 to 20). For those who want to squeeze in more culture, head to Villa Manin in Passariano (about an hour's drive from Venice), where the art curators Kaspar Konig and Francesco Bonami have selected work from the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the most important contemporary-art collection in Europe (June 8 to Nov. 6). Phillips and her group will take a tour possibly to check out the mosaics in Ravenna and Palladian villas along the Po River. ''You can never see these things enough,'' she says.

HEADLINE: Fly Me

BYLINE: By Tyler Brule

 BODY:
A DESIGN MAVEN's plan for a new AIRLINE. About once a day I get an idea for a new airline. I redesigned one once, but the provocation continues. On a wind-swept airfield in Bavaria, I spy a tired-looking Embraer from the Polish carrier LOT and think the airline should become Mitteleuropa's new supercarrier with a livery that plays up the country's royal past. Gazing heavenward at Heathrow's westerly approach path, an MEA Airbus inbound from Beirut makes me think that Lebanon needs a sexier, hotter-looking flag bearer. In the air from Hong Kong to Seoul, I wonder why long-haul travel remains a nightmare for the tens of thousands who want more choice, more control and fewer unnecessary extras. 
 I've spent the better part of six months daydreaming about this new long-haul carrier and what it might look like, how it would function and where it might innovate. After the success of brands like Southwest Airlines, Air Berlin and EasyJet, there has been considerable talk about all kinds of aviation players moving into the low-cost, long-haul market. We've heard about designs for discounted single-class carriers linking Baltimore and London; consortiums planning to use the new A380 Airbus as a 700-seat supersaver for passengers willing to become contortionists in the process of crossing the Atlantic; and plans to turn a pair of 747's into the aviation equivalent of the Volkswagen bus -- complete with engines painted to look like beer cans. No prizes for guessing that the target market for this venture is the Anglo-Antipodean backpacker.
 Serving a mix of established and emerging centers (Los Angeles, London and New York, as well as Sapporo, Helsinki and Istanbul), my carrier would operate a fleet of Airbus A340's in a single-class configuration. The livery would be white, olive and hot yellow, and the interiors would be a soothing mix of grays, taupes and a bit more olive. To run a profitable operation, I'd have to squeeze in as many seats as possible while still making my passengers comfortable and happy. To achieve this, I would adopt the design of a German sun chair that I've sampled slopeside in Switzerland many times, and create a new industry standard. Since my new carrier would be aimed at the small entrepreneur who doesn't have the luxury of a corporate expense account, he or she won't be expecting an air bed for the amazing prices I'd offer. What would greet them instead would be a two-three-two configuration, with seats reclining to a position not unlike a good deck chair that can be adjusted for working, dining, laptop viewing and solid stretches of uninterrupted sleep.
 Passengers would be entitled to crisp, cotton-covered privacy ''ears'' for power naps (and for keeping their neighbors out of their field of vision), the largest television screen in the sky and wireless Internet access. The entertainment choices would be endless, as passengers could download anything they wanted to their laptops, and for those not armed with a PowerBook there would be a library offering all those titles you never quite get time to see down at your alternative movie house. In the galley, the focus would be on keeping things as fresh and flexible as possible for meals while limiting the number of choices. For Sapporo flights, there would be heaping bowls of curry rice; for London, sausages with bubble and squeak. The bar would offer one good red wine, a crisp white and a house beer brewed specially for the airline.
 At the aircraft's midsection and tail, there would be stand-up self-service bars for mingling, leg stretching and duty-free purchasing. Rather than the duty-free trolley that has been designed to trap hundreds of passengers in their seats while it rattles down the aisle, the duty-free kiosk would be stocked with items that this carrier's audience might actually want: a handbag by Marc Jacobs, swim trunks from Sundek, pens by Tombow and an iPod Shuffle in an exclusive color and finish.
 Of course, this whole environment would be supported by fresh-faced, eager crew members speaking no fewer than three languages each, with a keen sense of irony and looking fetching in their thick poplin shirtdresses and sandals or fitted three-button blazers and flat-front trousers.
 In all, a rather democratic and dignified experience in which the passengers would feel empowered and pampered. Not to mention the satisfying sense that they would be getting exactly what they paid for.

HEADLINE: OLD FOES SOFTEN TO NEW REACTORS

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
Several of the nation's most prominent environmentalists have gone public with the message that nuclear power, long taboo among environmental advocates, should be reconsidered as a remedy for global warming.
 Their numbers are still small, but they represent growing cracks in what had been a virtually solid wall of opposition to nuclear power among most mainstream environmental groups. In the past few months, articles in publications like Technology Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Wired magazine have openly espoused nuclear power, angering other environmental advocates.
 Stewart Brand, a founder of the Whole Earth Catalog and the author of ''Environmental Heresies,'' an article in the May issue of Technology Review, explained the shift as a direct consequence of the growing anxiety about global warming and its links to the use of fossil fuel.
 ''It's not that something new and important and good had happened with nuclear, it's that something new and important and bad has happened with climate change,'' Mr. Brand said in an interview. 
 For many longtime advocates of environmental causes, such talk is nothing short of betrayal. Because of safety fears that reached a peak during the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and unresolved questions of how to dispose of nuclear waste, environmentalists have waged unrelenting campaigns against plants from Shoreham on Long Island to Diablo Canyon near the California coast.
 But as mounting scientific evidence points to a direct connection between increasing carbon emissions and climate change, Mr. Brand and others have come to see conventional fuels like oil and coal as a greater threat.
 In his article, Mr. Brand argued, ''Everything must be done to increase energy efficiency and decarbonize energy production.'' He ran down a list of alternative technologies, like solar and wind energy, that emit no heat-trapping gases. ''But add them all up,'' he wrote, ''and it's just a fraction of enough.'' His conclusion: ''The only technology ready to fill the gap and stop the carbon-dioxide loading is nuclear power.'' 
 In recent statements, three top environmental experts -- Fred Krupp, the executive director of Environmental Defense, and Jonathan Lash, the president of the World Resources Institute and James Gustave Speth, the dean of Yale's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies -- have stopped well short of embracing nuclear power, but they have emphasized that it is worth trying to find solutions to the economic, safety and security, waste storage and proliferation issues rather than rejecting the whole technology.
 These efforts to edge away from the established orthodoxy coincide with moves by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, to offer significant financial incentives for the development of three new nuclear technologies --each with its own corporate backer -- as part of a bill he and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, are sponsoring to regulate emissions of heat-trapping gases.
 ''We've got to go to all alternate forms of energy, nuclear power,'' Mr. McCain told Don Imus during an appearance on his MSNBC show Friday morning. 
 The addition to the McCain-Lieberman bill, which is being circulated in draft form, would codify a new political bargain. Conservatives would support emission controls in return for liberal support for a new generation of nuclear power plants, a shift that could reshape the existing alignments on these issues. 
 Details of the proposed new language in the McCain-Lieberman bill, some of which were first reported in The Energy Daily, a trade publication, were provided by a person who had read a draft. He requested anonymity because no final decision on the measure has been made.
 Those environmentalists who are newly outspoken in favor of nuclear power lace their views with qualifiers.
 Mr. Krupp of Environmental Defense said in an interview, ''There are still very serious questions that have not been answered and E.D. is not going to be supporting nuclear power until we get good answers.'' 
 But, he added, ''We are taking a fresh look and we want to pursue the answers, get the answers, because the global warming problem is so serious.''
 Mr. Speth of Yale, the author of ''Red Sky at Morning,'' a book painting global warming as a crisis, said in an interview that if there were a national program to control the emission of heat-trapping gases, ''I think we would want nuclear to be one of the technologies that is out there, competing on a level playing field with the others.'' 
 The changing attitudes are roiling established environmental groups and provoking fierce internal arguments in the United States and in Europe. In this country, some groups used antinuclear campaigns to build membership, financial support and often their fundamental identities back in the 1970's, when Birkenstocks were new and the folksinger Arlo Guthrie was celebrating the antinuclear Clamshell Alliance.
 The release of radioactivity at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 brought a halt to any thought of expanding nuclear technology in the United States.
 Now, groups like Greenpeace U.S.A., the Sierra Club, the World Wildlife Fund and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group argue with one voice that any more time or money spent on nuclear energy would unjustifiably divert resources from more promising solutions, like conservation and renewable energy.
 It has been 32 years since the last nuclear reactor was ordered and built in the United States, and 1996 was the last year in which a civilian nuclear reactor -- the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar reactor -- was commissioned. Nuclear reactors, almost all of them the first generation of this technology, now provide about 20 percent of electric power in the United States.
 Aside from the environmental issues, it is still far from clear when the fundamental economics of energy generation would favor the construction of new nuclear plants in the United States. Officials of electric company officials and those of companies that design and build reactors have said recently that without substantial government help, the costs of winning regulatory approval and building nuclear plants would be dauntingly high for investors.
 The proposals that Senator McCain is considering would provide a 50-50 cost-sharing arrangement, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies, to gain federal certification for three new designs for nuclear plants. On Monday he met with Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, which constructs nuclear plants.
 Such subsidies are still anathema to most environmental groups, which believe that the nuclear industry got far more than its fair share of government aid in the last generation, while their technologies of choice were left hungry. 
 ''The notion out there from some of these deep thinkers is that we have to take our medicine and if only we could accept nukes, the global warming problem would be solved,'' said Anna Aurilio, the legislative director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ''We have a whole bunch of solutions already that are not as risky.'' These include, Ms. Aurilio said, increasing national energy efficiency and investing in solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy, like ethanol.
 Thomas B. Cochran, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's nuclear program said: ''The issue isn't: Do you support nuclear? The issue should be: Do you support massive subsidies to the tune of billions of dollars for nuclear power?'' He said, ''The answer is no.'' 
 The most frequent objection to nuclear reactors is that they may lead to the spread of nuclear weapons. In an era when hostile or potentially hostile governments like those in North Korea and Iran are gaining proficiency in nuclear weapons technology, opponents ask, why support a technology that would generate more weapons-grade fuel? They also balk at the notion that nuclear waste can be safely and economically stored.
 The anger at the magazine articles advocating nuclear power was visceral. In the April edition of Wired, the editors wrote: ''In February, we suggested it's time to reconsider nuclear power; readers had a meltdown.'' They said, ''Even onetime environmentalist-in-chief Al Gore chimed in at Davos, complaining directly to our editor in chief.''
 One letter to the magazine called the article -- ''Nuclear Now!'' by Peter Schwartz and Spencer Reiss -- ''right-leaning, Cheney-worshipping drivel about clean nuclear power'' and said, ''The bottom line is that nuclear power is inherently dangerous, and we have no way of disposing of the intensely radioactive trash it generates.''
 Mr. Brand, the author of the Technology Review article, believes that these arguments will, if anything, get more intense. After ''decades of getting a message out and getting a degree of alignment'' he said, ''it's hard to reverse the polarity on this.''
 Jerry Slominski, a lobbyist for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group for manufacturers, has yet to see much movement in the core constituencies of environmental groups. 
 ''I think there's a lot of talk, but I haven't seen a real shifting in policy among environmental groups,'' Mr. Slominski said. ''They just don't know how to get from here to there, I think.''
 But Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, disagreed.
 ''I do think that things are changing,'' Ms. Claussen said. ''I think people in the environmental community are getting more realistic about what is possible and what is not. At the same time, they are getting more panicky, maybe, about what you have to do to deal with climate change.''

HEADLINE: The Towering Problem

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Things seem to get old a lot faster than they used to. Modernism -- yesterday's holy terror, yesterday's tomorrow -- has already reached senescence, and the preservationist impulse that once protected Victorian and Beaux-Arts monuments from the wrecking ball has now turned to the cause of the modern.
 There's an obvious, and perhaps humbling, paradox in shielding from destruction and decay the chief specimens of a movement that presented itself as the expression of irresistible forces of change. It was, after all, the Modernist remaking of cities that obliterated so much of the pre-existing urban landscape. Indeed, for that very reason, few urbanites will mourn the passing of the Modernist moment. Many of the movement's high priests, most famously Le Corbusier, recoiled in horror from the anarchic energies of city life. ''We must kill the street!'' Corbu cried. And he imagined an architecture in which a grid of aerial highways connected high-rise towers surrounded by grass. Cars here, people there; work here, habitat there. 
 Corbu never got to rebuild Paris, thank God, but his vision of ''the tower in the park'' helped to produce the distinctive urbanism of the second half of the 20th century. In ''The Seduction of Place: The City in the Twenty-First Century,'' the architectural historian Joseph Rykwert praises high Modernist structures like Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building on Park Avenue, but he observes that the developers and architects who reared a double column of mighty steel towers on the Avenue of the Americas took over Mies's ''total disregard of urban form, with none of the virtues of Mies's obsessional care over detail, and between them produced one of the more devastating urban landscapes of the century.''
 The prophets of Modernism provided the intellectual and even moral rationale for ''urban renewal,'' the epic campaign of bulldozing that flattened so many crooked old neighborhoods in the name of health and progress. As Marshall Berman writes in ''All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity,'' ''The tragic irony of Modernist urbanism is that its triumph has helped to destroy the very urban life it hoped to set free.''
 And so, yes, let's preserve the exemplary buildings, but not the urban principles that lay behind them. We can revitalize Lincoln Center -- as the innovative firm of Diller Scofidio & Renfro is now setting out to do -- but still recognize that if we were starting from scratch today we wouldn't mass a suite of shimmering white buildings on a mighty white plinth. Nor would we clear the space for it by flattening a neighborhood -- even a gamy one -- as Robert Moses, New York's master builder and destroyer, did in the late 50's. It's no coincidence that in the ''cultural district'' now being planned for Fort Greene in Brooklyn, the arts facilities are to be scattered around the neighborhood. In a rebuttal to Modernist practice, the architectural planner Charles Renfro speaks fondly of the project's ''porosity.''
 What, then, is the answer to the ''tragic irony''of Modernist urbanism? The mightiest blow ever struck against this doctrine came in Jane Jacobs's ''Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' Jacobs argued that it wasn't green grass, broad vistas and spanking new buildings that urbanites craved; it was, rather, ''the intricate sidewalk ballet'' of her old, warrenlike Greenwich Village neighborhood. Jacobs provided a countervocabulary, a language of authentic urbanism, which preservationists and neighborhood advocates have been wielding against developers and municipal authorities ever since.
 But ''Death and Life'' appeared in 1961. Jacobs's image of a city of stable, small-scale enclaves, where everyone knows everyone, may have been romantic even then; now it seems tinged with a hopeless melancholy. It is we, the restless moderns, who untangle the dense weave of these communities by moving into them, and by converting their coffee shops into espresso bars. Marshall Berman cherishes Jacobs's vision and lambastes Moses, but he admits that neither he nor any of his friends would have stayed in their beloved Bronx neighborhood even if Moses hadn't callously destroyed it to build the Cross Bronx Expressway.
 The machine-clean and functionally mapped future toward which Modernism once beckoned now strikes us not only as soulless but almost comically archaic as well; and yet the organic and folkloric alternative offers us a city in amber -- the urban equivalent of the retro baseball stadium. What is the proper relationship of the tall building to the street? Today, New York is one of the very few American cities where the street matters enough that the problem bears thinking about. Preservation is well and good; but for New Yorkers -- and urbanites everywhere -- reimagining the street would constitute a greater contribution to 21st-century urbanism than protecting another chaste glass box.

HEADLINE: Mere Half Billion Easily Absorbed In Budget Fight

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
THERE was a spark of bipartisan euphoria this month with the news that lawmakers were entering the perennially tenacious budget negotiations with a surplus of more than a half-billion dollars, more than twice the expected cushion. Within days, however, the good will was gone.
 While most lawmakers agreed that budget negotiations have been more cordial since M. Jodi Rell became governor, at least when compared with the process under John G. Rowland, the talks have hardly been tension-free. One legislative leader defiantly predicted that Mrs. Rell, after promising to veto proposals by the Democrats, would suffer a hand injury from signing those vetoes. Another lawmaker walked out of negotiations because he was denied his request to open the meetings to the public.
 Budget season is usually rancorous, and not even the good news about the surplus arrived without disagreement. The governor's office estimated it at $602 million, while the Office of Fiscal Analysis, the nonpartisan state agency that works for the Legislature, said it was $700 million. A deficit is predicted for fiscal 2006, but the governor's office estimated it at $1 billion, the Democrats at $400 million. 
 And whatever its size, the surplus does not eliminate the need to wrestle with two issues that are among the Legislature's most contentious: how much to exceed the state spending cap and whether to institute the so-called millionaire's tax.
 ''There are the Democrats who want to spend as much as they want and raise taxes, the governor who wants to raise taxes a little, and the Republicans who want to cut spending and not raise taxes at all,'' said Robert M. Ward of North Branford, a Republican and House minority leader.
 On Feb. 7, Mrs. Rell released her budget, a $31.1 billion plan with $15.27 billion in 2006 and $15.86 billion in 2007. The proposal, which is subject to revision by the Legislature, calls for $624 million in spending cuts and as much as $585 million in tax increases, primarily on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol, and on special financing measures for fiscal year 2006, which begins July 1.
 But here, too, the numbers depend on how the tax increase is calculated. Mrs. Rell's office has said her tax increases, minus the financing measures, total about $140 million, while Democrats said they equal as much as $585 million.
 Her budget plan increases spending 3.9 percent in both fiscal 2006 and 2007. She would give $100 million of the surplus to cities and towns and use another $100 million for pensions for teachers.
 This year's surplus was originally expected to be about $330 million, but tax revenue from individuals and businesses soared after the April 15 filing deadline, more than doubling it. From the inheritance tax on just two estates, the state received payments of $40 million and $18 million.
 But the bulk of the surplus appears to be from capital gains taxes, not income taxes, said Robert L. Genuario, the governor's budget director.
 In recognizing the origin of the surplus, Mr. Genuario sounded a sobering note, one that cautions against building a budget based on the windfall from capital gains. Based on this philosophy, it is better to spend a surplus on one-time expenditures.
 ''Capital gains are more mercurial than withholding,'' said Mr. Genuario, who is in his first year as the governor's budget director, but who served for 14 years as a state senator. ''These types of surges in income tax receipts may not repeat themselves in 2006.''
 The Democrats' plan would increase spending by an additional 1.7 percent above the governor's proposal for each of the next two fiscal years. Under the plan, which could be voted on by the House and the Senate any day now, the gap between proposed spending and forecasted revenue was $922 million, which would have to be reconciled by more taxes and spending cuts.
 Mrs. Rell reacted to the plan by shelving her characteristic reserve and vowing to ''veto it without hesitation.'' In response, James A. Amann, a Democrat who is speaker of the House, said the Democrats would merely pass new budgets and predicted Mrs. Rell would suffer carpal tunnel syndrome from vetoing so many.
 Under the Democrats' plan, the increase in spending would be offset, in part, by raising taxes on the state's wealthiest rather than instituting so-called sin taxes, a measure proposed by Mrs. Rell that Mr. Amann said unjustly targets lower-income residents. He said the governor was echoing her predecessor.
 ''The Rowland-Rell administration nickel-and-dimed taxpayers over the years,'' he said. ''If I closed my eyes at her budget address in February, I could have sworn I was listening to her give the same talk that Rowland used to give.''
 But like his Democratic colleagues, Mr. Amann said he agreed with at least two of Mrs. Rell's ideas for the surplus, giving back money to cities and towns and financing teacher retirement.
 The governor has proposed using $170 million of the state's surplus to prepay its short-term notes and an additional $50 million owed to an early-retirement program for state employees. The state owes $14.1 billion on bonded projects, Mr. Genuario said. He said Connecticut has the highest per capita debt in the nation, about $4,000 for every resident.
 Yet Connecticut has the highest per capita income of any state, at $45,398, 38 percent above the national average, a fact that bolsters the philosophy behind a proposal by Democrats to institute a so-called millionaire's tax. 
 The idea of increasing taxes for high-income residents here gained steam in 2002 when, during pitched negotiations with the state employee unions, Governor Rowland flirted with the Democratic proposal before quickly abandoning it. Mrs. Rell had said she would not support an increase in income tax regardless of income levels, Mr. Genuario said.
 On Monday, Donald E. Williams Jr., a Democrat and Senate president pro tem, expressed disappointment that Mrs. Rell would not consider a millionaire's tax.
 ''That's new,'' he said. ''In the past, she hasn't ruled that out.''
 Eileen M. Daily, a Democrat of Westbrook who is chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said her party's proposal would increase taxes for couples with incomes above $500,000 and individuals above $260,000.
 Not all Democrats agreed that the threshold should be that low. Lt. Gov. Kevin B. Sullivan, who was considering a gubernatorial run, said setting the bar at $260,000 simply played into the Republican's hands. He said he would be more apt to support a ''true millionaire's tax,'' on incomes of $1 million.
 The idea of levying higher taxes on the richest residents has gained ground in other states, notably New Jersey and California. Last year, New Jersey increased taxes for people with incomes of $500,000 or more, said Bert Waisanen, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. In California, voters approved a millionaire's tax last November to finance mental health programs.
 The issue of the spending cap has also divided lawmakers along partisan lines. The cap, which was offered in 1991 as a salve to residents who were dismayed by the creation of the state's first income tax that same year, is a percentage limit on the state's budget growth. By law, budget expenditures cannot be increased over the previous year at a rate greater than the growth in either personal income or inflation without a gubernatorial declaration and the approval of 60 percent of the House and Senate. The state has exceeded the cap three times in the last five years, Mr. Williams said.
 The budgets of the governor and the Democrats propose that the state exceed the spending cap, but differ over how much. Mrs. Rell's proposal would exceed the cap by $190 million. The Democrats have proposed exceeding the cap by $430 million.
 Legislators like Ms. Daily described the budget process as ''fascinating, exhausting, intellectually challenging.''
 ''Most of the time, we act together to hammer something out,'' she said. ''And most of the time, it's not a fight.''

HEADLINE: If You Pay to Build It, Hall of Fame May Come

BYLINE: By VIV BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., May 14 

 BODY:
The country that was first to mass produce the automobile has been mass producing halls of fame and museums to honor racecar drivers for years.
 Start with the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Talladega, Ala., which calls itself the Canton, Ohio, of Motorsports. Add the Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame in Daytona Beach, Fla.; the Motorsports Museum and Hall of Fame in Novi, Mich.; and the Joe Weatherly Museum and National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame in Darlington, S.C. There are motorsports halls of fame in North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, among others. There is even a Winston Cup Museum in Winston-Salem, N.C., honoring tobacco's history in Nascar. 
 Despite all of those and more, Nascar officials have decided they need their own hall of fame and museum. And they have come up with a way to have somebody else build it for them.
 Nascar has put its hall up for bid. Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Daytona Beach, Fla.; Richmond, Va.; and Kansas City, Kan., are vying for the opportunity to spend millions in private and public dollars to build Nascar's hall. The deadline for cities to present their plans is May 31.
 ''We always knew that there were all kinds of motorsports hall of fames serving our industry and Nascar fairly well,'' Brian France, Nascar's chairman and chief executive, said in a phone interview earlier this month. ''But the reality today is, Nascar, the industry, is so different now than open wheel and other forms. We're just going in a different direction, and we need to have our own hall of fame.''
 Nascar's approach is different from that of other sports. The Baseball Hall of Fame is in Cooperstown, N.Y., once universally thought to be the sport's birthplace. Pro football's is in Canton, Ohio, where the National Football League was founded. 
 But that is not the Nascar way.
 ''We want the best hall of fame,'' France said. ''It's going to be expensive. It's going to be a big project, and to do that we've got to have a competitive environment and we also have to sell it, meaning we've got to sell the economic impact and benefits. And the best way to sell that is to let a bunch of people study it and come up with options for us.''
 Mayor Pat McCrory of Charlotte is hopeful that Nascar's deep North Carolina roots will matter come decision day. He has taken to calling the region Nascar Valley, because many of the Nascar race teams make their home near Charlotte. But deep North Carolina pockets will mean just as much. 
 The city is prepared to raise the hotel tax to help finance a downtown hall of fame, and it expects as much as $35 million more in state and private financing. 
 ''I think it is worth an awful lot to Charlotte,'' McCrory said. ''We consider this the home of Nascar.''
 Daytona Beach is having a problem matching Charlotte's dollars. The city, Nascar's home base and the site of the annual Daytona 500, has history on its side, but it lost a key component of its bid when the Florida Legislature declined to approve $30 million in financing for the hall. John Saboor, executive director of the Central Florida Sports Commission, said local and private financing would make up for the loss when the bid was submitted.
 ''We have a great amount of heritage and tradition and history associated with Nascar,'' he said. ''Nascar is an extraordinary brand, and it's our full intention to deliver an extraordinary proposal on May 31.''
 Charlotte is the only bidder to openly disclose its plans for financing. But officials involved in bids for Atlanta, Richmond, Daytona Beach and Kansas City have made public pitches.
 After Nascar asked Kansas City officials to make a proposal, the governor of Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius, led a state contingent that traveled to Nascar's headquarters in Daytona Beach in February. Virginia's governor, Mark R. Warner, and North Carolina's, Mike Easley, support their state's bids. 
 Meanwhile, Atlanta officials are feeling confident about their chances. And with good reason. Atlanta is the largest market among the bidders and is home to many of Nascar's corporate sponsors, including United Parcel Service and Home Depot. 
 ''There's no other city that can compare with the compelling numbers that Atlanta and the whole state of Georgia can deliver to Nascar,'' said A.J. Robinson, president of Central Atlanta Progress, the group heading the Atlanta bid. He pointed to Atlanta's population, diversity and tourism as reasons to select the city.
 And Robinson may be right. Richard Petty, the legendary driver, who has his own museum in Randleman, N.C., said he believed Nascar should put its hall in North Carolina. But he does not expect history to matter when the choice is made.
 ''Nascar will make this decision strictly on the greenery, O.K.?'' he said last week. ''They've got no loyalty to one place or another place. They've got loyalty to money. And I don't blame them. I'd do the same thing.''

HEADLINE: Why Marathon Runners Aren't Betting on the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE stubbornly resilient dollar has cost Warren E. Buffett a lot of money this year and has disappointed many other investors who thought that a weaker dollar would be their friend.
 Mr. Buffett's bet against the dollar resulted in a $307 million currency loss for his company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the first quarter. 
 It also hurt many Americans who invested in stocks and bonds abroad. In France, the CAC 40 stock index is up 5.2 percent this year, but that becomes a 2.1 percent loss once it is translated into dollars. In Japan, the 3.8 percent decline in the Nikkei 225 index balloons to a loss of 8.2 percent, in dollar terms. 
 What's an investor to do? There is no easy answer, unless you, like Mr. Buffett, are in there for the long term. Using foreign-exchange contracts, he had a $21.8 billion bet against the dollar at the end of the first quarter. He has also profited from foreign-exchange gains on foreign bonds. 
 The best advice is to stick with the long-term bet as long as you still believe in it. In fact, if you view the bet as a way to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk, it makes even more sense now, as long as you are not overdoing it. 
 The near-term choices are more difficult. If you were looking for some extra return from the dollar for the year, perhaps you should rethink your position, especially if your foreign stocks and bonds are denominated in euros or yen.
 But if you have been buying stocks or bonds in Latin America or some parts of Asia, the dollar may still be on your side because it has fallen against some currencies in those regions. The decline of 8.8 percent in Brazil's Bovespa stock index this year shrinks to 2 percent in dollar terms, while the gain 3.3 percent in the Philippines composite index climbs to 6.9 percent.
 The expectation that China will soon revalue its currency, the yuan, adds to the complexity. After a revaluation, analysts say, the dollar would be likely to fall much more against the yen and other Asian currencies and less against the euro.
 The main reasons to worry about a near-term bet against the dollar are a slumping economy in Europe, weakness in Japan and persistent buying of American securities by Asian central banks. Those factors have already helped the dollar rise 7.3 percent this year against the euro and 4.5 percent against the yen. (On Friday, the euro was valued at $1.2631 and the dollar was worth 107.28 yen.)
 The 2005 bounce follows a 34 percent plunge in the dollar over the previous three years against the euro. That decline helped Mr. Buffett make a bundle -- $2.7 billion through March, which is why he probably is not worrying about the first-quarter loss.
 Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Bank of America, said the dollar should also be supported in the short term by a flattening of the Treasury yield curve. This bond market jargon means that shorter-term interest rates, which are being pushed higher by the Federal Reserve, are rising faster than longer-term rates, narrowing the gap between the two. 
 ''After a lag, a flatter yield curve is usually supportive of the dollar,'' Mr. Sinche said. 
 If the change in the yield curve occurs when the economy is healthy, the climb in short-term rates makes the dollar more attractive.
 Mr. Sinche's bullish forecast has the dollar rising and the euro falling to $1.25 to $1.20 by year-end. That would mean more losses for Mr. Buffett and those Americans with bets in Europe. 
 As for the longer term, some analysts still expect the dollar to fall, because there are few indications that there is the political will to do anything about the currency's underlying problems: a record current-account deficit, a troublesome budget deficit and American consumers who spend but do not save.
 ''Altogether the circumstances seem to me as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember, and I can remember quite a lot,'' wrote Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, in The Washington Post last month.
 David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, is an ardent dollar bear, but he sees circumstances in which the dollar could rebound for a while.
 He acknowledged that the long-term structural story -- the current-account and budget deficits -- had been offset so far this year by what he called a short-term cyclical story, in which the American economy is outperforming Europe and Japan by enough for foreign investors to take notice.
 The dollar rose to a seven-month high against the euro last week after reports that the United States trade deficit unexpectedly shrank 9.2 percent in March, to $55 billion, the biggest month-to-month percentage decline since December 2001, and retail sales for April jumped 1.4 percent. ''There is not another attractive place to put your money,'' Mr. Gilmore said.
 But when the dollar tumbles again, he said, it will drop to close to 90 yen, and the euro will climb to a value of $1.40 to $1.50. ''Most reasonable economists know there will be an adjustment,'' he said, ''but when it happens is hard to predict.'' 
 Steven Englander, chief foreign-exchange strategist for the Americas at Barclays Capital, predicts that in six months, the euro will be around $1.25. At that point, the dollar would be up 8.4 percent for the year. But in 12 months, the euro will be back to $1.27, he said. And, assuming that China raises the value of its currency by about 5 percent against the dollar, the American currency will be down to 98 yen, a decline of 8.7 percent from Friday.
 So he does not yet see a reason for longer-term investors to shift their bets. ''There is nothing here,'' he said, ''that says that the clear downward trend of the dollar has been broken.''

HEADLINE: Senators Say Bush Lags On Creating Terror Panel

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
The White House has been slow to establish an oversight board charged with ensuring that the government's campaign against terrorism does not erode privacy and civil rights, a bipartisan group of senators said in a letter released Friday.
 Five months after the board was created, President Bush has yet to name any members or an executive director, and the $750,000 budget for the board proposed by the White House is far less than the budgets of other federal panels, the senators said.
 ''We urge the White House to take the steps necessary to allow the board to begin functioning effectively as soon as possible,'' the senators said in a letter to Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff. 
 The letter was signed by Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who leads the Committee on Homeland Security, and by three Democrats: Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. 
 The White House said in response to the senators' concerns that Mr. Bush remained committed to giving the board the staffing and resources it would need to monitor and protect civil liberties in the fight against terrorism.
 Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, declined to say when board members might be named. 
 ''We're working to finalize a list of people,'' Mr. Duffy said, ''and the hope is to move quickly on this.'' He rejected charges that the effort had gone too slowly, saying the president was ''moving at the appropriate pace, and he wants to make sure the right people are on board.''
 The Sept. 11 commission, in its final report last summer, noted the absence of any centralized federal office to protect civil liberties in the campaign against terrorism, and it urged the creation of such an office. Congress moved on the idea last December as part of a broader restructuring of federal intelligence operations, creating the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. 
 The move reflected a compromise that allowed the White House to retain control of the panel and its membership. Some House Democrats, calling the plan watered-down and ineffective, have proposed a more independent body with greater subpoena power, but that idea appears to have stalled in Congress.
 In their letter to the White House, the four senators asked for a timetable and details on how the panel would be staffed and set up. The letter noted that the White House's proposed budget for the board fell well below the $13 million devoted to a civil rights office within the Department of Homeland Security, the $39 million for the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the $4 million for the Council of Economic Advisers.
 Timothy H. Edgar, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the White House's lack of action reflected a resistance to aggressive monitoring of civil liberties in the face of public concern about the government's use of data mining, toughened immigration controls, expanded surveillance powers and a host of other counterterrorism measures. 
 ''With the centralization of power in the intelligence community,'' Mr. Edgar said in an interview, ''you need to have some agency in government that's seriously looking at protecting civil liberties. Instead, you have a real lack of commitment from the White House, and they're not really doing much of anything.''

HEADLINE: For This President, Power Is There for the Taking

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENTIAL power has always been as much a function of circumstance, personality and political skill as of constitutional prerogative. In a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1952, Justice Robert H. Jackson, assessing how power migrates between the branches of government, invoked Napoleon's maxim, ''The tools belong to the man who can use them.''
 George W. Bush has not been shy about seizing those tools, whether in their constitutional, policy-making or political forms. Just last week, he won a big victory when a federal appeals court unanimously affirmed a president's right to conduct much of his business behind closed doors. In the coming week, the White House will tacitly support efforts by Senate Republicans to stop Democrats from using the threat of filibusters to block Mr. Bush's judicial nominees, a change that would strip from the Senate one of its points of leverage over the executive branch. 
 The president has clearly been trying to harness and expand the clout available to him and to present his office as even more the seat of power than it was under many of his predecessors. By many standards he has succeeded, in part through the good fortune of having a Republican Congress to work with, in part because of his role as commander in chief at a time of threats to the nation and in part because of his aggressive style of advancing his agenda and political interests.
 The question that has yet to be answered is whether he has fundamentally altered the presidency in ways that will outlast his tenure and wipe out the remaining legacies of Vietnam and Watergate, which were taken as object lessons in the dangers of a too powerful, too secret executive.
 ''He has gained power both informally and permanently for the next person in the office, and he has done it more than any president since L.B.J.,'' said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington.
 Mr. Bush has claimed for himself power to set policy on the detention and interrogation of people caught up in the battle against terrorism. He has used executive power to make changes to environmental policy through rule making and regulatory changes on issues from clean air and water to road building on federal lands that had previously been off limits. He has fought to protect the ability of the administration to block Congress from calling White House aides to testify, and has moved to limit release of historical presidential papers.
 In purely political terms, Mr. Bush has established a new standard for claiming a mandate from even the narrowest of electoral victories, asserting that his slim victory in 2000, never mind his much clearer win last year, was license to pursue an ambitious rethinking of economic and social policy along conservative lines. According to figures compiled by Congressional Quarterly and cited by Mr. Thurber, Mr. Bush in his first term had the best record of getting his initiatives through Congress of any president since Johnson. 
 Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter were most obviously restrained by the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam climate. Ronald Reagan reclaimed much of the grandeur and authority of the office, but then was set back by scandal and confrontations with Congress. Mr. Bush's father never exerted the same clout in domestic policy and politics as he did in foreign affairs, and Bill Clinton was hobbled by a Republican Congress and the effects of his dalliance with an intern.
 But if Mr. Bush has pushed the pendulum further away than any of them from where it was 30 years ago, he has yet to fix it firmly there. 
 For one thing, much of what Mr. Bush has done is a product of a particular time and place.
 Harvey C. Mansfield, a government professor at Harvard University, said circumstances have enabled Mr. Bush to expand the authority of the office --a Republican Congress paired with a Republican president, and a sense of danger from abroad that prompted Mr. Bush to adopt a doctrine of confronting threats before they fully emerge. But that does not necessarily mean that the person who walks into the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2009, will have the same toolbox at his disposal.
 ''The office is there, ready to be molded by the occupant,'' said Mr. Mansfield, who has written widely about executive power. ''I don't think the structure is ever anything permanent. What is gained by one president can be lost, voluntarily or not, by the next.''
 On some fronts, Mr. Bush's assertiveness has been challenged. The Supreme Court has already reined in Mr. Bush's policy on detaining people associated with the threat of terrorism, ruling that courts can review the status of hundreds of foreigners held at Guantanamo Bay and that the United States could not hold one of its own citizens in a military brig indefinitely without trial.
 Mr. Bush's general take-no-prisoners approach to governing has regularly bumped up against its limits. The angst within his own party in the Senate last week over the nomination of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations showed how difficult it is to dominate Congress. A defeat for Mr. Bush on his effort to overhaul Social Security would leave him distinctly in danger of becoming a lame duck early in his second term.
 What sets Mr. Bush apart is his willingness to take on battles, even when they exact a political price --a trait that many of his predecessors, by dint of their own political circumstances and personalities, have not always shared.
 SUMMONED to the Oval Office in 1995, Abner J. Mikva, then the White House counsel, found President Clinton upset that Republicans on Capitol Hill were hounding him to release more documents related to a dispute with Congress over economic aid to Mexico. Told by Mr. Mikva that the White House had withheld only three pages that summarized a private conversation the president had held with his Mexican counterpart, Mr. Clinton at first ordered even those pages released, only to be talked out of it by Mr. Mikva and his staff.
 Mr. Bush's instinct, Mr. Mikva said, is the opposite: to fight all encroachments.
 ''The separation of powers works because of who makes the biggest muscle,'' Mr. Mikva said. ''When the president makes a big muscle, as George Bush is currently doing, he has a lot of power. He's willing to take on the courts and Congress and exercise power in a big way.''

HEADLINE: Beware the Easy Fix For Social Security

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH has yet to offer a specific plan for overhauling Social Security, but the war over numbers has already become surreal.
 To hear White House officials tell it, the ideas he has outlined would save trillions of dollars and leave everyone a winner. The scene they describe is something like Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average: everyone who retires in 2050 would end up with more money than today's system could afford to pay. To hear Democratic critics tell it, Mr. Bush would eventually cut benefits for most people by thousands of dollars a year -- even though he would allow today's benefits to rise at least as fast as inflation. 
 Most analysts on both sides say Mr. Bush's approach would solve less of the problem than he claims. Indeed, as House Republicans began hearings last week to debate alternatives, neither Mr. Bush nor his critics fully addressed how they would pay for benefits that, according to the Social Security trustees, will probably not be affordable under the current system.
 Mr. Bush has embraced ''progressive price indexing'' -- a concept that would slow the growth of benefits for middle- and upper-income people. Developed by Robert C. Pozen, the chairman of MFS Investment Management in Boston, the idea would be to increase benefits for middle- and upper-income retirees in line with consumer prices rather than wages. Because wages have increased about one percentage point faster than prices each year, Social Security benefits would gradually replace a smaller and smaller share of wages for all but the lowest 30 percent of income earners. 
 While Mr. Bush has alluded only vaguely to the idea, White House officials have promoted it in considerable detail. According to one White House chart, people at every income level appear to end up winners. 
 Middle-income workers, for example, those with average annual earnings of $36,000 today, would receive about $1,380 a month in today's dollars -- about $172 more than today's system could afford to pay -- if they retired in 2050.
 Even high-income workers, whose benefits would be trimmed the most, would end up with $1,626 a month, about $100 more than today's system could afford. ''All earnings groups in 2050 would receive higher benefits than the current program can afford to pay,'' the White House declared in a briefing paper.
 But as Mr. Bush's critics quickly pointed out, the happy outlook omitted two major points. The first is that, under Mr. Bush's cuts, Social Security would still not be able to afford all the benefits being promised. The second is that the comparisons look favorable only for people who retire within a few years of 2050.
 Using projections by the Social Security trustees, White House officials based their comparison on the assumption that, if nothing changed, the Social Security trust fund would be out of reserves in 2041. At that point, Social Security would be allowed to pay out only as much as it took in through payroll taxes and would have to cut total benefits by about 27 percent.
 The problem is that Mr. Bush's plan would not keep Social Security from running out of money. An apples-to-apples comparison would have to take into account that the government would eventually need to cut benefits or raise taxes even if the government did adopt progressive price indexing. 
 White House officials contend that the changes Mr. Bush has outlined would close about 70 percent of the long-term deficit, but most analysts say the changes would eliminate less than 60 percent.
 Jason Furman, an economist at New York University and at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, estimated that the plan would close only about 59 percent of the shortfall expected over the next 75 years. The projected insolvency would be delayed by only six years, to 2047.
 At that point, he estimated, the government would have to reduce benefits by an additional 15 percent.
 Kent Smetters, a former Treasury official under President Bush and now an associate professor at the Wharton School of Business, came up with similar estimates about the impact of progressive price indexing.
 Mr. Smetters noted that Mr. Pozen's original plan would have gradually trimmed disability benefits and would have closed about 70 percent of the shortfall. But Mr. Bush has vowed to preserve disability benefits at current levels, and to ensure that even low-income retirees are kept above the poverty line.
 ''I would say it solves about 60 percent, or a little less'' of the projected deficit, Mr. Smetters said in an interview.
 White House officials do not dispute those estimates, but they have redefined the problem. Instead of saying they would solve 70 percent of the 75-year deficit, the measure most analysts use, administration officials say the plan would reduce about 70 percent of the deficit in the 75th year of their plan. The difference is worth about $500 billion over 75 years.
 ''The real question is how close you are to getting the system back to positive cash flow by the final year,'' said Andrew G. Biggs, deputy director of Mr. Bush's National Economic Council. ''How much of the final-year deficit does it eliminate? By that measure the plan closes about 70 percent of the deficit.'' 
 The White House also shined up its estimates by comparing benefits for a single year, 2050. If the trust fund became insolvent as projected, benefits for a middle-income worker in 2050 would be only $1,208 a month. Benefits under Mr. Bush's plan would be $1,380, or $1,532 if the person had a personal account that earned higher returns.
 But the comparison is misleading. Mr. Bush's cuts would begin in 2012, whereas people would be claiming full benefits through 2040 if there were no changes in Social Security. 
 DEMOCRATIC lawmakers are rolling out their own calculations. On Thursday, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York posted a calculator on his Web site, www.schumer.senate.gov, that allows people to estimate their own benefits under the Bush plan.
 Under that measure, a person who earns about $50,000 today and retires in 2040 would receive benefits in that year that are 25 percent, or $6,596, lower than promised under today's formula.
 But the Schumer calculations do not account for the projected insolvency of the trust fund in 2041. Because Social Security's trustees project a 27 percent shortfall if nothing is done to stabilize the system, that same person's benefits would drop by $7,250 in the second year of his retirement. 
 C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who worked in the Treasury Department in the Reagan administration, summed up what neither side wanted to say.
 ''One way or another, somebody's going to have to pay,'' Mr. Steuerle told the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday. ''I'm guessing it will be the middle class and the upper class.''

HEADLINE: Studies Find Disparity in U.S. Cancer Care

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., May 15 

 BODY:
New studies show that Americans generally receive high-quality cancer care but that closer monitoring is needed to explain significant geographic variations in practices.
 Also, cancer specialists say they need improved training in communication so they can better advise terminally ill patients about how long they have to live and help them choose the care they wish to receive.
 The findings were presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology here on Sunday. This group of cancer specialists commissioned a study of the quality of cancer care in the United States after a report in 1999 from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences said the number of Americans who did not receive care known to be effective for their cancer was believed to be substantial, though the precise number was not known. 
 The institute's report surprised the cancer group, which then hired the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif., and researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health to begin to get a more complete picture of cancer care, said Dr. Kathleen M. Foley, who practices at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan and who moderated a news conference where the studies were discussed.
 The Rand-Harvard researchers used more than 100 measures of quality in studying the care for cancers of the breast, colon and rectum in five cities: Atlanta, Cleveland, Houston, Kansas City and Los Angeles. The researchers interviewed 2,366 patients and reviewed the medical records of these and other patients.
 Overall adherence to the quality measures was 86 percent among breast cancer patients and 78 percent among those with colorectal cancer.
 The rate was higher for some specific quality measures. More than 95 percent of breast cancer patients had at least the standard recommended number of lymph nodes removed and examined, and 92 percent of breast cancer patients who should have received the drug tamoxifen did.
 The rates were ''higher than previously published,'' said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, who served as liaison between the cancer group and the Rand-Harvard team, which conducted the study independently.
 Still, there were wide variations in the chemotherapy prescribed for breast cancer patients. Adherence to recommendations for the number of cycles of drug treatment and the amount of drug given in each cycle ranged from 29 percent to 74 percent.
 ''That's quite distressing,'' said Dr. Emanuel, who is chairman of the department of clinical bioethics at the National Institutes of Health.
 The cancer group is now working to develop a standard summary sheet of care recommendations that oncologists can use and insert as part of each patient's medical record, as well as systems to monitor adherence to recommended guidelines.
 In the United States, about half a million people die of cancer each year. ''Doctors have been described as poor at giving accurate prognostic information for their dying patients,'' who often overestimate their survival, said Dr. Christopher K. Daugherty of the University of Chicago. Dr. Daugherty added that there was little information about how doctors talk with such patients.
 In a survey, 559 members of the cancer group were asked about how candid they were in communicating prognosis with cancer patients who were expected to die in 6 to 12 months. Eighty percent said they had either inadequate teaching or none on how to convey such critical information.
 Ninety-eight percent of the oncologists surveyed said they told their terminally ill cancer patients that their cancer would eventually kill them. Only 5 percent of the cancer specialists always gave patients estimates of the time they had left to live, but 75 percent of the same doctors said they would want an estimate if they had terminal cancer.
 ''Patients are often left to ask, 'How much time do I have, doc?''' Dr. Daugherty said.
 Another study found that surgeons in the United States removed too few lymph nodes from 75 percent of patients with stomach cancer, jeopardizing their treatment and prognosis.
 That study, led by Dr. Natalie G. Coburn of Princess Margaret Hospital and the University of Toronto, involved more than 10,000 cases of stomach cancer in the United States, using a database kept by the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. 
 The incidence of stomach cancer has been declining worldwide in recent years. Still, it remains the 15th most common cancer in the United States, with 21,860 new cases expected this year, the American Cancer Society says.
 Surgery for stomach cancer involves removal of the cancer and surrounding lymph nodes. A pathologist then examines these tissues to determine how far the cancer has spread, which helps determine the treatment.
 In the study, survival strongly correlated with the number of lymph nodes removed, Dr. Coburn said. Standard guidelines call for removal and examination of at least 15 lymph nodes for stomach cancer.
 Adherence to the guidelines varied geographically. More than twice as many patients in Hawaii (33.4 percent) survived five years after detection of stomach cancer than in Utah (16.2 percent). In Hawaii, the median number of lymph nodes removed was 15, compared with 6 in Utah. But even in Hawaii, 47.5 percent of patients did not have enough lymph nodes removed, Dr. Coburn said.
 Stomach cancer seems to be more common among Japanese and other Asians, so that could be one explanation for the more favorable rates in Hawaii, said Dr. Robert J. Mayer, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
 Another possible explanation, Dr. Mayer said in an interview, is that many stomach cancer patients are operated on in hospitals that care for only a few patients with the disease each year and so may not have systems to monitor their care according to standard guidelines.

HEADLINE: Groton, Navy Town, Is Stunned at Plans to Close Sub Base

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., May 15 

 BODY:
This is not where John Markowicz expected to be this Sunday afternoon: behind his office desk, poring over stacks of Pentagon documents and trying to make sense of the government's recommendation that the Navy's historic submarine base here on the east bank of the Thames River be closed for good.
 For the past two years, Mr. Markowicz, a Navy veteran himself and a former chief engineer of a fast attack nuclear submarine, has led a coalition of government and civic groups from the Groton area in an unsuccessful campaign to keep the base off the Pentagon's newest list of recommended base closings, which was announced on Friday.
 The closing of the base -- it is officially called the United States Naval Submarine Base New London -- would mean the loss of about 8,460 military jobs and possibly thousands more in the surrounding community, according to the Pentagon's calculations. It represented the single biggest loss of military jobs at any base on the list; under the proposal, Connecticut as a whole would lose 8,586 military jobs, the largest tally of any state. 
 The Pentagon said that by shutting the base and shifting its fleet of 18 fast attack subs elsewhere, including bases in Norfolk, Va., and Kings Bay, Ga., it would eventually save $1.6 billion over 20 years.
 ''I never guessed it would be closure,'' Mr. Markowicz, chairman of the Subase Realignment Coalition, said in an interview. ''I'm in my office on a Sunday. That says it all, doesn't it?''
 The announcement stunned this Navy town, which has been home to the submarine base for nearly a century and calls itself the Submarine Capital of the World. Residents have been grappling with the news with a mixture of emotions ranging from engaged anger to blithe denial.
 ''People are still in disbelief,'' said Richard Brown, 53, a resident of Groton since 1980 and an employee at a local firm that makes parts for aircraft engines. ''They don't believe they're going to do it, probably because they don't want to think about what's going to happen.''
 The Pentagon's list of recommendations is not final. It is under review by the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or BRAC, which can add or subtract bases from the list during the next several months before submitting it to President Bush and Congress for approval.
 Everyone here agrees that to close the base would most likely mean the collapse of the local economy and the rending of the community's social fabric.
 Base employees and their families keep afloat the businesses along neighboring Route 12: the convenience stores, chain supermarkets, restaurants, gas stations and tattoo parlors. Navy families fill entire housing subdivisions here. They hang out in the downtown commercial district of New London across the river and at the mall in Waterford. Three of Groton's nine elementary schools are almost entirely populated with Navy children.
 Two mammoth casinos, Mohegan Sun in Uncasville and Foxwoods in Mashantucket, help prop up the regional economy, but residents say they will not be able to replace the social and economic value of the submarine base.
 ''We don't know what's going to happen,'' said Ron, 55, a retired Navy electronics technician who, as a civilian contractor, now repairs computer simulators on the base. Standing outside the Navy Exchange Dolphin Mart Convenience Store off Route 12, he gave only his first name for fear that speaking publicly might annoy his bosses; several other base employees, military and civilian, said they were under orders not to speak to the news media without permission from their superiors.
 Ron said he worried the most about older civilians who depend on the base for their livelihood and would find it particularly difficult to move. ''It's hard to start over again,'' he said. ''But I'm afraid what the economy will be like around here. It'll be hard to find jobs.''
 The same kind of fear and anxiety is rippling through military communities across the country. The Pentagon recommended closing nearly 180 military installations and offices, including 33 big bases like Groton's.
 But residents here feel that few other military communities on the Pentagon's list have the long history of the submarine base or a similar claim to a tradition of military importance.
 The property began as a naval base in 1872 and became a submarine base in 1916. After World War I, the base became a submarine training and warfare research center. Electric Boat, a private company nearby, began building submarines in 1934, helping to establish Groton as a world submarine center and further entwining the base with the community. The world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the Nautilus, was built at the shipyard and was christened in 1954 by Mamie Eisenhower.
 By the early 1990's, about 40,000 people were employed in the defense industry in Groton, according to Mr. Markowicz: half of them were employed by the base and the rest worked for Electric Boat. But since the end of the cold war, the work force in the Groton defense industry has been cut in half. (Electric Boat has said it does not plan to leave even if the naval base closes.)
 In the 1991 round of base closings, the Pentagon successfully recommended the closing of half the Naval Underseas Warfare Laboratory here. In 1993, half the submarine base was listed for closing, but it was spared in the face of a lobby led by the region's government and civic leaders. In 1995, the remaining half of the warfare laboratory was cut.
 According to Mr. Markowicz, this could be the hardest fight of all. He and other advocates must now convincingly argue that the Pentagon's financial calculations were faulty and the military value of the base was underestimated.
 His group has saved about $150,000 in state money to press its case, and he says that Gov. M. Jodi Rell has promised more. ''She said she'd do whatever it takes,'' he said.
 Mr. Markowicz, who also is also executive director of an regional economic development agency, was asked how he felt entering what looked to be a grueling four-month endgame. He drew from his experience as a submariner.
 ''I'm looking at what I consider equivalent to a four-month deployment to the Western Pacific on a fast attack nuclear submarine,'' he said evenly. ''I've been there before. You're pretty much going to work around the clock with some of your closest friends. You hope to return from the mission very successful.''

HEADLINE: Iran Parliament Calls for Resuming Nuclear Fuel Development

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: TEHRAN, May 15 

 BODY:
Iran's Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution on Sunday insisting that the government resume developing nuclear fuel, defying the American and European demand for a halt in all nuclear activity because they contend that Iran seeks to build a nuclear bomb. 
 The resolution, seeking production of enough nuclear fuel to produce a substantial amount of electricity, comes from a Parliament dominated by hard-liners. It ratchets up the pressure on the government not to compromise in talks scheduled for next week between Iran and the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany to try to break the deadlock on the issue. 
 Hassan Rowhani, the senior nuclear negotiator, announced that Iran would not immediately carry out its threat to resume some aspects of processing uranium. But he warned in an interview on state television that negotiations could not drag on without Iran resuming some fuel activity, although he did not specify what that might entail. 
 ''We cannot continue the negotiations with the Europeans without having resumed some of our activities,'' said Mr. Rowhani, a senior cleric on the National Security Council. He added that Iran's declaration that it would resume converting uranium ore to the gas used in the first stage of enrichment ''remained valid.''
 The European states negotiating with Iran warned last week that if it resumed any stage in the cycle of fuel enrichment, including any introductory stages, they would halt talks and refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council for possible international penalties. The Europeans persuaded Iran to suspend uranium enrichment last November, before negotiations, but the Iranians did not fully comply until February. At low levels, uranium enrichment provides the fuel for electricity, but at higher levels, it can be used for nuclear bombs.
 Asked Sunday on CNN when penalties might be sought from the Security Council, Stephen J. Hadley, the United States national security adviser, said it depended on the negotiations. ''And if in fact the Iranians do not abide by the temporary suspension, which has been negotiated, then it's pretty clear,'' Mr. Hadley said. 
 Mr. Rowhani said Iran was waiting to restart the enrichment process because of appeals not to abandon the negotiations from the European Union, Russia, Japan and Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general. 
 ''We are in favor of negotiations; we can negotiate for months, but we cannot negotiate under the present conditions,'' he said. ''The fact that the resumption of our activities will be delayed by several days is not a problem.''
 Hamid-Reza Asefi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at his weekly briefing on Sunday that the suspension of all fuel activity could last an additional 10 days. ''The coming days will be the last chance for the Europeans,'' he said. ''With or without an agreement, we will restart our activities.''
 Given Iran's history of hiding significant parts of its enrichment activity, the European Union has demanded that it prove its peaceful aims by permanently suspending all domestic production and importing whatever fuel is needed to produce electricity. The union is offering a package of economic incentives in return. 
 The idea of developing nuclear fuel from the uranium ore deposits in Iran's central desert has become an issue of national pride for Iranians. They insist they only want to master the complete cycle of creating nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes, their right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 Iranian officials say that since their nation has been treated as an international pariah, it must be able to produce its own fuel, because any boycott might cripple its planned nuclear reactors, even as Iran's population increases and electricity demand surges. 
 ''We need security of supply,'' said Ali Salehi, a professor at Sharif University of Technology and one of Iran's leading nuclear specialists. ''We would like to get energy from all possible sources.''
 No government branch or candidate in the June 17 elections wants to appear soft on the nuclear issue. 
 ''Do we have to beg the world to provide us with fuel?'' thundered Kazem Jalali, a member of Parliament who spoke in favor of the nuclear fuel resolution. ''We have not been able to master nuclear technology in the past several years, and this shows the international community has prevented us from having it.''
 The 20-minute debate was broadcast live on the radio, and 188 of the 205 members voted for the resolution. It specified that Iran should develop enough nuclear fuel to generate 20,000 megawatts of electricity. That goes far beyond the government plan to develop 7,000 megawatts in the next 15 years. 
 The hard-line newspaper Jomhuri Islami weighed in Sunday with a front-page editorial suggesting that any presidential candidate who opposed the development of nuclear technology was not fit to serve. 
 Even the reformist bloc, generally the most publicly open to seeking to improve Iran's international ties, comes down heavily on the side of developing nuclear power. 
 ''There is no reason not to create nuclear energy and to use it in a peaceful way,'' Dr. Mostafa Moin, the anointed reformist candidate and a close political ally of President Mohammad Khatami, said in an interview. He noted that Iran's population has doubled, to more than 70 million, since the nation started talking about developing nuclear energy with American support before the 1979 revolution. ''Why can't we exploit this energy at a time when the population has doubled and we have the scientific ability to develop it?''

HEADLINE: A Rematch in Los Angeles, With a Difference

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 15 

 BODY:
Los Angeles voters will once again choose between James K. Hahn and Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor on Tuesday, a rematch of the 2001 contest, which Mr. Hahn won with a late surge.
 But conditions this time are starkly different, with the staid Mayor Hahn in the role of underdog and Mr. Villaraigosa, a charismatic member of the City Council, seemingly on his way to victory. 
 The two men spent Sunday morning trying to build support among two important voting groups, visiting a half-dozen African-American churches each and then showing up a couple of hours apart at an Israeli Independence Day celebration in the San Fernando Valley.
 Mr. Hahn, underfinanced and, if polls are to be believed, unloved, is fighting to avoid losing his first citywide race in 24 years in politics and being the first mayor turned out of office in a third of a century. He is also seeking to avoid the fate of Gray Davis, the California governor who was ousted in a recall election in October 2003.
 Mr. Villaraigosa, who says he is running as the candidate of all Angelenos, not just of the nearly 50 percent who are of Hispanic heritage, would be the first Latino mayor since the late 19th century, when Los Angeles was little more than a dusty village.
 According to the latest Los Angeles Times poll, published a week ago, Mr. Villaraigosa is leading Mr. Hahn by 11 percentage points. Respondents also gave Mr. Villaraigosa higher marks on likability and leadership.
 Mr. Hahn's job approval rating is 38 percent, not much better than Mr. Davis's rating before he was voted out of the governor's office.
 Mr. Villaraigosa has raised and spent nearly three times as much money as Mr. Hahn, although the mayor has benefited from substantial independent spending on publicity by the city's labor unions.
 Mr. Hahn and Mr. Villaraigosa, both Democrats, were the top two finishers in the March primary, as they were four years ago. But Mr. Villaraigosa's leading margin this time -- 9 percentage points -- was much wider than in 2001, and there is little evidence that Mr. Hahn has been able to close the gap.
 Mr. Villaraigosa has received endorsements from most of the major political and business figures in the city, while Mr. Hahn has the support of the city's largest labor organization, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 But the labor federation's respected chief, Miguel Contreras, died a week ago, taking some of the steam out of the union's efforts to support the mayor. Charles Lester, who was appointed interim leader of the union, said that members would walk precincts and staff phone banks through Election Day, as planned before Mr. Contreras's death.
 Several outside analysts, though, said that union members -- many of whom support Mr. Villaraigosa -- would put in less than a full commitment.
 Raphael J. Sonenshein, a political scientist at California State University, Fullerton, said Mr. Contreras, like many rank-and-file union members, had mixed feelings about the mayoral race. Mr. Hahn has rewarded union supporters and backed union causes while in office, he said, but Mr. Villaraigosa, a former union organizer and a reliable ally in state and city government, is beloved by many workers.
 ''We have two pro-labor candidates,'' Dr. Sonenshein said. ''They can't lose. Contreras symbolized both pieces of the labor puzzle. His head was with Hahn, but his heart was with Villaraigosa.''
 Mr. Hahn has tried to focus the mayoral race on crime, with repeated charges that Mr. Villaraigosa, a former leader of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, is soft on gangs and drug crimes. He is broadcasting an advertisement that asserts that Mr. Villaraigosa was the lone member of the State Assembly several years ago who voted against a bill to toughen penalties for murderers of children. 
 Mr. Villaraigosa says that he voted for a tougher measure a week later.
 Mr. Hahn is also hoping to ride to re-election on the coattails of the popular Los Angeles police chief, William J. Bratton, the former New York police commissioner, whose appointment in 2002 Mr. Hahn engineered. The mayor appears frequently around town with the chief, and Mr. Hahn seldom fails to mention him in his stump speeches. He cites a significant drop in homicides and other violent crimes in his tenure as mayor.
 Chief Bratton says his position requires him to remain neutral in the mayoral race. But he is unreserved in his praise for the mayor. 
 ''He is the fellow who brought me to the dance,'' Chief Bratton said in an interview last week. ''He has fulfilled his promises to me and consistently supported the idea of public safety being the city's No. 1 priority. I can't ask any more from a mayor.''
 Chief Bratton said it would be incongruous, even tragic, if Mr. Hahn lost his job in a time of falling crime, improving relations between residents and the police, and a growing economy. He said Mr. Hahn deserved credit for helping to defeat efforts by residents of Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley to secede from the city.
 ''If he does lose, history will ultimately be kind to him because he delivered on his promise to make the city safer, and he held the city together,'' Chief Bratton said. ''I just can't get over that he expended phenomenal political capital to keep the city together, and that could be one of the issues that may cost him the office. Only in L.A.''
 The chief offered praise for Mr. Villaraigosa as well. ''I'm probably closer to Antonio than to Hahn,'' he said. ''My wife and I socialize with him, and he's been very supportive of the department in his time on the Council.''
 Mr. Villaraigosa has said that if he wins, he intends to keep Chief Bratton in office for the remaining two and a half years of his five-year contract.

HEADLINE: Don't Believe the Hype. A Hip-Hop Mogul Says It's Propaganda.

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

 BODY:
Russell Simmons has long reigned as one of the entertainment industry's most capable promoters. At 47, as the co-founder of the Def Jam Recordings label, Mr. Simmons still tirelessly hawks a portfolio of ventures, from financial services to an energy soda. 
 His best-known recent success has been Phat Farm, the hip-hop-flavored clothing line he founded in 1992. Early last year, the Kellwood Company, an apparel maker based in Chesterfield, Mo., purchased the firm for $140 million, retaining Mr. Simmons as chief executive of the division. 
 But in a civil deposition last July, he provided some unusual insights into fashion marketing. Under questioning from a plaintiff's lawyer as part of a lawsuit involving a longtime business partner, Mr. Simmons told of what he described as ''the amount of hype that goes on when I discuss the value of Phat Farm,'' according to the transcript. 
 ''It is how you develop an image for companies. So in other words, you give out false statements to mislead the public so they will then increase in their mind the value of your company,'' Mr. Simmons said. 
 The strategy seemed to work. In February 2003, for instance, Mr. Simmons appeared on CNBC saying that Phat Fashions was ''doing $350 million'' in sales. In fact, Phat Fashions' revenue for 2002 totaled $14.3 million, according to court papers and the company. 
 His testimony might be regarded as remarkably candid or remarkably troubling for any executive. The fashion business has never been known for its sincerity, though there is no suggestion that Mr. Simmons or Phat Fashions, which was a private company and is the parent of the Phat Farm brand, ever misled investors or business partners.
 But Mr. Simmons's testimony is particularly striking in light of the public position he occupies. While he earns his paycheck as a media and entertainment kingpin, he has carved out a role for himself as a potent political activist and credible social commentator. 
 In a statement, Rush Communications, the corporate parent for his various enterprises, said his testimony ''reflects his exasperation and frustration at being dragged into a lawsuit he was not a party to.'' It said the deposition veered away from the topics it was supposed to cover, and that he was preoccupied with a family matter that day which ''caused Russell to make some offhand and self-deprecating comments about his promotional activities.'' 
 ''The offhand comments that Russell made, yes, if he had to do it over again, he wouldn't have chosen those words,'' the statement said.
 Rush added that Mr. Simmons's role as an entrepreneur marketing his brands ''is not the same activity as social activism.''
 Mr. Simmons was deposed in proceedings arising from a civil case in which Def Jam and Lyor Cohen, then its chairman, were held liable for reneging on a deal to let another label release a CD featuring a Def Jam artist. Def Jam, which is owned by Vivendi Universal, and Mr. Cohen, a longtime friend and business partner of Mr. Simmons, are appealing the verdict, which was delivered two years ago. 
 In the meantime, however, the rival label, TVT Records, has been inquiring into whether Mr. Cohen understated the value of his 16 percent stake in Phat Fashions in a statement of his net worth that was submitted to the court several months before the sale to Kellwood. Lawyers for Mr. Cohen have said he was not aware of the contemplated sale price at the time, and Mr. Simmons affirmed that view in the deposition, which had been sealed until recently. Mr. Cohen is now chief of the domestic music unit of Warner Music Group. Mr. Simmons, who sold Def Jam to Universal Music Group in 1999, recently started a new label in partnership with that company.
 In his testimony, Mr. Simmons makes clear that he views himself as the chief marketer of his fashion line. He said the figures in a 2003 Newsweek article reporting Phat Farm's sales at $340 million ''accurately reflected my optimism or my brand position statement, a good brand positioning statement.'' 
 ''In other words, did I say it? I was hoping it would sound good.'' He adds, ''maybe by that year the gross numbers were there. I don't know.'' 
 (Rush said the figures apparently referred to 2002 sales of the brand at the retail level, not revenue received by the company. Mr. Simmons's comments to CNBC appear to reference the same thing.)
 Throughout his testimony, Mr. Simmons appears unreserved, offering occasionally lengthy answers and cursing. Yet at another point, shortly before he was to be asked about comments he made to The New York Times in 2003, he asked, suddenly: ''It is not going to come out, right, about me lying to everybody? Right?''
 Mr. Simmons's words and various written statements also provide a glimpse into the economics of apparel. More than a decade after Mr. Simmons introduced Phat Farm, so-called urban lines rank among the hottest sectors of the fashion industry. A variety of music-inspired fashion lines have sprouted, including Sean John from Sean Combs, Rocawear from Jay-Z and Damon Dash and the Fetish line from Eve.
 For the most part, these firms, like many in the fashion business, don't make their own clothes. Instead, they make money by charging fees or royalties amounting to a percentage of the revenue generated by manufacturers who license their names. These manufacturers make and sell the goods at wholesale prices to department stores and merchants.
 Many of the brand-name fashion houses in Paris and Milan run the same way. But when chatting about their financial performance, many fashion executives -- and news reports -- prefer to cite wholesale revenue; that is, the revenue received by the manufacturers. In other cases, they quote the revenue received by retailers who sell the goods to consumers, a far bigger number.
 ''Hip-hop is about aspirations, it's about keeping up with the Joneses. There is a competitiveness about who can own the most and be the richest,'' said Emil Wilbekin, a former editor of Vibe magazine who is now vice president of brand development at Marc Ecko, another urban fashion house. ''Now that urban is becoming mainstream, people are going to pay more attention to the details of the finances, the real worth. Before this time, no one took the businesses seriously enough to care.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Simmons has long spoken of the difficulty he faced in marketing the brand to retailers, who initially viewed his fashions as a fad. 
 ''There was lack of vision in fashion just like in music,'' he said in a statement provided by Rush. ''I launched Phat Farm in 1992, and it took a lot of work for me to persuade buyers that there was a market for my brands, which we've made a success.'' 
 The multiple ways of accounting for sales sometimes seems to confuse even Mr. Simmons. In his 2001 autobiography, ''Life and Def,'' for instance, he explains that ''last year the company did $150 million. This year we are projecting, conservatively, $225 million in wholesale revenue.'' He goes on to say that ''when reporting revenue to the press, most companies use the retail number'' which he estimates would amount to roughly double the figures he cited. 
 Asked in his deposition whether he believed the numbers in his book, Mr. Simmons said no. Then, last week, Rush said Mr. Simmons's figures in fact appeared to refer to total retail sales for 1999 and 2000, and that they had been described in the book as wholesale by mistake. 
 In general, Rush said, Mr. Simmons has described the company's fortunes depending on the context. In speaking with the news media, the company said, he often used retail sales ''in order to keep the brand on equal footing with competitors, who typically released what appeared to be retail sales figures to the media.'' 
 ''To use numbers that would not have enabled consumers to compare like with like would have misled the buying public and, at the same time, would have been a foolish and unnecessary self-inflicted wound to the Phat Fashions brand,'' the statement said.

HEADLINE: Uzbekistan Shaken by Unrest, Violence and Uncertainty

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Moscow for this article, and Yola Monakhov from Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 15 

 BODY:
Skirmishing between armed Uzbeks and troops along Uzbekistan's border with Kyrgyzstan persisted Sunday, news agencies reported, as uncertainty grew about the circumstances and extent of bloodshed on Friday when the government suppressed a mass demonstration by force.
 Reports of the number of deaths since the violence began varied widely, from dozens to hundreds of civilians. The Associated Press reported that residents of the village of Tefektosh had said the latest clashes left several soldiers dead. Uzbekistan's president, Islam A. Karimov, said Saturday that 10 government soldiers and ''many more rebels'' had been killed.
 None of the reports could be verified, and it was difficult to determine who was fighting, and with what ambitions, although in addition to elements of a general uprising against a repressive government, armed and newly freed inmates were in the area of strife. Telephone service has been intermittent, and the Uzbek government has forced many journalists to leave. 
 Uzbekistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim republic of 25 million people, has been enveloped in uncertainty since late last week, when armed men stormed a prison in the Ferghana Valley to release a group of demonstrators they regarded as being unjustly tried. 
 The attack on the prison released as many as 2,000 inmates and turned into a mass demonstration in Andijon. The protesters were dispersed, according to accounts by journalists and witnesses, when soldiers and armored vehicles fired on the crowd. 
 Disorder has ensued since, although reports on Sunday indicated that for at least one day the area was calmer. There were also reports, however, suggesting that the government had lost control of parts of the country's northeastern border. 
 Criticism of both sides from abroad was reminiscent of the cold war. Britain's foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told the BBC, ''There has been a clear abuse of human rights, a lack of democracy and a lack of openness.'' Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, compared the uprising to ''a Taliban-style provocation,'' according to RIA Novosti, Russia's state news agency.
 The unrest and violence have tested Mr. Karimov, a former Communist Party official who has ruled Central Asia's most populated republic with an iron grip since the Soviet Union disintegrated. 
 As journalists in the region reported that hundreds and perhaps thousands of Uzbeks moved toward and across the Kyrgyz border, at risk was the stability of the heart of Central Asia, already buffeted by an underdeveloped economy, ecological decline, a resurgence of Islam, a recent revolution in Kyrgyzstan and the conflicting pulls of China, Russia and the United States.
 Mr. Karimov, an inaccessible and aloof autocrat, has long been criticized for persecution of opponents, intolerance of freedom of religion and expression, and the use of the police and torture, including the sexual assault and boiling of suspects.
 His control had been almost absolute. He was last re-elected in 2000, with 91.7 percent of the vote, an election generally regarded as fixed.
 His style has also fueled worries about the government's conduct. The reported violence over the past three days, emerging from a near information vacuum, has been chilling in part because Mr. Karimov has long made clear that in maintaining order, he has a high tolerance for blood. 
 ''I am prepared to rip off the heads of 200 people, to sacrifice their lives, in order to save peace and calm in the republic,'' he told reporters in 1999, after a bus hijacking ended with a shootout that left nine people dead. ''If my child chose such a path, I myself would rip off his head.''
 Mr. Karimov also has strengthened his relationship with the United States, as the interests of two nations have increasingly intertwined.
 Hardened elements of his opposition, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, collaborated with Al Qaeda and trained in camps in Afghanistan. After the attacks in the United States in 2001, the Karimov government presented itself as a Bush administration partner in counterterrorism efforts, and the Pentagon opened a base in southern Uzbekistan. 
 There has also been evidence that the United States has used the country for interrogations of terrorist suspects seized elsewhere.
 Nonetheless, signs of strain in the relationship have emerged since 2003, as uprisings have toppled corrupt post-Soviet governments in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, isolating the Uzbek president. 
 Mr. Karimov, speaking at a news conference on Saturday as journalists reported seeing blood-stained streets and full morgues, made an oblique but unmistakable reference to American interference.
 ''Attempts by some countries to plant democracy in Central Asia can be used by a third force,'' he said, according to RIA Novosti. He added, ''This force is radical Islam.''
 Mr. Karimov routinely labels enemies militant Islamists, and blamed Islamic political and militant groups for the latest violence. Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said Sunday that his position had raised concern he would repress all opponents, including human rights defenders, labeling them Islamic extremists.
 There were contradictory signs on Sunday about the resilience of Mr. Karimov's government. In Tashkent, streets were calm but police were visible, said a photographer working for The New York Times there. 
 In Karasu, a border village where clashes erupted Saturday as hundreds of Uzbeks tried to flee into Kyrgyzstan, the situation appeared peaceful but disordered. The Kyrgyz border authorities turned back more than 500 Uzbeks, said Kamil Toktorov, a correspondent with Kyrgyzstan's official news agency, Kabar. 
 He said the authorities had confiscated 87 weapons from them, suggesting that some might have been involved in clashes with Uzbek troops. Others appeared to be prisoners; some were wounded.
 ''Everyone was sent back, including the wounded,'' Mr. Toktorov, who visited the border crossing on Sunday, said in a telephone interview from Osh, Kyrgyzstan. 
 He said that in Karasu he did not see any Uzbek border troops or customs officials, a sign that the Uzbek government might have lost control of a section of the border, at least temporarily. In another border town, Dostuk, Mr. Toktorov said, he did see Uzbek forces. At least one news agency report indicated that thousands of Uzbeks had crossed. The number of casualties was uncertain. 
 Daniil Kislov, the editor in Moscow of a Web site, Ferghana.ru, said the site's correspondent in Andijon saw 50 bodies in the city's morgue on Saturday, as well as 15 bodies in the city's central square on Saturday evening. On Sunday, the correspondent, Aleksei Volosevich, saw three more bodies, Mr. Kislov said.
 Mr. Volosevich was not able to visit School No.15, where The Associated Press had reported that 500 bodies awaited identification, citing an unidentified doctor. Mr. Kislov said the number of dead was less important than how they died.
 ''I do not think there is any difference between 50 and 500,'' Mr. Kislov said. ''It is equally too many. The government's response was disproportionately tough.'' The resistance to the government has been variously described as peaceful demonstrators seeking reform, desperate criminals and Islamic militants, and could contain elements of all three. 
 ''It's a hybrid,'' said Glen Howard, president of the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation, which follows the region and has an analyst who had been in Andijon recently. 
 ''It began as a peaceful demonstration, but it appears that some people manipulated the group for its own purposes, because freeing 2,000 prisoners is not indicative of a peaceful demonstration,'' Mr. Howard said in a telephone interview.
 He said the days ahead were critical, to see if the disorder would move to the nearby city of Namangan, where Islamic resistance took hold after the Soviet Union collapsed. 
 ''If it spreads to Namangan, it could destabilize the country,'' he said. ''You're talking about a very insular leader, and a country that is very important to the United States.''

HEADLINE: Crying Foul in Manchester

BYLINE: By Geoffrey Wheatcroft. 
Geoffrey Wheatcroft is the author of ''Le Tour: A History of the Tour de France'' and ''The Controversy of Zion.''

DATELINE: Bath, England 

 BODY:
IF not quite matching the millions who turned out here to oppose the invasion of Iraq, the huge crowds in Manchester last week were impressive enough. They were protesting another invasion, by Malcolm Glazer, a real estate and investment magnate, who had finally achieved his ambition of acquiring the Manchester United soccer club for a cool $1.5 billion or thereabouts. 
 Outside Old Trafford, the team's stadium, fans carried banners reading ''Not for $ale.'' One man pointed to the statue of Sir Matt Busby, the most famous manager of this most famous soccer club, who ''will be turning in his grave tonight.'' Glazer must have been aware that his attentions were unwelcome, but he may not quite realize the importance of this team, a national institution as well as a flag-bearer for its city. 
 Although Manchester has never been on the tourist trail, it has a notable history. It was here, after all, that the first capitalist industrial revolution erupted, with Engels on hand to show it to his friend Marx. Under its self-confident burghers, the city gave its name to a species of political economy that conquered the world: the competitive free-market principles of the Manchester school. 
 A scarcely less important English contribution to humanity is team sports -- above all, soccer. And here Manchester United occupies an honored spot. The club began life as a ''works team'' -- with factory hands playing in their spare time -- and then turned professional and went on to conquer every height. What's more, its story has been more than usually freighted with sentiment. 
 For an Englishman my age, the date Feb. 6, 1958, is still a knife in the heart. On that day, Busby's fine young team, which had been playing brilliantly at home and in the new European Cup competition, was flying home from a game against Red Star Belgrade. After stopping to refuel in Munich, the plane carrying ''Busby's babes,'' as the newspapers called them, tried to take off in a snowstorm, and crashed. Eight players were killed. Even now the names Roger Byrne, Duncan Edwards and Liam Whelan can bring a tear to aging cheeks. 
 Ten years later, in 1968, the emotional charge was almost overwhelming when the Manchester United team Busby had rebuilt became the first English club to win the European Cup. A superb team it was, with Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and, almost supreme among them, George Best, as dazzling as he was self-destructive.
 If Glazer is sitting in Florida, wondering about the ferocious hostility in Manchester, he would do well to review this history. As George Orwell once observed, far from stimulating the brotherhood of man, ''sport is an unfailing cause of ill will.'' 
 There was surely a tradition of jingoist xenophobia in English soccer, memorably expressed by Vincent Mulchrone, a columnist for The Daily Mail, on the morning England was to play West Germany in the 1966 World Cup. ''West Germany may beat us at our national sport today, but that would be only fair,'' he wrote. ''We beat them twice at theirs.'' 
 Now the game here cannot really be called nativist anymore, when such a high proportion of players and managers are foreign. Several years ago Chelsea made a small piece of history as the first club in the English league to start a game without a single English player on the field. 
 And Chelsea now has a Russian owner, Roman Abramovich, who arrived with an immense fortune acquired in the oil business, ready to buy the club and to buy success, as he has duly done: Chelsea has just won its first league title in 50 years. 
 Then again, Abramovich does love the game and is seen cheering at every match. To anyone's knowledge, Glazer has never set foot at Old Trafford (now is most definitely not the moment for him to try), and there is little to suggest that he knows much about soccer. 
 He may have picked up the struggling Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whoever they may be, and taken them to the Super Bowl, but Manchester United is already a hugely successful and profitable club, largely from merchandizing and from its popularity in Asia. The club has one fanzine that sells 35,000 copies a month in Thailand; games from Old Trafford are watched live in China by more people than inhabit the British Isles; and Real Madrid bought David Beckham from Manchester United as much for his image rights in Japan as for his knack of bending the ball. 
 To add insult to injury, up to $500 million of the money Glazer is using for the purchase is borrowed against the assets of the debt-free club itself, giving fresh meaning to leverage. 
 True to his own Manchester-school or laissez-faire principles, Prime Minister Tony Blair has kept out of the way: who owns a soccer club is for the market to decide, the government says. But Glazer has not reckoned with the emotions this particular transaction has aroused, and threatened boycotts by fans could still have a sobering effect.
 Then again, British capital has made deep inroads in American business recently. Maybe it's time some of our chaps bought into the Dallas Cowboys.

HEADLINE: Life at the Top in America Isn't Just Better, It's Longer

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
Jean G. Miele's heart attack happened on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan last May. He was walking back to work along Third Avenue with two colleagues after a several-hundred-dollar sushi lunch. There was the distant rumble of heartburn, the ominous tingle of perspiration. Then Mr. Miele, an architect, collapsed onto a concrete planter in a cold sweat.
 Will L. Wilson's heart attack came four days earlier in the bedroom of his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. He had been regaling his fiancee with the details of an all-you-can-eat dinner he was beginning to regret. Mr. Wilson, a Consolidated Edison office worker, was feeling a little bloated. He flopped onto the bed. Then came a searing sensation, like a hot iron deep inside his chest.
 Ewa Rynczak Gora's first signs of trouble came in her rented room in the noisy shadow of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. It was the Fourth of July. Ms. Gora, a Polish-born housekeeper, was playing bridge. Suddenly she was sweating, stifling an urge to vomit. She told her husband not to call an ambulance; it would cost too much. Instead, she tried a home remedy: salt water, a double dose of hypertension pills and a glass of vodka. 
 Architect, utility worker, maid: heart attack is the great leveler, and in those first fearful moments, three New Yorkers with little in common faced a single common threat. But in the months that followed, their experiences diverged. Social class -- that elusive combination of income, education, occupation and wealth -- played a powerful role in Mr. Miele's, Mr. Wilson's and Ms. Gora's struggles to recover.
 Class informed everything from the circumstances of their heart attacks to the emergency care each received, the households they returned to and the jobs they hoped to resume. It shaped their understanding of their illness, the support they got from their families, their relationships with their doctors. It helped define their ability to change their lives and shaped their odds of getting better.
 Class is a potent force in health and longevity in the United States. The more education and income people have, the less likely they are to have and die of heart disease, strokes, diabetes and many types of cancer. Upper-middle-class Americans live longer and in better health than middle-class Americans, who live longer and better than those at the bottom. And the gaps are widening, say people who have researched social factors in health.
 As advances in medicine and disease prevention have increased life expectancy in the United States, the benefits have disproportionately gone to people with education, money, good jobs and connections. They are almost invariably in the best position to learn new information early, modify their behavior, take advantage of the latest treatments and have the cost covered by insurance.
 Many risk factors for chronic diseases are now more common among the less educated than the better educated. Smoking has dropped sharply among the better educated, but not among the less. Physical inactivity is more than twice as common among high school dropouts as among college graduates. Lower-income women are more likely than other women to be overweight, though the pattern among men may be the opposite. 
 There may also be subtler differences. Some researchers now believe that the stress involved in so-called high-demand, low-control jobs further down the occupational scale is more harmful than the stress of professional jobs that come with greater autonomy and control. Others are studying the health impact of job insecurity, lack of support on the job, and employment that makes it difficult to balance work and family obligations.
 Then there is the issue of social networks and support, the differences in the knowledge, time and attention that a person's family and friends are in a position to offer. What is the effect of social isolation? Neighborhood differences have also been studied: How stressful is a neighborhood? Are there safe places to exercise? What are the health effects of discrimination?
 Heart attack is a window on the effects of class on health. The risk factors -- smoking, poor diet, inactivity, obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and stress -- are all more common among the less educated and less affluent, the same group that research has shown is less likely to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, to get emergency room care or to adhere to lifestyle changes after heart attacks. 
 ''In the last 20 years, there have been enormous advances in rescuing patients with heart attack and in knowledge about how to prevent heart attack,'' said Ichiro Kawachi, a professor of social epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''It's like diffusion of innovation: whenever innovation comes along, the well-to-do are much quicker at adopting it. On the lower end, various disadvantages have piled onto the poor. Diet has gotten worse. There's a lot more work stress. People have less time, if they're poor, to devote to health maintenance behaviors when they are juggling two jobs. Mortality rates even among the poor are coming down, but the rate is not anywhere near as fast as for the well-to-do. So the gap has increased.''
 Bruce G. Link, a professor of epidemiology and sociomedical sciences at Columbia University, said of the double-edged consequences of progress: ''We're creating disparities. It's almost as if it's transforming health, which used to be like fate, into a commodity. Like the distribution of BMW's or goat cheese.''

The Best of Care
 Mr. Miele's advantage began with the people he was with on May 6, when the lining of his right coronary artery ruptured, cutting off the flow of blood to his 66-year-old heart. His two colleagues were knowledgeable enough to dismiss his request for a taxi and call an ambulance instead.
 And because he was in Midtown Manhattan, there were major medical centers nearby, all licensed to do the latest in emergency cardiac care. The emergency medical technician in the ambulance offered Mr. Miele (pronounced MEE-lee) a choice. He picked Tisch Hospital, part of New York University Medical Center, an academic center with relatively affluent patients, and passed up Bellevue, a city-run hospital with one of the busiest emergency rooms in New York.
 Within minutes, Mr. Miele was on a table in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, awaiting angioplasty to unclog his artery -- a procedure that many cardiologists say has become the gold standard in heart attack treatment. When he developed ventricular fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality that can be fatal within minutes, the problem was quickly fixed.
 Then Dr. James N. Slater, a 54-year-old cardiologist with some 25,000 cardiac catheterizations under his belt, threaded a catheter through a small incision in the top of Mr. Miele's right thigh and steered it toward his heart. Mr. Miele lay on the table, thinking about dying. By 3:52 p.m., less than two hours after Mr. Miele's first symptoms, his artery was reopened and Dr. Slater implanted a stent to keep it that way.
 Time is muscle, as cardiologists say. The damage to Mr. Miele's heart was minimal.
 Mr. Miele spent just two days in the hospital. His brother-in-law, a surgeon, suggested a few specialists. Mr. Miele's brother, Joel, chairman of the board of another hospital, asked his hospital's president to call N.Y.U. ''Professional courtesy,'' Joel Miele explained later. ''The bottom line is that someone from management would have called patient care and said, 'Look, would you make sure everything's O.K.?'''
 Things went less flawlessly for Mr. Wilson, a 53-year-old transportation coordinator for Con Ed. He imagined fleetingly that he was having a bad case of indigestion, though he had had a heart attack before. His fiancee insisted on calling an ambulance. Again, the emergency medical technician offered a choice of two nearby hospitals -- neither of which had state permission to do angioplasty, the procedure Mr. Miele received.
 Mr. Wilson chose the Brooklyn Hospital Center over Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, the city-run hospital that serves three of Brooklyn's poorest neighborhoods. At Brooklyn Hospital, he was given a drug to break up the clot blocking an artery to his heart. It worked at first, said Narinder P. Bhalla, the hospital's chief of cardiology, but the clot re-formed.
 So Dr. Bhalla had Mr. Wilson taken to the Weill Cornell Center of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan the next morning. There, Dr. Bhalla performed angioplasty and implanted a stent. Asked later whether Mr. Wilson would have been better off if he had had his heart attack elsewhere, Dr. Bhalla said the most important issue in heart attack treatment was getting the patient to a hospital quickly.
 But he added, ''In his case, yes, he would have been better off had he been to a hospital that was doing angioplasty.''
 Mr. Wilson spent five days in the hospital before heading home on many of the same high-priced drugs that Mr. Miele would be taking and under similar instructions to change his diet and exercise regularly. After his first heart attack, in 2000, he quit smoking; but once he was feeling better, he stopped taking several medications, drifted back to red meat and fried foods, and let his exercise program slip.
 This time would be different, he vowed: ''I don't think I'll survive another one.'' 
 Ms. Gora's experience was the rockiest. First, she hesitated before allowing her husband to call an ambulance; she hoped her symptoms would go away. He finally insisted; but when the ambulance arrived, she resisted leaving. The emergency medical technician had to talk her into going. She was given no choice of hospitals; she was simply taken to Woodhull, the city hospital Mr. Wilson had rejected.
 Woodhull was busy when Ms. Gora arrived around 10:30 p.m. A triage nurse found her condition stable and classified her as ''high priority.'' Two hours later, a physician assistant and an attending doctor examined her again and found her complaining of chest pain, shortness of breath and heart palpitations. Over the next few hours, tests confirmed she was having a heart attack.
 She was given drugs to stop her blood from clotting and to control her blood pressure, treatment that Woodhull officials say is standard for the type of heart attack she was having. The heart attack passed. The next day, Ms. Gora was transferred to Bellevue, the hospital Mr. Miele had turned down, for an angiogram to assess her risk of a second heart attack.
 But Ms. Gora, who was 59 at the time, came down with a fever at Bellevue, so the angiogram had to be canceled. She remained at Bellevue for two weeks, being treated for an infection. Finally, she was sent home. No angiogram was ever done.

Comforts and Risks
 Mr. Miele is a member of New York City's upper middle class. The son of an architect and an artist, he worked his way through college, driving an ice cream truck and upholstering theater seats. He spent two years in the military and then joined his father's firm, where he built a practice as not only an architect but also an arbitrator and an expert witness, developing real estate on the side.
 Mr. Miele is the kind of person who makes things happen. He bought a $21,000 house in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, sold it about 15 years later for $285,000 and used the money to build his current house next door, worth over $2 million. In Brookhaven, on Long Island, he took a derelict house on a single acre, annexed several adjoining lots and created what is now a four-acre, three-house compound with an undulating lawn and a 15,000-square-foot greenhouse he uses as a workshop for his collection of vintage Jaguars.
 Mr. Miele's architecture partners occasionally joked that he was not in the business for the money, which to some extent was true. He had figured out how to live like a millionaire, he liked to say, even before he became one. He had worked four-day weeks for the last 20 years, spending long weekends with his family, sailing or iceboating on Bellport Bay and rebuilding cars. 
 Mr. Miele had never thought of himself as a candidate for a heart attack -- even though both his parents had died of heart disease; even though his brother had had arteries unclogged; even though he himself was on hypertension medication, his cholesterol levels bordered on high and his doctor had been suggesting he lose weight.
 He was a passionate chef who put great store in the healthfulness of fresh ingredients from the Mieles' vegetable garden or the greengrocers in Park Slope. His breakfasts may have been a cardiologist's nightmare -- eggs, sausage, bacon, pastina with a poached egg -- but he considered his marinara sauce to be healthy perfection: just garlic, oil, tomatoes, salt and pepper.
 He figured he had something else working in his favor: he was happy. He adored his second wife, Lori, 23 years younger, and their 6-year-old daughter, Emma. He lived within blocks of his two sisters and two of his three grown children from his first marriage. The house regularly overflowed with guests, including Mr. Miele's former wife and her husband. He seemed to know half the people of Park Slope.
 ''I walk down the street and I feel good about it every day,'' Mr. Miele, a gregarious figure with twinkling blue eyes and a taste for worn T-shirts and jeans, said of his neighborhood. ''And yes, that gives me a feeling of well-being.''
 His approach to his health was utilitarian. When body parts broke, he got them fixed so he could keep doing what he liked to do. So he had had disk surgery, rotator cuff surgery, surgery for a carpal tunnel problem. But he was also not above an occasional bit of neglect. In March 2004, his doctor suggested a stress test after Mr. Miele complained of shortness of breath. On May 6, the prescription was still hanging on the kitchen cabinet door. 
 An important link in the safety net that caught Mr. Miele was his wife, a former executive at a sweater manufacturing company who had stopped work to raise Emma but managed the Mieles' real estate as well. While Mr. Miele was still in the hospital, she was on the Internet, Googling stents. 
 She scheduled his medical appointments. She got his prescriptions filled. Leaving him at home one afternoon, she taped his cardiologist's business card to the couch where he was sitting. ''Call Dr. Hayes and let him know you're coughing,'' she said, her fingertips on his shoulder. Thirty minutes later, she called home to check.
 She prodded Mr. Miele, gently, to cut his weekly egg consumption to two, from seven. She found fresh whole wheat pasta and cooked it with turkey sausage and broccoli rabe. She knew her way around nutrition labels. 
 Ms. Miele took on the burden of dealing with the hospital and insurance companies. She accompanied Mr. Miele to his doctor's appointments and retained pharmaceutical dosages in her head.
 ''I can just leave and she can give you all the answers to all the questions,'' Mr. Miele said to his cardiologist, Dr. Richard M. Hayes, one day.
 ''O.K., why don't you just leave?'' Dr. Hayes said back. ''Can she also examine you?''
 With his wife's support, Mr. Miele set out to lose 30 pounds. His pasta consumption plunged to a plate a week from two a day. It was not hard to eat healthfully from the Mieles' kitchens. Even the ''junk drawer'' in Park Slope was stocked with things like banana chips and sugared almonds. Lunches in Brookhaven went straight from garden to table: tomatoes with basil, eggplant, corn, zucchini flower tempura.
 At Dr. Hayes's suggestion, Mr. Miele enrolled in a three-month monitored exercise program for heart disease patients, called cardiac rehab, which has been shown to reduce the mortality rate among heart patients by 20 percent. Mr. Miele's insurance covered the cost. He even managed to minimize the inconvenience, finding a class 10 minutes from his country house.
 He had the luxury of not having to rush back to work. By early June, he had decided he would take the summer off, and maybe cut back his workweek when he returned to the firm. 
 ''You know, the more I think about it, the less I like the idea of going back to work,'' he said. ''I don't see any real advantage. I mean, there's money. But you've got to take the money out of the equation.''
 So he put a new top on his 1964 Corvair. He played host to a large family reunion, replaced the heat exchanger in his boat and transformed the ramshackle greenhouse into an elaborate workshop. His weight dropped to 189 pounds, from 211. He had doubled the intensity of his workouts. His blood pressure was lower than ever.
 Mr. Miele saw Dr. Hayes only twice in six months, for routine follow-ups. He had been known to walk out of doctors' offices if he was not seen within 20 minutes, but Dr. Hayes did not keep him waiting. The Mieles were swept into the examining room at the appointed hour. Buoyed by the evidence of Mr. Miele's recovery, they would head out to lunch in downtown Manhattan. Those afternoons had the feel of impromptu dates.
 ''My wife tells me that I'm doing 14-hour days,'' Mr. Miele mused one afternoon, slicing cold chicken and piling it with fresh tomatoes on toast. ''She said, 'You're doing better now than you did 10 years ago.' And I said, 'I haven't had sex in a week.' And she said, 'Well?'''
 Just one unpleasant thing happened. Mr. Miele's partners informed him in late July that they wanted him to retire. It caught him off guard, and it hurt. He countered by taking the position that he was officially disabled and therefore entitled to be paid through May 5, 2005. ''I mean, the guy has a heart attack,'' he said later. ''So you get him while he's down?''

Lukewarm Efforts to Reform
 Will Wilson fits squarely in the city's middle class. His parents had been sharecroppers who moved north and became a machinist and a nurse. He grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant and had spent 34 years at Con Ed. He had an income of $73,000, five weeks' vacation, health benefits, a house worth $450,000 and plans to retire to North Carolina at 55. 
 Mr. Wilson, too, had imagined becoming an architect. But there had been no money for college, so he found a job as a utility worker. By age 22, he had two children. He considered going back to school, with the company's support, to study engineering. But doing shift work, and with small children, he never found the time.
 For years he was a high-voltage cable splicer, a job he loved because it meant working outdoors with plenty of freedom and overtime pay. But on a snowy night in the early 1980's, a car skidded into a stanchion, which hit him in the back. A doctor suggested that Mr. Wilson learn to live with the pain instead of having disk surgery, as Mr. Miele had done. 
 So Mr. Wilson became a laboratory technician, then a transportation coordinator, working in a cubicle in a low-slung building in Astoria, Queens, overseeing fuel deliveries for the company's fleet. Some people might think of the work as tedious, Mr. Wilson said, ''but it keeps you busy.''
 ''Sometimes you look back over your past life experiences and you realize that if you would have done something different, you would have been someplace else,'' he said. ''I don't dwell on it too much because I'm not in a negative position. But you do say, 'Well, dag, man, I should have done this or that.''' 
 Mr. Wilson's health was not bad, but far from perfect. He had quit drinking and smoking, but had high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes. He was slim, 5-foot-9 and just under 170 pounds. He traced his first heart attack to his smoking, his diet and the stress from a grueling divorce.
 His earlier efforts to reform his eating habits were halfhearted. Once he felt better, he stopped taking his cholesterol and hypertension drugs. When his cardiologist moved and referred Mr. Wilson to another doctor, he was annoyed by what he considered the rudeness of the office staff. Instead of demanding courtesy or finding another specialist, Mr. Wilson stopped going.
 By the time Dr. Bhalla encountered Mr. Wilson at Brooklyn Hospital, there was damage to all three main areas of his heart. Dr. Bhalla prescribed a half-dozen drugs to lower Mr. Wilson's cholesterol, prevent clotting and control his blood pressure.
 ''He has to behave himself,'' Dr. Bhalla said. ''He needs to be more compliant with his medications. He has to really go on a diet, which is grains, no red meat, no fat. No fat at all.''
 Mr. Wilson had grown up eating his mother's fried chicken, pork chops and macaroni and cheese. He confronted those same foods at holiday parties and big events. There were doughnut shops and fried chicken places in his neighborhood; but Mr. Wilson's fiancee, Melvina Murrell Green, found it hard to find fresh produce and good fish. 
 ''People in my circle, they don't look at food as, you know, too much fat in it,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I don't think it's going to change. It's custom.''
 At Red Lobster after his second heart attack, Ms. Green would order chicken and Mr. Wilson would have salmon -- plus a side order of fried shrimp. ''He's still having a problem with the fried seafood,'' Ms. Green reported sympathetically.
 Whole grains remained mysterious. ''That we've got to work on,'' she said. ''Well, we recently bought a bag of grain something. I'm not used to that. We try to put it on the cereal. It's O.K.''
 In August, Ms. Green's blood pressure shot up. The culprit turned out to be a turkey chili recipe that she and Mr. Wilson had discovered: every ingredient except the turkey came from a can. She was shocked when her doctor pointed out the salt content. The Con Ed cafeteria, too, was problematic. So Mr. Wilson began driving to the Best Yet Market in Astoria at lunch to troll the salad bar. 
 Dr. Bhalla had suggested that Mr. Wilson walk for exercise. There was little open space in the neighborhood, so Mr. Wilson and Ms. Green often drove just to go for a stroll. In mid-October he entered a cardiac rehab program like Mr. Miele's, only less convenient. He would drive into Manhattan after work, during the afternoon rush, three days a week. He would hunt for on-street parking or pay too much for a space in a lot. Then a stranger threatened to damage Mr. Wilson's car in a confrontation over a free spot, so Mr. Wilson switched to the subway.
 For a time, he considered applying for permanent disability. But Con Ed allowed him to return to work ''on restrictions,'' so he decided to go back, with plans to retire in a year and a half. The week before he went back, he and Ms. Green took a seven-day cruise to Nassau. It was a revelation.
 ''Sort of like helped me to see there's a lot more things to do in life,'' he said. ''I think a lot of people deny themselves certain things in life, in terms of putting things off, 'I'll do it later.' Later may never come.''

Ignoring the Risks
 Ms. Gora is a member of the working class. A bus driver's daughter, she arrived in New York City from Krakow in the early 1990's, leaving behind a grown son. She worked as a housekeeper in a residence for the elderly in Manhattan, making beds and cleaning toilets. She said her income was $21,000 to $23,000 a year, with health insurance through her union.
 For $365 a month, she rented a room in a friend's Brooklyn apartment on a street lined with aluminum-sided row houses and American flags. She used the friend's bathroom and kitchen. She was in her seventh year on a waiting list for a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the adjacent Williamsburg neighborhood. In the meantime, she had acquired a roommate: Edward Gora, an asbestos-removal worker newly arrived from Poland and 10 years her junior, whom she met and married in 2003.
 Like Mr. Miele, Ms. Gora had never imagined she was at risk of a heart attack, though she was overweight, hypertensive and a 30-year smoker, and heart attacks had killed her father and sister. She had numerous health problems, which she addressed selectively, getting treated for back pain, ulcers and so on until the treatment became too expensive or inconvenient, or her insurance declined to pay.
 ''My doctor said, 'Ewa, be careful with cholesterol,''' recalled Ms. Gora, whose vestigial Old World sense of propriety had her dressed in heels and makeup for every visit to Bellevue. ''When she said that, I think nothing; I don't care. Because I don't believe this touch me. Or I think she have to say like that because she doctor. Like cigarettes: she doctor, she always told me to stop. And when I got out of the office, lights up.''
 Ms. Gora had a weakness for the peak of the food pyramid. She grew up on her mother's fried pork chops, spare ribs and meatballs -- all cooked with lard -- and had become a pizza, hamburger and French fry enthusiast in the United States. Fast food was not only tasty but also affordable. ''I eat terrible,'' she reported cheerily from her bed at Bellevue. ''I like grease food and fast food. And cigarettes.''
 She loved the feeling of a cigarette between her fingers, the rhythmic rise and fall of it to her lips. Using her home computer, she had figured out how to buy Marlboros online for just $2.49 a pack. Her husband smoked, her friends all smoked. Everyone she knew seemed to love tobacco and steak.
 Her life was physically demanding. She would rise at 6 a.m. to catch a bus to the subway, change trains three times and arrive at work by 8 a.m. She would make 25 to 30 beds, vacuum, cart out trash. Yet she says she loved her life. ''I think America is El Dorado,'' she said. ''Because in Poland now is terrible; very little bit money. Here, I don't have a lot of, but I live normal. I have enough, not for rich life but for normal life.''
 The precise nature of Ms. Gora's illness was far from clear to her even after two weeks in Bellevue. In her first weeks home, she remained unconvinced that she had had a heart attack. She arrived at the Bellevue cardiology clinic for her first follow-up appointment imagining that whatever procedure had earlier been canceled would then be done, that it would unblock whatever was blocked, and that she would be allowed to return to work.
 Jad Swingle, a doctor completing his specialty training in cardiology, led Ms. Gora through the crowded waiting room and into an examining room. She clutched a slip of paper with words she had translated from Polish using her pocket dictionary: ''dizzy,'' ''groin,'' ''perspiration.'' Dr. Swingle asked her questions, speaking slowly. Do you ever get chest discomfort? Do you get short of breath when you walk?
 She finally interrupted: ''Doctor, I don't know what I have, why I was in hospital. What is this heart attack? I don't know why I have this. What I have to do to not repeat this?''
 No one had explained these things, Ms. Gora believed. Or, she wondered, had she not understood? She perched on the examining table, ankles crossed, reduced by the setting to an oversize, obedient child. Dr. Swingle examined her, then said he would answer her questions ''in a way you'll understand.'' He set about explaining heart attacks: the narrowed artery, the blockage, the partial muscle death.
 Ms. Gora looked startled.
 ''My muscle is dead?'' she asked.
 Dr. Swingle nodded.
 What about the procedure that was never done?
 ''I'm not sure an angiogram would help you,'' he said. She needed to stop smoking, take her medications, walk for exercise, come back in a month.
 ''My muscle is still dead?'' she asked again, incredulous.
 ''Once it's dead, it's dead,'' Dr. Swingle said. ''There's no bringing it back to life.''
 Outside, Ms. Gora tottered toward the subway, 14 blocks away, on pink high-heeled sandals in 89-degree heat. ''My thinking is black,'' she said, uncharacteristically glum. ''Now I worry. You know, you have hand? Now I have no finger.''
 If Mr. Miele's encounters with the health care profession in the first months after his heart attack were occasional and efficient, Ms. Gora's were the opposite. Whereas he saw his cardiologist just twice, Ms. Gora, burdened by complications, saw hers a half-dozen times. Meanwhile, her heart attack seemed to have shaken loose a host of other problems.
 A growth on her adrenal gland had turned up on a Bellevue CAT scan, prompting a visit to an endocrinologist. An old knee problem flared up; an orthopedist recommended surgery. An alarming purple rash on her leg led to a trip to a dermatologist. Because of the heart attack, she had been taken off hormone replacement therapy and was constantly sweating. She tore open a toe stepping into a pothole and needed stitches.
 Without money or connections, moderate tasks consumed entire days. One cardiology appointment coincided with a downpour that paralyzed the city. Ms. Gora was supposed to be at the hospital laboratory at 8 a.m. to have blood drawn and back at the clinic at 1 p.m. In between, she wanted to meet with her boss about her disability payments. She had a 4 p.m. appointment in Brooklyn for her knee.
 So at 7 a.m., she hobbled through the rain to the bus to the subway to another bus to Bellevue. She was waiting outside the laboratory when it opened. Then she took a bus uptown in jammed traffic, changed buses, descended into the subway at Grand Central Terminal, rode to Times Square, found service suspended because of flooding, climbed the stairs to 42nd Street, maneuvered through angry crowds hunting for buses and found another subway line.
 She reached her workplace an hour and a half after leaving Bellevue; if she had had the money she could have made the trip in 20 minutes by cab. Her boss was not there. So she returned to Bellevue and waited until 2:35 p.m. for her 1 o'clock appointment. As always, she asked Dr. Swingle to let her return to work. When he insisted she have a stress test first, a receptionist gave her the first available appointment -- seven weeks away.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Gora was trying to stop smoking. She had quit in the hospital, then returned home to a husband and a neighbor who both smoked. To be helpful, Mr. Gora smoked in the shared kitchen next door. He was gone most of the day, working double shifts. Alone and bored, Ms. Gora started smoking again, then called Bellevue's free smoking cessation program and enrolled.
 For the next few months, she trekked regularly to ''the smoking department'' at Bellevue. A counselor supplied her with nicotine patches and advice, not always easy for her to follow: stay out of the house; stay busy; avoid stress; satisfy oral cravings with, say, candy. The counselor suggested a support group, but Ms. Gora was too ashamed of her English to join. Even so, over time her tobacco craving waned.
 There was just one hitch: Ms. Gora was gaining weight.
 To avoid smoking, she was eating. Her work had been her exercise and now she could not work. Dr. Swingle suggested cardiac rehab, leaving it up to Ms. Gora to find a program and arrange it. Ms. Gora let it slide. As for her diet, she had vowed to stick to chicken, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes and low-fat cottage cheese. But she got tired of that. She began sneaking cookies when no one was looking -- and no one was.
 She cooked separate meals for Mr. Gora, who was not inclined to change his eating habits. She made him meatballs with sauce, liver, soup from spare ribs. Then one day in mid-October, she helped herself to one of his fried pork chops, and was soon eating the same meals he was. As an alternative to eating cake while watching television, she turned to pistachios, and then ate a pound in a single sitting. 
 Cruising the 99 Cent Wonder store in Williamsburg, where the freezers were filled with products like Budget Gourmet Rigatoni with Cream Sauce, she pulled down a small package of pistachios: two and a half servings, 13 grams of fat per serving. ''I can eat five of these,'' she confessed, ignoring the nutrition label. Not servings. Bags.
 Heading home after a trying afternoon in the office of the apartment complex in Williamsburg, where the long-awaited apartment seemed perpetually just out of reach, Ms. Gora slipped into a bakery and emerged with a doughnut, her first since her heart attack. She found a park bench where she had once been accustomed to reading and smoking. Working her way through the doughnut, confectioners' sugar snowing onto her chest, she said ruefully, ''I miss my cigarette.''
 She wanted to return to work. She felt uncomfortable depending on Mr. Gora for money. She worried that she was becoming indolent and losing her English. Her disability payments, for which she needed a doctor's letter every month, came to just half her $331 weekly salary. Once, she spent hours searching for the right person at Bellevue to give her a letter, only to be told to come back in two days.
 The co-payments on her prescriptions came to about $80 each month. Unnerving computer printouts from the pharmacist began arriving: ''Maximum benefit reached.'' She switched to her husband's health insurance plan. Twice, Bellevue sent bills for impossibly large amounts of money for services her insurance was supposed to cover. Both times she spent hours traveling into Manhattan to the hospital's business office to ask why she had been billed. Both times a clerk listened, made a phone call, said the bill was a mistake and told her to ignore it. 
 When the stress test was finally done, Dr. Swingle said the results showed she was not well enough to return to full-time work. He gave her permission for part-time work, but her boss said it was out of the question. By November, her weight had climbed to 197 pounds from 185 in July. Her cholesterol levels were stubbornly high and her blood pressure was up, despite drugs for both. 
 In desperation, Ms. Gora embarked upon a curious, heart-unhealthy diet clipped from a Polish-language newspaper. Day1: two hardboiled eggs, one steak, one tomato, spinach, lettuce with lemon and olive oil. Another day: coffee, grated carrots, cottage cheese and three containers of yogurt. Yet another: just steak. Ms. Gora decided not to tell Dr. Swingle. ''I worry if he don't let me, I not lose the weight,'' she said.

Uneven Recoveries
 By spring, Mr. Miele's heart attack, remarkably, had left him better off. He had lost 34 pounds and was exercising five times a week and taking subway stairs two at a time. He had retired from his firm on the terms he wanted. He was working from home, billing $225 an hour. More money in less time, he said. His blood pressure and cholesterol were low. ''You're doing great,'' Dr. Hayes had said. ''You're doing better than 99 percent of my patients.''
 Mr. Wilson's heart attack had been a setback. His heart function remained impaired, though improved somewhat since May. At one recent checkup, his blood pressure and his weight had been a little high. He still enjoyed fried shrimp on occasion but he took his medications diligently. He graduated from cardiac rehab with plans to join a health club with a pool. And he was looking forward to retirement.
 Ms. Gora's life and health were increasingly complex. With Dr. Swingle's reluctant approval, she returned to work in November. She had moved into the apartment in Williamsburg, which gave her a kitchen and a bathroom for the first time in seven years. But she began receiving menacing phone calls from a collection agency about an old bill her health insurance had not covered. Her husband, with double pneumonia, was out of work for weeks.
 She had her long-awaited knee surgery in January. But it left her temporarily unable to walk. Her weight hit 200 pounds. When the diet failed, she considered another consisting largely of fruit and vegetables sprinkled with an herbal powder. Her blood pressure and cholesterol remained ominously high. She had been warned that she was now a borderline diabetic.
 ''You're becoming a full-time patient, aren't you?'' Dr. Swingle remarked. 

ABOUT THE SERIES

This is the second of a series of articles examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent more than a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of unbounded opportunity.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Always Low Wages. Always,'' by Paul Krugman (column, May 13):
 By dismissing opponents of nationalized health care as being motivated only by ideology, Mr. Krugman avoids tackling intellectual arguments against such a policy. Valid or not, such arguments do exist.
 For example, economics, not ideology, suggests that health care costs are unnecessarily raised by a $325 billion Medicare budget that allows 40 million Americans to purchase medical services on other people's dimes. 
 Economics, not ideology, also advises that each of us knows our individual health care needs and hopes better than do strangers in Washington, and therefore, the more power we give to government, the more we sacrifice control over very personal matters.

HEADLINE: Once Shunned, Dinkins Is Back In the Spotlight

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
David N. Dinkins left office stunned and frustrated, secure in history as the city's first black mayor but narrowly defeated for a second term by a man who used the racial violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as an example of a city mismanaged. He was shunned by his successor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and kept a low political profile for several years.
 Now, 11 years after leaving City Hall, Mr. Dinkins finds himself courted by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, sought after by the four major Democrats running to oust him, and the subject of bemusement even among close friends, who find themselves once again trying to figure him out.
 He is a regular presence at Gracie Mansion. He and his wife, Joyce, have dined at Mr. Bloomberg's town house. Next month, he will travel with the mayor to Africa to promote New York City's bid for the 2012 Olympics. And he finds himself pulled by Democratic power brokers seeking to get him to back their preferred candidate in advance of the Sept. 13 primary. 
 Unlike the two other living former mayors, Mr. Giuliani and Edward I. Koch, who have endorsed Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Dinkins is not saying which candidate he will back, or even if he will make a primary endorsement. 
 As the last candidate to build a multiracial coalition that led to victory in a New York City mayoral race, he maintains a reservoir of good will in a city where ethnic and racial politics continue to shape campaigns for City Hall.
 Perhaps delighting in his new status, he is as elliptical as ever about his plans.
 ''I've never endorsed a candidate who was not a Democrat other than John Lindsay,'' Mr. Dinkins, 77, says over and over, resisting entreaties to further assess the candidates or even hint if he is leaning toward one or another.
 ''I have no reason to be in that big of a hurry, and things happen,'' Mr. Dinkins said in his office at Columbia University, where he is a professor of public affairs. ''Something may occur that alters my judgment. Who knows? I don't mean to suggest I'm waiting for that. I'm just not in a hurry to make a decision.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's advisers believe they have a fair shot at getting Mr. Dinkins's endorsement, which would be a coup as the mayor tries to attract Democratic support and draw black support. But Democratic strategists are more confident he will remain in the camp, and at least back the party's nominee.
 Their courting comes as Mr. Dinkins seeks to shore up his legacy, hopeful that historians will play up things like the drop in crime that began toward the end of his term after a period of abundant and sometimes sensational violence. He concedes blemishes like his handling of the Crown Heights racial violence, where he now says he dropped the ball. It is, he said, his biggest regret that he did not take action sooner to quell the violence among blacks and Jews there.
 Columbia will soon announce an endowed chair in his name. He is planning a book, eager to pay homage to his political mentors and troubled by inaccuracies he said he has seen in the news media, from the sequence of events in Crown Heights to who was a deputy mayor and who wasn't.
 But the parlor game over which candidate he may pick in the mayor's race -- and yes, it matters in some circles, particularly among black voters who still hold him in high regard -- has piqued curiosity in political circles partly because of some unexpected elements.
 The relationship most intriguing to Democrats has been the one with Mr. Bloomberg, who has given Mr. Dinkins in retirement something that Mr. Giuliani denied him, a place in city business.
 They have given each other warm introductions at events. They have traveled to the Little League World Series together. They have attended the United States Open tennis tournament together (an event Mr. Giuliani largely ignored). And next month, Mr. Dinkins, whom Mr. Bloomberg appointed to the city's sports commission and sports development corporation, plans to travel to Africa with Mr. Bloomberg.
 Mr. Dinkins has promised Mr. Bloomberg to stay neutral on whether a stadium should be built on the West Side for the Jets and the Olympics, a contrast with the Democratic candidates, who all oppose it.
 ''I'm just neutral, I'm taking no stand,'' he said, adding that he had promised Mr. Bloomberg not to campaign against it but refusing to elaborate on his reasons or position.
 Over all, Mr. Dinkins said, ''I have a good relationship with'' Mr. Bloomberg, giving him credit for his philanthropic activities even before he ran for office. 
 ''I like him,'' Mr. Dinkins added.
 Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman, said the mayor ''has great respect for Mayor Dinkins and is proud to call him a friend, regardless of their political differences.''
 The conventional wisdom held that Mr. Dinkins would surely back C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, who has lined up the support of two of Mr. Dinkins's closest friends and political allies, Representative Charles B. Rangel and Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president and broadcasting entrepreneur.
 Mr. Dinkins appeared at a fund-raiser for Ms. Fields this month, soaking in applause from the crowd but not speaking, and insisting afterward that his presence was no signal of his intentions.
 But then again, his former top political aide and close friend, Bill Lynch, is working for Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, and Mr. Lynch said he was arguing Mr. Ferrer's case.
 Some of Mr. Dinkins's associates say they do not understand why he has not taken a position. Some close friends even thought he had, figuring that like them he was with Ms. Fields.
 ''I thought he really had endorsed her, but he reminded me that he did not,'' said Mr. Rangel, who has known Mr. Dinkins for more than 40 years. ''I don't know why you go to the dinner without endorsing her.''
 Mr. Sutton, though, has cut him slack.
 ''He has a wider range of things to consider than I do,'' Mr. Sutton said. ''He has to add in the thinking his past status, present status and what kind of relationship he has had with people.''
 Mr. Dinkins, noticeably heavier than in his mayoral days but still impeccably dressed in a blue blazer and matching silver dotted tie and handkerchief, spoke optimistically in recent days about his legacy: that some of the school programs he started still exist; that despite economic hard times, he kept libraries open six days a week; that he negotiated the expansion of the National Tennis Center in Queens, including a stadium named after Arthur Ashe.
 But for all the regret he said he harbors over not acting soon enough to quell the violence in Crown Heights, he grows annoyed that it has come to symbolize disorder of the day.
 ''I wish that I had sooner said to Lee Brown, who was the police commissioner at the time, as I did ultimately, what you guys are doing isn't working in Crown Heights,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''But the public and press can be -- I'm trying to get the right descriptive language -- interesting, odd, different.''
 And perceptions linger that Mr. Dinkins underperformed as mayor.
 Thomas Kessner, a history professor at City University of New York's graduate school who wrote a book about Fiorello H. La Guardia, said that although it is too soon to judge, Mr. Dinkins appeared to fall into the ''caretaker'' category of mayors rather than those recalled for grand achievements or forceful personalities.
 ''I don't think he left much of a mark,'' Dr. Kessner said. ''People consider him a gentleman with tremendous grace, but his thumbprint on the city is not so large.''
 Mr. Dinkins said he took heart in what he called the usual warm reception he receives at public appearances. But he is conscious enough of mixed perceptions of him to allow a joke when asked what his endorsement might do for a candidate.
 ''It might harm them,'' he said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: Paying for Asbestos

BYLINE: By Arlen Specter. 
Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is a Republican senator from Pennsylvania.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
FOR over two decades, Congress has wrestled unsuccessfully with the difficult problem of asbestos. Now, with Congress about to produce legislation that will compensate Americans hurt by asbestos without clogging the courts and causing undue economic hardship, Dick Armey, a Republican and the former House majority leader, has led a huge and misleading advertising campaign to defeat the bill. 
 The bill, which Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and I introduced last month with broad bipartisan support, would use a $140 billion trust fund to pay asbestos victims in a no-fault program similar to workers' compensation. Workers exposed to asbestos would be paid based on severity of injuries without proving in court who would be liable under existing tort laws, eliminating the high costs of litigation. Unlike current law, under which those who have been exposed to asbestos may be compensated for potential future injuries, damages can be collected only on proof of existing harm. These and other provisions are the result of 40 bargaining sessions over the last two years among manufacturers, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., insurers and trial lawyers. 
 But in radio ads that have run in 15 states, Mr. Armey says the bill would levy $140 billion in new taxes to create a federal trust fund for asbestos victims. He knows better. Manufacturers, which are liable for asbestos injuries, and their insurers have offered to create the $140 billion trust fund to avoid further liability. The bill is explicit that the federal government would pay nothing into the fund. 
 Mr. Armey also asserts that the fund would set aside billions of those tax dollars as payoffs to trial lawyers. In fact, the bill caps lawyers' fees at 5 percent, compared with current contingent fees of 33 percent.
 What Mr. Armey didn't tell his radio listeners was that, as reported by the Washington newspaper Roll Call, the lobbying firm that he works for has received nearly $1 million from Equitas, a British insurer that has fought to stop this legislation. Posing as a disinterested spokesman on behalf of the public interest, Mr. Armey is instead just another paid lobbyist spreading disinformation. 
 Thousands of asbestos victims suffering from deadly diseases are uncompensated because of the insolvency of the asbestos-related companies that are prospective defendants. I stand ready to work with responsible critics to resolve any remaining issues. Each month, additional companies join the more than 70 already in the bankruptcy courts. The economy has taken a terrific beating with these bankruptcies and the losses of thousands of jobs. If we can put the finishing touches on this bill, we can produce a triple-win for asbestos victims, companies facing bankruptcy and the economy in general.

HEADLINE: U.S. IN WARNING TO NORTH KOREA ON NUCLEAR TEST

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration on Sunday warned North Korea for the first time that if it conducted a nuclear test, the United States and several Pacific powers would take punitive action, but officials stopped short of saying what kind of sanctions would result. 
 ''Action would have to be taken,'' Stephen J. Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, said on the CNN program ''Late Edition.'' Asked earlier on ''Fox News Sunday'' about recent reports that intelligence agencies have warned that North Korea could conduct its first test, Mr. Hadley added: ''We've seen some evidence that says that they may be preparing for a nuclear test. We have talked to our allies about that.'' 
 But he cautioned that North Korea was ''a hard target'' and that correctly assessing its intentions was nearly impossible.
 Mr. Hadley's warnings represented the first time anyone in the Bush administration had approached drawing a ''red line'' that North Korea could not cross without prompting a reaction. The term red line was often used during the cold war to set the boundaries in confrontations, with perhaps the most extreme example President Kennedy's action in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis to curb a nuclear risk.
 In the case of North Korea, the threat has risen incrementally over 15 years. Mr. Bush's aides have said in interviews over the past year that if they drew a clear line, they believed that the North Koreans would see it as a challenge and walk right up to it. 
 On Sunday afternoon, senior administration officials said that concerns about baiting North Korea helped to explain why Mr. Hadley did not specify what kind of penalty was possible. Instead, Mr. Hadley noted that ''the Japanese are out today already saying that those steps would need to include going to the Security Council and, potentially, sanctions.''
 He appeared to be referring to comments by Shinzo Abe, the secretary general of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. Returning to Japan from a recent trip to Washington -- where he met Mr. Hadley, Vice President Dick Cheney and others -- Mr. Abe said Japan faced the most direct threat if North Korea proved that it could detonate a nuclear weapon.
 ''If North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons becomes definite,'' Mr. Abe said on Asahi TV, and North Korea ''conducts nuclear testing, for instance, Japan will naturally bring the issue to the U.N. and call for sanctions against North Korea.'' 
 Mr. Abe also told Asahi TV that it was ''unthinkable not to impose any sanctions in case of a nuclear testing.'' 
 In an interview with The New York Times during his visit to Washington, Mr. Abe acknowledged that making sanctions work would ''depend on the cooperation of China,'' though he noted that Japan would be capable of cutting off a considerable flow of money into North Korea sent by ethnic Koreans living in Japan.
 North Korea has repeatedly declared that it would consider any sanctions imposed through the United Nations as an act of war.
 Mr. Hadley, known for his caution, appeared somewhat more tentative Sunday than Mr. Abe did in discussing sanctions. He offered no specifics. Nor did he mention the extensive studies under way at the State Department, and in his own National Security Council to come up with a range of options, either in the event of a nuclear test or North Korea's continued refusal to rejoin negotiations that it has boycotted for nearly a year with South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. 
 For the Bush administration, devising meaningful sanctions is difficult because the United States has prohibited almost all interchanges with North Korea, except for some emergency food aid, since the Korean War ended five decades ago.
 Any effective sanctions would require the full cooperation of North Korea's neighbors, South Korea and China, at a time when they are going in the opposite direction. South Korea is expanding economic ties with the North, and trade between China and North Korea has significantly increased in the past year.
 The sanction options could range from establishing a quarantine of North Korea -- searching shipments in and out of the country for weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency, the country's main sources of foreign cash -- to cutting off its oil supplies. But all of those depend on the cooperation of China, and Chinese officials have insisted, at least publicly, that they do not believe that it is time to pressure North Korea economically.
 A senior Chinese official, Yang Xiyu, told The Times in an interview published last week that it was true that ''we do not yet have tangible achievements'' in ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program. ''But a basic reason for the unsuccessful effort lies in the lack of cooperation from the U.S. side.'' He cited Mr. Bush's references to Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, as a ''tyrant'' who keeps dissidents in concentration camps.
 Mr. Hadley played down the differences with China, saying that ''we're comfortable that we are all on the same page.''
 Other administration officials contended last week that the Chinese, in private, have said they are trying to pressure North Korea not to take provocative action. Yet in recent days, North Korea has seemed to ignore such caution, boasting that it had already removed 8,000 spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor to make more bomb-grade plutonium.
 At the same time, administration officials and outside experts have said the Chinese fear instability in North Korea and are opposing sanctions that may destabilize the government and send millions of North Koreans over the Chinese border.
 Mr. Hadley, on CNN, also appeared to increase the official American estimate of the number of nuclear weapons the North Koreans possess. Officially, the Central Intelligence Agency has said one or two, though most government analysts say the number is higher. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Hadley said: ''Estimates range from two to six. We just really don't know.'' At issue are estimates about how much plutonium North Korea has harvested from its nuclear reactor, a subject of disagreement among the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Japanese and the South Koreans.
 While the Bush administration has been criticized by Democrats for letting North Korea's program expand in 2003 when the United States was tied up in Iraq, conservatives have also been critical of the White House for not speaking more clearly. 
 Asked about Mr. Hadley's comments on Sunday, Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute who has urged the United States to draw clear red lines, said, ''My impression is that until now there has been a muscular effort to change the topic'' when administration officials were asked how they would react to a test.

HEADLINE: How Much for an Hour of Schmoozing, Doc?

BYLINE: By THOMAS W. GROSS, M.D.

 BODY:
In our economy, productivity is often measured in units of time. Time is then converted to money. We hire architects, lawyers, plumbers and piano teachers, and we pay them by the hour. 
 The current medical reimbursement system pays by the job performed, not by the time spent. 
 Your appendectomy is charged on a flat rate, like a brake job. The surgeon who performs your appendectomy gets paid the same if he takes one hour or two, as long as he takes out only one appendix. 
 Your family doctor receives the same reimbursement for diagnosing a sinus infection in 6 minutes as he does if he takes 30 minutes. 
 In our current system, there is no way to buy an hour of your doctor's time just to talk. 
 The doctor can give you that time free, but under most health plans he cannot bill you for it. 
 With the current rate of exchange, as dictated by the health insurance companies, an hour spent talking with your physician has no value.
 One night when I was an intern, the nurses paged me around 2 a.m. and requested a sleeping pill for an elderly man with an infection. Imagine that -- being unable to sleep in a hospital. That hardly ever happens. 
 I was up anyway. Interns never sleep, except at lectures, and sometimes in the hospital cafeteria. I was waiting for the results of some laboratory tests for a recent admission. 
 Because not all sleeping pills are created equal, I went to see this patient before ordering any medication for him. I pulled up a chair, and sat by his bedside. We started to talk. 
 I learned that he was Hungarian. Before World War II, when he lived in Budapest, he had been a lawyer, a specialist in international law.
 Given his description of Eastern Europe in the late 1930's, I tried to imagine how challenging his job must have been. 
 After the war broke out, he was drafted, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, ultimately serving in six different armies, first in Poland, then back in Hungary and then in Romania.
 He was later drafted into the German Wehrmacht, and then escaped and was captured by the British. So desperate were the various armies for cannon fodder that original allegiances were immaterial.
 He eventually served in the Canadian forces, and then the United States Army. After that, he immigrated to this country and obtained American citizenship. 
 Ineligible to sit for the bar exam, or to practice law in the United States, he found a job as a janitor in the university library. He eventually worked his way up to become the assistant librarian at the law school.
 In his hospital room, we sat and talked for quite a while, but about history, not medicine. I got a glass of water for him and a cup of burnt coffee for myself. He taught me some jokes in Hungarian, and a few in Polish and Ukrainian. 
 Most of the jokes were about the Communists. It took him forever to get me to understand the punch lines from different languages and cultures, but once I did, we both laughed. 
 He finally said he was becoming tired, and he fell asleep as I was turning out the light. I slipped away and wandered down the quiet hallway to check my overdue lab reports. 
 Even in my sleep-deprived state, I was not oblivious to the lesson he had taught me. Rather than prescribe a medication to make him drowsy, I had let him talk himself to sleep.
 The next morning, he was more alert than he would have been if I had prescribed a sleeping aid. His infection had abated enough to allow him to go home. 
 The colonel slept through the night. Twenty years later, I remember more about him than I would have if I had called in a tranquilizer. 
 I still remember how to say ''to your health'' in seven Eastern European languages. You'd be amazed how frequently that comes in handy. 
 I still remember how many K.G.B. agents it takes to screw in a light bulb.
 I hope I never forget what I learned that night: Time is not money. Time is medicine.

 BODY:
RISING FARE ALERT -- Struggling to offset the impact of soaring oil prices as passenger demand grows, the major airlines are playing leapfrog once again with incremental fare increases. The latest round started last Wednesday, when American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, raised round-trip fares by $2 to $6, depending on route. ''Then Delta came through with a larger increase, then American decided to match Delta's increase, and then everybody else fell in line'' among the network carriers, said Terry Trippler of Farefacts.com. As of yesterday, the fare increases -- typically $10 to $20 round trip -- were sticking, Mr. Trippler said. It was not clear whether low-cost carriers like Southwest would respond. ''I haven't seen any movement with them yet, but they tend to slip in $1 to $2 fare increases without anybody noticing,'' he said.
 THE EYES HAVE IT -- This summer, the irises of workers entering secure areas of Orlando International Airport in Florida will be electronically scanned in a test of technology for improving airport access control. The scanning is being conducted by the Transportation Security Administration. Another test will take place in the watery boundaries of Logan International Airport in Boston, using clam diggers who were allowed back in two years ago after passing a background check. In what the security agency calls an ''advanced water-perimeter intrusion detection system,'' the clam diggers will receive voice-recognition cellphones equipped with global positioning systems to report any trouble, the agency said. In all, five domestic airports are participating with the agency in tests of technology to improve security at perimeters, in cargo areas and near runways.
 DIRECTIONS TO THE ROUGH -- The Cranwell Resort, Spa and Golf Club in Lenox, Mass., joins a growing number of courses offering golf carts with global positioning systems. Golfers can get precise data on things like cart-to-cup yardage, exact pin location and where the hazards are.
 AIR TRAVEL BUBBLE? -- Unsustainable fare wars, not ''fundamental consumer demand,'' are driving the surge in traffic at some airports, according to the annual Airports: USA survey by the Boyd Group, an aviation forecasting company. It says airports served by troubled carriers like Independence Air are candidates for ''traffic bubble deflation'' when the cheap tickets disappear.
 INTERNET ON BOARD -- All Nippon Airways, also known as ANA, now offers Internet and e-mail access on its daily New York-Tokyo route, flown by Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Connexion by Boeing supplies the service for passengers' laptops. The price is $29.95 for the entire flight or $9.95 for the first 30 minutes and 25 cents for each additional minute. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Valet Parking, Comfy Seats, Nice Meal (This Is Flying?)

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey. 
On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE morning rush-hour traffic was awful. My flight was scheduled for 7:58 a.m. I had just enough time to make it, assuming I could find the right terminal at the Westchester County Airport, which I couldn't. 
 After frantically circling the little airport three times and then somehow ending up on a country lane, I called the terminal from my cellphone. A friendly woman answered and stayed on the line to give me directions as I sheepishly made my way back through the maze of roads. ''O.K., I just passed the Quaker meeting house,'' I said. 
 ''Turn left at the next road and you'll be there,'' she said. ''Just leave your car in front with the keys.'' 
 Anxiously, I pulled the car in front of the Westair terminal. It was now 8:25. I tossed the car keys to a waiting attendant and was escorted onto the airport apron, where a sleek Lear 60 business jet sat, door open and engines revved. I was identified to the pilot, Capt. James Beller, and the first officer, Geoffrey McIntosh, both of whom amiably shook off my apology. On the plane, I buckled into a comfortable leather seat. Within five minutes we were climbing, steep in the sky. A fruit plate was placed before me, followed by bagels and lox. 
 No, this is not the reverie of an oppressed business traveler who ordinarily considers himself lucky if he gets past security without being snarled at. This not only happened to me last week, it is the way things work for that lucky elite who fly to their destinations by private jet. 
 Last week's column described the rebound in business jets after years of slump. So when a representative from Bombardier's Flexjet fractional business-jet subsidiary contacted me recently and asked if I wanted to take a flight to Flexjet's headquarters in Richardson, Tex. I said yes. 
 When I boarded the plane last Tuesday, I was joining, for one day, a small but growing exodus of business travelers from the world of commercial flight and all its irritations. Companies in the United States own or operate more than 5,000 private jets. Also, manufacturing is rebounding sharply after a post-9/11 slump, with shipments up 21.1 percent in the first quarter of 2005. 
 But let's face it, fellow working stiffs: the people who cruise the skies on company jets are different from you and me. They have more money. I am accustomed to flying, say, from Newark to Los Angeles on Continental Airlines at a round-trip coach fare of $350 or less. The numbers they are looking at are somewhat higher. 
 Consider: Cessna, a unit of Textron, plans to introduce a new model, the Citation Mustang, the lowest-priced entry-level jet. The price is $2.4 million. But most other light jets start in the $4 million to $5 million range, while heavy jets are priced all the way up into the $40 million level and above. 
 Here's a representative figure from NetJets, the leader in the fractional-share market: The cost for a one-eighth share in a midsize six- to eight-passenger, 2,961-mile-range Raytheon Hawker 800XP is $1,581,250. Add to that a $15,204 monthly management fee and an in-flight hourly operating cost of $1,969, and you've got yourself 100 hours a year of pretty swell transportation.
 NetJets, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, increased fractional contracts by 28 percent and ''earned a modest amount in the United States last year,'' Berkshire Hathaway's chairman, Warren E. Buffett, said in his company's 2004 annual report. That performance was affected by a shellacking NetJets took from its attempts to sell European business executives on the idea of private jets. 
 Asked how much the company lost in Europe last year, Richard T. Santulli, the chief executive, would say only, ''A lot.'' Yet he reaffirmed his confidence in the venture. ''This may sound like one of those Internet economics deals or something like that, but I think we have to sell our way out of trouble in Europe,'' he said. NetJets actually increased its contracts in Europe by 90 percent last year, to 693, from 364 in 2003. Huge fleet-acquisition and early-stage operational costs account for the continuing losses. 
 Flexjet, a major NetJets competitor, has about 600 fractional owners of its 80-plane fleet of Bombardier jets, and is planning to add 51 new aircraft over the next three years. Flexjet also made a small profit last year, but its expansion plans are deliberately more conservative than NetJets', Michael McQuay, the president of Bombardier Aircraft Services, said at the Flexjet headquarters. Because of intense competition, it is a business with ''razor-thin margins'' where ''it's very difficult to make money,'' he said. 
 I figured Mr. McQuay as a big-time business-jet flyer, but to my surprise he told me he uses a company jet only when he has to make trips to multiple cities in a day. Most of the time he flies commercial. 
 Why? I asked. 
 ''Well, it's a lot cheaper,'' he replied.

HEADLINE: Proposal in Congress Seeks Better Estimates of Mileage

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
The Senate is likely to vote Tuesday to make the Environmental Protection Agency find a better way of measuring automobile fuel economy, to bring more realism to the stickers on the windows of new cars, which consumers have learned always to read but not to trust. 
 The provision, written by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and incorporated into the highway bill, which has widespread support, would cut mileage estimates by 10 percent to 30 percent, its backers say. 
 The idea faces a tougher time in the House, where it was recently attached to the energy bill but was watered down before completion. 
 Critics say the current mileage test is less grueling than real-world driving, because it is done at lower speeds and with more gentle acceleration and no use of air-conditioners or defrosters. ''Nobody drives the way the E.P.A. thinks they do,'' said Christopher T. Plaushin, national manger of regulatory affairs at AAA, which is backing the change.
 Margo T. Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality at the E.P.A., declined to comment on the legislation but said her agency would propose a new system to calculate mileage this year. Ms. Oge said that since the last change, in 1985, traffic had increased, air-conditioners had become standard and speeds had risen. She added that the market now included gas-electric hybrids, in which use of air-conditioners may make the gas engine run more.
 Ms. Oge said there was a perception that the tests inflated hybrids' efficiency: If a hybrid that is supposed to get 60 miles a gallon gets about 50, the consumer will surely notice. But if an S.U.V. sticker promises 17 miles and its mileage drops by a similar percentage, the difference is barely noticeable.
 The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which fought the House provision, believes that the current system is fine. ''No testing procedure can account for all the variables that influence fuel economy,'' said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the alliance. ''We've done a lot of surveys and research and found that consumers generally are getting the gas mileage they expect from their vehicles. Some are getting fewer miles per gallon while others are getting better mileage than expected.''
 The Senate and House will also consider a provision passed by the House that would overrule state laws that make rental car companies liable, without limit, for damage done by their customers. New York and Connecticut have such laws, called ''vicarious liability,'' and the legislatures in both states have turned back repeated efforts by rental companies to change them.
 Marc Moller, a lawyer at Kreindler & Kreindler in New York City, said car rental companies were often the only entities involved that had the ability to pay substantial death benefits or pay for the care of the seriously injured. If those companies rent ''to anyone with a license and credit card, and walk away, that is irresponsible,'' he said.
 But Richard D. Broome, a vice president at Hertz, said the laws were a holdover from the days when only the wealthy had cars, and legislatures wanted a way for injured parties to sue owners, not their chauffeurs.
 ''If we've done something to the car, or turned the car over to someone we shouldn't have, we don't disagree that we should be held responsible,'' he said. But in other cases, ''why pick on the car rental company?'' he asked, saying there was no more reason to hold it liable than the car manufacturer or the company that paved the road.

HEADLINE: The Twain Still Won't Meet, Even in German Soccer

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: ROSTOCK, Germany, May 15 

 BODY:
They came draped in scarves that said ''Hansa Forever'' (on sale in the ''Fankatalog'' for 13 euros), and as the game began, the crowd of 21,000 people lustily sang the team hymn, seeming to linger on the line, ''This is where togetherness counts.''
 But a kind of pall hung over the soccer stadium on Saturday in this battered northern city, the main commercial port of the former German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Everybody here knew that unless the local and hotly loved team, Hansa Rostock, won by a huge margin against Arminia Bielefeld, it was going to be eliminated from the first division in the national soccer league.
 Its descent into the second division in Germany's national sport would mean that for the first time since reunification 15 years ago, no team from the former East Germany will remain in the German equivalent of the big leagues. For people in the east, there could be no more poignant indication of the way the gap with the western part of the country has continued to grow. 
 Well, there was no miracle, even though Hansa Rostock did put up a spirited fight in the first half, carrying most of the offense and thrilling the fans with several close plays.
 Still, it did seem a sign of the times that one of the few times Bielefeld got the ball deep into Rostock territory, it scored the first goal of the game. Rostock tied it up soon after on a penalty kick, and the stadium, which seemed about two-thirds full, erupted in a roar.
 But the second half was lackluster. Bielefeld, a middle-ranked first division team from the west, had nothing to prove, and Rostock's fate had pretty much been sealed in a loss a week ago that left the club's die-hard fans weeping in the stands. The game on Saturday ended in a 1-to-1 tie, and once again the hometown crowd sang the team hymn, which soared into the windy blue sky like a valedictory.
 ''It's very sad to see that not even one East German team will be in the first division next year,'' said Heiko Schliemann, a 42-year-old commercial fisherman, who drove up from Waren-Muritz, about 60 miles away, to see the game.
 ''Money rules the world,'' he said, sounding like a baseball fan from Kansas City, Oakland or any smaller American city that has seen its best players leave for rich contracts elsewhere. 
 For Rostock, that meant the departure last year of several of its best players including, for example, Oliver Neuville, who became nationally famous early in his career in Rostock but then moved a few years ago to Monchengladbach, in the heavily populated area near the German-Dutch border.
 For people in the eastern half of the country, the absence of even a single team in the first division helps confirm the conclusion of the well-publicized report of an official commission last year that reunification has been an economic failure, despite the $110 billion a year that Germany invests in the east.
 A comparison between Rostock and Dortmund, a western city in the Ruhr area and the home of a First Division team, tells the story. There are 460,000 people and very few major corporations in Rostock and the surrounding area, compared with 9 million people and numerous big business headquarters in greater Dortmund.
 The population in the former eastern states is diminishing as people, especially the young, leave for brighter prospects elsewhere. Schools are closing for lack of pupils; few companies are setting up headquarters, and in some areas, unemployment is upward of 25 percent.
 Some of Hansa Rostock's commercial sponsors had already dropped the team as it became more and more likely it would sink to the second division. Mr. Schliemann noted that fewer and fewer fans had the money to become ''team members,'' the rough equivalent of a season ticket holder.
 ''We're glad we can still afford to buy tickets to see games,'' he said.
 The prospect of elimination from the first division contributes to a vicious cycle: the club's budget of 25 million euros a year will be cut 50 percent, mostly because second division teams get no television royalties. Seventeen people will lose their jobs on the team's support staff of 60.
 ''This was an accident, not a downfall,'' contended Manfred Wimmer, Hansa Rostock's chairman, putting the team's decline in the best possible light. Rostock could come back to the first division; every year the best teams in the second division rise to the first, as the last three teams in the first sink to the second.
 But the financial vicious cycle, with top players making more money than ever before, seems worse than it was in the days when the East-West gap did not seem quite as wide and impervious to attempted solutions as it does now.
 Indeed, with that in mind, Mr. Schliemann was asked if he thought conditions for the east were actually better under the Communists, at least for soccer.
 ''No,'' he said. ''Then we had different problems, because then the B.F.C. got the best players.'' He was referring to the Berlin Football Club, whose team, Dynamo, was controlled by the all-powerful and widely hated German State Security, the Stasi.
 ''So it really isn't different now,'' Mr. Schliemann said. ''Except then the best players got transferred for political reasons, and now they move for economic reasons.''
 His wife, Annette, who owns a grocery store in Waren-Muritz, turned the situation into a fashion statement. She was wearing a T-shirt, conspicuously black, that said ''Hansa Forever.''
 ''But tomorrow I'm going to wear this one,'' she said, and she pulled a blue T-shirt out of her bag. On one side it said, ''We'll be in the First Division again,'' and on the other, ''My heart beats for Hansa.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Dip, Giving Shares A Strong Lift

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors encouraged by falling oil prices bid stocks sharply higher yesterday as fears of a slowdown in consumer spending eased.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.17 points, or 1.11 percent, to 10,252.29. Broader stock indicators also climbed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 11.64 points, or 1.01 percent, at 1,165.69, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 17.65 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,994.43. 
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 9.69 points, or 1.66 percent, at 591.71.
 Though oil futures settled narrowly lower, a sharp drop in crude prices earlier in the day built on last week's declines, giving investors hope that gasoline prices would fall in time for the summer driving season and consumer spending would remain strong. 
 After falling below $48 per barrel earlier in the session, a barrel of light crude settled at $48.61, down 6 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The news on oil helped investors shrug off the latest reading of the Empire State Index, a measurement of New York's manufacturing sector and a barometer for the rest of the nation. The index dropped sharply this month, showing contraction at a time when economists had expected strong manufacturing growth instead.
 ''I would argue the stock market is probably about 5 percent undervalued, but you need a catalyst to get it going, to give investors confidence to buy stocks,'' said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. ''That catalyst is clearly the decline in the price of oil. That's causing investors to jump on values they see in this market.''
 Bonds edged lower. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note dropped 3/32, to 9931/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.13 percent from 4.12 percent on Friday. The dollar continued to firm up against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 The drop in oil and other commodity prices sent investors looking for bargains in other sectors, including the long-dormant technology sector. That has helped the Nasdaq, which has lagged behind the other major indexes, to gain ground.
 ''We're definitely seeing strength in the Nasdaq in particular, and that's a healthy sign for the market,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke. ''Of the times we've rallied over the past few years, a rally with the Nasdaq is far stronger than one where it's lagging.''
 Merger and acquisition activity remained strong as corporate America continued to express its optimism about the economy by pursuing deals. United Parcel Service added $1.03, to close at $73.18, after it announced an agreement to acquire a smaller rival, Overnite, for $1.25 billion in cash -- a 46 percent premium on Overnite's closing price Friday. Shares of Overnite surged 43.8 percent, or $12.94, to $42.52.
 The home improvement retailer Lowe's jumped 5.6 percent, or $2.94, to $55.80 after it reported a 31 percent increase in quarterly profits, but added that its bottom line was hurt by weather around the nation that kept do-it-yourselfers indoors. The company missed Wall Street's profit expectations by 2 cents a share.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, where preliminary consolidated volume came to 1.88 billion shares, compared with 2.18 billion traded on Friday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.292	98.447	High Rate	2.800	3.070	Investment Rate	2.859	3.162	Low Rate	2.760	3.020	Median Rate	2.775	3.045	Total applied for	$38,096,266	$32,887,979	Accepted	$22,866,676	$19,536,819	Noncompetitive	$1,758,555	$1,368,547	

Both issues are dated May 19, 2005. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 18, 2005 and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 17, 2005.

HEADLINE: China Says It Will Fight Restrictions on Exports of Clothing to United States

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 16 

 BODY:
Chinese trade officials say they will fight limits imposed on Chinese clothing exports by the Bush administration, while Chinese manufacturers are calling for tit-for-tat restrictions on American businesses.
 The move toward new quotas on Chinese clothing exports is a ''betrayal of the fundamental spirit of trade liberalization espoused by the W.T.O.,'' a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, Chong Quan, said in a statement Sunday in China's state-run press in response to Washington's decision. The limits, he said, would ''seriously damage the confidence of Chinese businesses and people in the international trade environment since China joined the W.T.O.'' 
 ''The Chinese government reserves the right to adopt further measures under the W.T.O. framework,'' Mr. Chong said. 
 Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, said Friday that limits would be placed on Chinese-made cotton trousers, shirts and underwear, citing a surge of up to 1,500 percent in Chinese garment exports since early January when the United States and Europe abolished a system of quotas that previously restrained imports.
 The proposed new restrictions would limit growth in Chinese imports of the affected garments to 7.5 percent above the level that exports reached in the previous 12 months, the lowest possible under trading rules.
 The United States notified China last week of its decision to file the safeguards, but they will go into effect on the day the United States requests formal consultation with China, sometime this month. During consultations, however, the two governments could raise the growth allowed under the quotas. 
 Mr. Chong also said that China's garment exports to the United States had not ''created market disruption,'' and that the measures were in violation of the World Trade Organization rules and domestic United States procedure.
 The trade fight between China and the United States comes at a brittle time in their economic relations. The United States' trade deficit with China -- the second-biggest exporter to the United States after Canada -- grew to $21 billion in the first four months of this year, compared with $11 billion in the period last year.
 American manufacturers and Bush administration officials complain that China keeps its currency exchange rate low to encourage exports of cheap Chinese goods, and United States textile makers say they have lost up to 16,000 local jobs because of Chinese imports. The China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Textiles, which represents many of the country's biggest garment makers, said in a statement over the weekend that Chinese manufacturers had simply responded to consumer demand in the United States and that some growth in exports was natural after the longstanding quota restrictions were lifted. 
 In March, China's garment exports to the United States grew 45 percent compared with the month last year, 65 percent lower than export growth for February, and garment export growth is likely to continue falling, the chamber said. 
 If the United States pursues the restrictions, it said, ''the Chinese garment industry will call on the Chinese government to adopt corresponding retaliatory measures.''
 In another response to the quotas, China's deputy prime minister in charge of trade, Wu Yi, warned the United States ambassador to China, Clark T. Randt Jr., that the United States should not jeopardize its trade relationship with China by politicizing trade disputes, according to a report of their meeting by the official Xinhua news agency.
 ''We also should avoid mixing economic and trade problems with politics,'' Ms. Wu told Mr. Randt at a meeting where the ambassador apparently briefed her on the impending announcement from Washington. 
 Trade disputes should be ''properly solved through consultation,'' she said.
 At the start of 2005, decades-old import quotas that previously restricted flows of garment imports were abolished worldwide, giving all W.T.O. member states unrestricted access to global markets.

HEADLINE: 'No Nukes,' No More

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The great taboo against nuclear power seems to be over in Washington. This is a mixed blessing.
 The subject had been off limits to environmentally correct politicians since the spring of 1979, when the Three Mile Island accident inspired the Woodstock of the antinuke movement. More than 65,000 protesters marched on the Capitol to hear energy experts like Jackson Browne and Benjamin Spock -- and, of course, Jane Fonda, an authority because of her role in the ''The China Syndrome.'' 
 Celebrities and politicians, warning of meltdowns and cancer epidemics, demanded the shutdown of all nuclear plants. Protesters dressed as mushrooms chanted, ''Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to radiate.'' I went to the rally sympathetic to the movement but left unsure of which was scarier, nuclear power or its enemies.
 Now some prominent environmentalists are having second thoughts, as Felicity Barringer reported in Sunday's Times. Given the threat of global warming, they say, encouraging new nuclear power plants may be necessary. And Congress is about to take up proposals to reinvigorate the industry.
 On the one hand, this risk-benefit analysis is a refreshing improvement over the doomsday speeches and the chanting mushrooms. But by looking to Congress to chart a grand new energy policy, environmentalists are making the same mistake they made when they helped create the nuclear industry.
 Environmentalists originally supported nuclear power because of its obvious benefits: no dirty air from smokestacks, no need to strip the ground for coal or dig for oil. Economic benefits, however, were not so obvious to investors, who were leery of the plants' costs and new problems, like accidents and waste disposal.
 But Washington decided that nuclear power was so good for the environment and national security -- how would America cope with the crisis when fossil fuels ran out? -- that it should be subsidized. The federal government exempted the industry from full liability for accidents and took responsibility for waste disposal. 
 If Washington hadn't acted, nuclear power plants wouldn't have been built so fast, maybe not at all. But if the industry had been forced to deal with the costs and the risks on its own, it might have developed cheaper, simpler, more reliable plants.
 Instead, it built unwieldy plants that were prone to problems, making them costly to operate and also inciting public fears. Even though the fears about the American industry were overblown, they led to tighter regulations and more expense. 
 Some proponents of nuclear power argue that the U.S. industry was killed by too much regulation; others say it simply lost out to the fossil fuels we were supposed to be running out of. Whatever the reason, investors looking for a profit lost interest long ago in building nuclear plants in America. 
 But now, just as in the 1950's, some environmentalists and politicians are seeing something that investors don't. They think that uranium could once again be the fuel of the future -- with their guidance. Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman are working on a plan in which conservatives would support limits on fossil fuel emissions if liberals agreed to subsidies for corporations working on new nuclear technologies. 
 The rationale is the new environmental crisis, global warming, which may turn out to be more real than the 1950's crisis of vanishing fossil fuels. But even if environmentalists and politicians are right this time about the problem, there's little reason to trust them to figure out which form of energy will be the solution.
 Starting with nuclear power, they've backed one loser after another for the past half-century. They promised that their subsidies would move us beyond fossil fuels and produce electricity from vast solar arrays, solar towers, geothermal heat, ocean waves, sugar beets, corn, manure and something called biogas (you don't want to know). But when the subsidies ran out, the electricity stopped. 
 If politicians are determined to combat global warming, their best bet is to try something they understand: imposing taxes. A tax on carbon emissions would make investors take into account the risks of global warming. I don't know if it would make them want to build new nuclear power plants, but I trust them to figure it out better than anyone in Washington who claims to see the energy future. And at least they don't dress up as mushrooms.

HEADLINE: Council's Clean-Water Plan Is Facing Some Opposition

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
New York is one of only five cities in the United States with drinking water so pure that most of it does not have to be filtered. The City Council is considering a bill to help keep it that way, but the legislation is meeting opposition from several sources, including some environmentalists. 
 The bill, to be discussed at a public hearing today, commits the city to the purchase of 7,500 acres of watershed land in the Catskills every year for the next 10 years to protect it from development that could contaminate creeks and streams flowing into the city's upstate reservoirs. 
 The bill also requires the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the current watershed land-buying program, to submit its plans for protecting the watershed to the Council for review. 
 Since 1997, the city has spent about $175 million to buy, from willing sellers, about 60,000 acres of Catskill Mountain woodland. 
 Councilman James F. Gennaro, chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee and principal sponsor of the bill, said that ''it's critical that we look way, way, down the road.'' 
 Mr. Gennaro said that the legislation should not cause any concern upstate because it merely formalizes the land-buying plan that already exists. And at more than a million acres, the watershed is so vast that it is unlikely any group of landowners could conspire to drive up prices. 
 While there is widespread support for the Council's eventual goal of preserving three-quarters of a million acres of woodland over the next decade, environmental officials worry that setting a yearly mandate will drive up prices and force the city to buy land whether or not it is crucial to protecting the watershed. The plan could also create fears in upstate communities that the city would use its power of eminent domain to acquire land to avoid falling short. 
 Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Department, said that increased Council involvement could end up jeopardizing the program's independence. ''We've tried to keep politics out of this,'' he said. 
 Cathleen Breen, the watershed protection coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, worries that the proposed legislation will undermine a 1997 agreement between the city and the 70 watershed towns and villages giving the city a 10-year exemption from federal requirements to filter its drinking water, provided that the water met health standards. 
 The exemption will be up for renewal in 2007. Mr. Gennaro said the proposed legislation, with its mandated land-acquisition goal, would help convince federal authorities that New York is serious enough about protecting the watershed to warrant another filtration exemption, which would allow the city to avoid, for now, the estimated $6 billion cost of building a filtration plant. 
 The city has already started construction on a $1.2 billion filtration plant for the 10 percent of its water supply system that comes from the Croton watershed in Westchester. 
 The federal Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment. 
 Under the 1997 agreement, towns and villages in the Catskill watershed were willing to accept the city's land-purchasing efforts if the city agreed to approve environmentally responsible local developments to help the region's economy. 
 ''This legislation undermines the watershed agreement,'' said Ms. Breen, whose organization is one of five environmental groups that signed the 1997 memorandum. Tom Alworth, executive director of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, which also signed the memorandum, said that while he did not disagree with aspects of the legislation, he thought it would be better simply to work within the existing agreement. 
 But Eric A. Goldstein, a staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who helped draft the legislation, said that subjecting future watershed protection plans to City Council review would allow the public to participate. ''This ought not to be an incendiary proposal with upstate communities,'' he said. 
 The other four cities that do not have to filter their water have done far more than New York to protect their watersheds. Three of them, Seattle, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., basically own their entire watersheds, while the fourth, Boston, has protected about 43 percent of the land around its reservoirs. Only about 30 percent of New York's watershed is publicly controlled.

HEADLINE: Rescuing Children of 2005 on Dollars of 1991

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The streets around Public School 15 in Red Hook are usually empty in the afternoon. This is not a bad thing, not like years ago when parents refused to let their children spend much time in broken-down playgrounds for fear they would be caught in the cross-fire. Definitely not like 1992, when Patrick F. Daly, the school's principal, was shot dead in the nearby housing projects as he went looking for a stray student.
 Today, the Brooklyn school, which now carries his name, also honors his commitment to young lives. Every day, several hundred children stay for several hours after school for art classes, homework help and sports, much as they do in 79 other schools that joined with local groups to establish vibrant community centers as part of the city's Beacon Schools Initiative.
 Wherever they are, the children are gently nudged forward by adults and teenage staff members, some of whom came up through the ranks. 
 Z'Andreia Hill was once a quiet girl from the projects who was among the first generation to attend the Beacon program. Now 19 years old, in college and a Beacon staff member, she said it was important for her -- and now for her young charges -- to know they had someone older as a friend.
 ''You have to feel confident when you are around other people,'' she said. ''That is the only way you can have community, by building relationships. Otherwise, you're just off by yourself.''
 She is amazed that this school remains a central part of her life, even as she prepares to become a children's psychologist.
 ''It's like the same, almost, but new,'' she said.
 The same might be said of the city's financing of the Beacons. 
 Each school still gets roughly the same allotment the first of them received back when they were created in 1991 -- about $450,000 a year, which is actually a drop in real dollars after considering inflation. Granted, the total number of Beacons has increased, so the city's overall spending has grown, but that has precluded giving more to individual centers. 
 Advocates are relieved that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's latest budget has ended the fiscal theatrics of past years, when cuts to the Beacons were proposed only to be reversed later, during negotiations with the City Council. But Michael Ognibene, chief of staff for the city's Department of Youth and Community Development, said no increases were planned, although the Beacons remain one of the nation's most successful after-school programs. 
 That is why advocates now are hoping to get the Council to shake loose some $12 million more to enhance the programs across the city.
 ''To me the Beacons are such a powerful jewel of the city,'' said Peter Kleinbard, vice president at the Fund for the City of New York, which helped develop the initiative. ''To let them bleed, which is essentially what the city is doing, is really tragic. We have to revitalize the city's commitment.''
 Mr. Kleinbard, whose group works with educators and youth advocates to set up similar Beacon schools in other cities, said New York was the first to show it was possible to do large-scale after-school projects that had staying power. 
 ''Beacons are different than other non-school-hour programs in that they involve adults in a big way,'' he said. ''It becomes a place for everyone in the community, and that is missing from kids' lives. Kids do not have a lot of contact with adults outside of the family.''
 Sister Paulette LoMonaco knew that was the case in Red Hook, where her group, Good Shepherd Services, already ran an alternative high school and a family counseling center before the Beacon was started. For that matter, adults were isolated, too.
 ''The area had no brand-name supermarket, no bank, no pharmacy and no dry cleaners,'' she said with a laugh. ''It was hard to get in or out of the community. Unemployment was high. It was a time when the city was paralyzed with guns and violence.''
 Red Hook was among the first group of what the city deemed high-risk areas that would get Beacons. Sister Paulette's group was awarded the contract to run the after-school center.
 She walked into the school with a breezy wave last week, smiling as she watched the children dash about the gym in those games, peculiar to schools and camps, that are meant to build trust and confidence. Next door, she stopped to catch a young dance group sweating it out with determination.
 This was not the Red Hook she encountered in the 1980's.
 ''Public schools used to be closed more than they were open,'' she said. ''But the reality is, the public school is a tremendous resource, particularly in poor communities. The school was once solely for the use of the teachers from 9 to 3. This is now a truly public space. It was groundbreaking to get the schools open.''
 Keeping them open is taking up more and more of her time. Each year she has to seek out philanthropic foundations to cover basic operating expenses that the city does not.
 ''In the old days foundations supported innovative, creative visions and gave birth to new models for social services,'' she said. ''Today, they are well aware what they are doing is covering the government shortfall in the most essential elements of program costs. In the end, the whole city loses because we have to spend more time and dollars to close the gap than developing creative and innovative programs.''
 She could get lucky and come into some guilt cash from the many speculators and artists who have flocked to the rapidly gentrifying area in recent years. Like the ones who spend time in a restaurant on Van Brunt Street that once housed Good Shepherd's family counseling offices.
 Sister Paulette was having lunch there recently when she got up and went to the back.
 ''I want to see if the bathroom is the same since we left it,'' she said.
 She returned a few minutes later with a faint smile. Turns out the wallpaper had formerly featured tattoo drawings of half-naked bombshells.
 ''I want to assure you there is different wallpaper in there now,'' she said. She turned her attention to the menu.
 ''You know something is happening in Red Hook when they start serving seared duck,'' she said. 
 Of course, she is used to change. And the biggest changes -- though perhaps not the best known -- took place at the public school across the street. Kristalyn Melendez, 20, has spent half her life at the Beacon, first as a shy child and now as a staff member working her way through college.
 ''I learned here not to be afraid so much,'' she said. ''I was really afraid of making new friends and going places where I had never been.''
 As she spoke, an unending procession of first graders sidled up to her, proudly showing off small kites they had painted with watercolors. She smiled at each one.
 ''I still remember how people made me feel,'' she said. ''A lot of people around here are tough. It's up to me to show the kids someone who grew up here can be positive.''
 When another child gave her a hug, Ms. Melendez patted herself on the back. She was not being prideful. She was being practical.
 ''A kid once put a 'Hello, My Name Is' sticker on my back,'' she explained. ''I left here and sat in class for two hours with it on my back. So now I always check my back.''

HEADLINE: Bush's Choice: Anger China Or Congress Over Currency

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
After two years of prodding China to relax its fixed exchange rate to the dollar, the Bush administration faces a choice of incurring the wrath of China or of Congress.
 On Tuesday, the administration will offer its latest verdict on China's foreign exchange policies. It will either anger China by accusing it of manipulating its exchange rate to gain an unfair trade advantage over the United States, or it will anger Congress by giving China a clean bill of health.
 The report to Congress, already one month late, will come as many Republicans and Democrats are clamoring for restrictions on Chinese imports as well as expressing skepticism about trade-opening deals in general. 
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is under intense pressure to declare that China has been deliberately undervaluing its currency, the yuan, to keep Chinese exports cheap and build its huge trade surplus with the United States. 
 Mr. Snow has repeatedly refused to make such an accusation, arguing that the United States should simply use ''financial diplomacy'' to persuade China that flexible exchange rates would be in its own interest.
 If the Bush administration changes course, it would be required by law to open ''consultations'' with Chinese leaders and then to take some kind of action if China refused to change its policy.
 If the Bush administration points the finger at China, it may simply harden Chinese opposition. 
 But if it gives China another clean bill of health, Congress will be more likely to pass legislation demanding tougher restrictions on Chinese imports.
 Last month, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 67 to 33 for a measure sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey O. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that would impose a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese imports if China failed to change its currency policies.
 After hurried negotiations, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham agreed to withdraw their amendment after the Senate Republican leader, Bill Frist, agreed to give them a vote on the bill in July.
 On Monday, aides to Mr. Schumer said he would redouble his efforts if Mr. Snow again refused to accuse China of currency manipulation. 
 In addition to pushing for his previous bill, Mr. Schumer plans to introduce another bill that strictly defines ''manipulation'' and would force the administration's hand.
 Experts are sharply divided about the wisdom of pushing harder. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, has long argued that the United States ought to accuse China and take its case to the International Monetary Fund.
 Others, including some frequent critics of administration policy, say belligerence would be misplaced.
 ''The harder the U.S. hectors the Chinese government, the less inclined they will be to move,'' said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Ratcheting up the pressure now is counterproductive.''
 If China were to relax its 10-year-old policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar, the action might have only a limited impact on the United States trade deficit but a significant impact on inflation and interest rates.
 To keep the yuan at an unchanged value relative to the dollar, despite China's ballooning trade surplus with the United States, Beijing has been a huge buyer of United States Treasuries and other securities. 
 Last year, the Chinese government bought more than $200 billion in Treasuries, and its total foreign reserves ballooned to $650 billion.
 Those purchases, combined with similar efforts by other Asian central banks, financed more than two-thirds of the United States' record trade deficit last year of $617 billion.
 If China and other Asian countries were to slow their purchases of Treasuries, long-term interest rates in the United States could increase at the same time that the Federal Reserve is pushing up short-term rates.
 Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University, has warned that the United States could pay dearly in higher interest rates if China did let its currency float freely.
 Federal Reserve officials have estimated that Asian central banks' impact on American interest rates is modest -- keeping them about half a percentage point below what they might otherwise be. 
 Long-term rates have remained at low levels, hovering about 4.2 percent on 10-year Treasury bonds, even though inflation has picked up over the last year and the Fed has been raising short-term interest rates.
 But many analysts say interest rates are low around the world, in part, because investment is sluggish in Europe, Japan and many Asian nations outside of China.
 ''China by itself is a relatively small part of the puzzle,'' said Desmond Lachman, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. ''I don't think Treasury rates go up very much at all, even if China lets its exchange rates float freely.''
 Some analysts predict that China's first step toward flexible currency rates could force it buy even more Treasury bonds. Many analysts predict China will raise the yuan's value against the dollar by 5 or 10 percent, a move that will simply encourage investors to bet even more heavily on further revaluations.
 Speculators are already pouring money into China, circumventing official restrictions to the extent possible, as they bet on a rise in the yuan's value. If those purchases accelerate, the Chinese government will have to buy additional Treasuries to keep its currency from rising even further.
 The Bush administration has stepped up pressure on China. Last month, Mr. Snow and other top officials declared that China had made enough preparations for a flexible currency and was ''now ready.''
 Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, has promised a review of complaints about Chinese trade practices, including complaints by American companies about widespread violations of American copyrights and patents.
 Last Friday, the Commerce Department announced plans to reimpose import quotas on Chinese-made shirts, trousers and underwear, prompting angry protests from Chinese leaders.
 But Chinese leaders insist they will not be pushed into change, particularly when it comes to the value of the yuan, or renminbi.
 ''The renminbi's foreign exchange rate reform is the sovereign issue of China,'' said Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, according to remarks published on Monday by the Xinhua News Agency. ''We respect the order of the market economy, but we do not succumb to outside pressure.''
 Mr. Snow, in an interview on Monday with CNBC, reiterated his optimism that China would change policy on its own. 
 ''I'm convinced they will move,'' Mr. Snow said. ''Now is the time. We're anxious to see them move. It's time.''

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Fault U.S. in Iraq Oil Scandal

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
The United States did not do enough to curb corruption by American companies involved in the United Nations' oil-for-food program in Iraq, say Democrats on a Senate committee investigating abuses in the program.
 A report by the Democrats released late Monday said the State Department and the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control had taken ''virtually no steps'' to ensure that American firms s enforced sanctions against Iraq.
 ''We have to look in the mirror at ourselves as well as pointing fingers at others,'' said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
 The committee is to hold a hearing on Tuesday at which a member of the British Parliament, George Galloway, is to respond to allegations that Saddam Hussein gave him the rights to export 20 million barrels of oil under the oil-for-food program. Mr. Galloway has called the allegations ''absurd.''
 The report presented Monday indicates that American imports of Iraqi oil helped finance about 52 percent of clandestine deals carried out illegally under the oil-for-food program at the time when Iraq was under United Nations sanctions.
 It looked at kickback allegations against a Texas company, Bayoil USA, which was indicted in the investigation of the $67 billion oil-for-food program. The program allowed Iraq to sell oil to buy civilian goods for its people living under United Nations sanctions.
 Bayoil executives pleaded not guilty last month to charges the company was part of a scheme to pay millions of dollars in kickbacks to Mr. Hussein in exchange for oil deals.
 Records kept by the Iraqi Oil Ministry's State Oil Marketing Organization showed that Iraq collected about $228 million in surcharges from September 2000 to September 2002, the report said.
 It contends that Bayoil ''facilitated'' about $37 million in illegal surcharges to Mr. Hussein and then engaged in lobbying efforts to influence the price of Iraqi oil and to oppose American efforts to stop the surcharges.
 ''Bayoil engaged in this misconduct for nearly two years, from 2000 to 2002, without attracting meaningful oversight from any U.S. agency,'' the report said.
 The report said questions raised by United Nations oil observers about Bayoil's oil-for-food activities produced no American response. Asked about the report, the State Department said it could not comment on a report it had not seen.
 The company's lawyer said she would respond later to allegations made against Bayoil in the Democrats' report.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Officials Vow To Fight Closing of Sub Base

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 16 

 BODY:
Connecticut officials and the state's Congressional delegation vowed on Monday to fight the proposed closing of the Naval submarine base in Groton, arguing that the Pentagon miscalculated important environmental and military factors in proposing the closing as part of a nationwide base realignment.
 ''We believe that we can refute much of the arguments that the military has already put into their recommendation,'' Gov. M. Jodi Rell said. Mrs. Rell said she planned to double to $1.5 million the money the state is devoting to lobbying to keep the base open.
 Mrs. Rell, a Republican, was joined by lawmakers from both parties. They promised a summer-long effort to reverse the decision, which the Pentagon announced on Friday. The federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission will review the Pentagon's proposal and make a recommendation to President Bush by September. 
 The Pentagon had proposed closing part of the submarine base before, in 1993. The state helped fend off that proposal with an aggressive lobbying effort that portrayed the move as financially unwise. 
 But such reversals are uncommon, and this time the closing could affect the entire base, meaning a loss of as many as 8,460 military jobs. Over all, state economists estimate that the 31,500 jobs are linked in various ways to the base, a figure that includes employees at hundreds of small private subcontractors and one big one, Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics that makes and repairs submarines. Electric Boat employs about 8,750 people in its Connecticut operations, based in Groton, and about 2,500 more at locations in Rhode Island and in Washington, D.C.
 The officials who met on Monday said that the Pentagon had not given enough consideration to the military benefits of the long relationship between the base and Electric Boat. 
 ''There is an important national security value in having a submarine base located adjacent to the premier submarine production facility in America,'' said United States Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican whose Eastern Connecticut district includes the base. ''Taking submarines out of Groton and New London is like taking cars out of Detroit.''
 Mr. Simmons also said the Pentagon had underestimated the cost of cleaning up the base for other uses after it is closed.
 ''They've estimated it's going to cost $29 million,'' he said. ''It'll cost $29 million even to study the cleanup.''
 Representative Simmons said, ''We've got 16 Superfund sites,'' referring to places in the state that required environmental cleanup. ''The state of Connecticut delivered this base to the Navy in pristine condition in 1868. It was an undeveloped, pristine piece of property.''
 Other United States representatives at the meeting were Nancy L. Johnson and Christopher Shays, both Republicans, and John B. Larson, a Democrat. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro participated by telephone, as did a fellow Democrat, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, was represented by a staff member.
 While state leaders said they would cast their argument in military terms, the potential economic impact of closing the base hovered over the issue on Monday.
 ''You cannot separate the two,'' Mrs. Rell said.
 Earlier, at a ''sub base summit'' at the Capitol, Fred Carstensen, director of the Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut, told the Connecticut House speaker, James A. Amann, a Democrat, and other lawmakers that the state should emphasize what he called the ''synergy'' between the base and Electric Boat. 
 ''It's a unique relationship and it's something that ought to be preserved,'' he said.
 Should the base close, Mr. Carstensen said, it would have a ''profoundly corrosive'' impact that would spread to other parts of New England. One union leader said as many as 35 percent of the private sector jobs related to the submarine base are held by workers from Rhode Island, which is about 15 miles east of Groton.
 ''It's highly unlikely that similar kinds of manufacturing jobs would re-emerge in the future,'' Mr. Carstensen said. ''Clearly when the subs go, these jobs are going with them.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Says It Doubts That the North Plans an A-Test

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 16 

 BODY:
A day after the Bush administration warned North Korea against conducting a nuclear test, South Korea said Monday that it saw no clear evidence that the North was preparing to explode a weapon.
 Officials in South Korea, which resumed bilateral talks with North Korea on Monday, said they had not changed their position toward the North, rejecting for now harsher punitive actions sought by Washington. On Sunday, Stephen J. Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, said the United States had seen ''some evidence'' that the North Koreans were preparing for a nuclear test and warned of penalties.
 ''Our government has made it clear there is not any evidence that North Korea would make a test in the future,'' said Lee Kyu Hyung, the spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry. 
 Song Min Soon, the deputy foreign minister and South Korea's lead negotiator on the North Korea nuclear issue, said in an interview with a South Korean news agency, Yonhap News, that the possibility of a nuclear test ''can range from one-tenth of 1 percent to 99 percent, and it looks as if Hadley's remark was made taking into consideration the most extreme circumstance.''
 As Washington tries to unite participants in the six-party talks over the North's nuclear program -- stalled since last June -- fundamental differences have hardened. While the United States and Japan favor tougher measures, South Korea and China do not. Russia tends to share the South Korean and Chinese views.
 After North Korea declared last week that it had extracted weapons-grade fuel from a nuclear reactor, South Korea and China dismissed punitive options like economic sanctions. 
 On Monday, in the first bilateral talks involving the two Koreas since summer, the South said it was prepared to offer a new proposal if the North returned to the six-party talks. But South Korea did not provide details.
 The offer underscored the fact that South Korea, though an ally of the United States, shares China's softer approach toward North Korea. In recent years the South has increased political, cultural and economic exchanges with the North to prevent a total collapse of the Communist government and nudge it toward Chinese-style reforms.
 For Seoul, managing its growing ties with the North and its alliance with an American administration hawkish on North Korea has become increasingly delicate. South Korean officials tend not to criticize Washington openly, as the Chinese do, but privately express some of the same frustrations over American tactics.
 In an interview here, Christopher Hill, Washington's negotiator on North Korea, played down the differences among members of the six-party talks.
 ''We're in pretty good contact with all these governments,'' said Mr. Hill, who met South Korean officials during a weekend visit here. ''We're working pretty well and we don't want to see a situation where this very tough problem causes difficulties in these relations.''
 Seoul's divergence with Washington has disclosed some of the strains. 
 In two recent speeches, President Roh Moo Hyun talked openly about a new role for South Korea, one far less dependent on America. South Korea, he said, would play a ''balancing role'' in the region. ''The power equation in northeast Asia will change depending on the choices we make.'' 
 The implication was that support for its traditional allies, the United States and Japan, might not be automatic.
 Mr. Hill, looking annoyed at the mention of Mr. Roh's ''balancing role,'' said he believed that South Korea would stick to its alliance.
 ''I would think if I were a South Korean,'' Mr. Hill said, ''there is logic to saying that we're in a neighborhood that in the past -- in the past, maybe not now -- has certainly qualified as a high-crime neighborhood. You know, a lot of invasions, a lot of battles, even, at times through the centuries, wars of annihilation -- serious stuff, especially on the peninsula. 
 ''If I were a South Korean looking into the future, I would be saying to myself, 'I want a special relationship with a distant power.'''

HEADLINE: Russian Court Delays Ruling In Fraud Trial Of Oil Tycoon

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 16 

 BODY:
The judges in Russia's most prominent criminal trial began reading their verdict on Monday against Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, once the country's richest man, indicating they had concluded that he and his partner had committed crimes, but then postponed a final verdict for at least another day.
 The climax of Mr. Khodorkovsky's trial began to unfold in a crowded Moscow courtroom much as the government's legal assault has progressed from the start: clouded in confusion, prone to surprise and drowned out by the clamor of those accusing President Vladimir V. Putin of using the case to settle a personal or political score.
 As protesters gathered outside the court, jostling with police officers, the court's three judges read aloud page after page of findings that essentially repeated the indictments against Mr. Khodorkovsky and his partner, Platon Lebedev, said lawyers who were inside. 
 The remarks appeared to leave little doubt that the defendants would be found guilty, but then the chief judge, Irina Y. Kolesnikova, abruptly adjourned after only two hours and 40 minutes. Even the defendants' lawyers appeared surprised and confused, though they were still persuaded that there was little chance of acquittal.
 ''The court found him guilty from the first phrase, but according to what measure, based on what concrete counts, it is too early to say right now,'' Yevgeny A. Baru, Mr. Lebedev's lead lawyer, said outside the courthouse. ''We have to listen through everything.''
 Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former chairman of Yukos Oil, and Mr. Lebedev face a maximum of 10 years in prison on seven charges of conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion.
 The trial -- along with the dismantling of Yukos on parallel tax charges -- has resonated deeply here and abroad, raising concerns about Russia's economic, political and judicial course under Mr. Putin.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last month that the Bush administration was watching the trial closely as a measure of the rule of law in Russia -- which Mr. Khodorkovsky's lawyers and supporters say has been trampled in the effort to punish a powerful businessman and potential political rival for Mr. Putin.
 The political subtext of the case was clear from the demonstrators who gathered outside the courthouse -- some to denounce Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev as crooked oligarchs, but many more to criticize Mr. Putin's government. The latter included prominent leaders of the country's weakened democratic parties and blocs, among them Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion who retired early this year to devote himself to campaign against Mr. Putin.
 When the police moved to break up the protest -- which had been approved for only two hours -- officers jostled with the protesters, including Mr. Kasparov, who was struck several times, though not detained.
 Several other protesters were detained, including Sergei S. Mitrokhin, a leader of the liberal Yabloko Party, who said in a telephone interview that the police had beaten him. ''Someone hit me with his knee under my ribs,'' he said. ''Then they hit my head against the van door, threw me into the van and handcuffed me to a bench.''
 It was unclear exactly how many people were detained or arrested. Mr. Khodorkovsky's legal team said there were dozens. Spokesmen for Moscow's police declined to comment. Mr. Baru, Mr. Lebedev's lawyer, said the commotion outside the courthouse at times had made it difficult to hear inside.
 Ever since his arrest in October 2003, sentiment for Mr. Khodorkovsky has split along the line between haves and have-nots. Valeriya Novodvorskaya, a democracy advocate, said the trial proved that Russia, as a country, was not prepared to accept free and independent businessmen according to standard rules. ''Khodorkovsky is paying for the illusion that he lives in a normal country,'' she said.
 Katerina Petrova, a pensioner, joined a smaller crowd waving banners and heckling Mr. Khodorkovsky and other oligarchs, all of whom, for now, remain untouched by any prosecution under Mr. Putin. ''Bandits are ruling us,'' she said. ''I am a pensioner. I live on kopecks.''

HEADLINE: Shaking Hands, Greasing Palms

BYLINE: By PAUL BURNHAM FINNEY

 BODY:
Martin R. Morrison, president of Fare Audits, a travel-consulting firm far removed from the murky world of payola that plagues international business, heard that bribes were tax-deductible in Germany. ''Am I the only one who's naive about what goes on during foreign business trips?'' he asked.
 Probably not, but American business executives do walk a fine line in doing deals overseas. On the one hand, both the United States and Europe are cracking down on corporations that make illegal payments to foreign officials. On the other, companies that do not play along in the estimated $1 trillion-a-year game of oiling the wheels of contract negotiations can put themselves at a competitive disadvantage. 
 ''The bribes aren't back alley,'' said Robert C. Blume, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a Washington law firm that specializes in compliance with federal antibribery legislation. ''They're direct. Many American companies get in trouble because they don't do due diligence and check out the foreign agents they use.'' 
 Petty corruption has always been a part of traveling to certain parts of the world, of course, with bureaucrats, corporate managers and police officers none too subtle about expecting a reward for easing your way. The travel writer Robert Young Pelton devoted an entire chapter of his advice book, ''The World's Most Dangerous Places,'' to the ins and outs of greasing palms. 
 ''If you meet with an African dictator about selling more product, it's normal to leave behind a laptop or an expensive plane ticket to Paris,'' Mr. Pelton said in a recent interview with CSO, a newsletter for corporate security officers. American law does, in fact, permit ''facilitating payments for routine government actions'' (reportedly capped at about $500), like expediting a visa request.
 More problematic are the bigger payoffs sometimes demanded for getting deals done, and American executives negotiating them -- or hiring local intermediaries to negotiate them -- need to exercise extreme caution, experts say.
 A list of recent cases, sent by Gibson, Dunn to its clients, in which the Justice Department took action for various violations of the antibribery law, includes Monsanto, the St. Louis agribusiness conglomerate; ABB, the Swiss engineering company; Schering-Plough, the Kenilworth, N.J., pharmaceutical giant; and InVision Technologies of Newark, Calif., a supplier of bomb-detection systems for airports that was acquired by General Electric late last year.
 The answer to Mr. Morrison's question is, no, international bribes are not tax-deductible in Germany. European countries, as well as Australia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea, have eliminated such tax dodges since the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development passed an Antibribery Convention in 1997, which the 30 members have ratified. It came none too soon for American multinationals, which for 20 years had been bound by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its prohibition of ''questionable and illegal'' payments to foreign officials, a law that they complained tilted overseas competition in favor of Europe. 
 The parade of prosecutions has grown longer since the corrupt-practices law was strengthened in 1998 to include ''foreign companies and nationals'' doing business in the United States and since the Justice Department and the S.E.C. began working together more closely to bring criminal and civil suits against violators. Some examples are:
 $(6$)In June 2002, Gautam Sengupta, a foreign national who had worked as a task manager at the World Bank in Washington, pleaded guilty to a Justice Department charge that he had directed World Bank-financed projects to a Swedish consultant in exchange for kickbacks. I
 $(6$)Early in 2003, J. Bryan Williams, a former senior executive with Mobil Oil, pleaded guilty to evading taxes on more than $7 million he received for negotiating oil deals in Kazakhstan.
 $(6$)In March of this year, the Titan Corporation, an intelligence and communications company in San Diego, pleaded guilty to violating the corrupt-practices act and agreed to pay more than $28 million to settle charges that included making $2.1 million in payments to the election campaign of Mathieu Kerekou, president of the West African nation of Benin. 
 Daniel Kaufmann of the World Bank, a veteran dispenser of third world loans, estimates that illegal transactions cost the world economy some $1 trillion a year. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which was enacted to attack accounting fraud, like off-the-books bribes, is a new weapon in the anti-corruption battle.
 Many American corporations are upgrading their compliance departments, adding ''foreign corrupt practices'' to their portfolio of concerns, says Jay G. Martin, a lawyer who is vice president and chief compliance officer at Baker Hughes, the Houston oil field services company.
 Breaching the law can lead to corporate fines of as much as $2 million and individual fines up to $100,000, as well as jail time. An easier way out might be voluntary disclosure and settlement with the Justice Department. 
 One way to make a payment legally would be to get preapproval from the Justice Department and the S.E.C., as Goldman Sachs did before agreeing to pay a $67 million fee to Beijing power brokers to smooth the way for a joint venture in China.
 Fewer than 100 cases have been prosecuted since the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act became law. Critics complain that the government goes too easy on some companies, citing a $300,000 fine that International Business Machines paid to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to settle charges that its Argentine subsidiary had paid bribes totaling $4.5 million to an Argentine bank.
 ''I'd recommend more prosecutions and less jail time,'' said Allan Gerson, a lawyer who specializes in international law. He added that unfavorable publicity is often an effective penalty.
 Transparency International, an antigraft watchdog in Berlin, publishes an annual corruption perceptions index, which generally ranks the Nordic countries and Singapore as the least corrupt, and places like Azerbaijan, Myanmar, Nigeria and Paraguay judged most crooked.
 Some specialists say that roughly two-thirds of the big multinationals find legal ways around antibribery statutes, like bartering goods and services.

HEADLINE: An Appeal to Hispanic Voters

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:

This minute-long advertisement began running yesterday on Spanish language television outlets, including NY1 Noticias, and local Univision and Telemundo affiliates.

PRODUCER -- Elevacion - Elevation

THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Bloomberg says in Spanish, ''Dear friends: four years ago, I had the great honor of being elected as your mayor.'' A female announcer says: ''A lot has happened since then. Today, New York is considered one of the safest cities in the country.'' Mr. Bloomberg says, ''Together we have worked hard to bring progress to our city.'' The announcer says, ''Not only did we keep the city from bankruptcy during the last four years, we are also experiencing an economic renaissance in all five boroughs.'' Mr. Bloomberg says, ''We still have a lot to accomplish.'' The announcer says, ''Day after day, we are improving our public schools, through several programs focused on school safety and academic excellence.'' Mr. Bloomberg says: ''But with everyone's effort, the best is yet to come. Thank you for your trust and support.''

ON THE SCREEN -- The spot features a fast-changing series of images set to salsa-infused background music: the Empire State Building lighted in red, white and blue set against the dusky blue sky; Mr. Bloomberg speaking directly into the camera; speaking with voters; Mr. Bloomberg speaking with officers at a police station house; two officers walking a beat; a pair of wrists in handcuffs; children running in a playground; a backhoe digging at a downtown construction site; Mr. Bloomberg speaking with a mother and her child on a residential block overshadowed by a warehouse with the word ''Greenpoint'' on its front; the front of John Jay High School; a school bus; a street sign at the intersection of 231st Street and Bailey Avenue in the Bronx; the Brooklyn Bridge; and downtown at dusk.

ACCURACY -- New York does regularly rank toward the top of the list of the safest big cities in America, and Mr. Bloomberg does win credit for guiding the city back from recession, though that was accomplished with assistance from an increase in property taxes that was pushed through with the help of the City Council and Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who is running in the Democratic mayoral primary. The mayor frequently points out that the city still faces an annual structural deficit in the billions. While several economic indicators are pointing upward and unemployment is relatively low, it is stubbornly higher among minorities. Mr. Bloomberg's schools initiative has so far been judged by many experts to be mixed, though test scores due out today were being eagerly anticipated.

SCORECARD -- Mr. Bloomberg will probably win points with Hispanic voters for speaking in Spanish in this spot, even if his accent is less than authentic. And with shots of him in neighborhoods with New Yorkers of various races, it seems to do an effective job at combating Democrats' charges that he is Manhattancentric and out of touch with the people of his city. But its ultimate efficacy will depend in large part upon whether those who see it agree that the city -- and their lot in it -- is improving the way this ad says it is. JIM RUTENBERG

HEADLINE: Tired of Being Razzed, Bronx Cheers Its Food

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
ADOLFO CARRION JR., the Bronx borough president, was taking drastic action. Disappointed that only 12 Bronx restaurants were listed in the 2005 Zagat Survey of New York City restaurants, Mr. Carrion had challenged its publisher Tim Zagat to visit the borough and taste it for himself. 
 ''There are thousands of restaurants in the Bronx, and more than a million people live here,'' Mr. Carrion said. ''How could there be 12 restaurants?'' 
 Riding in a black Chevrolet Suburban S.U.V. across a warm spring evening, I joined them as they tried pizza in Throgs Neck, blood pudding in Woodlawn, even burgers in a small corner of Hipsterland under the Third Avenue Bridge: eight restaurants in a five-hour spree. 
 Most were pretty good. But afterward I went looking for more in the borough's small restaurants and cheap storefronts. Some had a connection to New York's past, like the Puerto Rican mofongo at Joe's Place; some had food that's new to most local palates, like the chewy, freshly folded Albanian bureks on Lydig Avenue.
 There were quirky owners, like Matt Lewis, who opens his Press Cafe near Yankee Stadium 81 times a year, during Yankees home games. (In a good year, he opens for the playoffs too.) And Yuval Dekel, who plays at CBGB with his band, Irate, by night and sells handmade knishes at Liebman's Kosher Restaurant in Riverdale by day. 
 And on a desolate strip of Gun Hill Road, there is the best jerk chicken in all of New York City. 
 ''We come back here when we want to eat like home,'' Maria Cardenas said of Real Azteca, a tiny restaurant near Hunts Point whose owners come from Michoacan in southern Mexico. Ms. Cardenas lived in the Bronx for six years before moving to Westchester.
 ''To find a real quesadilla with huitlacoche in Scarsdale is not easy,'' she added, pointing to the homemade tortillas behind the counter, waiting to be stuffed with a stew of huitlacoche (corn fungus), tomatoes, onions and chilies.
 Here is a rough guide to the Bronx's lesser-known places:
 Mariama Bah says that her regulars at B.B. African and American Restaurant -- mostly taxi drivers from Guinea, Senegal and her native Sierra Leone -- like her coffee even more than her food.
 ''I make it the African way,'' she said, with instant Nescafe and hot condensed milk. It's a bracing match for her thick, spicy beef and groundnut stew, shredded goat with hot peppers and cucumber salad, or creamy, lightly bitter cassava-leaf stew. 
 The Bruckner Bar and Grill fits right into its freshly minted artists' neighborhood, near the Third Avenue bridge; it looks like a SoHo restaurant, circa 1978. Big windows, old wood floors and tin ceilings bathe the simple food in a heavenly light: excellent guacamole, good burgers oozing juice into toasted English muffins, elaborate salads and six beers on tap. 
 Dukagjini Burektorja, says its Albanian owner, Marjan Kolnrekaj, is the only restaurant in the city devoted entirely to bureks: savory pies that are the Balkans' answer to pizza. ''My family made bureks in Dubrovnik for a hundred years,'' he said, and they are convincingly good, stuffed with meat, spinach, or feta and ricotta, the crust hovering between puff pastry and pizza dough. 
 El Economico, a Dominican restaurant, doesn't look like much, but the line of regulars at the counter testifies to the quality. ''We come here every day,'' said Virgil Patterson, a mechanic at the nearby subway yard, gesturing at a group of West Indian colleagues who were drinking tres golpes, a Creamsicle-like blend of freshly squeezed orange juice, carrot juice and condensed milk. The specialty here is a changing roster of rich stews like oxtail, eggplant and sancocho, the classic brew of pork, pumpkin and root vegetables. Boiled yuca is served with house-made pickled red onions.
 Just two blocks from Yankee Stadium the Feeding Tree, a Jamaican restaurant, makes some of the best beef patties in the city: spicy, with a rich orange-yellow crust that falls apart into delicious flakes when you bite. With a fiery ginger beer, they're superior to any $8 stadium hot dog and soda.
 Jake's Steakhouse, on the eastern edge of Riverdale, serves some of the best creamed spinach and mashed potatoes anywhere. Steaks are juicy and good, but the genius dish here is the full rack of pork ribs: sweet, smoky, and soft. 
 In Morrisania James Combs, owner of Jimmy's Luncheonette, bakes tall Southern-style layer cakes from scratch every day (coconut, lemon and coconut-pineapple). Mr. Combs has been cooking on this corner since 1970, and still makes the dishes he opened with: fried fish with grits, macaroni and cheese, fried chicken.
 Joe's Place serves the solid, tasty Puerto Rican classics that have become hard to find in New York City: mofongo, mashed plaintains enriched with garlic and pork cracklings; juicy chuletas, thin pork chops; and tangy ensalada de bacalao, shredded salt cod sparked with capers and olives. Joe's is hugely popular with locals. 
 La Orquidea, which serves mostly Honduran food (and ranges elsewhere in Central America), excels at pupusas, yellow cornmeal pancakes stuffed with mild cheese and pressed on a griddle until the edges are crisp and the cheese is melted. The restaurant also makes baleadas from scratch: warm, thick flour tortillas wrapped around beans and cheese that are a Honduran specialty; ask for chimol, a fresh tomato-cilantro salsa, on the side.
 Lechonera Criolla proudly displays its masterwork -- burnished legs of roast pork -- in its front window. Open for 15 years, this is the place for garlicky pernil (leg) and lechon (shoulder).
 If it's been too long since your last tongue and coleslaw on rye or chicken soup with kreplach, Liebman's Kosher Restaurant is a beautiful sight. Open since 1953, the restaurant makes wondrous corned beef, homemade pigs in blankets, and increasingly rare round knishes. (Brooklynites still mourning Shatzkin's might want to make a pilgrimage.) Liebman's is one of very few places in New York that still make their own pastrami and slice it to order; one of the owners, Yuval Dekel, said he rubs a whole brisket of beef with pepper, sugar, and salt; then he smokes it, and then steams it ''until the proteins in the meat just give in.'' Mother's Bake Shop, two doors down, has excellent babkas and black-and-white cookies. 
 Press Cafe, opposite Gate 6 of Yankee Stadium, may have the oddest business model of any restaurant in New York. ''We're open two and a half hours before every Yankee home game, and we stay open an hour after it ends, even if it goes 14 innings,'' said an owner, Matt Lewis. ''And that's it.''
 Mr. Lewis, a lifelong Yankees fan who grew up in New Jersey, bought the restaurant last year. With its dark wood bar, tile floor and hanging lamps, the place is by far the most elegant in the stadium area. Its kitchen turns out a good variety of Italianate salads and sandwiches. The bruschette -- especially buffalo mozzarella with arugula -- are good, but the bread is too thick when used for panini, making the pressed sandwiches unwieldy. 
 Open since 2002, the Rambling House has quickly become the anchor for its stretch of Katonah Avenue, a social and shopping center for young Irish immigrants in the city. The Bronx has long been rich in Irish pubs, but the Rambling House is more than a pub, especially on Sundays, when families sit down to shepherd's pie, fish and chips, and rich, crumbly black pudding (blood sausage). For the ''Katonah Avenue Favorite'' of bangers, mashed potatoes and baked beans, the owner, Declan Rainsford, has the sausages made in the fine-grain Irish style by local butchers. 
 Real Azteca, a taqueria near Hunts Point, makes gorgeously overstuffed tortas, sandwiches of carnitas (roast pork) or cecina (dried beef) with diced tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, queso fresco and pickled jalapenos, all pressed into a softball-size foil package. The tacos are some of the best in the city, and on weekends there's an hourlong wait for roast goat. 
 Tasty Hut (formerly the Jerk Center) has changed its name but not its recipe, which produces some of the most fragrant jerk chicken in the city. The restaurant is open 24 hours a day.
 ''People have our jerk for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner,'' said a waitress. ''I think they get into the spices.'' Sauce-free and moist, the chicken carries a gentle heat and the unmistakable grit of spices: allspice, thyme and cumin, at least. 
 At Tosca in Throgs Neck, the owner, Eddy Sujak, has lovingly restored a 1922 pizza oven and uses it to make lightly charred, delicate, thin-crust pizzas. Tosca is the kind of old-school Italian-American restaurant that barely exists in Manhattan, with great grilled calamari, stuffed mushrooms and a luxurious toasted-almond cream cake that blends the allures of tiramisu and tortoni.
 With the Bruckner Grill, Jake's, Joe's, the Rambling House, Tosca and three other less exalted places under his belt, Mr. Zagat was as impressed with Mr. Carrion's restraint as with his selection. 
 ''It's good that you don't eat too much,'' Mr. Zagat said. ''People don't like fat politicians.''
 Before embarking on a political career, Mr. Carrion worked as a caterer. He lives in a house on City Island that was the longtime home of Le Refuge, an elegant French restaurant and inn. (Le Refuge reopened in larger quarters a few blocks down.) 
 ''I have beautiful marble counters, and even a wine cellar,'' he said. ''But since I was elected, I have no time to cook.''

HEADLINE: U.S. WARNS CHINA ABOUT CURRENCY

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration warned China on Tuesday that its currency policies were distorting world trade, and it brandished the threat of retaliation against the country's exports if Chinese leaders did not change course in the next year.
 In language far harsher than it has used before, the Treasury Department declared that China's fixed exchange rate between its currency, the yuan, and the dollar posed a risk to its economy and the economies of much of the rest of the world.
 The administration stopped short of accusing China of outright currency manipulation, a move demanded by American manufacturers who complain that the Chinese have artificially undervalued their currency to make exports cheaper in the United States.
 But the new language marked a change in relations, which the administration has until now handled with painstaking delicacy.
 ''Current Chinese policies,'' the Treasury Department said in a report to Congress on Tuesday, ''are highly distortionary and pose a risk to China's economy, its trading partners and global economic growth.'' 
 Coming closer than before to setting a deadline, the Treasury report warned that China's policy would meet its definition for currency manipulation unless Beijing officials make a ''substantial alteration.''
 The administration's combative new stance was not enough to satisfy many members of Congress from both parties, who want to soon threaten China with steep tariffs on its exports if it fails to allow the yuan to rise significantly from a narrow band around 8.28 to the dollar. 
 A stronger yuan would tend to make Chinese goods more expensive in foreign markets, diminishing the country's competitive advantage. Still, economists said even that was unlikely to make a dent quickly in the huge trade imbalance with the United States.
 The studied shift in the administration's stance reflected delicate issues that confront American officials, who want China to change its currency practices but are even more worried about pressure from Congress to restrict trade. 
 In less than a decade, China has emerged as a manufacturing powerhouse and an indispensable source of low-price goods -- toys, furniture and electronics, among others. The expiration on Jan. 1 of global textile quotas has flooded world markets with Chinese apparel. 
 American manufacturers have been caught on both sides of this transformation in trade: often overwhelmed by Chinese competition yet benefiting as buyers of Chinese goods and investors in factories. 
 Administration officials are also juggling political concerns. As a great power of Asia, China is crucial to Washington's efforts to restrain North Korean nuclear ambitions.
 The Chinese Embassy in Washington had no immediate comment. But even before the administration issued its report, Chinese leaders said on Monday that currency policy was a ''sovereign'' matter and that they would not be pushed into decisions by other governments.
 The Treasury warning implicitly gave the Chinese until October, when the administration is required to make its next report to Congress on foreign currency practices. If it declares that a country is manipulating its currency to gain competitive advantage, it is required to begin negotiations over exchange rates that could lead to retaliation.
 The United States trade deficit with China reached $124.9 billion last year, larger than that with any other country or with the entire European Union. China has also become one of America's biggest foreign creditors, holding more than $600 billion in Treasury securities and other dollar-denominated instruments as it seeks to keep its currency from rising in line with the trade surpluses.
 The Treasury report criticized China's policy as dangerous to itself, its Asian neighbors and global growth. ''China's 10-year-long pegged currency may have contributed to stability in the past,'' said Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, ''but that is no longer the case today as China has grown to be a more significant participant in global trade and financial flows.'' 
 The policy, he said, threatened the Chinese economy by sowing the seeds of inflation, distorting capital flows and preventing the nation's central bank from conducting normal monetary policy.
 Mr. Snow said that China must devise ''substantial'' changes in its currency practices to make them more ''flexible.'' He did not demand that Beijing move directly to a system of floating exchange rates, like those used by the United States and most of Europe. Most analysts say China is unlikely to do much more than let its currency appreciate by a limited amount, with some estimating an increase as high as 10 percent.
 But administration officials said Beijing would have to make changes of ''a manner and magnitude that is sufficiently reflective of underlying market conditions.''
 The direct American language marked at least a partial abandonment of the Bush administration's two-year attempt to cajole China, using ''financial diplomacy.''
 China has pegged the yuan at a fixed rate to the dollar since 1994, when it was beginning to emerge as a force in global trade. Left to free-market forces, specialists say that the value of the yuan would have climbed substantially against the dollar. But China and other Asian nations have kept the value constant by buying hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasury securities.
 The Chinese central bank bought more than $250 billion in dollar-denominated securities over the last year and now holds more than $600 billion, according to recent estimates.
 The Treasury's report Tuesday did not satisfy critics in Washington.
 ''The Bush administration is in serious denial with its claim today that China is not manipulating its currency,'' said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee on trade. ''In denying currency manipulation by the Chinese, the administration has turned a blind eye to American workers and businesses that are being seriously hurt by China's policies.''
 The National Association of Manufacturers, which has lobbied for tougher action for two years, said that it was ''disappointed'' and that Mr. Snow's warning shot was already ''long overdue.''
 But Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and an administration critic, said the tougher language was an improvement.
 ''They stepped right up to the door, but they didn't knock,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''The good news now is that the federal government -- the executive branch and the legislative branch -- agree that what the Chinese government is doing is wrong. But we still await action, and that's the only thing that will satisfy Congress.''
 Mr. Schumer and Senator Lindsey O. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, stunned administration officials last month by winning bipartisan Senate support for a measure that would threaten China with tariffs up to 27.5 percent if it failed to change its currency policies.
 The Senate voted 67 to 33 against killing an amendment that would have attached the provision to a spending bill. Mr. Schumer withdrew the amendment, but Senate Republican s have agreed to allow a vote on the measure before the end of July.
 Administration officials oppose such penalties for China but also hope the Chinese recognize the risk of provoking political retaliation in Congress if they delay action much longer. ''There are very, very strong protectionist sentiments growing in the United States,'' a senior official said, ''and they are directly against China. China could help that situation significantly by moving toward flexible exchange rates.''

HEADLINE: Landlords Cashing Out as Condo Fever Spreads 

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Apartment building owners faced with dwindling returns are selling their properties to developers willing to pay ever larger premiums so that they can convert rental units into condominiums.
 The trend is driven by low mortgage interest rates that have encouraged renters to become homeowners, leaving landlords in many areas with falling occupancy rates and forcing them to lower rents and make other concessions to keep their buildings full.
 Instead, many landlords are deciding to sell, and in many cities, condo conversion sales have been increasing at an explosive rate.
 But some real estate specialists say the condo conversion market has become so overheated, especially in places like South Florida and Las Vegas, that many developers could find themselves unable to sell their condo units --and possibly in default -- if interest rates rise and the pool of potential buyers dwindles. 
 ''Condo converters are paying above market rates, above what the rental value of the building would be,'' said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm.
 If all the units do not sell, leaving the building with an undesirable mixture of tenants and condo owners, he added, ''the lenders will have a tough time getting their money back'' and developers will have ''the headaches of having to manage renters and owners both.''
 Sales of apartment buildings to condo converters reached a record $13.3 billion last year, up from $3 billion in 2003, according to Real Capital Analytics, which tracks sales of at least $5 million. Since January 2004, 103,000 apartments have been sold to converters, the firm said.
 In metropolitan Washington, buildings intended for conversion sold for an average of 88 percent more than other apartment buildings, according to the research division of Marcus & Millichap, a national real estate investment brokerage company.
 In Northern New Jersey, condo converters paid about four times as much as buyers of buildings that will remain as rentals. In Northern Virginia, as in South Florida, there is little difference between what converters are paying for apartments and the market price for a condo, leaving little room for profit, Mr. White said. 
 Many condo units are sold to investors looking for an alternative to the stock market. Real estate specialists estimate that speculators and other investors account for as much as 60 percent of condo sales in Florida, and one-quarter or more of the sales in places like Washington and Chicago. 
 ''Investors are buying blocks of units, four or five at a time,'' said John R. Jaeger, a vice president at Appraisal Research Counselors, which focuses on Chicago's housing market. ''We see that quite a bit.'' He said that typically only 15 percent of the tenants in an apartment building wind up buying their units.
 Developers like the Related Group of Florida are taking steps to curb speculation by, for example, requiring a 20 percent deposit so that the investor will not be likely to walk away from his or her condo unit. ''No one can buy more than two units, and we carefully screen and cross-check with our other projects,'' said Joyce M. Bronson, a senior vice president. 
 Sometimes an apartment building changes hands even before or soon after construction is completed. Last month, Vornado Realty Trust, the New York-based real estate investment trust, agreed to sell a new 452-unit apartment building at 400 North LaSalle in downtown Chicago to a venerable local developer, Draper & Kramer, for $126 million, or about $278,000 a unit. Vornado said its gain would be $30 million. 
 Jim Freko, a Draper & Kramer vice president, said his company planned to install hardwood floors but otherwise does not need to spend much to convert the building, which was completed last year. An average 900-square-foot unit will be priced at about $360,000, he said. These days, he said, condo converters have come to expect lower returns than they have been used to. 
 ''You see a lot more converters stepping up to the plate, whether experienced or new, and they are getting more aggressive and pushing up the prices you need to pay,'' he said. But, he said, as long as interest rates remain low, the conversion trend is likely to continue.
 Fueling the spurt in condo conversions is the widespread availability of financing, not just from banks but also from other lenders willing to make up the difference between the bank loan and the actual cost of purchase and construction. Competition among lenders is so feverish that some developers can get away with putting very little of their own money at risk, mortgage brokers say. 
 ''There are promoters putting deals together who are taking out their own equity and replacing it with other people's equity so that they are getting a percentage of the transaction with no money in it,'' said Robert Kaplan, a senior managing director for South Florida for Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, who helps arrange financing for such deals. 
 Until now, Wall Street investment firms have issued their own condo conversion loans but have not sold them on the secondary market as mortgage-backed securities. But in what real estate specialists said was another sign of the expanding availability of debt financing for this type of property, Credit Suisse First Boston has just finished marketing a bond to institutional investors that was backed by $1.5 billion worth of mortgages for apartment buildings and other properties being transformed into condominiums.
 By taking many apartments off the market, condo conversions have actually helped raise apartment occupancy in some areas, said Lloyd Lynford, the president of Reis Inc., a New York research firm. The average vacancy rate in the top 64 metropolitan markets at the end of March was 6.6 percent, down from 7.1 percent the previous March. The average in the 1990's was 4.9 percent. 
 Apartment companies, whose performance is correlated to job growth as well as interest rates, are the weakest of the REIT sectors. This has led Equity Residential Properties Trust, the nation's leading apartment landlord, and Post Properties, another apartment REIT, to enter the conversion business themselves. The success of these efforts has prompted other apartment REIT's to consider following suit, said Craig Leupold, an analyst for Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif.
 But many converters coming into the market are inexperienced developers in search of quick profits, said Kenneth T. Rosen, a real estate professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''A lot of untested people are getting into this,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''It's the place where people think they can make fast money today. That's the real problem.''

HEADLINE: School's Out: No Money to Pay Its Teachers

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, May 17 

 BODY:
The desks of Lucas, Nicco, Katia, Maya and their classmates were empty on Tuesday. The kindergartners and the rest of the students at the Cornerstone School were off on an unexpected four-day vacation. Their teachers were out, too, waiting to see if there would be any money for their next paychecks. 
 On Monday, the private school notified the parents of its 132 students that it did not have the money to keep paying its 13 teachers. If it cannot come up with $120,000 to cover salaries until the end of the school year, it will have to close immediately, said Stephen Samborski, the school's interim chief executive. Students will have to start attending their neighborhood public school with only weeks left in the school year. 
 ''It's a saving grace in Jersey City,'' Esther Wintner, president of the school's board of trustees, said of Cornerstone. ''If something happens to this school -- we are on life support -- families will move out. A lot of families chose to remain in Jersey City because of this school. Families bought homes in Jersey City thinking they would have this school.''
 The school, which includes kindergarten through eighth grade, moved into 80 Pavonia Avenue in the city's Newport section in September 2003 after Newport's developer, the Lefrak Organization, had sought to locate a school near its 4,000 waterfront apartments. Residents received a 20 percent tuition break, and the school paid below-market rent, about $7.60 per square foot per year, according to Jamie LeFrak, managing director of the Lefrak Organization, compared with $30 per square foot per year for the rest of the building. 
 Mr. Samborski said, ''It's pretty darn reasonable, but still beyond our means.'' 
 Mr. LeFrak said the school was ''a good bit behind on rent and utilities,'' and its lease would be terminated at the end of the school year for lack of payment, but he hoped another school could move into the space. 
 ''We're committed to the concept of education being part of the community,'' he said.
 The River School, on Newport Parkway, will hold a meeting on Wednesday night to discuss the possibility of taking over the space, said Lorena Loayza, the assistant to the school's director. 
 When the Cornerstone School moved to the waterfront from Kennedy Boulevard, it needed about $350,000 to cover its costs, Mr. Samborski said. Part of that was covered by a low-interest loan from Provident Bank, and part was expected to come from the city's Economic Development Corporation. Two months after the move, however, the school learned the city money would not be available, which set off the recent financial troubles, Ms. Wintner said.
 ''We're as heartbroken as everyone else,'' she said. ''We did not want this to happen.'' 
 Parents are now calling each family with a child or children in the school to try to raise enough money to pay the teachers through June 16, the last day of school, and if possible through August, as called for in their contracts.
 Caroline Terrasson, whose daughter, Lily, is in kindergarten at the 18-year-old school, praised its teaching methods. 
 ''It's a great school. It lets children be free with what they think,'' she said. ''We have some issue with the administration of the school, not with the teachers.'' 
 Dan Krasner, whose daughter is in third grade, said the school had always been well run academically, but not financially. 
 ''They were never forthcoming with any kind of explanation of where they are financially,'' he said. 
 The school's progressive philosophy, based on the theories of John Dewey, the education reformer and philosopher, prefers experiential learning to textbook learning, Mr. Samborski said. 
 Tuition rose 10 percent last year, to $7,200, he said. Many students receive financial aid.
 ''In hindsight if we'd raised tuition 20 percent, we probably would be able to finish this year and start afresh nest year, and probably break even the next year,'' he said. 
 Sharon Bartley, a spokeswoman for the Jersey City public schools, said if the Cornerstone School closed, the district would help students enroll in the school closest to their homes for the rest of the school year.
 The state Department of Education does not oversee private schools, and has no control over the situation, said Jon Zlock, a spokesman.

HEADLINE: Efforts Continue to Win Release of American in China

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 17 

 BODY:
For most of the six months since the American business executive David Ji was arrested in China during a routine business visit, his family hoped muted diplomacy would win his release, according to his daughter, Jean Ji. 
 In coming weeks, however, Mr. Ji's arrest threatens to become another irritant in the increasingly fractious Chinese-American trade relationship, as the May 29 deadline for his current detention approaches and his daughter embarks on a public campaign to free him.
 Mr. Ji, who was born in Shanghai and became an American citizen in 2000, is the president and chief executive of Apex Digital, a company based in California that used cheap Chinese suppliers, especially the state-owned Sichuan Changhong Electric, to win a large piece of the low-price TV and DVD player market in the United States. But Mr. Ji's relationship with Changhong soured; the Chinese company accused him of reneging on payments of over $400 million and appears to be involved in his detention on fraud charges. 
 The police arrested Mr. Ji in the southern city of Shenzhen last October, but for most of the last six months he has been held in a hotel in Changhong's hometown, Mianyang, in western China. Since Nov. 29, he has been under a kind of house arrest called ''residential surveillance,'' which can last for up to six months under Chinese law, and he is accompanied constantly by up to three police officers, even apparently during visits to the bathroom, Ms. Ji said.
 ''What I strongly believe is they're keeping him hostage and using him as a bargaining chip for the negotiating table,'' Ms. Ji said, referring to the Mianyang officials. She was speaking from Washington, where she was lobbying members of Congress and administration officials about her father's case.
 This latest twist in David Ji's case comes as China is trying to burnish its image as a welcoming destination for foreign investors and to ease Washington's complaints about Chinese trade practices. 
 On Monday, China's president, Hu Jintao, told executives at the Fortune Global Forum in Beijing that China would ''work harder to help foreign investors, and create an even better environment for trade and economic cooperation,'' The China Daily reported on Tuesday, under the banner headline, ''You come, we profit, we all prosper.'' 
 Yet, while China remains one the world's most powerful magnets of international investment, cases like David Ji's highlight the dangers that investors can face.
 At first, Ms. Ji, 26 years old and a computer engineer who lives in her parents' home, said she and her mother, Ruying Liu, assumed Mr. Ji's absence was a part of his busy routine. But in early November she received a phone call from Ancle Hsu, Apex's chief operating officer, who told her Mr. Ji had been arrested. Since then, Apex and Changhong have traded lawsuits in Los Angeles, with Changhong accusing Apex of passing bad checks, and Apex accusing Changhong of shipping shoddy goods and using Mr. Ji's arrest to pressure him into signing documents unfavorable to Apex. 
 ''During the course of his detention there have been several violations of Chinese criminal procedure law and relevant regulations,'' said Andrea Worden, a lawyer in Washington with O'Melveny and Myers, who is representing Mr. Ji. She said the violations included refusing Mr. Ji free access to his lawyer and not presenting him with a detention warrant when he was first detained in Shenzhen, which Chinese law requires. 
 Consular officials have seen Mr. Ji regularly but been refused private meetings with him, said Kelly Shannon, a spokeswoman for the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington. A spokesman for Changhong, Liu Haizhong, refused to answer questions about his case, referring them to the legal department, which also refused.
 Mianyang police and officials refused to discuss Mr. Ji's case, referring questions to provincial officials, who also refused to answer any questions. But Mianyang has an unusually intimate relationship with Changhong; the company provides around two-thirds of the city's revenue, and Changhong's chairman and managing director, Zhao Yong, was until late last year the city's deputy mayor. American consular officials and Mr. Ji's lawyers said he had been held at the Fuleshan International Hotel in Mianyang. Hotel staff denied that Mr. Ji was staying there, saying they had no records of his presence or of police holding rooms.
 Ms. Ji said her father had not called her and her mother since early April -- before then he called regularly -- and during his last call he sounded depressed and listless.
 ''In the early days, he was always upbeat and telling us 'Don't worry, everything will work out O.K.,''' she said. ''But a month ago he was like, 'No matter what happens, take care of your mom.'''

HEADLINE: Many Signs Pointing Up, With Inflation Among Them

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices are climbing, industrial production is faltering and housing construction is rebounding, offering mixed signals about the economy.
 The latest batch of economic reports, released Tuesday, depicted ''an O.K. economy that is moving forward. It's not uniformly strong, but it is still sturdy,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a research group. 
 A Labor Department report showed the Producer Price Index, which measures the costs of goods before they reach store shelves, increased 0.6 percent in April, reflecting more expensive energy, cars and cigarettes. The increase in wholesale prices came on top of a 0.7 percent advance in March.
 The latest price figures bolstered economists' belief that the Federal Reserve will continue to push up short-term interest rates for much of this year in an effort to combat inflation.
 Excluding energy and food prices, which can swing widely from month to month, core wholesale prices increased by 0.3 percent in April. That was up from a 0.1 percent advance in March and represented the largest increase since January.
 ''Inflation is accelerating. It is not doing so rapidly, but the direction is clear,'' said Joel Naroff, the president of Naroff Economic Advisors.
 In another report, the Federal Reserve said that industrial production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities declined 0.2 percent in April, after nudging up 0.1 percent in March. April's decline was the largest since September.
 Production at factories in April was flat, especially restrained by cutbacks in automobile production.
 Economists attributed the manufacturing weakness to rising prices for energy and other goods, hurting demand for cars and other items, and to companies working off excess supplies.
 ''Manufacturers are pulling back on the production levers amid rising material prices and slumping orders,'' said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research.
 Housing construction, meanwhile, jumped 11 percent in April, after a 17.6 percent decline in March, the Commerce Department said. 
 The latest snapshot of inflation, however, surprised economists. Before the report was released, they were forecasting a 0.4 percent rise in overall wholesale prices and a 0.2 percent increase in core inflation.
 Wanting to make sure inflation does not become a problem, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates eight times -- each in quarter-point moves -- since last June, when the Fed's campaign to tighten credit began.
 Price increases in April covered a variety of categories. Rising energy costs, however, again led the way.
 Energy prices in April rose by 2.1 percent, after a 3.3 percent rise in March.
 Residential natural gas prices jumped 6.6 percent in April, the biggest increase since March 2003. Also in April, gasoline prices rose 2.6 percent from the previous month and liquefied petroleum gas, such as propane, rose 2 percent. Prices for residential electric power and home-heating oil, however, declined in April.
 The wholesale report also showed that cigarette prices went up 1.2 percent in April, passenger car prices rose 0.5 percent and prices for light motor trucks climbed 0.6 percent. Food prices nudged up 0.1 percent. Falling prices for dairy products and soft drinks helped to balance rising prices for roasted coffee, fresh fruits and meat.
 At the pump, the average price nationwide of regular gasoline was $2.16 a gallon last week, according to the Energy Department.

HEADLINE: Players From Over There Get a Shot Over Here

BYLINE: By CHARLIE NOBLES

 BODY:
Japan considers baseball its favorite sport, but the opportunity for a player to reach the professional level is extremely limited.
 There are about 4,000 high schools playing baseball in Japan and dozens of universities, but only 82 players were selected in the most recent annual professional draft, according to Kevin Outcalt, commissioner of the newly formed Golden Baseball League.
 ''It's such a limited system,'' Outcalt said. ''There's the major league team, and they all have one minor league team. There are industrial leagues, but they've fallen apart as the economic crunch in Japan has made companies rethink investing in baseball players as a promotional tool as opposed to investing in their core business. So there are a lot of highly skilled players coming out of the amateur leagues who have no place to go.'' 
 The eight-team Golden Baseball League supplies them with one more place to go. The Japan Samurai Bears will compete in the independent minor league based in Pleasanton, Calif. They will become the first all-Japanese team to play in an American league when the season opens May 26.
 In 1905, a team from Wasada University went on a lengthy West Coast tour, and the Yakult Swallows of the Japan Central League have trained in Arizona, but this will be the most a Japanese team has integrated into the American game. 
 The seven other G.B.L. teams include four in California -- Chico, Fullerton, Long Beach and San Diego, which has reached an agreement with Rickey Henderson to play this season -- and three in Arizona -- Yuma, Surprise and Mesa. The former major leaguers Garry Templeton and Terry Kennedy are among the managers.
 Warren Cromartie, the Bears' manager and a former major leaguer who became a Japanese icon in seven seasons there, describes the Bears as a ''farm system for Japanese ballplayers.''
 Cromartie, who has been doing radio work at WQAM in Miami in recent years, was the Central League's most valuable player in 1989 with the Yomiuri Giants, hitting a league-leading .378, and his gregarious nature helped his popularity spread. He became fluent in Japanese and knows the Japanese style of play. 
 He said that the Japanese players do not generally have as much power as American hitters, and not as much speed, but they are unselfish and play the game with an all-out zeal that makes them tough competitors. 
 ''It's intensity,'' Cromartie said. ''It's passion. They play it like it's a privilege to play the game, and it's an honor to wear the uniform. You won't see them slamming their helmets. You won't see them throwing their bats. I won't have to worry about personal issues and personal egos. There is a team emphasis across the board. We have a Samurai Bears code, and they understand it.'' 
 Cromartie, 51, jumped at this chance to be a manager for the first time. He said the players would range in age from 22 to 28.
 ''I don't have to worry about them hitting the cutoff,'' he said. ''I don't have to worry about them hustling. I don't have to worry about them catching the ball and giving me their all. It's just a matter of being able to get them to kick their game up another notch, be much smarter.''
 The Bears will play a 90-game regular season, but there is a catch. All of the games will be on the road. They will live out of hotels and buses. And they will have only two days off each month during the four-month regular season. 
 ''When I signed professionally and was sent to Quebec City and we had to take 14-hour bus trips to Reading, Pa., to play, I didn't have a problem with it,'' Cromartie said. ''Mainly it's because that is what I was getting paid to do. I was a professional. With the newness of this league and all the euphoria about being part of something that's never been done, I figure I can hang in there.''
 The G.B.L. owns all 8 clubs and hopes eventually to expand to 12 teams, with entries from China and Mexico. The league has one Japanese sponsor -- A-Wan Planning, which helps undrafted Japanese players find a place to play. Outcalt said he believes he can lure more foreign sponsorship by the time the Bears face the Surprise Fightin' Falcons in their opener. Pat Sajak, the ''Wheel of Fortune'' host and a part-owner, is expected to throw out the first pitch.
 League rosters are limited to 25 players, but Cromartie can be forgiven for carrying 5 extra players in case of injuries. After all, he said, ''I can't just call across the street and get another Japanese ballplayer.''

The consuming Senate slugfest over judges (vital as they are) proves how Washington remains determined to fiddle while our biggest problem burns: a broken health care system that threatens working families and national competitiveness. 
 President Bush -- who, with 51 percent of the vote, has set 100 percent of the agenda -- has taken a pass. And the terms of the debate remain surreal. After all, Margaret Thatcher would have been driven from office if she'd proposed anything as radically conservative as Bill Clinton's health plan, which would have left millions uncovered and had private doctors deliver the care. 
 Is there hope? Maybe. But only if America's chief executives exercise their ''nuclear option.''
 Here's the logic. Washington will offer zero leadership on health reform until 2009. The only way we'll get serious then is if the campaign in 2008 centers on health. The only way that will happen is if groundwork is laid in advance. And the only way this groundwork will get traction is if America's C.E.O.'s make it their mission. 
 Various groups (including one I'm paid to advise) have tried, without much luck, to energize this debate. C.E.O.'s are the one group with the incentive and the clout to take it on.
 So what should the chief executives do? Even if we don't have presidential leadership now, we desperately need the ''presidential perspective.'' By this I mean a view of our challenges that doesn't reflect the narrow agenda of business or labor, or the medical-industrial complex. Instead, we need a ''big picture'' framework, a way to engage the press and the public in the right strategic goals. 
 Here's my version of the script: A dozen marquee C.E.O.'s would convene a ''Manhattan Project''-style effort on the future of health care. They'd propose a new goal: instead of health costs rising from today's 15 percent of G.D.P. to 20 percent by around 2020, as is now projected, the nation should shave two to three percentage points of G.D.P. (or more) off projected growth in ways that improve quality, even as we extend coverage to the 45 million uninsured.
 Our chief executives would explain that this is doable because today's system costs too much and delivers too little. 
 (Quick review: We spend 15 percent of G.D.P. on health. Other rich nations spend 10 percent or less, but they manage to insure everyone -- and have equal or better public health outcomes. And we have huge variations in practice patterns and medical spending that bear no relation to quality. Bottom line: radical inefficiency.)
 Our C.E.O.'s would add that a new health strategy would get excess costs off businesses' backs -- costs that competitors don't face in countries where governments pick up the tab. It would re-engineer the delivery of care so governments would have cash left for other purposes. And it would cope with the political reality that every dollar of health care ''waste'' is somebody's dollar of income. 
 The group would issue a report in late 2007 with a full-blown agenda for the next president. Done right, the ''Jones'' Report (aspiring C.E.O. statesmen or stateswomen, picture your name here!) would become the touchstone for all health care talk in the campaign. 
 Now my rules for participation: First, only chief executives prepared to invest real time need apply. This shouldn't be a bar; health costs now loom so large that C.E.O.'s are destined to focus on the problem. They can't fix it alone, so they may as well fix it for everyone. (As a lure, we might enact a 100 percent short-term capital gains tax on their stocks during the life of the group to banish speculators and free the chiefs to think long-term.)
 Next, eligible C.E.O.'s have to grasp that most rhetoric in the health debate -- as exemplified by the Thatcher example above -- is rubbish. Republican C.E.O.'s who think ''big government'' is always the problem may be at special psychic risk.
 Critics may shout: Why should we want some lavishly paid bosses to take the lead? Well, for starters, as the Clinton debacle proved, if business doesn't buy in, nothing that matters here can change. But beyond this, spiraling health costs have aligned corporate interests with workers' for the first time in ages. My hunch is that inside many car and computer and bank and energy moguls, tomorrow's political heroes are dying to get out. 
 Ordinarily a bold call for a commission is a way to punt, but given today's leadership vacuum, it's a way to start. I'm not saying that this will end with C.E.O.'s marching on Washington to demand ''Margaret Thatcher-style universal health coverage.'' But I wouldn't rule it out either.

HEADLINE: Old Pills Finding New Medicine Cabinets

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
As the cost of prescription drugs climbs, more of the nation's officials and consumers are weighing how to salvage at least $1 billion worth of unused drugs that are being flushed down the toilet each year.
 Though the Food and Drug Administration generally forbids the redistribution of prescription drugs once they are dispensed to consumers, states are free to set their own policies for drugs controlled by nursing homes, long-term-care centers and other pharmacies.
 ''They seem content to let the states be laboratories, and that works out rather well because the dollars the states are saving are in a lot of cases federal dollars,'' said James Cooley, chief of staff for Diane Delisi, a Texas state representative and the author of legislation to expand Texas's limited drug recovery program, which may pass within a week.
 Several states, including Oklahoma, Louisiana and Ohio, have passed legislation in the last few years allowing unused drugs to be recovered from those organizations for distribution primarily to poor patients. 
 Nebraska even permits consumers to return unused drugs if they are in tamper-resistant packaging, like the blister package most familiar in over-the-counter medicines, skirting the F.D.A. prohibition. 
 Recovery has been modest, but California, Maine, Washington and other states are pondering similar programs in hopes of lowering health care costs, however marginally. 
 Other supporters are trying to push the idea further. An inventor in Massachusetts is seeking a patent on a system that would knit together existing technologies to address the myriad issues of drug redistribution. 
 ''We recycle newspapers, we recycle soda cans, we recycle plastic,'' said Moshe Alamaro, the inventor, who is a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's ludicrous not to recycle expensive drugs.'' 
 Mr. Alamaro added, ''It should be criminal to throw these drugs away, and instead it's required.''
 The concept has more skeptics than believers. The hurdles include concerns about patient safety and privacy, the lack of an infrastructure to process and redistribute drugs, and administrative requirements. 
 ''I don't want to sound overly negative, but there are lots of obstacles,'' said Susan McCann, administrator of the Missouri Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which is struggling to begin the state's redistribution program.
 To sidestep the questions of recycling, Representative Tim Murphy, a Republican who represents Pennsylvania in Congress, suggests that the federal government take a different tack and make it easier for doctors to prescribe small quantities of drugs initially to determine whether a patient can use them. 
 Monthly or longer prescriptions, now encouraged and sometimes mandated by states and insurers to hold down costs, lead to waste that could be curbed through redistribution.
 The amounts discarded are unknown. Though many states require nursing homes, hospitals and consumers to follow specified procedures for drug disposal, the rules add costs and are largely ignored, state health officials and others say.
 A study published in the Journal of Family Medicine in 2001 estimated that $1 billion a year in drugs prescribed to the elderly are thrown away, and Mr. Alamaro estimates that a more ambitious system for drug recycling could recapture 5 percent of the nation's prescriptions, or about $6 billion worth annually.
 Existing programs are a long way from that, however. The prevailing method of dispensing prescription medicine in bottles leaves it too vulnerable to tampering and contamination for any chance of recovery.
 Pharmacies, the most likely candidates for redistribution, have little incentive to take on the administrative burdens and potential liabilities.
 And states have not committed to developing the databases and other systems that would be needed, much less wrestled with how to ensure adequate supplies of drugs for patients to continue a regimen.
 ''It doesn't matter how safe the drugs are, how many of them there are or how neat and crisp the records are, if there isn't a database to tell patients what's available and where it is,'' Ms. McCann said.
 So far, only one clinic has expressed interest in participating in the Missouri program. Ohio has failed to get its program off the ground more than two years after it was approved by the legislature because of a lack of interest among nursing homes. 
 Among the handful of states pressing ahead, Louisiana is one of the most advanced, with 12 pharmacies that distribute unused prescription drugs. Expired drugs and controlled substances, those that are potentially dangerous, are not accepted. As in other states, the drugs are collected from nursing homes and assisted-living centers, which have a carefully controlled storage and distribution system and use blister packaging.
 ''We know those drugs are perfectly good,'' said William T. Winsley, executive director of the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy. ''They've been under lock and key; they've been stored properly.''
 Nonetheless, concerns about safety and hygiene have dogged the Louisiana program, said Malcolm J. Broussard, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy. ''We run across the thought that these are secondhand drugs, and 'don't poor people deserve the same drugs as anyone else?''' he said. 
 Getting nursing homes to hand over unused drugs has also been a challenge. 
 ''For years, they've been under the impression that they had to waste these medicines,'' Mr. Broussard said. 
 Louisiana's program intends to retrieve several million dollars' worth of medicines each year, Mr. Broussard said, though it is too early to gauge results.
 The recovery and redistribution of unused medicines is handled by charity pharmacies that cater to the working poor, thus avoiding thorny questions of who gets reimbursed for returned medicines and how. Should a patient get back part of the co-payment, for example?
 ''You need to reimburse the state or insurer or individual who paid for the drug, and there's a big hassle in that paperwork,'' said Gay Dodson, executive director of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy. 
 Mr. Alamaro is convinced that many problems can be resolved with technology, greatly expanding the pool of retrievable medicines.
 He and his partners want access to the shelved drugs in the medicine chests of consumers like Florence Weisfeld of New York. Mrs. Weisfeld, 80, a former social worker, ached and had flulike symptoms when she took Lipitor, the cholesterol-reducing medication. So her doctor changed her prescription.
 ''I had 25 Lipitor tablets left in my medicine chest, and all I could do with them was flush them down the toilet,'' Mrs. Weisfeld said. ''Such a waste.''
 Recycling Mrs. Weisfeld's Lipitor would require sweeping changes in the way drugs are dispensed. Mr. Alamaro's plan contemplates replacing bottles of pills with blister packaging or something like a high-tech Pez dispenser.
 Such packaging could be encoded with information about the drug and who paid for it. That data would then be used to determine the drug's integrity and reimbursement, which Mr. Alamaro envisions as a system of credits. For instance, a consumer returning a drug to a pharmacy would receive a credit toward a future co-payment. 
 Patients could return drugs by mail to a reprocessing center or deposit them in a secure box at a pharmacy, which would then forward them to an inspection center.
 His own partners are the first to point out the challenges. ''I'm optimistic about the technology; I'm not optimistic about the economics at present,'' said Mark G. Hodges, an environmental consultant who is working with Mr. Alamaro.
 The states that are trying drug redistribution have found novel ways to overcome some of the problems. For instance, Oklahoma drafted a corps of retired doctors to ferry drugs between donors and two participating county pharmacies.
 ''There are always all kinds of reasons not to do things,'' said Paul Patton, executive director of the Tulsa County Medical Society, the doctors' group that led Oklahoma's efforts on drug recycling. ''But this makes so much sense that we've been able to convince a lot of people that it's better to have this program and work to resolve the issues than to not have it at all.''
 Proponents of drug recovery programs say the real test will come in California, where the Senate is considering a bill to establish a drug recycling program that was first advocated by five first-year medical students at Stanford University.
 ''Throwing away valuable resources when there is already not enough to go around is cavalier and unfeeling, not to mention poor public policy,'' said Josemaria Paterno, one of the medical students.
 The Stanford students estimate that a program to recover drugs from nursing homes and long-term-care facilities would save the state $50 million to $100 million a year.

HEADLINE: 'Star Wars' On Track For Record Opening

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 17 

 BODY:
With ''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' opening nationwide just after 12 a.m. Thursday, and around the world in the course of a few days, the data streaming in to 20th Century Fox executives were nearly off the charts.
 The AMC Empire 25 movie theater on 42nd Street in Manhattan was already sold out of tickets for the 12:01, 12:30, 12:50, 1:10 and 1:45 a.m. shows.
 Across New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, Seattle and San Francisco, multiplexes were adding middle-of-the-night screenings as fast as they were running out of seats.
 Bruce Snyder, the studio's president of distribution, sounded giddy as he rattled off a list of national theater chains and their percentages of seats sold out nationwide for the movie's midnight start times: 
 ''As of Sunday, AMC theaters was at 75 percent,'' he said. ''Century -- 85 percent. Regal -- 83 percent. Loews -- 77 percent.'' 
 He went on, before adding: ''I'm doing this a long time. I can never remember anything like this, four days out for a midnight show on a Wednesday night. It's not exactly summertime.''
 But summer, it seemed, was starting a few weeks early, and not a moment too soon.
 The film industry has limped along through a blockbuster-free spring, with only ''Hitch,'' a romantic comedy that opened a few days before Valentine's Day, breaking $40 million in its opening weekend.
 Over all, box office receipts are down 8 percent for the year to date from the same period in 2004, and weekend grosses have been lower than last year's for 12 straight weeks. Even setting aside last year, when ''The Passion of the Christ'' opened in late February, nationwide attendance at movies this year is 7 percent lower than in 2003, according to Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box office results.
 While LucasFilm stands to reap the vast majority of the rewards if ''Revenge of the Sith'' proves to be a blockbuster, and Fox will receive a relatively low fee for distributing it to theaters, competitors were cheering from the sidelines this week.
 ''The movie business is contagious,'' said Tom Sherak, a partner at Revolution Studios. ''Meaning, if you go see a movie you like, chances are you'll continue to go to the movies. It turns on the industry. When we fall into a slump, it's because the movies that are out don't have good word of mouth. And there haven't been that many movies that have great word of mouth in the last month or so.''
 In a business that loves touting its records, ''Episode III, '' the sixth in a 28-year cycle of ''Star Wars'' pictures, appears to have a serious shot at displacing Sony Pictures' ''Spider-Man'' as the best-opening film in history. ''Spider-Man'' took in $114.8 million in three days when it opened in May 2002, setting a widely discussed weekend record and eventually grossing $403.7 million at the domestic box office, short of the $601 million take of the top-grossing ''Titanic'' in 1997. The weekend record does not account for ticket-price inflation or the vagaries of data from eras that produced blockbusters like ''Gone With the Wind'' or ''The Sound of Music.''
 Mr. Snyder, at Fox, was feeling the weight of history and expectations on Tuesday. ''Everybody is kind of laying the ills of the industry on this movie,'' he lamented.
 ''I do think it's a big burden to put on the shoulders of one movie,'' he said. ''But if there is such a movie that can handle it, this is it.''
 Indeed, the two major online ticket companies, Fandango and Movietickets.com, both said they were on pace to break their records for advance sales, set by ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,'' in 2003. That film took $72.6 million on its opening weekend and went on to top $377 million in ticket sales at the domestic box office.
 ''We're selling two tickets per second, and we expect that rate to quadruple by week's end,'' said Harry Medved, a spokesman for Fandango, which says it covers 70 percent of the nation's theaters with online sales. ''We anticipate we'll sell three million tickets for 'Sith''' -- compared with two million for the third ''Rings'' film, he said.
 At Movietickets.com, meanwhile, a spokesman said the new ''Star Wars'' film accounted for 98 percent of all tickets sold on Monday.
 ''Revenge of the Sith'' was on pace to sell more than five million tickets online, a box office head start of roughly $50 million.
 The ''Star Wars'' finale has the field to itself this weekend, with no new releases until DreamWorks Animation's ''Madagascar'' and Paramount's ''Longest Yard'' open on May 27. And rival studios were estimating that it could score a four-day weekend box office total of $120 million to $150 million or more, although some doubters said that opening a day early might bite into weekend sales, possibly leaving the ''Spider-Man'' record intact.
 ''Everyone here thinks that if they didn't open Thursday, they probably could've beaten 'Spider-Man,''' said a Sony executive, who insisted on anonymity because of a company rule against commenting on competitors' films. ''That may have let the air out of their tires a little bit.''
 About the only other things cutting against the ''Star Wars'' finale were its long running time, 142 minutes, and a bit of a backlash. That was mainly on conservative Web sites, which were reacting to the film's political jabs at President Bush and the war in Iraq, as when Anakin Skywalker, turning to the dark side, warns that ''if you're not with me, you're my enemy.''
 But executives at LucasFilm and Fox said they were unconcerned.
 ''Nobody cares,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''Is it pro-Republican? Is it pro-Democrat? Nobody cares. It's entertainment.''

HEADLINE: Fast or Slow, Johnny Still Can't Write

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As Brent Staples writes, the new economy demands ''fluent writers.'' It is vital that we teachers teach our students that writing is woven into all content areas in school and beyond. 
 While some are opposed to measuring student writing on a timed SAT segment for fear of quantifying a process, I prefer to consider essay writing a critical strategy that we can offer students to prepare them to succeed in the workplace. 
 Teachers must give students specific tools that will encourage them to explore the craft of writing and to become critical thinkers by shaping words on paper.
 Writing is both a process and a product. The challenge of any author is to determine the needs of particular audiences in order to structure written pieces accordingly and fast.

HEADLINE: When to Use The Filibuster

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''At Center of Senate Showdown, a Boxer Takes On a Surgeon'' (front page, May 15):
 Liberals used to hate the filibuster; at the moment, they love it.
 Conservatives used to employ the filibuster; now they reject it.
 Is there any way to resolve this intellectual quandary and political impasse? Yes, the test of reversibility. 
 When legislators debate controversial social or economic legislation, a filibuster is unwarranted because bad laws in those domains can be repealed.
 When they vote on judges with lifetime tenure or pass bills that restrict civil liberties, however, the errors may well be irreversible; hence, lengthy debate and delaying tactics can be a crucial safeguard. 
 The implication for today? The nomination of John R. Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations should not be filibustered because the error can be remedied: he can be dismissed.
 But dubious judicial nominations can and must be filibustered, because such errors and excesses will indeed be irreversible.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Modest Growth

BYLINE: By Elisabeth Malkin (NYT)

 BODY:
Mexico's gross domestic product grew 2.4 percent in the first quarter, the finance ministry said, attributing the modest figure to the Easter holiday, which came in March this year. In addition, Mexican industry was hurt by slower economic growth in the United States, damping demand for Mexican manufactured exports, particularly autos and auto parts. Adjusting for the holiday, Mexico's economy expanded 3.8 percent, the finance ministry said. The report indicated a slowdown from the 4.9 percent growth registered in the fourth quarter of 2004.

HEADLINE: Foreign Gas Companies in Bolivia Face Sharply Higher Taxes

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, May 17 

 BODY:
President Carlos Mesa's government allowed passage of a bill on Tuesday that will sharply raise taxes on foreign energy companies, a move officials hope will defuse mounting protests from groups that want Bolivia to squeeze the big multinationals that have flocked to this poor country.
 But the decision by Mr. Mesa, who has bowed repeatedly to demands from protesters in his 19-month term, appeared to placate few. Foreign oil companies say the law is financially onerous and will prompt them to cut back on investments, and the influential Movement to Socialism Party, led by Evo Morales, has promised more protests, contending the law is too soft on the companies. 
 Thousands of Indians and miners continued to march from several communities in the highlands toward the capital, some of their leaders promising to take over Congress unless a tougher law is approved.
 ''We are going to fight against this law,'' Dionisio Nunez, a congressman with Movement to Socialism, said outside Congress. ''The marches have to continue because in Congress, not all the senators and deputies defend the people. Sometimes they defend the multinationals.''
 By permitting a deadline to pass requiring him to approve or reject the law, Mr. Mesa turned the legislation back to Congress, where the senate president, Hormando Vaca Diez, signed it late Tuesday afternoon. 
 Mr. Mesa's decision surprised the country because after Congress approved the law on May 5, the government said it would be economically disastrous for Bolivia, which is heavily dependent on foreign investment. The law adds a 32 percent tax to an 18 percent royalty that is already in effect, and requires energy companies to sign new contracts with the government.
 Mr. Mesa, a historian and former journalist who took office after President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada was toppled by protesters angry at his energy policies, offered little explanation for his decision, telling Bolivians in a televised speech that ''there was no possibility that I would sign'' the law. 
 His chief of staff, Jose Galindo, told reporters that the president wanted to respect the will of Congress. ''Respecting that will, the president's decision is that this law is automatically approved,'' Mr. Galindo said.
 In March, after Mr. Mesa threatened to resign in the face of protests, he pledged to push a ''reasonable and acceptable'' energy bill that offered ''good conditions for Bolivia and for the international community.'' But with little support in Congress, and a range of groups promising to stage more protests, Mr. Mesa bowed once more to the will of the streets.
 The decision immediately put in danger $3.5 billion invested in Bolivia since the late 1990's by Petrobras of Brazil, British Gas, Repsol of Spain and Total of France -- all of them lured here by Latin America's second-largest natural gas deposits.
 With Bolivia gripped by five years of antiglobalization protests, the initial promise has waned and oil and gas investments have fallen precipitously, to less than $200 million last year from $608 million in 1998. Big plans, like a project to export natural gas from landlocked Bolivia to the United States via a pipeline to the Chilean coast, are dead.
 Companies ''have found gas reserves but have not had the conditions to even think of developing them,'' said Carlos Alberto Lopez, a former vice minister for energy who now consults for energy firms. ''It is difficult to see how this sector will grow and develop.''
 The president of Repsol in Bolivia, Julio Gavito, recently told the newspaper La Razon that the new legislation would ''force us to abandon many gas fields.''
 But many indigenous and labor groups want the government to go further, expropriating the companies' assets without compensation. They believe multinationals have been plundering Bolivia's riches for years and now they want payback.
 ''We say yes to nationalization of the hydrocarbons,'' said Julio Pabon, a leader of Fejuve, a leading antiglobalization group in the region.

HEADLINE: A Fast-Growing Independent Strikes Gold in Oil Refining

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO 

 BODY:
It is impossible not to notice the eight-foot bear in William E. Greehey's office. 
 The story of how the stuffed grizzly ended up here says as much about Mr. Greehey's hunting trip in British Columbia in 1982 as it does about his attitude as chief executive of Valero Energy: aggressive, risk-prone and endowed with self-confidence -- or, his critics say, an oversize ego.
 Those are the same traits that helped him turn Valero from an obscure gas pipeline business into the nation's top independent oil refiner. Valero, based in San Antonio, is leading a pack of refiners that are staking their future on the notion that tight refining capacity, growing demand for gasoline and high profit margins will last. 
 On the other side of the argument are the major oil companies, which have been selling their refineries in the belief that profits and margins may soon reach a peak in a notably volatile and cyclical business. The debate is being played out as retail gasoline prices are near the highest level in recent years.
 ''Anybody who has been in this business for a long time knows it has been lousy and they haven't made as much money as in exploration,'' said Malcolm M. Turner, president of Turner, Mason & Company, an industry consultant in Dallas. ''But Greehey has been a bull for five years on refining, and now he's turned into a raging bull.''
 Last month, Mr. Greehey -- widely known as Bill -- took his biggest gamble yet when he announced a $6.9 billion offer for Premcor, a smaller Connecticut-based rival, that would propel his company ahead of Exxon Mobil as the top refiner in the United States.
 For more than two decades, oil companies in the United States have been reluctant to pour money into refining, where they have had to contend with a surplus of capacity, relatively low profits and rising costs for producing cleaner fuels. Domestic refining capacity shrank about 10 percent from 1981 through 2004 even as demand soared 45 percent.
 But Valero has bucked the industry trend. The planned acquisition of Premcor is the latest in a series of leaps that have transformed the company since it sold its natural gas operation in 1997. Since then, it has spent $8 billion in acquisitions, growing from a single refinery in Corpus Christi, Tex., into a Fortune 500 company with plants in the United States, Canada and Aruba and control of 15 percent of America's refining capacity.
 Premcor would add 4 refineries to Valero's 15, lifting capacity by one-quarter, to 3.3 million barrels a day, or about 20 percent of domestic capacity. The purchase would also increase Valero's ability to process the more viscous, but cheaper, oil from South America and the Middle East. 
 ''We're going through a perfect storm in refining,'' Mr. Greehey said. ''But everybody continues to have such a negative perception of refining. To me, it's just unbelievable because the fundamentals have changed.''
 Not everyone sees the situation that way. The major oil companies -- which have exploration and production as well as refining businesses -- have been much more cautious about the long-term prospects for refining. Early this year, for example, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group sold a refinery in California.
 In February, Edward G. Galante, Exxon Mobil's senior vice president for refining, questioned that sector's prospects when he told a gathering of oil executives in Houston: ''Some say we have entered a 'golden age of refining.' Of those, I ask, how long is an age? And remember, those of us with upstream businesses tend to think in geological terms.''
 He added, ''With all due respect to the incurably upbeat among us, I don't know how long today's strong margins will persist.''
 At the moment, profit margins are at their highest. Last year, Valero's revenue rose to nearly $55 billion, up 44 percent from the previous year, with net income tripling to $1.8 billion -- more than Exxon Mobil earned from its refining business in the United States. Still, Exxon remains a far bigger refiner than Valero when considering its plants around the world. Exxon Mobil last year had revenue of $298 billion and net profit of $25 billion.
 Valero's share price is up 38.5 percent since the beginning of the year, making it the best performer in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and giving the company a market value of more than $16 billion. That compares with a 5 percent increase in Exxon Mobil shares, and a 3.1 percent decline in the S.&P. 500 index.
 Valero benefits from its refineries' ability to convert dirty, heavy oil that has high sulfur content into lighter, cleaner and more profitable gasoline. The company has invested heavily in such conversion capacity because, it says, most of the world's remaining oil reserves, like those in Saudi Arabia, are medium to heavy grades while lighter oil, like that from the North Sea, is declining.
 Maya crude from Mexico, for example, sells for $16 to $18 a barrel less than West Texas intermediate, the light, sweet grade that is used as a benchmark on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Most of Valero's refining capacity can process the heavier grades, which are on average $1.50 a barrel more expensive to refine, the company said.
 At the same time, the refiner's margin, or the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices, is at its highest in decades. This year, it is $11 a barrel on the East Coast, twice the five-year historic average, according to John S. Herold Inc., an oil consultant. This means that Valero can both buy cheaper oil than some of its rivals and sell gasoline at high prices. 
 Whether those advantages can continue may determine whether Valero can complete the Premcor acquisition smoothly and whether the company can continue to expand, either in the United States or in Europe. 
 Hours after the Premcor announcement was made on April 25, Standard & Poor's downgraded Valero's credit by one rung to BBB-, the lowest investment grade. The ratings agency also placed Valero on negative watch, meaning that its bonds might be lowered further to junk status. That would increase Valero's financing costs and the price it pays for Premcor.
 John Thieroff, a credit analyst at S.&P. in New York, pointed to Valero's growing debt. The company expects to issue $1.4 billion in new debt for the acquisition, which comes on top of existing debt of $4.3 billion and the $1.8 billion it is assuming from Premcor.
 ''A lot of people accept the company's premise that wider margins are here to stay,'' Mr. Thieroff said. ''We can't accept these assumptions blindly. Refining is a very volatile industry. What happens if the economy hits a soft patch? We don't look at how good can the upside be, but rather how bad can the downside be.''
 Few such doubts inhibit Mr. Greehey, a 68-year-old native of Fort Dodge, Iowa, who bears a resemblance to Karl Malden in ''The Streets of San Francisco'' and enjoys standing behind the grill at company barbecues. 
 ''We took advantage of getting in at the bottom and riding the crest,'' he said. ''And I don't think we're there yet. It's going to get better next year. We're going to grow our business very aggressively.''
 Valero was a late starter in the refining business. Mr. Greehey joined it in 1974 as a court-appointed chief executive after the company, then known as LoVaca Gathering, stopped supplying natural gas to customers in Texas when energy prices spiked and it could no longer honor its contracts. After six years of litigation and a $1.6 billion settlement, the business was spun off from its parent, the Coastal States Gas Corporation, and established as a pipeline operator. Coastal States, founded by Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., a Texas oilman and entrepreneur, has recently been named in Iraqi documents as paying surcharges for oil to Saddam Hussein's government. The company has denied the accusations. 
 Seeking to set some distance with the company's difficult past, Mr. Greehey, who majored in accounting at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, moved his new headquarters here from Houston and renamed the business Valero after the 18th-century San Antonio de Valero Franciscan mission, the original site of the Alamo.
 In 1997, the company decided to focus solely on refining and sold most of its other businesses. Starting from the one refinery in Corpus Christi, it snapped up underperforming plants around the nation and fit them to process heavy-grade oil. 
 ''I started working for Exxon and I used to think of Exxon as a refining company,'' Mr. Greehey said. ''I never thought anyone would ever be bigger than Exxon.'' 
 Then, returning to the bear-hunting experience, he said, ''If my gun had jammed, the bear would have eaten me up. But I think I could have outrun him.''

HEADLINE: The Mayor Opens His TV Ad Campaign Speaking Spanish

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday unleashed the first wave of what promises to be one of the biggest and most expensive political advertising campaigns in New York City history. The first two commercials suggest the dominant themes for his re-election campaign: the safety of New York City, its recovery from the 9/11 attacks and his efforts to improve the city schools. 
 In an unusually early start for a New York mayoral campaign, the first batch of television ads showed the mayor using his newly learned Spanish to appeal to Hispanic voters, a traditional base of Fernando Ferrer, the Democrat whom Bloomberg campaign aides expect the mayor to face in the fall. Mr. Ferrer is of Puerto Rican descent. 
 Those ads are to be followed today by English-language commercials that seek to portray the city's recovery from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack under the mayor's leadership.
 Taken together, the ads underscore the personal buying power of Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has indicated that he is willing to spend whatever it takes to win re-election
 The more than $1 million Mr. Bloomberg spent for his first 10 days of advertisements exceeds the combined spending by his four chief Democratic opponents in the last two months, and Democrats say they expect it to be just the beginning of an advertising barrage. The amount is also nearly a fifth of what the city's campaign finance laws allow his challengers to spend on all campaign activities between now and Primary Day, Sept. 13. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, is not accepting public matching funds and therefore faces no spending limits, and his advertisements are as carefully produced as any from last year's presidential campaigns. Unlike many of those ads, they are relentlessly positive in their tone, with messages reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's ''Morning in America'' campaign in 1984, which stressed the nation's return from the economic brink.
 In one of Mr. Bloomberg's ads, an announcer says in Spanish, ''In the last four years we have come a long way through high winds and rough seas,'' a reference to the aftermath of 9/11. Mr. Bloomberg, who has studied Spanish for a few years, then says into the camera, ''Porque somos Neoyorquinos'' (''because we are New Yorkers'') before the announcer goes on to say, again in Spanish, ''Today we are experiencing an economic renaissance in all five boroughs, and New York is considered one of the safest cities in the country.''
 Both ads -- one 30 seconds, the other 60 -- are replete with images of construction sites, the city's skyline, Mr. Bloomberg mingling with students and their parents, police officers walking the beat or, in one shot, arresting a man (a shot that features two white wrists being handcuffed).
 People who have seen the spots that are to appear on major English-language television stations today said they would more directly address the recovery from Sept. 11, with help from two former mayors, Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani, and from other New Yorkers. 
 The spots, those people said, seek to tell the story about the state of the city now as compared to when Mr. Bloomberg took office, when smoke was still rising from ground zero.
 The ads point to the city's recovery, as well as promote the sort of meat-and-potato issues that Mr. Bloomberg's aides believe are most attractive to voters this year: his efforts to overhaul the schools, the city's job growth, and the continued drop in crime. 
 ''It's the beginning of a telling of a story, a good story,'' said William T. Cunningham, a senior adviser to the mayor's campaign. ''It's fact-based, it's based on everything that New York has come through over the last three and a half years, and it's time to put it out there. Let the voters see the rationale for the mayor's re-election.''
 The mayor's political aides have long stated a goal of promoting his record in ways that leave his opponents with little to run on. Even though recent polls by Quinnipiac University and Marist College showed Mr. Bloomberg pulling ahead of the Democratic field, they also show him with an approval rating below 50 percent, a danger zone for any incumbent, let alone a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. 
 By advertising now, Mr. Bloomberg is putting his record in the best possible light months before his Democratic opponents are likely to advertise in any substantial way. That huge advantage may be somewhat dampened by anti-stadium advertisements that question his priorities when the city has other needs.
 Democrats tried to build on that theme yesterday, arguing that his high spending on the advertisements was offensive and that the city economy was not quite as rosy as depicted in the spots shown yesterday, especially among black and Hispanic residents. 
 ''Bad policies are bad policies in any language, and Mike Bloomberg's policies are indefensible no matter how many millions of dollars he spends,'' Mr. Ferrer said in a statement.
 Joseph Mercurio, an adviser to the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, the only black candidate in the Democratic field, said that when it came to boasts about job growth, ''black and Hispanic voters say 'not in our neighborhood' -- they don't see it.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's decision to aim his first ads at Hispanics seemed to take Democrats by surprise yesterday because it is a segment of the electorate that is expected to go fairly solidly to Mr. Ferrer if he becomes the Democratic nominee.
 But Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who has worked with several of the members of Mr. Bloomberg's team, defended the move. 
 ''He made a calculated decision to talk to Hispanics with two objectives,'' he said. ''One, to pick up votes because he needs them, and two, to make everyone understand that he speaks to all New Yorkers. Therefore, he's really not the out-of-touch person that the polling data portrays him as.''

HEADLINE: What to Do About a Country That Has a Nuclear Threat and No Use for Rules

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

Rogue Regime
Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea
By Jasper Becker
Illustrated. 300 pages. Oxford University Press. $28.
 ''Rogue Regime'' begins, appropriately enough, with a nightmare. Dozens of American stealth bombers fly over North Korea and bomb the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, the half-finished nuclear reactor at Taechong and chemical factories across the country. By striking quickly and accurately, United States commanders hope to neutralize a Korean nuclear counterattack, but if it should come, a submarine lurking offshore in the Yellow Sea will respond instantly with a barrage of nuclear-tipped missiles. 
 The catalyst for this fictional doomsday sequence is North Korea's decision to test a nuclear weapon, an event that may take place very shortly in the real, nonfictional world. This month, satellite photographs examined by White House and Pentagon officials seemed to suggest that North Korea was preparing to stage its first nuclear test. Not long after, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that North Korea had probably already assembled a half-dozen nuclear weapons. 
 In other words, Jasper Becker, a veteran foreign correspondent and the author of ''Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine,'' has come up with a very timely book.
 ''Rogue Regime'' is not for the faint-hearted. Mr. Becker takes an unblinking look at a dark regime that has made North Korea an international pariah, has elevated its rulers to the status of gods, and through torture and indoctrination reduced its subjects to virtual slaves, three million of whom, according to some estimates, perished during famines in the late 1980's. Mr. Becker puts it harshly: ''North Korea can best be compared to a large concentration camp in which the guards and their Gestapo officers are able to live as before but the inmates are slowly being worked to death.'' 
 His arguments might carry more weight if ''Rogue State'' were not such a slapdash production. It shows every sign of having been thrown together in haste, with a rash of dropped words and verbs that do not agree with their subjects. The same facts, arguments and anecdotes make multiple appearances. But if the history feels thin, the journalism is compelling.
 The facts almost defy belief. Years of malnutrition have produced a stunted people. The average North Korean is nearly eight inches shorter than his South Korean counterpart and weighs half as much. Under Kim Jong Il, the son of North Korea's first Communist leader, Kim Il Sung, the country's political prisons and re-education camps have multiplied, and now they contain as many as 300,000 prisoners, some arrested for crimes as petty as singing a South Korean pop song. Mr. Becker estimates that a million or more may have died in these camps under the two Kims. 
 In a country with a population of about 22 million, the security ministries employ 300,000 full-time officers who enforce discipline on a citizenry grouped, by loyalty, into three classes (core, wavering and hostile) and about 50 subclasses. Food rations, housing and other privileges are doled out according to class rank. What little wealth the economy produces goes straight to the leadership and the military. When famine struck in the late 1980's, ordinary North Koreans were urged to make noodles out of bark, seaweed and corncobs. Meanwhile, Kim Jong Il, ''possibly the last fat man left in his country,'' enjoyed his 100 limousines and multiple palaces, staffed by 2,000 doctors, nurses, cooks, dancing troupes and other essential personnel. 
 From its inception, North Korea has presented, to put it mildly, a diplomatic challenge. The Kim dynasty, whose paranoid, ultranationalist outlook is backed by an enormous military machine, has held fast to the principles that Korea must be reunited and ruled by the North, and that no foreigner will ever dictate terms. 
 In his later chapters, Mr. Becker goes over the recent history of diplomatic initiatives, and finds a common theme. Again and again, North Korea has encouraged overtures by hostile powers, either by implying that it might behave less aggressively and liberalize its economy, or by playing the military card, as it is doing now. After securing loans, food or industrial investment, it has pocketed its gains and reneged on its agreements.
 Often, the North Koreans have redefined the word chutzpah, brazenly violating agreements and then demanding payment to desist. In August 1998, when American intelligence discovered that a large underground facility, capable of housing a nuclear reactor or reprocessing plant, was being built at Kumchangri, officials demanded an inspection, as called for under a 1994 agreement known as the Agreed Framework. The North Koreans agreed only after being promised 600,000 tons of food aid. 
 Mr. Becker has nothing but contempt for the so-called Sunshine Policy pursued by Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, which urged a nonaggressive, open-handed approach to North Korea, holding out the carrot of investment that would lead to the creation of export-oriented industries, which in turn would bring about deeper social and political change. One of the more bizarre results of this policy was the auto factory built in Nampo by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. North Korea simply took delivery of the first 7,000 cars and never paid for them. The factory closed soon after. 
 Diplomats have scurried back and forth between constructive engagement, often indistinguishable from bribery, and punishment that would isolate the regime. As Mr. Becker points out, their task has been complicated by their inability to fathom the man they are dealing with, Kim Jong Il, who is, as described by Mr. Becker, either evil but rational, evil and irrational, or a closet reformer struggling to break loose from the control of hard-liners.
 Mr. Becker votes for a blend of the first two, which means that right now North Korea is, once again, bluffing, or is not, and is prepared to let fly with nuclear missiles if cornered. This is not consoling. Mr. Becker also argues for giving up on the United Nations as a means of bringing North Korea back within the international fold, and instead creating, along lines proposed by Tony Blair, ''a new framework in international law'' to deal with rogue states and ''a method to enforce these laws through the legitimate use of military force.'' 
 That's the plan. Let's see if Kim Jong Il goes along.

HEADLINE: Europeans Schedule New Talks With Iran on Its Nuclear Plans

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The leading foreign ministers of Europe have set another round of talks with Iran for early next week, most likely in Paris, amid growing hopes that they can put off a confrontation over Iran's suspected nuclear program until elections next month, European diplomats said Tuesday.
 The diplomats, speaking anonymously because of the extreme sensitivity of their talks, said that if the talks could proceed in the next month, then it was possible that the victors in the elections might eventually be willing to accept political and economic incentives in exchange for abandoning the nuclear program.
 The plan to keep the talks going until the elections had long been the objective, but it was in danger of unraveling earlier in the month, when Iran declared at the United Nations that it would resume nuclear activities, then appeared to back away from that threat.
 The erratic state of talks with Tehran was a focus of a meeting on Tuesday evening between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, American and British officials said. Also discussed, they said, was how to respond if the talks were to collapse abruptly. 
 Ms. Rice said afterward, as she has before, that Iran must negotiate an end to its activities or face the possibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency referring its case to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. But neither she nor Mr. Straw expressed more than a guarded hope.
 ''As to the outcome of those discussions, I can't predict,'' Mr. Straw said of the talk he and his German, French and European counterparts plan to have next week with Hassan Rowhani, Iran's senior nuclear negotiator. ''I hope, but I can't predict, that the negotiations at the beginning of next week will be fruitful.''
 Ms. Rice added that ''we've obviously got the Security Council as an option,'' though some American and European officials caution that getting the council to adopt sanctions against Iran is far from assured.
 The sequence of events over the last week had an air of melodrama and some absurdity, several diplomats said. Last week, a top European diplomat suggested that after Iran declared so frequently and firmly that it would resume nuclear activities, it would be impossible to back down without losing face.
 This week, the same diplomat said it appeared that Iran had indeed changed its mind, even at the expense of looking like it was backing down. Many experts say that the switches in position reflect a debate between forces perceived as more secular-oriented leaders and hard-liners who are believed to reside among Iran's circle of high-ranking clerics. 
 ''The fact that Rowhani will be coming to Europe next Monday or Tuesday is at least a sign that we can continue the talks and that they won't break their agreements to suspend their uranium programs,'' the diplomat said.
 A toughly worded letter from Mr. Straw and his colleagues last week, warning that Iran was in danger of angering the international community, ''has had an impact,'' the diplomat said, adding, ''Speaking bluntly, it moves us closer to the elections and the chance that there can be a negotiated agreement.''
 Iran has an acknowledged a uranium enrichment program that it asserts is for peaceful nuclear energy purposes, but experts say that the program's many parts, and the fact that Iran has failed to disclose all of it, reinforce suspicions of its intentions.
 Iran's immediate objective has been to convert uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride gas. Western experts fear that it might then enrich the gas to a higher grade of fuel with the help of a centrifuges it has been assembling in various parts of the country. 
 That step could produce weapons-grade fuel, the experts say.
 Iran's negotiations have been supported in principle by the United States but with top American officials expressing doubt about their success at the outset. Only after President Bush's trip to Europe and other trips by Ms. Rice have American officials managed to convince the Europeans that they really do support the talks and hope they succeed, averting a confrontation with Iran.

HEADLINE: Registering New Influence, Iran Sends a Top Aide to Iraq

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Sabrina Tavernise, Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Razzaq al-Saedy contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 17 

 BODY:
Wasting little time in registering its new influence in Iraq, Iran sent its foreign minister to Baghdad on Tuesday only 48 hours after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice became the first high-level visitor to hold talks with Iraq's new Shiite-majority government.
 The arrival of the Iranian, Kamal Kharrazi, underscored changes in the political landscape that many Iraqis find dizzying: almost 25 years after Iraq and Iran started an eight-year war that left a million people dead, the government in Baghdad is now led by officials with close personal, religious and political ties to Iran's ruling Shiite ayatollahs.
 Iraqi officials who greeted Mr. Kharrazi acknowledged that the timing of his arrival, so soon after Ms. Rice's 12-hour visit on Sunday, was not chance. ''The political message of this visit is very important, notably in its timing,'' said Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari of Iraq, who at one point broke into fluent Persian, Iran's principal language, during a news conference with Mr. Kharrazi. 
 For his part, Mr. Kharrazi appeared eager to put the United States on notice that Iran expects to wield influence in Iraq, especially in the long term, that will match or outstrip the United States'. At one point, standing beside Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Iraq's new prime minister, Mr. Kharrazi fielded a reporter's question about the competition for influence in Iraq between Washington and Tehran with a reminder of what he described as the geographical realities.
 ''Let me add that the party that will leave Iraq is the United States, because it will eventually withdraw,'' he said in English, referring to the 138,000 American troops here. ''But the party that will live with the Iraqis is Iran, because it is a neighbor to Iraq.''
 Dr. Jaafari and other top Shiite leaders gave Mr. Kharrazi a welcome suffused with references to the ties they formed during years of exile in Iran after fleeing the repression of Saddam Hussein. But there was no escaping the competing reality of America's power here, or the Iraqi leaders' need to balance affinities with Iran with their acknowledged dependence on American military power to hold back Iraq's Sunni Arab insurgency.
 In his joint appearance with Mr. Kharrazi on the steps of the prime minister's office, Dr. Jaafari focused his remarks on the new government's determination not to allow its relations with Iran or the United States to be prejudiced by the hostility between Tehran and Washington. 
 ''We will build relationships between Iraq and other countries according to Iraqi standards and Iraqi national interests,'' he said. ''We would like to see relations between Iran and the United States that are characterized by peace and love, and by a sense of their shared interests. But our relations with every country will be fashioned in a way that is independent of the positive or negative feelings they may have for any other nation.''
 Mr. Kharrazi arrived in Baghdad by road after crossing from Iran at the Iranian border town of Mehran, 100 miles east of Baghdad, thus avoiding having to use the American military helicopters that are the inescapable form of transport for most high-level visitors to Iraq. But at the prime minister's compound, security was led by the United States Navy Seals in civilian dress who are Dr. Jaafari's constant companions.
 In other ways, arrangements for the Iranian's visit demonstrated the differences between the relationships Iraq's new leaders seem likely to have with the two foreign powers contending for influence here. Ms. Rice, in her brief visit, met only with Iraqi political leaders and American officials and military commanders. Iranian officials said Mr. Kharrazi was expected to remain in Iraq for three days and to travel to the Shiite holy city of Najaf for a meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Iranian-born cleric who is the most revered and politically influential of Iraq's Shiite religious leaders.
 In the 25 months since American troops swept Mr. Hussein from power, Ayatollah Sistani has refused to meet with American officials, leaving them to guess exactly what political preferences -- or directives, as many Iraqis see them -- he hands to the leaders of Shiite religious parties. 
 Aides to Dr. Jaafari said Mr. Kharrazi would also meet with Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iran, or Sciri. It and Dawa are the ranking parties in the new government. Mr. Hakim has taken no government post, but is widely regarded as the most powerful of the Shiite political leaders. 
 Among many of Iraq's hard-line Sunni Arab leaders, and still more so among Sunni insurgent groups, the Shiite leaders' ties to Iran are a trigger for hostility and suspicions that trace back far beyond the Iran-Iraq war, to ancient history and the Persian conquest of Mesopotamia.
 But Western scholars interviewed by telephone as Mr. Kharrazi began his visit cautioned against seeing the new Iraqi leaders as necessarily pliable in their relations with Iran and against any assumption that Iranian and American interests in Iraq are strongly opposed, at least as long as the Sunni insurgency here continues.
 Shaul Bakhash, an Iran scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said Mr. Kharrazi's visit showed that Iraq's leaders were eager to recognize the importance Iran, with its 800-mile border with Iraq, its trading possibilities and its Shiite faith, will have in Iraq's future.
 But he said Iraq's Shiite leaders would not be pawns of the Iranians. ''They are Iraqi nationalists, and now that they're in power, they're less dependent on external support than they were as exiled opposition groups,'' he said.
 Other experts said Iran shared the United States' aim of vanquishing the Sunni insurgency in Iraq -- a point Mr. Kharrazi alluded to after meeting with Dr. Jaafari, when he said Iran was ready to offer aid to Iraq on matters of security. 
 Fred Halliday, an international relations scholar at the London School of Economics, said: ''Both Iran and the United States want to see Sunni insurrection defeated. Both will suffer if there is civil war in Iraq. The Iranians do not want to see a complete American troop withdrawal now.''

Troops Battle Rebels in Mosul
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 17 (AP) -- American troops backed by helicopters battled scores of insurgents holed up in two houses in the northern city of Mosul, the military said Tuesday. Mosul's police commander, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Muhammad Khalaf, said 20 militants were killed when American aircraft destroyed the buildings, but the American military said it was unaware of any casualties.
 Three Islamic clerics -- a Shiite killed in a drive-by shooting and two Sunnis who had been kidnapped -- were found dead in Baghdad, the police said Tuesday, a day after Iraq's prime minister vowed to use an ''iron fist'' to end sectarian violence. 
 The two Sunnis had reportedly been abducted by men in Iraqi Army uniforms, but Defense Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi said the government was not involved. He also said Iraqi troops would no longer be allowed to enter mosques, churches or universities.
 An additional 17 Iraqis were killed Tuesday: two officials in separate Baghdad drive-by shootings, six truck drivers delivering supplies to American forces north of the capital, a former member of the Baath Party and his three grown sons, three Mosul policemen, and two soldiers in Baghdad. An American soldier was killed and a second wounded when a roadside bomb struck their patrol near Tikrit, the military said.

HEADLINE: The Mournful Math of Darfur: The Dead Don't Add Up

BYLINE: By Marc Lacey

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan 

 BODY:
Darfur's dead have been tossed into the bottoms of wells, dumped into mass graves, interred in sandy cemeteries and crudely cremated. Children have been snatched from the arms of their mothers and thrown into fires, villagers dragged on the ground behind horses and camels by ropes strung around their necks.
 All of which makes the important and politically charged task of counting the precise number of victims of the two-plus years of war in western Sudan a virtually impossible exercise. 
 Is the death toll between 60,000 and 160,000, as Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoellick told reporters during a recent trip to the region? 
 Or is it closer to the roughly 400,000 dead reported recently by the Coalition for International Justice, a Washington-based nongovernmental organization that was hired by the United States Agency for International Development to try to determine whether the killing amounts to genocide. (Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called the Darfur killing genocide last year, but Mr. Zoellick has studiously avoided the issue.) The State Department has said the higher mortality figures offered by some groups are ''skewed'' by overestimates of the number of deaths from violence in Darfur, rather than from disease and other causes.
 Those trying to tally the terror are engaging in guesswork for a cause. They say they are trying to count the deaths to shock the world into stopping the number from rising higher than it already is. Sudan has not issued an estimate of its own, although officials in Khartoum label the numbers floating around as propaganda.
 With death certificates nonexistent, census figures hopelessly out of date and much of Darfur's population uprooted from its home villages and scattered into makeshift settlements and camps, the only feasible way to count is through broad-brush statistical analysis.
 To the survivors, the various estimates are impossible to grasp. In the middle of the mayhem, they often had no idea how many people were slain in their own tiny villages when the government-backed militias, known as the janjaweed, swept in full of so much fury.
 ''So many died,'' Ibrahim Adam Abdallah said simply, his face blank, when asked how many lives were lost in Seraf, a settlement in South Darfur that was first emptied a year ago and set on fire in April, to ensure that no one ever goes home.
 John Hogan, the John D. MacArthur professor of sociology and law at Northwestern University who led the compilation of the numbers for the Coalition for International Justice, argues that devising a death toll for Darfur is worth the effort, even if it is a rough approximation. ''To focus the attention of people, it's important to give them some sense of the scale of what's happening in Darfur,'' he said.
 Error is inevitable, Mr. Hogan acknowledged. ''Obviously, this is not correct to the person, or even the 10 or the 100,'' he said. ''But it's much better to have information of some kind -- and this is a good estimate -- than no information.''
 Whatever the actual figure, it is undoubtedly a moving target. People are still dying from sickness, starvation and exposure at rates that experts say are higher than the already elevated rates at which they died before the conflict began in early 2003. And although Darfur has long been known for its lawlessness, violent deaths are regarded as far higher than normal, as well.
 Totaling up the dead in Africa's wars has always been particularly challenging, from the mass killing in Rwanda (in which somewhere around 800,000 people died) to the continuing war in Congo (where the toll is now estimated to be in the neighborhood of 3.8 million).
 The continued insecurity in Darfur and the rugged nature of the vast battlefield make counting its dead a particularly error-prone exercise.
 The World Health Organization looked into the health consequences last year when it estimated that 70,000 people had died over a seven-month period from malnutrition and disease linked to the conflict.
 Researchers for the Coalition for International Justice then released their more comprehensive review. They were not able to get into Sudan, but under an American government contract they managed to conduct 1,136 interviews with refugees in eastern Chad, asking them whether they had family members who had died in violent circumstances or were missing.
 From this survey, the coalition's researchers established a death rate of 1.2 per 10,000, which is alarmingly high. Applying that figure to the estimated number of displaced people in Chad, the coalition concluded that 142,944 people may have been killed by government forces or allied militias, the main groups ravaging the civilian population. 
 The figure is rough. It assumes that every missing relative has died, which will surely not prove true. It assumes that the death rate among relatives of the refugees in Chad is similar to the rate among those who remained in Darfur, which may or may not be accurate.
 The Coalition for International Justice then took the W.H.O. study and -- assuming that same number of people died in the beginning of the conflict from sickness as two years later -- projected the death estimates for the entire Darfur war. The total number of health-related deaths came to 253,619, for a grand total of 396,563 deaths.
 In its attempt to determine whether the killing amounted to genocide, the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur conducted extensive interviews in all three Darfur states and studied numerous raids in minute detail. In some cases, the commission reported the number of militiamen who swept into a village, the number of government bombers flying overhead and the number of corpses left behind.
 Despite such precision, the commission made no attempt to come up with a Darfur-wide death toll. In fact, commissioners found that totaling up the number of damaged villages in Darfur was difficult enough. Estimates range from 700 to well over 2,000.
 Still, the counting continues, and eventually, when Darfur's violence mercifully ends, a number will be agreed upon. That number, like the figure of 800,000 for the Rwanda massacre, will be forever appended to the awful events. The rest of the world, slow to react to Darfur, will then have plenty of opportunity to think about it, and wonder why it was able to grow as large as it did.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Raises City's Rating On Debt to A+, Its Best Ever

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, gave New York City its highest rating ever yesterday, the second major rating agency to raise its assessment of the city's financial condition in recent months.
 The agency said that its decision to award an A+ rating to the city's $32 billion in general obligation debt was based on the city's ''steady fiscal and economic recovery since 2001 and strong budget management'' by the Bloomberg administration, which has grappled with successive multibillion-dollar deficits.
 ''Also factored into the rating action is a comprehensive financial planning process that has enabled the city to effectively balance its ongoing spending pressures,'' S.&P. said in a statement. ''The outlook is stable.'' 
 Previously, S.&P. had given New York City an A rating. The upgrade was the second since April, when another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, raised its rating to A1 from A2, the highest it had ever given the city.
 The higher credit ratings make it easier for the city to borrow money and to negotiate lower interest rates on its debt.
 The improved credit ratings came at a politically advantageous time for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is campaigning for re-election in large measure on his record as steward of the city's finances. Yesterday, Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor, was quick to credit Mr. Bloomberg for the positive developments cited by the rating agencies.
 ''Today's announcement by S.&P. demonstrates that New York's economy has strengthened and the difficult decisions Mayor Bloomberg made during the fiscal crisis were the right ones,'' he said. ''However, significant budgetary challenges still exist, and now is not the time to change course.''
 S.&P. noted that the city would be ending its current fiscal year in June with a $3.3 billion surplus, and that Mr. Bloomberg had proposed a balanced budget of close to $50 billion for next year -- a budget that city officials had once predicted would have a deficit of $3.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Hey, Didn't the Beatles Sing About a Submarine?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., May 17 

 BODY:
In the days since the Pentagon proposed closing the Navy's submarine base here, Gov. M. Jodi Rell has begun forming a high-profile coalition of military, political and business leaders to fight to keep the base open.
 On Tuesday, the coalition expanded to include three relatively unknown local players: Ben Parent on guitar, Trevor Chandonnait on drums and Steven Elci on bass. Together, the three men are called Superbald, and they have recorded a song that in 24 hours rose from an obscure musical subgenre to become a rallying cry to save the base. 
 After Mrs. Rell met at the Groton Town Hall Annex on Tuesday with dozens of business and political leaders, she and the rest of the group met Superbald and then listened to a recording of ''Submarine Town.''
 It's a dirty job, men working hard
 Building boats out in the yard 
 In a submarine town
 The world has changed 
 But it's all still the same
 In a submarine town
 First people tapped their fingers, and then they applauded. Mrs. Rell, who is a Republican. left with a copy of the CD.
 The bright punk-pop riff was recorded a few months ago, well before the Pentagon's announcement on Friday. But even then people were worried about the base's future. 
 The lyrics, squeezed between 2 minutes and 27 seconds of guitar shimmer and driving drums, are more a collection of memories and mental images than a protest song or a working man's anthem. But their tone is affectionate and the tune is catchy, with subtle effects that evoke the deep-sea plunge of a submarine. 
 Mr. Elci, who wrote the words and sings the lead vocal, says ''Submarine Town'' reflects a kind of spiritual alliance with the more than 31,000 people whose jobs, according to state economists, are linked to the sub base. The band members are in their mid-30's and each holds a day job, though none work at the base.
 ''We've all lived here our whole lives,'' Mr. Elci said. ''This is all we know.''
 The idea to play the song for the governor and the business group came from Andrea L. Stillman, a Democratic state senator from nearby Waterford. Mr. Elci, a friend of Mrs. Stillman's family, first played the recording for her on Monday.
 ''Don't be surprised when you hear it on the radio,'' Ms. Stillman said on Tuesday. ''It's southeast Connecticut saying, 'Come and help us.'''

HEADLINE: Stadium Vote Delayed, 7 Weeks Before Olympic Decision

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Al Baker in Albany contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Less than 24 hours before a crucial vote on the $2.2 billion stadium proposed for the West Side of Manhattan, Gov. George E. Pataki and two legislative leaders agreed last night that the matter would be postponed, probably until June.
 The Public Authorities Control Board, a little-known state panel that can block the state's $300 million contribution to the stadium project, had been scheduled to vote today. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had said that a positive vote at this month's meeting was crucial to the city's chances of winning the 2012 Olympics and redeveloping the West Side. 
 The decision to put off the vote came after the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican who controls one of three seats on the board, formally asked for a one-month postponement, raising concerns about financial and legal issues related to the project. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who controls another seat, has also expressed doubts about the stadium.
 As a result of the delay, the status of the 75,000-seat stadium will still be up in the air only seven weeks before the International Olympic Committee meets in Singapore on July 6 to select Paris, London, Lisbon, Moscow or New York for the Summer Games. The uncertainty could hurt New York's standing when the Olympic committee issues a major evaluation of the bid cities in early June, because Paris, regarded as the front-runner, already has an Olympic-size stadium. 
 Mayor Bloomberg, a Republican, has insisted that New York has no chance of getting the Games if the stadium is not approved before the Singapore meeting. Every day that goes by, ''the odds on us getting the Olympics go down and the odds on us getting a stadium go down,'' the mayor said on Monday.
 His spokesman, Edward Skyler, said last night that the mayor remains optimistic that the project will eventually be approved on its merits.
 Opponents of the stadium, including neighborhood residents, the city's largest civic groups and some Broadway theater owners, say that it will cause traffic congestion and pollution on days when it is used as a football stadium by the Jets, while repelling development nearby.
 Both Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have repeatedly said that the stadium should not be considered by the board while there is outstanding litigation, like the lawsuits filed against the stadium by Cablevision. Mr. Bruno also complained yesterday that the state and the Jets had failed to provide sufficient financial information, given the size of the taxpayers' investment in the project, $600 million.
 But both men have taken pains not to be painted as the villains who cost the city the Olympics.
 Mr. Bruno said yesterday that if the 2012 games are awarded to New York, ''we in the Senate are committed to building whatever facilities it takes to host the Olympics, wherever it's appropriate to host the Olympics.''
 The comment seemed to suggest a willingness to move the stadium from Manhattan to Queens, where borough officials would welcome it.
 But the third member of the control board, Governor Pataki, a Republican, supports the stadium in Manhattan and wanted to force one of the other two to take responsibility for the delay. 
 ''I want to see a vote tomorrow,'' Mr. Pataki said yesterday, hours before the postponement was announced by his budget director, John Cape. ''I think the stadium and convention complex is important. I think the timing of it is important. The Olympics is going to be decided in less than two months, and I would urge a vote tomorrow. I can't force that to happen.''
 Although the vote will probably occur at the regular June meeting of the board, Mr. Cape, who also serves as the board's chairman, said a special meeting could be called with seven days' notice.
 The political wrangling played out as thousands of union construction workers demonstrated in Albany in favor of the proposed stadium, which would double as a convention hall. On Monday, stadium opponents brought to Albany what they said were 25,000 messages against the stadium. 
 Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have not formally taken positions on the stadium, although they have both expressed qualms about it and said the vote should wait until a court settles some of the legal challenges on June 2. 
 Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno also raised numerous questions concerning financial, legal and security aspects of the project.
 ''There are too many unanswered questions about this project,'' Mr. Silver said in an interview last night. ''One is what is the extent of the public money going into this project. It's well beyond the $600 million, that's clear.''
 At the same time, Mr. Silver is negotiating with the Bloomberg administration over a new economic development package for his downtown district. Mr. Bruno, according to state officials, is looking for money for upstate projects to offset state funds for the stadium. 
 As the issue continued to unfold last night in Albany, Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group said it appeared that Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver may each be carefully straddling divisions within their Senate and Assembly majority conferences and trying to avoid alienating anyone.
 ''I think the are some substantive differences,'' said Mr. Horner, who is opposed to the stadium. ''I think the leaders reflect the ambivalence in their conferences. I think there's generally deep ambivalence in both majority conferences on the wisdom of developing this asset by building a sports stadium.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 2005

 CORRECTION:
The Metro Matters column yesterday, about the politics behind New York State leaders' positions on the proposed West Side stadium -- a project linked to New York City's bid for the 2012 Olympics -- misidentified another city in competition for the Games. (The error also occurred on Wednesday in an article about the postponement of a vote on the project by a state board.) The competing city is Madrid, not Lisbon. 
 A related article yesterday about Gov. George E. Pataki's call for a special meeting of the state board next week misstated the timing of comments by Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who said they had grave concerns about the project. They spoke on Wednesday, not yesterday.

HEADLINE: Europe Pressuring China To Limit Textile Exports 

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and PAUL MELLER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 17 

 BODY:
Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade commissioner, called Tuesday for China immediately to curb exports of two important textile products. 
 Mr. Mandelson invoked emergency procedures that force China, under World Trade Organization rules, to impose its own restrictions on its exports of T-shirts and flax yarn. 
 China will have several weeks to act, or face sanctions from the European Union. 
 The European Union's decision to intensify pressure on China comes amid evidence that surging exports from the world's most powerful emerging economy are undermining Europe's textiles industry. 
 After months of treading softly around the issue, the European Union has sharply toughened its line, just ahead of the referendum in France on its new constitutional treaty on May 29. French voters have voiced concerns about the impact of globalization and free trade on jobs and growth at home. 
 Mr. Mandelson avoided questions about whether his decision was influenced by the timing of the French referendum. A vote against the treaty could create political challenges for European Union members. France and Italy are Europe's main producers of flax yarn. 
 ''You can see the scale of changes that are taking place, which, if they continue during this year, will have devastating effects,'' Mr. Mandelson told a news conference. 
 Europe's move, which could end in sanctions, will test Europe's relations with China, which is Europe's second-largest export market, after the United States.
 It follows the announcement last week by the United States of proposed new quotas for three categories of Chinese textiles. Washington's move drew a sharp response from Beijing, where a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that the limits would seriously damage the international trade environment.
 Until now, the United States had taken a stronger stance than the European Union against China's textile exports, which have surged since the lifting of global quotas on Jan. 1. 
 But Mr. Mandelson said Tuesday that an investigation into nine categories of textiles had already provided evidence of big increases of imports of T-shirts and flax yarn, or linen. Imports of T-shirts from China into the European Union increased 187 percent in the first three months of 2005, compared with the same period a year earlier, he said. Flax yarn imports rose 56 per cent.
 Under W.T.O. rules, the European Union's call for emergency talks automatically requires China to impose restrictions on the growth in exports of these two products; otherwise, Europe is free to erect its own temporary safeguards, he said. Europe would continue to monitor the other seven categories. 
 Mr. Mandelson has sought to play down any confrontation with China, but he has been caught between France and other countries urging a harder protectionist approach, and a more liberal group, including Sweden, arguing that reimposing trade barriers would eventually hinder growth and cost Europe jobs. Europe's textile industry has also lobbied hard for Mr. Mandelson to take a tougher line. 
 The predicament has been aggravated by signs that economic recovery in Europe may be slowing. 
 The rise of Chinese exports has had a drastic effect on local European producers. Production of T-shirts in Portugal, for example, dropped between 30 percent and 50 percent in the first three months of 2005, compared with the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, European production of flax yarn has fallen by a quarter, and employment in the sector was 13 percent lower in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier. 
 Last month, Jacques Chirac, the president of France, said that Europe would not accept an invasion of Chinese textile imports without regulation. 
 Calls for protectionist measures by some European Union countries mirror the reaction this year to the proposed liberalization of Europe's services sector, which was eventually sidelined after pressure from France and Germany. 
 There was no immediate sign of response from China to the commission's step, which, despite divisions within Europe, was likely to receive backing from all 25 European Union members, Mr. Mandelson said. 
 Mr. Mandelson said that he hoped Beijing would take voluntary action to restrain its exports rather than face sanctions, referring to recent comments by China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, that China was considering more stringent controls. 
 But Mr. Mandelson said that if China failed to restrain export growth, then the European Union would impose safeguards that would stay in place until the end of this year. ''There is a lot of understanding on the Chinese side about the pressures that are mounting and the need for us to take action,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Lexus Tops Owner Survey For 5th Year

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 18 

 BODY:
Lexus drivers reported the fewest problems with their new vehicles, while owners of cars like Volvos, Porsches and Saabs on average had much more to complain about, according to the latest survey from J.D. Power & Associates. The study also found that owners were significantly more impressed with their Nissans and Hummers after giving the brands dismal ratings in last year's survey.
 Lexus, which is owned by Toyota, led the J.D. Power study for the fifth year in a row. Lexus was followed by Jaguar, owned by Ford, and BMW, which took the third spot. The worst performers in the study were Land Rover and Mazda, both owned by Ford, and Suzuki. 
 The survey, which asked consumers to rate their vehicles after having owned them for 90 days, is one of a trio of closely watched automobile quality reports issued by J.D. Power. Together, they are highly valued by automobile companies and dealerships as a way to market their vehicles. 
 The research released Wednesday, known as the initial quality study, examined responses from more than 62,000 new owners who rated their vehicles in nine categories. The study, which covers 38 models, includes ratings on areas from a vehicle's transmission to its seats to its sound system. 
 In rating vehicles, J.D. Power assigns a number that reflects how many problems on average that owners report for every 100 vehicles. The new results showed that overall automobile quality in the first 90 days of ownership remained largely unchanged from last year. Across the industry, consumers reported an average of 118 problems for each 100 vehicles. Last year, the average was 119. 
 Neal Oddes, director of product research for J.D. Power, said that did not suggest that automobile quality would stop improving. ''We haven't reached any kind of plateau,'' he said. ''We've seen this kind of pattern in the past where you have a plateau and then the next year, that's when you see a huge improvement in quality.''
 Over all, automobile quality is on the rise, the survey showed. Since 1998, the industry average of complaints for each 100 vehicles has improved by a third. 
 The surveys were mailed to consumers who purchased their vehicles late last year. Among those who responded, the No. 1 complaint was wind noise. The second most-cited concern was poor fuel economy.
 Both wind noise and poor gas mileage were two of the major reasons that Hummer, a division of General Motors, fared so poorly in last year's survey. The vehicle made strides in both areas this year, tying for 10th place compared with last place last year. Hummer received a rating of 110 problems for each 100 vehicles.
 Other G.M. brands also performed well in the survey. Buick finished fourth on the list with 100 problems for each 100 vehicles; Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz tied for fifth, with 104 problems per 100 vehicles.
 ''We're pretty happy with the overall performance,'' said Kevin Williams, G.M.'s vice president for quality. ''We're not satisfied in terms of where we are over all, but we're extremely satisfied with the kind of results we've been able to see.'' Other G.M. brands like Saab and Saturn were ranked near the bottom of the list.
 Also near the bottom of the list was Volvo, which last year was above the industry quality average with 113 problems for each 100 vehicles. This year, Volvo, which is owned by Ford, had 140 problems for each 100 vehicles. Porsche, which finished third from the bottom last year, stayed in the same spot this year, with 147 problems for each 100 vehicles.

HEADLINE: Those Who Outgrow Foster Care Still Struggle, Study Finds

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 18 

 BODY:
As the definition of adulthood has shifted in this country and young people are living with their parents even into their 20's, one group has been mostly left behind in this phenomenon: thousands of people who grow up in foster care.
 Nationally each year, some 20,000 youths who were once removed from their homes because of abuse or neglect leave their second home -- the child welfare system -- because they get too old for it. In some states, they are allowed to stay on until they turn 21, but in many more places, they ''age out'' when they turn 18.
 And that, the authors of a new study to be released on Thursday by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago say, can have devastating consequences. The study, which is believed to be the broadest of its kind in 20 years, looked at a rarely examined group -- more than 600 young people, mostly 19 years old and in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, who recently left foster care or will soon do so. 
 As a group, the youths from foster care wrestled with tougher problems than a wide national sample of 19-year-old Americans, the study said. More than a third of those coming from foster care had no high school diploma or general equivalency diploma, compared with about 10 percent of people their age. Those from foster care were also far more likely to be pregnant, unemployed, unable to pay the rent, or getting counseling.
 Perhaps more striking about the group from foster care, though, those allowed to stay in the child welfare system -- living in foster homes or youth facilities beyond their 18th birthdays -- seemed to fare better than those who headed out at 18. Those who left at 18 were half as likely to be enrolled in school or a training program than those still in care, the study found. Those who had left care were 50 percent more likely to be unemployed and out of school than those who stayed in. About 14 percent of those who left, in fact, reported finding themselves homeless at some point. Of those who left care, 11.5 percent reported sometimes or often not having enough to eat, compared with less than 4 percent of those who stayed in care.
 ''Most states do not allow them to stay in much beyond 18, and that's the legacy of what we thought, historically, was the point of becoming an adult,'' said Mark E. Courtney, the study's lead author and the director of Chapin Hall Center here. ''But it doesn't make sense anymore. What parent kicks their child out at 18? Why are we treating these kids radically differently than parents are treating every other kid?'' 
 Dr. Courtney said he was unsure precisely how many states allow youths to stay in care until they are 21, but said that Illinois is one in that small group, while youths in Iowa and Wisconsin -- and most other states -- generally leave the foster care system when they turn 18 or 19. 
 It is uncertain, though, how much it might cost states to extend such benefits to 21, and in tight budget times, money may be one reason states have been reluctant. 
 ''The reluctance could be a fiscal issue or it could be the whole issue, too, of older wards -- you're not cute and cuddly anymore,'' said Robert F. Harris, the public guardian who represents wards in Cook County, Ill. ''But by and large, young people need the benefit of societal support past 18 -- and even past 21.''
 Shalonda Williamson, one of those surveyed in Dr. Courtney's study, said in an interview that she has been in the system since she was 9. Now 20, she is studying computers at college in Chicago, but remains in the formal care of the child welfare system here. To her, that is a relief. She has somewhere to live.
 ''If I had gotten out at 18, I think I'd be totally different than I am now,'' she said. ''When you're 18, you're not really an adult anyway. I think it's around 20 when you start getting your life together.''
 Even now, Ms. Williamson acknowledged, she does not have every adult question answered: She has no bank account or summer job. 
 But Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, based in Alexandria, Va., said the ''dismal'' findings described in Dr. Courtney's study and others emerging from the foster system across the country should not necessarily leave child welfare experts clamoring to hold youths in the system longer. 
 ''When we talk about people aging out, we get away from the central point,'' he said. ''What these results should tell us is that we've got to stop throwing so many children into foster care in the first place. What you can see is, regardless of what the problems were going in, foster care surely didn't fix them.''
 The Chapin Hall study cost $1.6 million and was financed by the three states and the William T. Grant Foundation.

HEADLINE: China's Growth Ebbs, a Deterrent To Revaluation

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 18 

 BODY:
A string of economic indicators suggests that China has tempered recent growth and inflation, an achievement that could make it more reluctant to appease demands on Tuesday from the Bush administration to let its currency rise soon.
 The figures on softening domestic growth in China set the stage for continued tensions with the United States, which already said last week that it planned to impose quotas on imported Chinese trousers, underwear and cotton shirts. Already, Chinese officials have resisted calls from Washington to allow currency changes and have denounced preparations by the European Union to limit imports of Chinese clothing. 
 According to Chinese figures released this week, inflation has slowed significantly -- with consumer prices just 1.8 percent higher in April than a year earlier. Inventories of unsold goods are rising at steel mills and other businesses, and imports of iron ore and many other raw materials have slipped. While exports remain extremely strong, domestic economic activity has moderated. 
 Beijing officials have imposed administrative measures that seem to have been surprisingly effective in controlling a potentially overheated economy and inflation.
 ''The government has been saying for some time that they would rein in the economy,'' said Harry Banga, vice chairman of the Noble Group, a shipping and commodities business based in Hong Kong, ''and it would seem that they have succeeded.''
 Few foresee a serious risk that the Chinese economy might slow too much, especially as long as exports continue soaring at an annual pace of more than 30 percent.
 Chinese officials have said that their decisions on currency policy will be driven by long-term matters involving how they manage the country's economy, not short-term considerations about how to even out economic cycles. But one virtue of a stronger currency is that it tends to make imports cheaper and hold down inflation, and China, at least temporarily, now seems to have less need of this.
 The question debated by economists and business executives is how long the current pause in economic growth and inflation will last. Put another way, how much longer can the administrative controls, like limits on bank loans, remain effective in preventing another unsustainable burst of economic output.
 ''Compared with a few months ago, six months ago, from a policy maker's point of view,'' said Qu Hongbin, an HSBC economist, ''there's less worry about economic problems, although it is too early to declare victory.''
 Some economists foresee a surge in inflation and economic growth after the spring, contending that year-over-year comparisons now can be misleading because the economy was starting to overheat in the spring of 2004. 
 Others worry that credit-starved Chinese companies and public works managers are becoming more cautious about spending money as banks, warned by regulators to be more prudent, are more wary in making loans.
 At stake is not only the health of China's economy but also growth across Asia. Regional economies have come to depend on exports to China; Japanese machinery makers, for instance, are already struggling with weaker sales.
 Europe and especially the United States depend much less on exports to China. But officials there are likely to pay increased attention to whether policy makers in Beijing let the nation's currency, the yuan, rise in the markets.
 The value added in industrial production, which limits the effect of rising raw material prices, increased 16 percent in China in April, the government said Wednesday, a slight slowdown from a year-on-year increase of 16.2 percent in the first quarter. And the value added from industrial production could have declined further, were it not for a 29.9 percent increase in industrial exports in April.
 The government is scheduled to announce figures on Thursday or Friday for fixed-asset investment in apartment buildings and other large projects. Private economists expect an increase of 22 percent to 24 percent for the month of April from a year earlier, although the figure will be inflated by fast-rising prices for land purchases, which Chinese statisticians count as investments even as statisticians in many other countries do not.
 Economists concerned that China may soon show another surge in growth and inflation point out that producer prices are still rising more than 5 percent a year. They contend that year-over-year comparisons of economic statistics are a problem right now because the Chinese economy had acute problems with overheating in the spring of 2004, with clogged rail lines and arriving ships waiting in line for up to a month to discharge cargo, even as a poor harvest was driving up food prices.
 A better harvest last summer and autumn has reversed the rise in food prices while exports have boomed. ''The numbers are telling you this economy is poised for further momentum, and there has been no policy to restrain that,'' said Liang Hong, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of Goldman Sachs.
 Some business executives in China, particularly those from companies selling to consumers, say their sales remain strong.
 ''The purchasing power of people is very high nowadays,'' said Henry Zhang, general manager of the Shishi Hengyi Textile Product Trade Company, a maker of casual men's trousers in Fujian Province in southeastern China. ''People earn more and they keep buying clothes every day. Many are willing to pay more for fancy and quality clothes.''
 But other economists say that businesses are becoming much more cautious about making investments. This is reducing the demand for steel and other materials and making it likely that their production will have to fall soon.
 Annual growth in steel consumption has slowed sharply, while production has kept on rising steeply. Chinese steel makers have muscled foreign rivals out of their home market and begun exporting. But with imported steel now down to a small sliver of the market, specialists predict that it will be hard for Chinese steel makers to maintain growth.
 Mr. Banga, whose company ships large quantities of iron ore and coal to China, said that Chinese mills were selling steel as fast as they made it just two months ago, but now practically every mill had stockpiles available. China's volume of raw materials imports ''is coming down very fast,'' he said, adding, ''It has come down drastically across the board.'' 
 Jonathan Anderson, an economist with UBS, said that Chinese industrial production had not slowed as much as demand, and predicted that production would slow at least temporarily before demand caught up again. Using a comparison from Road Runner cartoons, he warned, ''The coyote has run off the cliff, and he's hanging there.''
 It remains unclear how much the lull in domestic demand will affect the currency ruminations of Beijing policy makers. A more valuable yuan would make imports cheaper in China and Chinese goods more costly in foreign markets, a combination that would tend to slow growth. If the policy makers want another reason not to let the yuan rise in the currency markets, then slower growth at home could provide that reason.
 Less vigorous growth in the Chinese economy may also make the nation's central bank less likely to increase interest rates. ''It weakens the argument for a rate hike definitely,'' said Ma Jun, an economist with Deutsche Bank.

HEADLINE: City Cashes In as Mecca for the Hefty (With Wallets to Match)

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C. 

 BODY:
In late 2003, Susan Blech sold her office products business, left her home in Long Beach, N.Y., and came here with a plan to spend her life savings losing weight.
 So far, her plan has worked. Ms. Blech, 39, has dropped about $70,000 and 220 pounds in Durham. She subsists on an 800-calorie diet prescribed by the Rice Diet Program, one of three major weight-loss and nutrition centers here in the city that sometimes calls itself the Diet Capital of the World.
 When her weight falls another 50 pounds, to 200, Ms. Blech plans to spend her remaining money for surgery to remove dangling skin from her midsection and fill out her sagging breasts. She has already picked her plastic surgeon -- one right here in Durham at the Duke University Medical Center. 
 If she is broke by then, Ms. Blech said, ''It's going on the credit cards.'' 
 Ms. Blech's losses are this town's gains. Durham, a former tobacco-trading and cigarette-manufacturing city of 204,000, has evolved into a Lourdes for the obese. Each year, about 4,000 people like Ms. Blech arrive here, hoping to change their lives. 
 And Durham's status, whether as a magnet or national model, seems likely to grow, as the country increasingly focuses on obesity as a potential epidemic. The obese now make up an estimated one-third of the adult population. They are the people most likely to have diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that account for more than $100 billion of the United States' $1.8 trillion annual medical bill. 
 Durham's diet experts say the people who come to their centers tend to lose more weight, more consistently than people who diet on their own -- because of the motivation that brings them to town in the first place and the network of doctors, medical staff and fellow dieters. But as with any diet, anywhere, keeping the weight off long term depends on a person's willingness to forever alter eating and exercise habits.
 ''I don't dare go home,'' said one dieter, Corinne Keene of Naples, Fla. Ms. Keene, 73, moved to Durham last Dec. 10 after hitting 252 pounds, a medical emergency on her 4-foot-9-inch frame. She has lost more than 50 pounds, but fears she will not keep dieting after leaving the supportive cocoon of the Rice Diet Program. 
 Durham has been known for weight loss ever since the Rice Diet was founded here in the 1930's. Local residents can reel off a list of corpulent celebrities over the years who have left some of themselves in Durham. 
 There was the Kentucky Fried Chicken founder, Col. Harland Sanders, who, in his trademark white suit, huffed and puffed on a local walking trail back in the 1970's while on the Rice Diet -- which has evolved over the years but still largely involves a strict regimen of grains and fruit. 
 The comedian Buddy Hackett, also a Ricer, was known for gags like ordering pizza for fellow dieters when he visited in the 1970's and 1980's.
 James Coco, the roly-poly comedic actor who starred on Broadway in ''Last of the Red Hot Lovers,'' dieted at the Structure House, then published a book in 1984 promoting the diet's effects -- three years before he died of a heart attack at age 56. 
 The celebrities still come, if more guarded these days about their privacy. But in the last few years, as weight loss has moved beyond vanity to a matter of national medical urgency, more and more everyday people have started spending their time and money on the Durham cure.
 ''I see a shift in people recognizing that this is something they have to deal with,'' said Dr. Gerard Musante, a psychologist who founded Structure House in 1977. 
 While shedding pounds at Durham diet houses -- the Rice Diet Program, the Duke Diet and Fitness Center and Structure House -- dieters pump more than $51 million a year into the local economy, according to the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau. The money includes not only the fees at the diet centers, but also the money dieters spend around town on everything from new sneakers to cosmetic surgery. ''The last time we did a study, the diet and fitness impact was almost equal to the conventions and meetings held in Durham in a one-year period,'' said Shelly Green, chief operating officer for the convention bureau. ''It's very significant.'' 
 Often, the dieters arrive plagued by the medical complications of severe obesity, and require visits to eye doctors, endocrinologists and surgeons. They rent apartments, set up temporary offices and sometimes come to live here permanently. As their weight drops, they buy several sets of new clothes. As their diabetes improves, they need to be fitted for new glasses. All of the spending adds to Durham's economy. 
 The dieters are easy to spot, tackling a walking path along the three-foot-high stone wall that encircles Duke University's east campus; or milling about the Southpoint Mall, where shopping takes the place of eating; or attending games at the minor league Durham Bulls' baseball stadium. Some have been spotted cheating on their diets at Francesca's Dessert Cafe. 
 A few dieters like Durham so much, they stay. One is Franklin Wittenberg, a former electronics importer-exporter, who came from Connecticut for a diet in 1981, disgusted with himself. Nearly 25 years later, Mr. Wittenberg could be called either a success or a failure of Durham's diet houses. 
 Mr. Wittenberg, 71, has thick white hair and a chiseled face that is remarkably thin compared with his girth, which seems to engulf his office swivel chair. He lost weight several times, but could never keep it off. Mr. Wittenberg talks about the pain of being obese, but also seems to revel in his business success. 
 While on his initial diet here at Duke Diet and staying in a scruffy Durham motel room, Mr. Wittenberg had an epiphany: dieters like him should not have to live in such quarters. So Mr. Wittenberg opened one of the country's first suite motels, a two-story complex with 114 units and a central outdoor pool. It is just across the street from the Duke center. Since opening Duke Towers in 1983, Mr. Wittenberg reckons that he has collected $50 million in rent money from dieters. 
 Many of the overweight come to town in sandals, their feet too swollen to fit in a closed shoe. Because they must exercise, one of the dieters' first stops often is a consultation with Walter Cleary. A 74-year-old former Duke football and track coach, Mr. Cleary owns 9th Street Active Feet. The store's $2 million in annual sales owes much to equipping dieters with shoes like the Brooks Beast, a sneaker with extra arch support that comes in super-widths like EEEE and retails for $110. Shoppers try them sitting on special oversize reinforced benches. 
 ''Invariably, they're going to be overpronated,'' Mr. Cleary said of the dieters, using a fancy word for flat-footed. ''Their weight has collapsed their arches.'' 
 The other thing he has noticed, he said, is that ''none of them are poor.''
 The diet programs are not covered by insurance. A few of the morbidly obese spend their last dimes to come here. Others have enough money to return each year for annual tuneups, and those people seem to be the most successful, Mr. Wittenberg said. 
 Durham's roots as a diet capital trace to Dr. Walter Kempner, a kidney specialist who fled Nazi Germany and joined Duke's medical faculty. As he was experimenting with diets to control blood pressure and promote kidney function, he found that an overweight female patient who had eaten rice and fruit while on an extended vacation returned much thinner and with her blood pressure under control. The Rice Diet was born. Dr. Kempner died in 1997, and the for-profit Rice Diet Program, which separated from Duke in 2001, is now run by a cardiologist, Dr. Robert A. Rosati. But the program continues to have the same spartan feel Dr. Kempner favored.
 A gravel parking lot adjoins what appears to be a large white ranch-style house. Inside, the Rice Diet House has all the decorative appeal of a slightly upscale Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, with Formica tables and leather sofas. The dieters start arriving at 7:30 a.m. for weigh-ins, thinly brewed decaf to avoid caffeine, and breakfast -- about a cup of oatmeal with raisins and honey, plus a bowl of fruit. Later, they will hear lectures, go for walks, participate in group discussions or practice yoga. In the first phase of the program, the dieters eat only grains and fruit, a regimen that adds up to 800 calories a day or slightly more. 
 Lunch and dinner each consist of small portions of rice, couscous or kasha and two fruits. Vegetables, beans and pasta are added in the second phase, when fish is also served once a week. 
 Jeff Melchor, 43, arrived at the Rice Diet Program last Nov. 23 in an old Lincoln Town Car he bought for the cross-country drive from San Francisco. At 548 pounds, it was the only vehicle he could fit in. A friend drove him. 
 As Mr. Melchor tells it, the alternative was death. His body was covered in Ace bandages to hide sores that seemed to be related to his diabetes. He was injecting himself with insulin eight times a day.
 Five months later, Mr. Melchor has lost 150 pounds and tossed out his insulin. He no longer needs it. His sores have healed. His shoe size has shrunk, and he has purchased several pairs at 9th Street Active Feet. As his diabetes has abated, he has required three different pairs of eyeglasses, purchased at Specs Eye Care, also on 9th Street. 
 A team of Duke-affiliated plastic surgeons has become accustomed to operating on people who have lost huge amounts of weight. One surgeon, Dr. Michael Zenn, said he received about 50 referrals a year, from dieters and from patients who had undergone gastric bypass surgery.
 ''They have skin hanging from their arms, they have skin hanging from their bellies,'' Dr. Zenn said. ''They have breasts that are empty bags.'' Fixing these problems can cost around $25,000, depending on severity, Dr. Zenn said. 
 Ms. Blech, who arrived here Nov. 24, 2003, carries an album with photos of herself 12 years ago when she was a bodybuilder weighing about 165 pounds, then a more recent version, when she weighed closer to her peak of 468 pounds. She attributes her weight gain to emotional issues caused by her mother's stroke-induced quadriplegia when Ms. Blech was a baby. 
 Ms. Blech said the emotional issues have been more difficult to deal with than the weight, but she has made strides on those, as well, while in the Rice Diet's therapy programs. 
 Ms. Blech's 220-pound weight loss has elevated her to a special dieters' Century Club plaque at the Rice Diet Program, a distinction reserved for those who have lost 100 pounds or more and kept it off. 
 ''I knew when I came down here that I was going to be broke when I left,'' she said. ''It's worth every single penny.''

HEADLINE: Price Report Eases Fears On Inflation 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Inflation slowed in April from its fast pace in March, easing fears that the country might be headed toward a bout of surging prices even as the economy was slowing.
 Prices still rose substantially last month. Energy prices pushed the Consumer Price Index up 0.5 percent after a 0.6 percent jump in March, the Labor Department reported. This pushed overall inflation in the last 12 months to 3.5 percent, the fastest clip since November. 
 But the core price index -- which excludes the volatile contributions of food and energy to the mix -- did not move in April. This soothed concerns that the spike in oil prices, which hit records in March, was seeding inflation through the economy. 
 ''Obviously it's very good news,'' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago. ''It still keeps us inside the Goldilocks band, where economic growth is warm enough and inflation is cool enough that the Fed can continue raising interest rates at a measured pace and keep things under control.''
 Investors in financial markets were elated by the news and drove up prices of stocks and bonds. On the New York Stock Exchange, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1 percent, to 1,185.56. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.09 percent, its lowest point since early February.
 The streak of good news snapped investors out of a gloomy spell that followed a rash of downbeat economic data. This had kindled doubts over whether the economy could stay on a path of vigorous growth accompanied by relatively low inflation.
 In March, an upsurge of core consumer price inflation hinted that energy prices might be generating more broad-based inflation, as businesses passed their rising energy costs on to consumers. A report of an unexpected slowdown in the growth of the nation's gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year, meanwhile, appeared to indicate that the economy was losing steam.
 Suddenly it seemed as if oil prices, which had been ascending in a series of bursts since the beginning of last year without causing significant distress to the economy, were starting to dent growth seriously and were setting off inflationary forces. 
 The mix of bad news startled even the usually steely governors of the Federal Reserve. After their most recent monetary policy meeting just over two weeks ago, they issued a new double warning, underscoring that ''the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat'' and that ''pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months.''
 These cautionary flags were interpreted by some investors as indicating that the Fed could replace its current policy of gradual interest rate increases -- at a clip of 0.25 percent each meeting -- with a more aggressive approach to squelching inflation. But this, in turn, might further threaten growth.
 ''When the Fed met on May 3, inflation and growth looked imperiled; that would have left the Fed uneasy on both its goals,'' said Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton who is a former Fed vice chairman. ''I think the Fed is feeling much more comfortable today.'' 
 Indeed, other data have turned positive. Retail sales in April beat expectations. Employment growth picked up steam. An improving trade balance hinted that the surprisingly poor output growth reported for the first quarter was likely to be revised upward. 
 ''This is a normal midcycle phenomenon, where growth is not at its boom-time highs and inflation is not at its post-recession lows,'' said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist of the Dreyfus Corporation. 
 Excluding energy costs, which rose 4.5 percent, and food prices, which rose 0.7 percent, consumer prices remained mostly subdued. 
 Clothing prices, which inexplicably jumped 0.8 percent in March, declined by 0.6 percent last month. Hotel prices fell 1.2 percent in April, giving back part of their 3.9 percent rise the month before. Even inflation in medical care, which has consistently outpaced price increases for other products and services, slowed to 0.2 percent, the most muted since February 2003.
 Over all, Mr. Hoey said, the rise of 2.2 percent in core consumer prices over the last 12 months ''is pretty close to where the Fed hoped we would be'' since 2003, when core inflation bottomed at 1.1 percent and economists were worrying about the prospect of falling prices. 
 The question is how far prices will rise from here. Producer prices have been picking up, indicating that inflation is building at earlier stages of production. Excluding food and energy, the price of finished goods was up 2.6 percent in April from a year earlier. Intermediate materials, minus food and energy, were up 6.6 percent. Some companies have been starting to pass on those increases.
 Yet Robert S. Gay, a former economist at the Federal Reserve who currently is managing partner at Fenwick Advisers, an investment advisory firm in New York, noted that oil prices have receded from their peaks and should thus reduce inflation in coming months. 
 ''There's a good chance next month the Consumer Price Index is going to be a negative number,'' Mr. Gay said. ''This will relieve concerns over the pass-through of higher oil prices.''
 Also, the dollar appears to have hit a bottom and has risen against other major currencies, reducing the risk of importing inflation. 
 And there seems to be little inflationary pressure on wages. Average hourly earnings of ordinary workers are still 1 percent below their level a year ago in constant dollars. Despite falling unemployment, the labor market still shows some slack, with the employment-to-population rate at 62.6 percent, some two percentage points less than its peak in 2000.
 ''The story of a gradual upward drift in core inflation is still intact, but a big upsurge doesn't look very plausible here,'' said Mr. Hoey at Dreyfus.

HEADLINE: Below the Surface: Daydreams of Havana, and Other Cities, Too 

BYLINE: By AMEI WALLACH

 BODY:
Walking the dilapidated streets of Havana, the Cuban artist Carlos Garaicoa imagined an alternative universe. He pondered the Art Deco facades behind which dogs prowled debris-strewn lots and the disintegrating columns that supported nothing but sky. In 1993 he began transforming those ruins into artworks that seem as evocative as the city itself.
 He would pretend to prop up a building's walls with wooden beams and then photograph the results. On another photograph of a crumbling site he would superimpose absurd drawings or the outlines of utopian architectural structures. In 1996 he took his obsessions with cityscapes on the road, in an exhibition at the Art in General gallery in Manhattan that explored the relationship between Havana and New York. Several of the works featured an object photographed on the streets of both cities. Another juxtaposed a photograph of a young Cuban in Havana who literally wore his urban dream on his arm in the form of a tattoo of the World Trade Center towers with a photograph of the actual towers. 
 A growing number of artists around the world have begun looking at their city's streets as metaphors for politics, culture and history. Mr. Garaicoa's tragicomic view of Havana travels particularly well. At 37, he is a rising star of international art fairs who has translated his urban excavations into riffs not just on Havana but on cities as disparate as Moscow and Los Angeles.
 Through July 17 his interpretations of Los Angeles and Havana are on view at the Pacific Design Center of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. This survey of his recent work, ''Carlos Garaicoa: Capablanca's real passion,'' includes pop-up books, videos, architectural models and rice paper lanterns whose glowing shapes evoke a nocturnal metropolis idealized from afar.
 ''Everybody who lives in a city knows what I am talking about,'' Mr. Garaicoa said in a recent telephone interview from Havana, explaining his fascination with urban centers. ''In the complexity of a big city, a lot of people are fighting for something, looking for something. So the city is a very rich subject to make work about love, hate, history, beauty, what people expect from life and how politics get involved.''
 Mr. Garaicoa (pronounced gar-eye-CO-ah) lives in Havana with his wife and son. But he often spends weeks, even months, reconnoitering the cities where he will show his works. 
 But in the case of Los Angeles, he made only one short visit, in March 2004. There, Alma Ruiz, a Museum of Contemporary Art curator who organized the exhibition , pointed out an abandoned storage building at the edge of the Santa Monica Freeway that was scheduled for demolition. He photographed it then but was never able to return for the next stage: photographing the site after the building was torn down (a friend did that for him) or even to see the exhibition. 
 Last fall his visa application was turned down, something that has happened to other Cubans over the last year under the Bush administration's tightened restrictions on Cuba. 
 To complete plans for the Los Angeles exhibition, Ms. Ruiz had to catch up with Mr. Garaicoa in Moscow in January, where he was participating in that city's first biennale. 
 There he displayed the techniques that result in his Los Angeles exhibition, as in the before-and-after photographs of the storage building site. That final work paired huge black-and-white photographs: on the left the shabby Art Deco building against a cloudy sky; on the right, the vacant lot with an outline of the former building traced in red thread.
 In Moscow, however, his photographed reconstructions had a harsher edge. It was in Russia, he said, that he found the roots of so much that he deplores in Soviet-influenced Cuba. 
 ''I wondered, how did Cuba get involved in all that?'' he said in an interview in Moscow in January. ''We come from African gods; when we have problems, we go to the beach.'' The Moscow installation is called ''To transform the political speech in fact, finally.'' It includes black-and-white photographs of Havana streets and buildings on which he stitched in red the outlines of the avant-garde architecture of the 1920's Russian Constructionists. In glass cases, he displayed sheets of Soviet stamps imprinted with current Cuban political slogans. The thread architectural drawings represented the exuberance of the first years of revolution; the stamps the export of a stale ideology to Cuba. 
 ''I'm bringing back to Russia all this official propaganda that doesn't belong to me,'' he explained.
 The Los Angeles exhibition, ''Capablanca's real passion,'' takes its title from another of Mr. Garaicoa's works that explores Cuban-American relations. It consists of a chessboard on which the pieces have been arranged to reproduce a moment in the 1918 New York chess match between the American champion, Frank Marshall, and Jose Raul Capablanca, the Cuban who defeated him.
 ''My idea is that America and Cuba have been playing a game of chess for a century,'' Mr. Garaicoa said. 
 The chess pieces are fantastical models of old Havana buildings as well as the boxy high rises, nuclear reactors and television towers of the modernist enterprise that visionaries once believed would change the world. If the buildings were removed from the board, he said in the telephone interview, the landscape would change, just as political and economic forces change cities. ''My art is not political,'' he said. ''But it is playing a game with politics. It is a little judgment of history.''

HEADLINE: Iran Seeks Incentives From Europe in Nuclear Impasse

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: TEHRAN, May 18 

 BODY:
The European Union and Iran will not break the impasse over restraining Iran's nuclear development program unless the Europeans offer significant incentives like a deal for 10 nuclear reactors, a top Iranian negotiator said Wednesday. 
 But no incentives will persuade Iran to abandon its plans to enrich fuel, said Hossein Mousavian, a negotiator with Iran's Supreme National Security Council. That is the central demand of the United States, which suspects that Iran would divert the resulting fuel to make nuclear arms.
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mousavian accused the Europeans of stalling, saying, ''The maximum announced was U.S. readiness to give spare parts for used airplanes, which is just a joke as the result of three months of negotiations.'' 
 The top Iranian negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, is scheduled to meet with the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany in Paris on Tuesday to try to break the deadlock that stalled the last round of negotiations on April 29. 
 Although Iran has suspended fuel enrichment during negotiations, Mr. Mousavian emphasized that the suspension of all aspects of the fuel cycle could last only a few more months. 
 ''We would be prepared to continue suspension of enrichment for two to three more months, or some months, to test whether there would be any outcome of negotiations,'' he said. 
 He said Iran would provide whatever guarantees or provisions for inspections might be necessary to prove that it was not diverting the fuel to build nuclear weapons. ''Iran is 100 percent flexible, open, ready to negotiate, to compromise on any mechanism, but not cessation,'' he said. 
 For example, he said, Iran has proposed reaching a complete enrichment cycle in four phases over two years in order for the West to grow confident that it was not trying to build nuclear weapons. ''In terms of the different phases and the time of each phase, we have not closed the door for the Europeans,'' he said. 
 The fuel cycle starts with converting uranium ore, known as yellowcake, to gas, which is then fed into centrifuges for enrichment. The level of enrichment depends on how many times the gas is fed through the centrifuge. At low levels, the fuel can be used for nuclear power; the highest level of enrichment produces fuel that can be used to make nuclear bombs. 
 It remains unclear that phases spread over two years would constitute much of a compromise, since some of the more technical aspects of the fuel cycle, including building the 3,000 centrifuges that Iran wants to enrich uranium, might take that long anyway. 
 In exchange for allowing international inspectors to monitor every stage of the process, Iran expects a major package of incentives involving its security, political stability and economic development, Mr. Mousavian noted. 
 Iranian officials, scientists and scholars interviewed over the past few days all insisted that Iran would never give up its right as a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to enrich fuel for peaceful means. Iran needs to enrich fuel to ensure a steady supply of electricity, develop related medical technologies and advance technologically, they said. 
 The Americans and the European Union counter that Iran forfeited the right to peaceful nuclear technology because it organized a deliberate effort to hide the activity, facilities and materials of its nuclear development program from the rest of the world for two decades. 
 Iran seeks to use the nuclear issue to end the international isolation it has been subjected to in varying degrees since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, analysts in Tehran believe, so it cares less about the timing of the steps than about getting an agreement. 
 But so far Iran has seen nothing to indicate that the European trio, backed by the United States, is even contemplating offering the level of incentives Tehran expects. ''The other side is still at the point of zero,'' Mr. Mousavian said.
 Negotiators had anticipated delaying further talks until after the June 17 presidential elections in Iran, waiting to see what kind of government would emerge. But there is widespread consensus among Iranians that the country should be allowed to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
 Possible compromises that would allow Iran to have a limited number of centrifuges to enrich uranium are being discussed, if not yet negotiated. 
 Some experts believe that it is better to allow Iran to have an open program that can be monitored rather than a clandestine one that it would probably build anyway. 
 ''It's much better to have 500 centrifuges under the eye of everybody than 50 clandestine ones out in the desert somewhere,'' said one expert on nonproliferation talks who did not want his name or country linked to this proposal. 
 A senior European diplomat familiar with the proposal said if Iran had only 500 centrifuges, it would take 10 years or so to make enough material for one bomb. However, American officials have said that even a small number of centrifuges would allow Iran to master the technology. 
 Iran, however, has proposed that it move step by step through the stages of uranium enrichment, including installing 3,000 centrifuges in its enrichment plant at Natanz. That level would certainly give it enough material for a bomb, and it is also the basic building block for Iran's eventual plans to build 50,000 centrifuges. 
 But there are concerns that Iran, as it improved its knowledge from any small program it is allowed to run, might build a secret parallel system on a military base that international inspectors could not detect. 
 Iran denies any interest in developing a bomb. Officials and scientists interviewed said they found the move to deny Iran nuclear technology particularly grating because before the Islamic Revolution, the West had offered to help Iran develop nuclear power. The United States had been willing to sell Iran 23 nuclear power plants, Germany was building the Bushehr nuclear reactor -- which the Russians are finally scheduled to help complete next year -- and France signed a contract to supply nuclear fuel. 
 Asked for a specific example of the kind of incentive Iran now seeks, Mr. Mousavian said, ''Europe can agree in principle to a contract for 10 nuclear power plants for Iran.'' 
 Given that major American companies hold the licenses for the most advanced nuclear power plants, and that significant investment in Iran is banned under American sanctions, such a deal would be impossible without American approval. But Iran considers sanctions a problem to be solved by European negotiators, not Iran, Mr. Mousavian said.
 The European trio, backed by the United States, has sought through the talks to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for guaranteed fuel supplies from abroad. 
 But in recent weeks Iran has threatened to restart the first step in the processing of raw uranium at its uranium conversion plant at Isfahan, although not the enrichment itself, if the talks remain deadlocked. 
 The European Union said any Iranian moves to start the fuel cycle, even the steps before enrichment, would prompt it to break off the talks and refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council for possible penalties. 
 Iran admits to hiding significant elements of its nuclear development program from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations watchdog against nuclear proliferation, over almost two decades. It said such subterfuge was necessary because of the sanctions against it. Iran is suspected by some proliferation experts of hiding a secret program to develop nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Acts on Currency To Discourage Speculators

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 18 

 BODY:
Monetary authorities here changed the link between this territory's currency and the United States dollar on Wednesday, in an attempt to discourage speculators from using the local currency as a way to bet on a possible move by China to let its currency appreciate against the dollar.
 The action by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority underscored a problem being faced by central banks across East Asia. Currency traders are moving large sums around the region in the hope of profiting if China allows its currency, the yuan, to become worth more dollars.
 Since 1983, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has maintained a floor for the Hong Kong dollar, initially at 7.75 to the United States dollar and at 7.80 to the dollar since 1998. It has intervened when necessary in currency markets to make sure the Hong Kong dollar does not weaken beyond that level. 
 Until Wednesday, however, the authority, which has some of the functions of a central bank, never declared a ceiling for the currency's value, although it intervened occasionally to stop appreciation and kept the currency effectively pegged at 7.80 to the American dollar. 
 A ceiling, on the other hand, would prevent the Hong Kong dollar from strengthening beyond a certain limit, which the authority set on Wednesday at 7.75 to the United States dollar. 
 The absence of a ceiling has prompted currency traders and investors from around the world to pour money into Hong Kong in the hope that the Hong Kong dollar might also appreciate if China were to let the yuan rise. 
 This inflow has kept interest rates here unusually low -- close to zero -- for bank deposits and has fed a wave of real estate speculation, as wealthy investors have borrowed heavily to buy luxury apartments with prices now approaching $4,000 a square foot. 
 The monetary authority's action on Wednesday evening was intended to stop the speculation by eliminating the previous floor for the currency. Instead, the currency will be allowed to trade in a range from 7.75 to 7.85 to the dollar, setting a new limit on the currency's appreciation and also lowering the floor for the currency slightly.
 Joseph Yam, the monetary authority's chief executive, said that he did not know whether China would let the yuan rise someday, but added that Wednesday's change was intended to ''reduce the usage of the Hong Kong dollar as a vehicle for speculation on a revaluation.''
 James Malcolm, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in Singapore, said the new rules would make it harder for currency traders to use the Hong Kong dollar for bets on the value of the yuan. ''It makes it a lot less attractive,'' he said.
 Mr. Yam said that he hoped that speculative money would be withdrawn from Hong Kong as soon as possible. The monetary authority also regulates the territory's banks, and Mr. Yam has worried publicly this spring that banks flush with overseas money might make ill-advised loans at very low interest rates as they struggled to find uses for the money flowing in. 
 The Chinese government makes it hard to invest directly in the yuan, by severely limiting most money coming into the country except in connection with exports, imports and approved foreign investments. So speculators have taken to putting large sums of money into other Asian currencies in the hope that they will appreciate as well if the yuan rises.
 If the yuan rises, Chinese exports will tend to become more expensive and less competitive in overseas markets. Currency traders have been betting that if China lets the yuan appreciate, other central banks in the region will slow their intervention and let their currencies appreciate as well, because there would be less risk of losing foreign markets to Chinese exports.

HEADLINE: Decline Takes Bond Yield Back to Conundrum Level 

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note went below 4.10 percent yesterday for the first time since February, a move that could confound the Federal Reserve's effort to slow economic growth. At the same time, however, the rally in Treasuries appears to reflect a decline in inflationary fears.
 That view was given at least one day of support yesterday with the report that the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy costs, was unchanged in April. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent. 
 The last time the 10-year yield was this low, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said the surprisingly low level was a conundrum, given how far the central bank had already pushed up short-term interest rates.
 But as the yield breached that conundrum level again yesterday, dropping to 4.09 percent, investors responded positively, pushing up the three main stock gauges by more than 1 percent each. It was the third consecutive day of gains for stocks.
 Reduced inflationary concerns can be traced in part to China, according to some analysts. A few months ago, investors were worried that commodity prices, surging to multiyear highs, would stoke inflation. Now the recent plunge in the prices of industrial commodities, and China's ability to make low-cost goods that Americans like, are seen as putting downward pressure on prices.
 Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, said: ''The China game has been a dance between China as a force for inflation and China as a force for deflation. The forces for inflation seemed to be winning but now it looks like we are back to a force for deflation.''
 But some other analysts suggested that the drop of the 10-year yield yesterday was more a result of a recent rush of investors into the safe harbor of the Treasury market as both the investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond markets were roiled by the recent downgradings of General Motors and Ford to high-yield, or junk bond, status.
 Such concerns sent stocks sharply lower last week and started the bond rally. The rallies in both stocks and bonds may now pick up momentum, if investors conclude that inflation is not a threat even if the economy moves ahead at its current pace. Such a development, these investors would believe, could mean that the Fed would slow its pace of rate increases. 
 But with core inflation at the consumer level up 2.2 percent over the last year, despite the surprising April report, more proof may be needed to support a real -- rather than a one-day -- change in attitude. 
 And Fed policy makers are unlikely to be convinced. Lower longer-term Treasury rates are just what they do not want, because they keep mortgage rates low, fueling a housing and refinancing boom that needs to be curbed to avoid an inflationary pace of economic growth. In addition, some Fed members have expressed concerns about the increase in speculative activity in the housing market.
 So Fed policy makers are likely to keep sounding aggressive about raising interest rates in the weeks ahead, which may make some investors pause, especially if the stock and bond rallies continue.
 ''With the 10-year note at this level, the Fed rhetoric will remain uncompromising,'' said Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP. 
 Mr. Greenspan drew the conundrum line on Feb. 16, when he acknowledged in testimony to Congress that he could not explain the decline of longer-term rates despite the Fed's six increases in short-term rates from June to February. While the fed funds rate had jumped to 2.50 percent from 1 percent, the yield on the 10-year note had fallen to 4.10 percent, from 4.58 percent. 
 ''This development contrasts with most experience,'' Mr. Greenspan said, adding that ''other things being equal, increasing short-term interest rates are normally accompanied by a rise in longer-term yields.'' While Mr. Greenspan cited many possible reasons for this unusual happening, he ultimately concluded that ''it remains a conundrum.'' His comments set off a surge in interest rates, which took the 10-year Treasury yield as high as 4.64 percent in March. 
 Another reason given for the fall in the 10-year yield from that March level is that some investors have finally given up on betting that longer-term rates will rise significantly. Making a bet on that assumption was reasonable, given the rise in short-term rates engineered by the Federal Reserve since last June, but the bet has been a loser all year.
 William H. Gross, the manager of the world's biggest bond mutual fund -- the Pimco Total Return fund -- signaled Tuesday that he was moving in this direction when he said that he thought the 10-year yield would be in a range of 3 percent to 4.5 percent over the next three to five years
 Mr. Gross, in his investment outlook published Tuesday, said that the recycling of billions of dollars from Asia -- mostly from China's central bank -- into the Treasury market would also help keep Treasury rates low.
 This is because China, even if it revalues its currency, the yuan, later this year, will still have to buy dollars and sell yuan to prevent the yuan from becoming less competitive globally too quickly. And those dollars will be used to buy Treasuries, keeping rates lower by about a percentage point than they otherwise would be, according to Mr. Gross.
 Lundy Wright, who runs the Treasury desk at Nomura Securities International, said the rally in the Treasury market, was, in part, a flight to quality because of the turmoil in the corporate bond market. He said that money managers were reducing their bets until the smoke cleared. What is not contestable is that the bond market continues to be volatile as investors shift sentiment on a dime in a global economic environment where uncertainty seems to be one of the few constants. This means yesterday's move could reverse quickly.

HEADLINE: How to Make It? No Shortage of TV Gurus 

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
With corporate greed and boardroom scandals long in the headlines, entrepreneurs are swiftly replacing corporate titans as America's business idols. And to cash in on that luster, a host of new television and radio shows, and even an Internet television network, are tracking their ups and downs, advising them on ways to revitalize their struggling start-ups and even setting them up in contests for an investment pot of gold.
 Whatever their slant, the new programs all zero in on ordinary folk who have caught the entrepreneurial bug. The producers seek big audiences by playing to the dream many Americans harbor of chucking their jobs and striking out on their own.
 A survey by Harris International released this month found that one-third of American adults would like to start their own business within the next five years. The survey, for Yahoo Small Business, said the No.1 reason respondents gave was the desire to be their own boss. 
 The raft of new TV programs gives a taste of the pitfalls that lie in wait. One of the shows, CNN's ''The TurnAround,'' which began in February, finds ailing small businesses and then sends in advisers for three days to pinpoint the problems and give on-the-spot advice.
 In March, for example, it focused on Susan Owens, a homemaker in the Los Angeles area, and her troubled interior-design business, run from her home. Even though Ms. Owens, a franchisee of the Interiors by Decorating Den chain, was averaging $7,000 a sale and had a profit of $60,000 after seven months in business, she was struggling with a mountain of personal debt and lacked credit standing with vendors.
 The producers paired her up with Kathy Ireland, the designer and former model who founded Kathy Ireland Worldwide, a $1 billion home furnishings and clothing company.
 Ms. Ireland brought in her company's financial planner, who advised a tearful Ms. Owens to consolidate her mortgage debt, home equity debt and credit card debt into one loan that would save her $500 a month in payments and to set financial goals.
 She also urged her to establish a relationship with her local bank, in case she needed cash quickly, and to join local business organizations like the Chamber of Commerce to increase her profile.
 Ms. Ireland suggested that she lobby for additional business from every client she has worked with. Taking that advice, Ms. Owens is then shown closing a $16,000 deal to remodel a client's dining and living rooms and kitchen, and then talking her into a $15,000 project to overhaul the backyard.
 Finally, Ms. Ireland sent her Web designer to help Ms. Owens turn her Web site into a ''showroom online'' that would save her some of the hours she was spending on individual sales calls and presentations.
 The show, according to CNN's parent, Time Warner, has been drawing about 230,000 viewers in its Saturday morning time slot.
 ''Until now, there was a real gaping hole in programs for viewers who represent an extraordinary amount of employed Americans,'' said Andy Breslau, one of the show's executive producers. ''The program provides lessons on how to get through the problems and dilemmas that beginners encounter.''
 The 13 episodes made so far tackle issues ranging from marketing to meeting payroll to paying bills.
 While dispatching a specialist to show an entrepreneur how to get out of a jam is a new approach, giving advice to start-ups is not. Jeff and Rich Sloan have been fielding calls from despairing, or just befuddled, entrepreneurs for two and a half years on their hourlong weekend syndicated radio program ''StartupNation'' (www.startupnation.com).
 With 250,000 listeners each weekend, the brothers are planning a television spinoff. They are in talks with several cable and network channels, Jeff Sloan said, for a series that would borrow from ''StartupNation's'' coaching segment, offering tips to flailing businesses or to someone who wants to start a business.
 Another TV show in development is Lifetime Entertainment's ''Ms. Mogul,'' modeled after the real estate developer Donald J. Trump's megahit, ''The Apprentice,'' in which job contestants compete to avoid his signature ''You're fired!'' Instead of striving to work for a mogul, however, 13 women with entrepreneurial leanings will be vying -- if the show is approved -- for a prize of up to $1 million in seed money. 
 The show's possible format would call for assigning each woman a mentor to help create a business or bolster an existing one. The show is being put together by Nely Galan, producer of a cosmetic makeover show, ''The Swan.''
 A real-life competition called ''The Pitch,'' which follows 30 teams from a number of countries battling for $150,000 in start-up money, already is being shown on www.mootcorptv.com, operated by iVEAA of Austin, Tex., a media company dedicated to helping entrepreneurs.
 In the next few months, iVEAA plans to begin taping episodes for a new cable series on high-profile entrepreneurs, said Lyn Graft, the company's co-founder. Another program skips the gimmicks and gets down to the nitty-gritty. Since November, the Small Business Television Network, based in St. Louis, has been running twice weekly a half-hour news magazine called ''Small Business Beat.'' 
 One recent segment focused on Margaret McEntire, of Little Rock, Ark., who overcame two business failures to create the Candy Bouquet franchise chain, which sells candy arrangements for birthdays and other celebrations.
 In addition, since January 2004 the network has been serving up daily advice around the clock on its Web site and is ''almost profitable,'' according to the chief executive and executive producer, Susan Wilson Solovic. 
 Ms. Solovic says she believes the venture is tapping into a rich but overlooked vein. ''The reason there is such a proliferation of small-business-oriented shows is that clearly, small businesses are driving the economy,'' she said. ''They have two-thirds of the work force and are creating the net new jobs. Advertisers recognize that.''
 Public television hopped aboard the how-to trend early with a 1994 program, now called ''Small Business School,'' which profiles entrepreneurs. More than 200 stations broadcast the half-hour program, which recently had a segment on female business owners in male-dominated industries, like Pamela Rodgers, owner of a Chevrolet dealership in Woodhaven, Mich.
 Two other two long-running public television programs -- ''Black Enterprise Report,'' produced by Central City Productions in Chicago, and ''Making It!,'' a half-hour weekly program produced in Los Angeles -- are aimed at minority entrepreneurs.
 CNN was not the only cable channel to broadcast a makeover series. Last summer, the TLC cable network ran ''Taking Care of Business,'' which sent turnaround specialists to outfits as diverse as a bed-and-breakfast, a skateboard store, a luncheonette, a bakery, an Internet cafe and a barbershop.
 Despite a core of passionate viewers, TLC canceled the show in January because the numbers had not grown quickly enough, Don Halcombe, a network spokesman, said.
 Sometimes advice doled out on the air can be hard to take. In a CNN ''TurnAround'' episode, a former Nascar driver, Randy Baker, balked at the recommendation of Robby Gordon, a fellow racer and entrepreneur, to solicit cash from corporations in exchange for splashing company logos on Mr. Baker's vintage cars. But in the end, he realized he had no alternative if he wanted to stay afloat.
 ''Sometimes there's a lot of tension,'' said the show's host, Ali Velshi, who gained his entrepreneurial experience in his family's bagel shop. ''It's not all happy, but it's cathartic.''

HEADLINE: Pataki Orders Special Meeting On Stadium

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
After plans to win Albany's approval for a West Side stadium were stymied by a little-known state board on Tuesday, Gov. George E. Pataki took the unusual step yesterday of calling a special meeting of the board for next week to give the stadium another chance. 
 But it is far from clear that the passage of a week will erode the objections raised by the leaders of the State Legislature, Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Both men said today they still had grave concerns about the project, and both have the power to kill it. 
 The governor had pulled the matter off the agenda of the Public Authorities Control Board meeting on Tuesday, after Mr. Bruno, a Republican who controls one of the three seats on the board, asked for a one-month delay to resolve unanswered issues concerning the financing.
 But both Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have insisted that a positive vote is critical to the city's chances of winning the 2012 Olympics and redeveloping the West Side.
 Acknowledging that there is ''a lot of opposition to the stadium,'' Mr. Pataki said, ''I just want to do what is right for the people of New York, that is to build the stadium, to get it approved, and I'm going to continue to push for it.''
 Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have both requested additional information on the legal and financial issues swirling around the stadium plan, and yesterday neither gave the impression that the special meeting called by the governor next Wednesday would force their approval. 
 Either one can still delay or veto the project at that meeting, although they are reluctant to be personally accused of losing the Olympics for the city.
 ''Deadlines are great,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''But what we need to do is deal in reality. We need to deal in facts. We need to deal with what's best for the West Side development, which all of us support.'' He added that he wanted to see the state's $300 million investment in the stadium balanced by similar spending upstate.
 As for Mr. Silver, he said yesterday that he remained concerned that the public investment in the project exceeded ''the $600 million that's been advertised'' and worried that the push for commercial development on the West Side would undermine the rebuilding of his downtown district. He plans to unveil his own downtown plan in a speech tomorrow. 
 The control board -- a body that governs the state's many public authorities -- held its regularly-scheduled meeting yesterday without taking up the stadium. Its agenda was tightly held; even some of the members did not know the agenda until they arrived. Then, after very little discussion or debate, the board approved more than $1 billion in new borrowing or refinancing in about 40 minutes.
 Senator Thomas K. Duane of Manhattan, who, as the representative of the Democratic minority in the Senate, is entitled to sit on the board but not to vote, questioned several proposals. He asked what the $209.5 million that the Urban Development Corporation was being given permission to borrow would be used for, and what the $235 million that the Dormitory Authority was being given permission to borrow would be used for. He got no answers.
 The resolutions approved by the board show that the money will be divided up for ''economic development'' projects according to memorandums of understanding signed by Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno -- money often described in Albany as pork.
 The board may be obscure, but it holds enormous power over many of the city's biggest redevelopment projects. If the governor and the mayor have their way, it would approve a project that they say will transform the low-scale neighborhood on the West Side, providing thousands of jobs and sparking development nearby.
 But the board could also block the state's $300 million subsidy for the stadium, which would be used for football games, conventions, and possibly, the Olympics. More important, state officials acknowledged for the first time this week that the board ultimately has the power to kill the stadium project, the keystone of Mr. Bloomberg's bid for the 2012 Olympics and the redevelopment of the West Side.
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority owns the West Side site and plans to sell development rights for the project to the Jets for $250 million. But without the board's approval, the stadium site could not be transferred to the state for redevelopment and rezoning.
 ''The project cannot go forward unless the P.A.C.B. approves it,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the transportation authority. 
 In essence, that makes the Jets plan contingent on the board's vote. But both the Jets and the transportation authority said earlier that the sale was not contingent on any public vote or rezoning, and the issue has become a flashpoint in the suit against the project filed by several opponents, including Cablevision. Both are certain to make the board vote an issue in the suits.
 The board may yet get another vote if the city wins the Olympics bid. To convert the stadium from football to Olympic use, at an estimated additional cost of $142.5 million, the stadium would have to add about 10,000 seats, install a regulation track around the field and expand over the West Side Highway. That is likely to require approvals by federal, state and city agencies. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 2005

 CORRECTION:
The Metro Matters column yesterday, about the politics behind New York State leaders' positions on the proposed West Side stadium -- a project linked to New York City's bid for the 2012 Olympics -- misidentified another city in competition for the Games. (The error also occurred on Wednesday in an article about the postponement of a vote on the project by a state board.) The competing city is Madrid, not Lisbon. 
 A related article yesterday about Gov. George E. Pataki's call for a special meeting of the state board next week misstated the timing of comments by Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who said they had grave concerns about the project. They spoke on Wednesday, not yesterday.

HEADLINE: Shares Rally as Price Report Eases Fears About Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, capping their biggest three-day rally in six months, after a consumer price report suggested that the economy can sustain growth without igniting inflation and as oil prices dropped below $48 a barrel. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 132.57 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,464.45. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 11.76 points, or 1 percent, to 1,185.56. The Nasdaq composite index increased 26.50 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,030.65. 
 All three benchmarks had their best three-day performance since November. Both the S.&P. 500 and Dow industrials closed at their highest since April 12.
 More than five stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.8 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 10 percent more than the three-month average.
 Prices paid by consumers, excluding food and energy, were unchanged in April, the Labor Department said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected a 0.2 percent gain. Including those items, prices increased 0.5 percent, more than the 0.4 percent economists estimated.
 The figures bolster the view that inflation is under control, giving policy makers leeway to keep raising the target interest rate in steps of a quarter percentage point each. The Fed has increased borrowing costs eight consecutive times since June and has said future increases will be made at a ''measured pace.''
 Investors are ''concerned more than anything about continued interest rate increases by the Fed,'' said Tom Wirth, who manages $1.3 billion at Chemung Canal Trust in Elmira, N.Y. ''As soon as the Fed is done raising rates, you're going to see this market really take off.''
 He expects the central bank to signal its intention to stop increasing rates at its meetings in June or August.
 Prices of Treasury securities also rose on the report. By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note was up 7/32, to 10010/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.09 percent, from 4.11 percent on Tuesday. 
 Crude oil for June delivery sank 3.5 percent, to $47.25 a barrel in New York, the lowest close since Feb. 11, after an Energy Department report showed that United States oil inventories rose more than expected.
 An index of financial companies climbed 1.1 percent. Citigroup added 58 cents, to $47.74. Bank of America increased 51 cents, to $46.65.
 An index of raw material producers surged 2.4 percent for the best performance among 10 S.&P. 500 industry groups. China's industrial output rose 16 percent in April, faster than the highest forecast by economists, spurring optimism that the country will drive commodity demand and a rally in prices.
 Alcoa, the aluminum maker, gained 64 cents, to $27.85. The steel maker Nucor added $2.34, to $52.74. The company's chief executive, Daniel DiMicco, said American steel prices, down about 20 percent since October, would rebound in the next two months as distributors work off excess inventories. United States Steel climbed $1.74, to $41.02. Allegheny Technologies, a stainless steel producer, gained $1.29, to $21.23.
 Hewlett-Packard climbed $1, or 4.6 percent, to $22.55. The company's second-quarter profit and sales beat the average estimates of analysts in a Thomson Financial survey.
 Computer-related stocks rose after Steven Milunovich, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, recommended that investors buy shares of technology companies because their earnings might benefit from a pickup in spending. I.B.M. climbed $2.07, to $76.36. A measure of computer-related shares on the S.&P. 500 increased 1.3 percent. The group has slumped 5.7 percent in 2005, compared with a 2.2 percent loss in the benchmark.
 Google, the most-used Internet search engine, added $6.03, to $239.16. The company released a free product to find files and e-mail messages on business computers.
 MetLife, the No.1 life insurer, sank $1.29, or 2.9 percent, to $42.73, for the S.&P. 500's steepest drop. The company will add ''significantly more good will'' to its balance sheet from its purchase of Travelers Life and Annuity than investors believe, a Lehman Brothers Holdings analyst, Eric Berg, wrote. He cut the stock to equal weight from overweight.

HEADLINE: China Rejects Calls for Currency Changes and Limits on Textile Exports

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 18 

 BODY:
Chinese officials on Wednesday angrily rebuffed both Washington's blunt demand that China loosen its fixed exchange rate policy and Europe's threat of quotas on a tide of Chinese textiles. 
 The United States should ''put its own house in order before blaming others'' for its trade deficit, said Wei Benhua, deputy director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which manages China's currency reserves. Mr. Wei made his comments at a conference in Singapore, according to Bloomberg News.
 On Tuesday, the United States Treasury made the most stinging official attack so far on China's foreign exchange policy in a report that warned China to revalue its yuan -- pegged at 8.28 to the dollar. The report hinted at retaliation if the yuan was not allowed to appreciate. 
 In Beijing on Wednesday, China's minister of commerce, Bo Xilai, criticized the European Union's threat to impose restrictions on Chinese textiles, calling the decision hypocritical.
 ''Everybody is espousing free trade, but there shouldn't be double standards,'' Mr. Bo said to a meeting of international business leaders. ''When you have an absolute advantage, you advocate free trade and make everyone open the door, but when developing countries begin to challenge you, you immediately set limits and shut the door.''
 But reactions from Chinese bankers and officials, including recent comments from the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, suggest that China is unlikely to revalue its currency soon or to bow to Western limits on Chinese garment exports.
 Indeed, the public chastisement of China in Washington, and the accompanying burst of market speculation on the timing of an exchange rate shift, may make it less likely China will make the swift changes demanded.
 ''The U.S. government and experts are entitled to have their views on China's exchange rate, and I don't feel the pressure in itself is a problem,'' Li Lihui, the president of the Bank of China, said. ''But the problem is that this public pressure brings in its wake rising speculative factors, and those speculative pressures make it less likely, not more likely, China can move.'' 
 China is committed to a ''step by step'' loosening of its exchange rate, by expanding the band in which the yuan trades against the dollar, Mr. Li said. ''But the hotter the market speculation, the more we can't move,'' he added.
 Chinese foreign ministry and central bank representatives had no immediate reaction to the Treasury Department's report. 
 The Chinese spokesmen instead pointed to Mr. Wen's comments on Monday defending the country's gradual approach to exchange rate reform and contending that the pressure for change on the currency, known also as renminbi, or RMB, was an affront to sovereignty.
 ''Reform of the RMB exchange rate belongs to China's sovereignty,'' Mr. Wen told a delegation from the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''We'll respect the laws of the market economy, but we won't bow to external pressure, or any pressure or speculation. Politicizing economic issues doesn't help solve problems.''
 But without concrete action, China will face increasing anger in Washington, said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the chamber, who attended the meeting with Mr. Wen. ''The Chinese are very aware we have a serious problem in Washington right now,'' Mr. Donohue said. 
 The American trade deficit with China soared to a record $162 billion in 2004, and was followed by a tide of Chinese textile exports that resulted in the announcement of new quotas last week.
 Any likely adjustment of China's exchange rate would be marginal and not rapidly reverse the United States' trade deficit with China, Mr. Donohue said. ''But I think it will change the relationship deficit,'' he said, referring to the growing strains between the countries. In a country where memories of colonial economic subjugation run deep, however, the Treasury's demands may have the effect of making concessions on exchange rate policy politically risky, bankers in China said.
 ''Outside pressure is actually becoming a political obstacle,'' said Chen Xingdong, the chief China economist of BNP Paribas Peregrine Securities. ''It's a political one, because China cannot be seen making a decision based on external pressure.''
 Kenneth Lieberthal, a China expert at the University of Michigan and former National Security Council official, said the pressure ''encourages them to both reform and also to dig in their heels.'' Speaking at a news briefing here, he added that China's leaders ''really value an approach that makes it appear that bullying China doesn't work.''
 Recent indicators, which reflect some cooling in China's economy and a surge in currency speculation, make it even less likely China will opt for an early shift in exchange rate policy, Mr. Chen said. 
 A recent spike in one-year nondeliverable forward contracts in Hong Kong -- a financial instrument that allows investors to wager on the future value of China's currency -- as well as China's swelling foreign currency coffers, suggest speculative pressures have recently grown, he said.
 And Chinese bankers said the government might not want to alter the exchange rate at a time when speculative pressure might overwhelm China's brittle financial defenses.

HEADLINE: Up From the Holler: Living in Two Worlds, At Home in Neither

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: PIKEVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
Della Mae Justice stands before the jury in the Pike County Courthouse, arguing that her client's land in Greasy Creek Hollow was illegally grabbed when the neighbors expanded their cemetery behind her home. 
 With her soft Appalachian accent, Ms. Justice leaves no doubt that she is a local girl, steeped in the culture of the old family cemeteries that dot the mountains here in East Kentucky. ''I grew up in a holler, I surely did,'' she tells jurors as she lays out the boundary conflict.
 Ms. Justice is, indeed, a product of the Appalachian coal-mining country where lush mountains flank rust-colored creeks, the hollows rising so steeply that there is barely room for a house on either side of the creeks. Her family was poor, living for several years in a house without indoor plumbing. Her father was absent; her older half-brother sometimes had to hunt squirrels for the family to eat. Her mother married again when Della was 9. But the stepfather, a truck driver, was frequently on the road, and her mother, who was mentally ill, often needed the young Della to care for her. 
 Ms. Justice was always hungry for a taste of the world beyond the mountains. Right after high school, she left Pike County, making her way through college and law school, spending time in France, Scotland and Ireland, and beginning a high-powered legal career. In just a few years she moved up the ladder from rural poverty to the high-achieving circles of the middle class.
 Now, at 34, she is back home. But her journey has transformed her so thoroughly that she no longer fits in easily. Her change in status has left Ms. Justice a little off balance, seeing the world from two vantage points at the same time: the one she grew up in and the one she occupies now.
 Far more than people who remain in the social class they are born to, surrounded by others of the same background, Ms. Justice is sensitive to the cultural significance of the cars people drive, the food they serve at parties, where they go on vacation -- all the little clues that indicate social status. By every conventional measure, Ms. Justice is now solidly middle class, but she is still trying to learn how to feel middle class. Almost every time she expresses an idea, or explains herself, she checks whether she is being understood, asking, ''Does that make sense?''
 ''I think class is everything, I really do,'' she said recently. ''When you're poor and from a low socioeconomic group, you don't have a lot of choices in life. To me, being from an upper class is all about confidence. It's knowing you have choices, knowing you set the standards, knowing you have connections.''

Broken Ties
 In Pikeville, the site of the Hatfield-McCoy feud (Ms. Justice is a Hatfield), memories are long and family roots mean a lot. Despite her success, Ms. Justice worries about what people might remember about her, especially about the time when she was 15 and her life with her mother and stepfather imploded in violence, sending her into foster care for a wretched nine months.
 ''I was always in the lowest socioeconomic group,'' she said, ''but foster care ratcheted it down another notch. I hate that period of my life, when for nine months I was a child with no family.''
 While she was in foster care, Ms. Justice lived in one end of a double-wide trailer, with the foster family on the other end. She slept alongside another foster child, who wet the bed, and every morning she chose her clothes from a box of hand-me-downs. She was finally rescued when her father heard about her situation and called his nephew, Joe Justice.
 Joe Justice was 35 years older than Della, a successful lawyer who lived in the other Pikeville, one of the well-to-do neighborhoods on the mountain ridges. He and his wife, Virginia, had just built a four-bedroom contemporary home, complete with a swimming pool, on Cedar Gap Ridge.
 Joe Justice had never even met his cousin until he saw her in the trailer, but afterward he told his wife that it was ''abhorrent'' for a close relative to be in foster care. While poverty is common around Pikeville, foster care is something much worse: a sundering of the family ties that count for so much. So Joe and Virginia Justice took Della Mae in. She changed schools, changed address -- changed worlds, in effect -- and moved into an octagonal bedroom downstairs from the Justices' 2 year-old son.
 ''The shock of going to live in wealth, with Joe and Virginia, it was like Little Orphan Annie going to live with the Rockefellers,'' Ms. Justice said. ''It was not easy. I was shy and socially inept. For the first time, I could have had the right clothes, but I didn't have any idea what the right clothes were. I didn't know much about the world, and I was always afraid of making a wrong move. When we had a school trip for chorus, we went to a restaurant. I ordered a club sandwich, but when it came with those toothpicks on either end, I didn't know how to eat it, so I just sat there, staring at it and starving, and said I didn't feel well.''
 Joe and Virginia Justice worried about Della Mae's social unease and her failure to mingle with other young people in their church. But they quickly sensed her intelligence and encouraged her to attend Berea College, a small liberal arts institution in Kentucky that accepts students only from low-income families. Tuition is free and everybody works. For Ms. Justice, as for many other Berea students, the experience of being one among many poor people, all academically capable and encouraged to pursue big dreams, was life-altering.
 It was at Berea that Ms. Justice met the man who became her husband, Troy Price, the son of a tobacco farmer with a sixth-grade education. They married after graduation, and when Ms. Justice won a fellowship, the couple went to Europe for a year of independent travel and study. When Ms. Justice won a scholarship to the University of Kentucky law school in Lexington, Mr. Price went with her, to graduate school in family studies.
 After graduating fifth in her law school class, Ms. Justice clerked for a federal judge, then joined Lexington's largest law firm, where she put in long hours in hopes of making partner. She and her husband bought a townhouse, took trips, ate in restaurants almost every night and spent many Sunday afternoons at real estate open houses in Lexington's elegant older neighborhoods. By all appearances, they were on the fast track. 
 But Ms. Justice still felt like an outsider. Her co-editors on the law review, her fellow clerks at the court and her colleagues at the law firm all seemed to have a universe of information that had passed her by. She saw it in matters big and small -- the casual references, to Che Guevara or Mount Vesuvius, that meant nothing to her; the food at dinner parties that she would not eat because it looked raw in the middle.
 ''I couldn't play Trivial Pursuit, because I had no general knowledge of the world,'' she said. ''And while I knew East Kentucky, they all knew a whole lot about Massachusetts and the Northeast. They all knew who was important, whose father was a federal judge. They never doubted that they had the right thing to say. They never worried about anything.''
 Most of all, they all had connections that fed into a huge web of people with power. ''Somehow, they all just knew each other,'' she said.

Knitting a New Family
 Ms. Justice's life took an abrupt turn in 1999, when her half-brother, back in Pike County, called out of the blue to say that his children, Will and Anna Ratliff, who had been living with their mother, were in foster care. Ms. Justice and her brother had not been close, and she had met the children only once or twice, but the call was impossible to ignore. As her cousin Joe had years earlier, she found it intolerable to think of her flesh and blood in foster care.
 So over the next year, Della Mae Justice and her husband got custody of both children and went back to Pikeville, only 150 miles away but far removed from their life in Lexington. The move made all kinds of sense. Will and Anna, now 13 and 12, could stay in touch with their mother and father. Mr. Price got a better job, as executive director of Pikeville's new support center for abused children. Ms. Justice went to work for her cousin at his law firm, where a flexible schedule allowed her to look after the two children.
 And yet for Ms. Justice the return to Pikeville has been almost as dislocating as moving out of foster care and into that octagonal bedroom all those years ago. On a rare visit recently to the hollows where she used to live, she was moved to tears when a neighbor came out, hugged her and told her how he used to pray and worry for her and how happy he was that she had done so well. But mostly, she winces when reminded of her past. 
 ''Last week, I picked up the phone in my office,'' she recalled, ''and the woman said who she was, and then said, 'You don't remember me, do you?' And I said, 'Were you in foster care with me?' That was crazy. Why would I do that? It's not something I advertise, that I was in care.''
 While most of her workweek is devoted to commercial law, Ms. Justice spends Mondays in family court, representing families with the kind of problems hers had. She bristles whenever she runs into any hint of class bias, or the presumption that poor people in homes heated by kerosene or without enough bedrooms cannot be good parents.
 ''The norm is, people that are born with money have money, and people who weren't don't,'' she said recently. ''I know that. I know that just to climb the three inches I have, which I've not gone very far, took all of my effort. I have worked hard since I was a kid and I've done nothing but work to try and pull myself out.''
 The class a person is born into, she said, is the starting point on the continuum. ''If your goal is to become, on a national scale, a very important person, you can't start way back on the continuum, because you have too much to make up in one lifetime. You have to make up the distance you can in your lifetime so that your kids can then make up the distance in their lifetime.''

Coming to Terms With Life
 Ms. Justice is still not fully at ease in the other, well-to-do Pikeville, and in many ways she and her husband had to start from scratch in finding a niche there. Church is where most people in town find friends and build their social life. But Ms. Justice and Mr. Price had trouble finding a church that was a comfortable fit; they went through five congregations, starting at the Baptist church she had attended as a child and ending up at the Disciples of Christ, an inclusive liberal church with many affluent members. The pastor and his wife, transplants to Kentucky, have become their closest friends. Others have come more slowly.
 ''Partly the problem is that we're young, for middle-class people, to have kids as old as Will and Anna,'' Ms. Justice said. ''And the fact that we're raising a niece and nephew, that's kind of a flag that we weren't always middle class, just like saying you went to Berea College tells everyone you were poor.''
 And though in terms of her work Ms. Justice is now one of Pikeville's leading citizens, she is still troubled by the old doubts and insecurities. ''My stomach's always in knots getting ready to go to a party, wondering if I'm wearing the right thing, if I'll know what to do,'' she said. ''I'm always thinking: How does everybody else know that? How do they know how to act? Why do they all seem so at ease?'' 
 A lot of her energy now goes into Will and Anna. She wants to bring them up to have the middle-class ease that still eludes her. ''Will and Anna know what it's like to be poor, and now we want them to be able to be just regular kids,'' she said. ''When I was young, I always knew who were the kids at school with the involved parents that brought in the cookies, and those were the kids who got chosen for every special thing, not ones like me, who got free lunch and had to borrow clothes from their aunt if there was a chorus performance.''
 Because Ms. Justice is self-conscious about her teeth -- ''the East Kentucky overbite,'' she says ruefully -- she made sure early on that Anna got braces. She worries about the children's clothes as much as her own. ''Everyone else seems to know when the khaki pants the boys need are on sale at J.C. Penney,'' she said. ''I never know these things.''
 As a child, Ms. Justice never had the resources for her homework projects. So when Anna was assigned to build a Navajo hogan, they headed to Wal-Mart for supplies. 
 "We put in extra time, so she would appear like those kids with the involved parents,'' Ms. Justice said. ''I know it's just a hogan, but making a project that looks like the other kids' projects is part of fitting in.'' 
 Ms. Justice encouraged Will to join the Boy Scouts, and when he was invited to join his school's Academic Team, which competes in quiz bowls, she insisted that he try it. When he asked her whether he might become a drug addict if he took the medicine prescribed for him, she told him it was an excellent question, and at the doctor's office prompted him to ask the doctor directly. She nudges both children to talk about what happens in school, to recount the plots of the books they read and to discuss current events. 
 It is this kind of guidance that distinguishes middle-class children from children of working-class and poor families, according to sociologists who have studied how social class affects child-rearing. While working-class parents usually teach their children, early on, to do what they are told without argument and to manage their own free time, middle-class parents tend to play an active role in shaping their children's activities, seeking out extracurricular activities to build their talents, and encouraging them to speak up and even to negotiate with authority figures. 
 Ms. Justice's efforts are making a difference. Will found that he enjoyed Academic Team. Anna now gets evening phone calls from several friends. Both have begun to have occasional sleepovers. And gradually, Ms. Justice is coming to terms with her own life. On New Year's Eve, after years in a modest rented townhouse, she and her husband moved into a new house that reminds her of the Brady Bunch home. It has four bedrooms and a swimming pool. In a few years, when her older cousin retires, Ms. Justice will most likely take over the practice, a solid prospect, though far less lucrative, and less glamorous, than a partnership at her Lexington law firm. 
 ''I've worked very hard all my life -- to have a life that's not so far from where I started out,'' she said. ''It is different, but it's not the magical life I thought I'd get.''

ABOUT THE SERIES
These articles are the third part of a series examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent nearly a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of unbounded opportunity. Previous articles can be found on nytimes.com.

Sunday: Preaching to the Elite

Della Mae Justice describes her childhood and the role class plays in her life today, and Dan Croteau and Cate Woolner talk about their marriage. Also, interactive graphics, a forum for reader responses and the series so far.

 Re ''Aide to Pataki Is Put in Charge at Ground Zero'' (front page, May 12):
 As a 9/11 widow who has tried to ensure that deadly mistakes are not repeated, I am thoroughly disgusted by the politics and greed surrounding the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site. 
 Since 9/11, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and others have been allowed to run roughshod ignoring the obvious -- that whatever is built on this site will be a terrorist target. Any rush to ''rebuild'' and ''revitalize'' this plot of ''prime'' real estate without addressing the Port Authority's operating above the law with its immunity from local building and fire codes is a call for disaster. 
 The 9/11 families have pleaded for the time to do things ''right.'' Yet the politicians, in their egotistical desire to leave their legacy, have pushed forward, ignoring those pleas and common sense. 
 Can we finally take pause? The sanctity and safety of human life must take precedence over economic greed. Gov. George E. Pataki's first order of business for his legacy should be making sure that all possible measures for safety and security are implemented -- not pretty, tall spires!

 Re ''Class in America: Shadowy Lines That Still Divide'' (''Class Matters'' series, front page, May 15):
 I would hope that the reaction of my fellow Times readers to your series about the growing, hardening social class divisions in America would be not a fatalistic acceptance but a revived commitment to the ideal of a classless society. 
 If we are to remain a democracy, we must make a determined national effort to reach a consensus on what truly constitutes the good life. We must strive to assure that not just a few but all American citizens can participate in it. 
 Wealth, luxuries and possessions for their own sakes should not be the chief desiderata so much as adequate food, clothing and shelter; good medical care; a good education; a healthy, pleasant environment; our cherished constitutional freedoms; spiritually and intellectually rewarding work (as opposed to the soul-killing drudgery that is now the lot of many rich as well as poor Americans); and the capacity to recognize, enjoy and augment the best things that our civilization has to offer.

To the Editor:
 Class is not as important socially or culturally as it once was, and almost all levels of American society can lead a relatively decent quality of life. But there is one distinct difference between the upper and lower classes in this country.
 The upper classes have the savings and thus financial security to weather health crises, retirement and periods of unemployment or low earnings. 
 As a fair society, we need to fully finance programs like Social Security and Medicare that help close this one lasting class division.

 You write about how upward mobility has declined since the 1970's. The article talks about the increased need for education and the inherited advantages and other factors without which it has become more difficult to move up the economic ladder.
 The article doesn't mention one of the biggest developments in that period. During the last 35 years, the ''war on poverty,'' with its wide array of programs, was put into effect and expanded. 
 Liberals claimed that the programs would help the poor. Opponents of the programs claimed that government assistance would stifle economic opportunity by creating a dependent underclass and burdening the middle class with heavy taxes.
 Based on your series, it appears that the conservatives were right.

 Contrary to the implication of ''Life at the Top Isn't Just Better, It's Longer,'' it is not news that wealthier Americans get more and better health care than lower income people.
 They also drive safer cars, eat healthier food and live in safer and less polluted neighborhoods.
 What is newsworthy (and underreported), however, is that with risk-pooling and undifferentiated benefit packages, everyone pays very similar health insurance premiums yet only the better-off enjoy gold-plated care.
 You offer some helpful explanations why lower income patients get less out of their health coverage. Another is that out-of-pocket co-payments deter the poor, not the rich, from using their jointly bought insurance to the fullest.
 Though it might be debatable whether inequality in the distribution of health care is unjust, a system that forces the maid and the utility worker to subsidize the architect's health care unquestionably is.

 As a cardiologist practicing in Canada since 1985, I read with interest your May 16 front-page article about the variability in the treatment of heart attacks in the United States depending on the patient's social status.
 The Canadian health care system may not be perfect. But any patient, regardless of social status, wealth or ability to pay, will have an angioplasty if required during a heart attack if he consults a doctor in a major city where that service is available. 
 The only criterion on which a treatment decision is made is based on the severity of the disease, not the size of the wallet.
 Patients of lower socioeconomic status, in Canada as in the United States, may have a shorter life expectancy because of their lifestyle, but not because of any difference in treatment during an acute problem. 
 I am proud of our health care system.

HEADLINE: A Marriage of Unequals

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: NORTHFIELD, Mass. 

 BODY:
When Dan Croteau met Cate Woolner six years ago, he was selling cars at the Keene, N.H., Mitsubishi lot and she was pretending to be a customer, test driving a black Montero while she and her 11-year-old son, Jonah, waited for their car to be serviced.
 The test drive lasted an hour and a half. Jonah got to see how the vehicle performed in off-road mud puddles. And Mr. Croteau and Ms. Woolner hit it off so well that she later sent him a note, suggesting that if he was not involved with someone, not a Republican and not an alien life form, maybe they could meet for coffee. Mr. Croteau dithered about the propriety of dating a customer, but when he finally responded, they talked on the phone from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.
 They had a lot in common. Each had two failed marriages and two children. Both love dancing, motorcycles, Bob Dylan, bad puns, liberal politics and National Public Radio. 
 But when they began dating, they found differences, too. The religious difference -- he is Roman Catholic, she is Jewish -- posed no problem. The real gap between them, both say, is more subtle: Mr. Croteau comes from the working class, and Ms. Woolner from money.
 Mr. Croteau, who will be 50 in June, grew up in Keene, an old mill town in southern New Hampshire. His father was a factory worker whose education ended at the eighth grade; his mother had some factory jobs, too. Mr. Croteau had a difficult childhood and quit school at 16. He then left home, joined the Navy and drifted through a long series of jobs without finding any real calling. He married his pregnant 19-year-old girlfriend and had two daughters, Lael and Maggie, by the time he was 24.
 ''I was raised in a family where my grandma lived next door, my uncles lived on the next road over, my dad's two brothers lived next to each other, and I pretty much played with my cousins,'' he said. ''The whole concept of life was that you should try to get a good job in the factory. My mother tried to encourage me. She'd say, 'Dan's bright; ask him a question.' But if I'd said I wanted to go to college, it would have been like saying I wanted to grow gills and breathe underwater.''
 He always felt that the rich people in town, ''the ones with their names on the buildings,'' as he put it, lived in another world.
 Ms. Woolner, 54, comes from that other world. The daughter of a doctor and a dancer, she grew up in a comfortable home in Hartsdale, N.Y., with the summer camps, vacations and college education that wealthy Westchester County families can take for granted. She was always uncomfortable with her money; when she came into a modest inheritance at 21, she ignored the monthly bank statements for several years, until she learned to channel her unease into philanthropy benefiting social causes. She was in her mid-30's and married to a psychotherapist when Isaac and Jonah were born.
 ''My mother's father had a Rolls-Royce and a butler and a second home in Florida,'' Ms. Woolner said, ''and from as far back as I can remember, I was always aware that I had more than other people, and I was uncomfortable about it because it didn't feel fair. When I was little, what I fixated on with my girlfriends was how I had more pajamas than they did. So when I'd go to birthday sleepovers, I'd always take them a pair of pajamas as a present.'' 
 Marriages that cross class boundaries may not present as obvious a set of challenges as those that cross the lines of race or nationality. But in a quiet way, people who marry across class lines are also moving outside their comfort zones, into the uncharted territory of partners with a different level of wealth and education, and often, a different set of assumptions about things like manners, food, child-rearing, gift-giving and how to spend vacations. In cross-class marriages, one partner will usually have more money, more options and, almost inevitably, more power in the relationship.
 It is not possible to say how many cross-class marriages there are. But to the extent that education serves as a proxy for class, they seem to be declining. Even as more people marry across racial and religious lines, often to partners who match them closely in other respects, fewer are choosing partners with a different level of education. While most of those marriages used to involve men marrying women with less education, studies have found, lately that pattern has flipped, so that by 2000, the majority involved women, like Ms. Woolner, marrying men with less schooling -- the combination most likely to end in divorce. 
 ''It's definitely more complicated, given the cultural scripts we've all grown up with,'' said Ms. Woolner, who has a master's degree in counseling and radiates a thoughtful sincerity. ''We've all been taught it's supposed to be the man who has the money and the status and the power.''

Bias on Both Sides
 When he met Ms. Woolner, Mr. Croteau had recently stopped drinking and was looking to change his life. But when she told him, soon after they began dating, that she had money, it did not land as good news.
 ''I wished she had waited a little,'' Mr. Croteau said. ''When she told me, my first thought was, uh oh, this is a complication. From that moment I had to begin questioning my motivations. You don't want to feel like a gold digger. You have to tell yourself, here's this person that I love, and here's this quality that comes with the package. Cate's very generous, and she thinks a lot about what's fair and works very hard to level things out, but she also has a lot of baggage around that quality. She has all kinds of choices I don't have. And she does the lion's share of the decision-making.''
 Before introducing Ms. Woolner to his family, Mr. Croteau warned them about her background. ''I said, 'Mom, I want you to know Cate and her family are rich,''' he recalled. ''And she said, 'Well, don't hold that against her; she's probably very nice anyway.' I thought that was amazing.'' 
 There were biases on the other side too. Just last summer, Mr. Croteau said, when they were at Ms. Woolner's mother's house on Martha's Vineyard, his mother-in-law confessed to him that she had initially been embarrassed that he was a car salesman and worried that her daughter was taking him on as a kind of do-good project. 
 Still, the relationship moved quickly. Mr. Croteau met Ms. Woolner in the fall of 1998 and moved into her comfortable home in Northfield the next spring, after meeting her condition that he sell his gun.
 Even before Mr. Croteau moved in, Ms. Woolner gave him money to buy a new car and pay off some debts. ''I wanted to give him the money,'' she said. ''I hadn't sweated it. I told him that this was money that had just come to me for being born into one class, while he was born into another class.'' And when he lost his job not long after, Ms. Woolner began paying him a monthly stipend -- he sometimes refers to it as an allowance -- that continued, at a smaller level, until last November, when she quit her longstanding job at a local antipoverty agency. She also agreed to pay for a $10,000 computer course that helped prepare him for his current job as a software analyst at the Cheshire Medical Center in Keene. From the beginning, the balance of power in the relationship was a sufficiently touchy issue that at Ms. Woolner's urging, a few months before their wedding in August 2001, they joined a series of workshops on cross-class relationships.
 ''I had abject terror at the idea of the group,'' said Mr. Croteau, who is blunt and intellectually engaging. ''It's certainly an upper-class luxury to pay to tell someone your troubles, and with all the problems in the world, it felt a little strange to sit around talking about your relationship. But it was useful. It was a relief to hear people talk about the same kinds of issues we were facing, about who had power in the relationship and how they used it. I think we would have made it anyway, but we would have had a rockier time without the group.''
 It is still accepted truth within the household that Ms. Woolner's status has given her the upper hand in the marriage. At dinner one night, when her son Isaac said baldly, ''I always think of my mom as having the power in the relationship,'' Mr. Croteau did not flinch. He is fully aware that in this relationship he is the one whose life has been most changed.

Confusing Differences
 The Woolner-Croteau household is just up the hill from the groomed fields of Northfield Mount Hermon prep school -- a constant local reminder to Mr. Croteau of just how differently his wife's sons and his daughters have been educated. Jonah is now a senior there. Isaac, who also attended the school, is now back at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon after taking a couple of semesters away to study in India and to attend massage school while working in a deli near home.
 By contrast, Mr. Croteau's adult daughters -- who have never lived with the couple -- made their way through the Keene public schools.
 ''I sometimes think Jonah and Isaac need a dose of reality, that a couple years in public school would have shown them something different,'' Mr. Croteau said. ''On the other hand I sometimes wish I'd been able to give Maggie and Lael what they had. My kids didn't have the same kind of privilege and the same kind of schools. They didn't have teachers concerned about their tender growing egos. It was catch-as-catch-can for them, and that still shows in their personalities.''
 Mr. Croteau had another experience of Northfield Mount Hermon as well. He briefly had a job as its communications manager, but could not adjust to its culture.
 ''There were all these Ivy Leaguers,'' he said. ''I didn't understand their nuances, and I didn't make a single friend there. In working-class life, people tell you things directly, they're not subtle. At N.M.H., I didn't get how they did things. When a vendor didn't meet the deadline, I called and said, 'Where's the job?' When he said, 'We bumped you, we'll have it next week,' I said, 'What do you mean, next week? We have a deadline, you can't do business like that.' It got back to my supervisor, who came and said, 'We don't yell at vendors.' The idea seemed to be that there weren't deadlines in that world, just guidelines.''
 Mr. Croteau says he is far more comfortable at the hospital. ''I deal mostly with nurses and other computer nerds and they come from the same kind of world I do, so we know how to talk to each other,'' he said.
 But in dealing with Ms. Woolner's family, especially during the annual visits to Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Croteau said, he sometimes finds himself back in class bewilderment, feeling again that he does not get the nuances. ''They're incredibly gracious to me, very well bred and very nice,'' he said, ''so much so that it's hard to tell whether it's sincere, whether they really like you.''
 Mr. Croteau still seems impressed by his wife's family, and their being among ''the ones with their names on the buildings.'' It is he who shows a visitor the framed print of the old Woolner Distillery in Peoria, Ill., and, describing the pictures on the wall, mentions that this in-law went to Yale, and that one knew Gerald Ford.

Family Divisions
 Mr. Croteau and Ms Woolner are not the only ones aware of the class divide within the family; so are the two sets of children.
 Money is continually tight for Lael Croteau, 27, who is in graduate school in educational administration at the University of Vermont, and Maggie, 25, who is working three jobs while in her second year of law school at American University. At restaurants, they ask to have the leftovers wrapped to take home.
 Neither could imagine taking a semester off to try out massage school, as Isaac did. They are careful about their manners, their plans, their clothes. 
 ''Who's got money, who doesn't, it's always going on in my head,'' Maggie said. ''So I put on the armor. I have the bag. I have the shirt. I know people can't tell my background by looking.'' 
 The Croteau daughters are the only ones among 12 first cousins who made it to college. Most of the others married and had babies right after high school. 
 ''They see us as different, and sometimes that can hurt,'' Maggie said.
 The daughters walk a fine line. They are deeply attached to their mother, who did most of their rearing, but they are also attracted to the Woolner world and its possibilities. Through holidays and Vineyard vacations, they have come to feel close not only to their stepbrothers, but also to Ms. Woolner's sisters' children, whose pictures are on display in Lael's house in Vermont. And they see, up close, just how different their upbringing was. 
 ''Jonah and Isaac don't have to worry about how they dress, or whether they'll have the money to finish college, or anything,'' Lael said. ''That's a real luxury. And when one of the little kids asks, 'Why do people sneeze?' their mom will say, 'I don't know; that's a great question. Let's go to the museum, and check it out.' My mom is very smart and certainly engages us on many levels, but when we asked a difficult question, she'd say, 'Because I said so.'''
 The daughters' lives have been changed not only by Ms. Woolner's warm, stable presence, but also by her gifts of money for snow tires or books, the family vacations she pays for and her connections. One of Ms. Woolner's cousins, a Washington lawyer, employs Maggie both at her office and as a housesitter. 
 For Ms. Woolner's sons, Mr. Croteau's arrival did not make nearly as much difference. They are mostly oblivious of the extended Croteau family, and have barely met the Croteau cousins, who are close to their age and live nearby but lead quite different lives. Indeed, in early February, while Ms. Woolner's Isaac was re-adjusting to college life, Mr. Croteau's nephew, another 20-year-old Isaac who had enlisted in the Marines right after high school, was shot in the face in Falluja, Iraq, and shipped to Bethesda Medical Center in Maryland. Isaac and Jonah are easygoing young men, neither of whom has any clear idea what he wants to do in life. ''For a while I've been trying to find my passion,'' Jonah said. ''But I haven't been passionately trying to find my passion.''
 Isaac fantasizes about opening a brewery-cum-performance-space, traveling through South America or operating a sunset massage cruise in the Caribbean. He knows he is on such solid ground that he can afford fantasy. 
 ''I have the most amazing safety net a person could have,'' he said, ''incredible, loving, involved and wealthy parents.'' 
 On the rare occasions when they are all together, the daughters get on easily with the sons, though there are occasional tensions. Maggie would love to have a summer internship with a human rights group, but she needs paid work and when she graduates, with more than $100,000 of debt, she will need a law firm job, not one with a nonprofit. So when Isaac one day teased her as being a sellout, she reminded him that it was a lot easier to live your ideals when you did not need to make money to pay for them.
 And there are moments when the inequalities within the family are painfully obvious.
 ''I do feel the awkwardness of helping Isaac buy a car, when I'm not helping them buy a car,'' Ms. Woolner said of the daughters. ''We've talked about that. But I also have to be aware of overstepping. Their mother's house burned down, which was awful for them and for her and I really wanted to help. I took out my checkbook and I didn't know what was appropriate. In the end I wrote a $1,500 check. Emily Post doesn't deal with these situations.'' 
 She and Mr. Croteau remain conscious of the class differences between them, and the ways in which their lives have been shaped by different experiences. 
 On one visit to New York City, where Ms. Woolner's mother lives in the winter, Ms. Woolner lost her debit card and felt anxious about being disconnected, even briefly, from her money.
 For Mr. Croteau, it was a strange moment. ''She had real discomfort, even though we were around the corner from her mother, and she had enough money to do anything we were likely to do, assuming she wasn't planning to buy a car or a diamond all of a sudden,'' he said. ''So I didn't understand the problem. I know how to walk around without a safety net. I've done it all my life.''
 Both he and his wife express pride that their marriage has withstood its particular problems and stresses. 
 ''I think we're always both amazed that we're working it out,'' Ms. Woolner said.
 But almost from the beginning they agreed on an approach to their relationship, a motto now engraved inside their wedding rings: ''Press on regardless.''

ABOUT THE SERIES

HEADLINE: The Mayor's Surrogates Speak

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:

This 90-second spot for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is to run for 10 days on major television stations.

PRODUCER -- Squier Knapp Dunn Communications

THE SCRIPT -- A man's voice: ''It's easy to forget how scary the whole thing was.'' A woman's voice: ''It was a real test for New York.'' A woman's voice: ''People were worried.'' Another woman's voice: ''It was a sad time.'' Another woman's voice: ''People didn't know if they were going to have a job.'' A man's voice: ''People didn't know what to expect next.''

The Rev. Floyd H. Flake of the Greater Allen Cathedral in Jamaica, Queens: ''We were in a fiscal crisis. New York City took a big hit.'' Mr. Bloomberg: ''I remember it was a very cold day when I gave my inaugural speech. My mother, she held the Bible when I got sworn in. The smoke was still coming out of the World Trade Center. Conventional wisdom was people were going to leave this city in droves.''

Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: ''He had to deal with a city that was going through one of its worst crises ever. And he established himself immediately as a strong and effective leader.'' A white woman: ''Mayor Bloomberg came in, balanced the budget, kept the city running.'' Another white woman: ''Little by little it just started to turn around.'' A black man: ''It's booming in our community now.'' A white man: ''I'm hiring people back. I'm buying new equipment.'' A white woman: ''I see the economy coming back. I think not only Manhattan has come back but all the boroughs have come back.'' A white man: ''Sometimes people forget as a city where we were.'' A white man: ''Mayor Bloomberg has led us through some pretty tough times.'' A white woman: ''Mayor Bloomberg has security and crime under control.'' A black girl: ''It's definitely safer.'' A Hispanic woman: ''He has good ideas for the future.''

Former Mayor Edward I. Koch: ''Crime is down. We have more jobs. We did good trusting him.'' A black woman: ''I think we really did the right thing in giving him a shot.''

ON THE SCREEN -- The spot opens with an image of the Brooklyn Bridge as somber piano music and police sirens are heard in the background. The screen slowly moves through various scenes: officers walking with their heads tilting down; a forlorn-looking woman standing in front of a shop; a flag on the side of a skyscraper; Mr. Bloomberg being sworn in before a huge flag, his mother holding the Bible upon which he is swearing. Mr. Bloomberg, dressed casually, speaks into the camera from a park bench shortly before the spot moves to Mr. Giuliani, in a suit and red tie. After a series of New York City street scenes -- children playing soccer in front of the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, workers constructing a house, children on swings -- the spot ends with a black screen and the tag line ''Mike Bloomberg: Leadership for Us.''

ACCURACY -- This spot is largely based on the statements of individuals portrayed as expressing opinions. Its verifiable facts are generally true: crime is down, many economic indicators are pointing upward and the city has come a long way since the grim period after the attacks. But his Democratic opponents will question how much credit he should get for all that, and whether the city has come as far as the mayor's surrogates featured in the commercial say it has -- especially in minority neighborhoods.

SCORECARD -- By harking to the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this spot goes to the heart of what Mr. Bloomberg's aides say they believe is his most powerful argument: that he delivered the city from some of the worst days it has known. Whether it was wise to open his ad campaign with that theme will be known only on Election Day. Political references to Sept. 11 can be dangerous in general. This spot seems to stay within the bounds of taste, though those can be hard to predict given the deep emotions the attacks still evoke. JIM RUTENBERG
