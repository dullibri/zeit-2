HEADLINE: Family Businesses Are Reeling In Recession

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Using only strips of canvas and a little rope, Scott Peterson walked up a 50-foot flagpole here to remove a star-spangled banner with reds faded pink. His ancestors used the same method: the family business, originally Harold A. Peterson Steeplejack, opened in 1926. 
 And it will probably close in 2009. The Great Recession, especially its stranglehold on credit and new construction, appears to have mortally wounded what the Depression could not kill. 
 ''It's not 'Oh, I don't have a job, I have to go find a new one,' '' Mr. Peterson said. ''We're losing a corporation that is 83 years old. We're losing our house. We're losing our credit. We're losing, other than our own physical bodies, everything.''
 Recessions, like bullies, always pick on the weak, but few victims feel more beaten down these days than the millions of Americans with family businesses. Most run small operations with just a few employees, and failure often means closing an office with a parent's name attached and deciding which relatives to fire. 
 They have been hit hard since the labor market began to weaken. Businesses with one to 19 employees, nearly all of them family run, lost 757,000 jobs from the second quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2008, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, broken down by company size. That amounts to 53 percent of all private-sector losses for a group of companies with about 20 percent of all employees. 
 Recent surveys by the National Federation of Independent Business also show that small-business owners are reporting lower profits and fewer plans to add inventory or spend capital than at any time since the group began asking such questions in 1973. 
 Bill Dunkelberg, the federation's chief economist, says the market is being ''cleansed'' of unneeded goods and services, but other researchers emphasize that this ignores the broader civic and social role that companies like H.A. Peterson and Sons have played since Paul Revere took over his father's silversmith business in 1754. 
 ''Outside looking in, people don't understand that business has often been an organizing point for the family,'' said Blaine McCormick, a professor at the Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University, who worked in his family's oil business growing up. ''Everyone works in it; it's our livelihood and it's a meeting place where we form our identities and the stories that carry us through life.'' 
 The Petersons' company began in New Jersey with Harry Hagan, a German immigrant who learned rigging at sea and taught his stepson, Harold A. Peterson Sr., how to use ropes to lift objects or himself. They opened the business together when Mr. Peterson was just 16. 
 Flags were initially just a sideline. ''Most of it was repairing steeples, smokestacks, water tanks, and painting them,'' said Harold Peterson Jr., 80, who said his father brought him into the business before he could shave, too. The elder Mr. Peterson made Junior, at age 14, scale a 125-foot wooden flagpole at a local school to fix a broken rope; later, the pair worked as a team, installing flags and building radio towers. 
 ''We traveled not like father and son,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''We were more like brothers.''
 The family moved to Florida in 1964. By the time Scott and his two older brothers reached high school a decade later, the steeplejack business had mostly petered out. Mr. Peterson went to work for Eastern Airlines -- until at a family picnic, Scott and his brothers asked him to teach them how to climb. 
 Learning for the first time was tough. Walking up a vertical cylinder that narrows to a diameter of a few inches requires the balance of a dancer. The canvas slings are as narrow as toilet paper, lashed to the pole with rope, then placed under the left thigh and right foot. Stepping up is possible through leverage and friction, but a little wind or the slightest lean means spinning around, flipping or crashing to the ground. 
 ''Climbing a flagpole and doing the work we do, being out in the middle of the air, over hundreds of feet off the ground, it's a rush,'' Scott Peterson said. 
 He and his older brother Mark persuaded their father to leave Eastern and revive the business. This time, they named it H.A. Peterson and Sons, and focused exclusively on flag installation and repair. 
 They did pretty well in the 1980s and '90s by piggybacking on the construction boom. Working together -- at its peak, the company had six employees, all related -- they installed flagpoles at the Miami Dolphins' new stadium, in countless new condominium developments and at the homes of Sylvester Stallone and the boxing promoter Don King. During its best years, the company brought in $500,000 in annual revenues. 
 Like many owners of family businesses, the Petersons also sewed themselves into their community. They signed on to maintain flags at local schools, worked with the Boy Scouts, teaching children the ceremony for burning used flags, and even now, they give some of their poorer, patriotic residential customers new flags for free. 
 Mr. Peterson Sr., who stopped climbing only a few months ago to take care of his ailing wife, said he would be heartbroken and ashamed if the company closed. He said he wanted to see the company's $120,000 in debt repaid. 
 ''We've established ourselves as people of integrity,'' he said. ''That integrity would be shot to hell if we said, 'O.K., it's bankruptcy. Goodbye.' ''
 Scott Peterson, 50, said that at this point he was just trying to make their monthly overhead of $15,000. He applied this spring for a loan backed by the Small Business Administration, but he said it was rejected because his credit score was too low -- after several credit card issuers cut his credit limits despite on-time payments. 
 Flag maintenance, an anachronism even before the recession, has now become his main income source. On one recent workday, he drove his 1993 GMC van with 250,000 miles to jobs at three separate flagpoles, and each earned him around $160. 
 ''It's not enough monthly to keep it even,'' he said, sweat pouring off his bald head after descending the last pole of the day. ''We're just going down and down.''
 The stress has already taken a toll. His wife, Arelis, is now the company's only other employee, and when asked what she made of their predicament, she started crying. Their two daughters, 8 and 11, are struggling to understand why their mother can no longer afford lunch at McDonald's, and their father no longer sleeps through the night. 
 ''The anxiety attack is instant,'' Mr. Peterson said.
 Seeing businesses like his disappear all around his office in a small industrial park does not help. Of the six spaces here, two are now marked with red ''for rent'' signs. A third is on the way, and Mr. Peterson said he just hopes his company will not be the fourth. 
 ''The reality is that you try and stay away from realizing that everything is about to go away,'' he said. ''We're about to lose everything that we have.''

HEADLINE: In Sotomayor Hearing, Philosophy; In Bronx Courts, Real Life

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Sonia Collins sat at the end of a small wooden bench on the fifth floor of the Bronx County Courthouse on Monday morning, hoping she was near the end of a seven-year battle to get back a $10,000 down payment she made on a house she had never moved into. 
 Down the hall, Samuel Afuakwah waited, too, flipping through the papers on his lap, including the city marshal's notice of eviction on his son's store. David J. Lucher walked to the elevators around the corner, a $900 credit-card dispute left unresolved. He had taken the day off from his steamfitter's job to come to court, only to find out that he had to return again, in December. 
 ''Just like anybody else, you hate it,'' said Mr. Lucher, 43. ''But it's a necessary evil.'' 
 As the Senate Judiciary Committee debated lofty principles of law at Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings in Washington, justice was its usual inelegant yet vital self in the main courthouse of her home borough, about 240 miles and another world away from the political theater unfolding in the Hart Senate Office Building. There were thousands of little, everyday dramas for everyday people, small-scale victories and setbacks, delays and defeats. 
 A court calendar posted outside a ground-floor courtroom listed the nonpayment of rent cases the city's public housing agency had brought against two tenants at the Bronxdale Houses, where Judge Sotomayor had been raised years ago. The court calendars read like chapter headings in some unwritten book of the Bronx: Jon Betlow v. Christmas Tree Shops; Katherine Garden v. the City of New York; Helena Addo v. Ernest Addo.
 Outside Room 504, the calendar listed a pretrial conference in the matter of David J. Lucher v. North Star Capital Acquisitions. North Star Capital was represented by Mel S. Harris & Associates. Mr. Lucher was representing himself. 
 Mr. Lucher said someone took out a credit card in his name in 2004 and charged $900 on it, $900 that was never paid. Mr. Lucher said he had only recently learned about the money owed, but he did not want to settle. ''I'm not paying for somebody else who enjoyed it,'' Mr. Lucher said of the charges made on the card.
 Here in the Bronx, a place with the highest unemployment rate in the state and the fourth-highest poverty rate in the country among large counties, the cases seemed to pivot not on questions of law but of dollars-and-cents economics. 
 Mr. Afuakwah, for one, had $4,000 on his mind. He had paid $14,000 in back rent to the landlord of his son's shop, which sells African goods, but, he said, a judge had ordered that the money be refunded since Mr. Afuakwah was not the tenant. Some of the money was returned by the landlord, all but $4,000. Meanwhile, the eviction case proceeded, and since his son was on a business trip in Mr. Afuakwah's native Ghana, Mr. Afuakwah came to court on Monday hoping to get an order temporarily stalling the eviction.
 A member of the court staff approached him as he sat in a fifth-floor hallway and told him that the order had been denied. He did not complain; he just listened and stared at the papers on his lap. He figured he had a few days to clear out the store before the marshal arrived, and he planned to sue the landlord for the $4,000 in small claims court. 
 ''I'm disappointed,'' he said. ''Four thousand dollars is not small money.''
 Mr. Afuakwah did not have to travel far to file suit; small claims court is also in the county courthouse. 
 The building, at the corner of East 161st Street and the Grand Concourse, is the borough's one-stop justice shop. You can get married in Room B-131 and you can file for divorce in Room 118. You can report for jury duty in Room 212 and you can ask to see the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., in Room 301.
 ''In this building, you can file a small claim for less than $5,000 in small claims court, yet you can file, in Supreme Court, a multimillion-dollar lawsuit involving a brain-injured child,'' said Judge Lizbeth Gonzalez of Bronx Civil Court, who had four trials in Room 528 on Monday and planned to attend Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings on Wednesday. ''I think that's why being a judge is a challenge and a calling at the same time. I think Judge Sotomayor embodies that sense of calling.''
 The building resembles a courthouse from the outside, but has the feel of a middle school inside, with signs and warnings posted everywhere. ''No Smoking in Elevators Under Penalty of Law.'' ''Save Water.'' ''No Sitting on Windowsills or Floor Permitted.'' ''If You Think Your Car Was Towed or Stolen, Please Call One of These Numbers.'' 
 Mrs. Collins, 45, paid the signs no mind. In 2002, she wanted to buy a two-family home on Findlay Avenue and made a $10,000 down payment, she said. But after a dispute over the water bill on the property, she was informed that it had been sold to someone else for cash. Looking back, she said, she felt that she had been the victim of a housing scam. ''It's so frustrating because you work so hard, and someone comes in and steals your money with no remorse,'' she said.
 She had come to Room 504 -- the same courtroom where Mr. Lucher's case had been heard -- seeking her down payment, plus interest. She went inside with her lawyer, and emerged a short time later. 
 She had a single piece of paper in her hand -- a judgment, in her favor.
 On her way out, she passed Mr. Afuakwah, who sat on the bench in the hall with his papers: two strangers in the Bronx, briefly connected not by a person, not even by a famous judge, but by a place.

An Unsigned Deal
 Could Be Costly 
 Ken Lewis needs to get out his checkbook. Mr. Lewis, the Bank of America chief executive, never signed the deal he cut in January for the United States to backstop some $118 billion in Merrill Lynch assets. But that didn't become known until May, when the bank announced it wouldn't be taking the guarantee. 
 In the interim, Bank of America benefited from investors' belief that it had Uncle Sam's backing. It owes American taxpayers something for that. The question is, how much? 
 The bank is trying to wriggle out of paying anything, saying the deal for a guarantee was never consummated. But the widely held understanding that the backstop was in effect probably had a calming influence on investors that helped the bank weather the worst of the first-quarter tumult. 
 The government is rightly pushing back, arguing that it is owed at least some of the $4 billion fee that the bank had provisionally agreed to pay in the form of preferred stock and warrants. 
 Some analysts argue that Bank of America should pay a third of the original fee, or $1.3 billion, since the bank benefited from the arrangement for a third of the year. That may be too steep -- not least since the preferred shares and warrants were to pay for 10 years' worth of coverage. 
 One option would be to charge the bank a sort of merger break-up fee of, say, 5 percent of the consideration that would have changed hands, which would total $200 million. Another would be to charge the bank a fee for having what was effectively a $100 billion line of credit that was never used. At the 0.20 percentage point a year that the government had intended to charge, the bill would also come to $200 million. 
 But that seems a little cheap for what might have been life-saving government help. A better answer may be to split the difference, sending Bank of America a bill for about $750 million. That would let the bank off relatively easily, provide some compensation for the risk shouldered by taxpayers -- and send a message that Uncle Sam's warm embrace comes with a price. 
 Godzilla of Beers?
 The United States has Budweiser, the self-proclaimed King of Beers. Could Japan soon have a Godzilla of Beers? 
 Suntory has confirmed that it is considering a merger with Kirin, the country's biggest beer maker. The resulting monster would have a dominant position in the beer market in Japan, and might even do some damage to competitors overseas.
 Kirin and Suntory already share one thing: an overreliance on Japan. Along with rivals Asahi and Sapporo, they're chasing a revenue pool that is expected to decline by at least 3 percent this year. High taxes contribute to low operating profit margins, which according to Moody's is 5.4 percent at the privately held Suntory. That's a quarter of the level at Anheuser-Busch InBev, which owns Budweiser. 
 Crunching together Kirin and Suntory will not make the Japanese drink more beer, but a more concentrated market should be more profitable. The idea of shutting down any of Suntory's four plants might not play well with Japan's unemployment at a six-year high, but the prospect leaves savings for a rainy day.
 Far juicier would be the cost savings from being Japan's dominant brewer, with a combined market share of more than 50 percent. In particular, the Godzilla of Beers could expect to save on promotion and marketing. 
 Currently, Japanese brewers spend 17 percent of revenue on marketing, according to Credit Suisse. If it reduced those expenses to the 11 percent that Anheuser-Busch InBev spends in North America, the companies could save more than $2 billion a year; that would be worth $12 billion to shareholders today. That should help persuade Suntory's owners, the Saji family, to release their grip on the company.
 The real prize for both brewers, though, would be to create a beverage monster with a balance sheet big enough to eat up tasty morsels overseas. Both Kirin and Suntory have nibbled already with overseas acquisitions. It may be time for the giants to chomp through some even bigger foreign prey.

HEADLINE: The Choices That Closed a Window Into Afghanistan

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
IN THE GRAVEYARD OF EMPIRES 
 America's War in Afghanistan 
 By Seth G. Jones 
 414 pages. W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95. 
 Among the many lasting consequences of the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 was the collateral damage it inflicted on Afghanistan and the war there against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Money, troops and expertise were diverted to Iraq, and as the RAND Corporation political scientist Seth G. Jones observes in his useful new book, the initial success of the military operation in Afghanistan was squandered. 
 The slender window for securing a stable democracy in Afghanistan began to close, and by 2006, Mr. Jones writes, a ''perfect storm of political upheaval'' had gathered, with several crises ominously converging: ''Pakistan emerged as a sanctuary for the Taliban and Al Qaeda, allowing them to conduct a greater number of operations from bases across the border; Afghan governance became unhinged as corruption worked its way through the government like a cancer, leaving massive discontent throughout the country; and the international presence, hamstrung by the U.S. focus on Iraq, was too small to deal with the escalating violence.'' 
 The first major operation using additional troops sent to Afghanistan by President Obama recently began in the southern part of that country, even as Taliban advances in border regions have aided Al Qaeda's efforts to destabilize neighboring Pakistan.
 Two Pulitzer Prize-winning books have already dealt cogently with aspects of Afghanistan and the war on terror: Steve Coll's ''Ghost Wars'' (2004) examined the C.I.A.'s covert role during the Soviet occupation of the 1980s and America's subsequent neglect of the country during the post-cold-war '90s, and Lawrence Wright's ''Looming Tower'' (2006) probed Al Qaeda's evolution and its activities in Afghanistan leading up to 9/11. In these pages Mr. Jones lightly retraces the ground covered by those pioneering books while zeroing in on what went awry after America's successful routing of the Taliban in late 2001. His narrative is fleshed out with information from declassified government documents and interviews with military officers, diplomats and national security experts familiar with events on the ground in Afghanistan -- most notably, the former ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalizad and the current ambassador to Afghanistan (who was a top military commander there), Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry. 
 It's hard for the reader to finish this volume without being struck by the remarkable parallels between the American failure to prevent a re-emergence of the Taliban in Afghanistan and its failure to prevent the emergence of an insurgency in Iraq. In both cases the determination of Donald H. Rumsfeld's Pentagon to use a smaller deployment than others recommended (what Mr. Jones calls a ''light footprint'') and to attempt to do reconstruction on the cheap resulted in a lack of sufficient troops and resources to maintain law and order and to provide the local population with basic services like electricity. In both cases these failures led to residents' growing dissatisfaction with the United States-backed government and a tilt toward the insurgents, who rushed to fill the power vacuum.
 Indeed, Mr. Jones quotes General Eikenberry warning in 2007 of the ''potential irretrievable loss of legitimacy of the government of Afghanistan.'' If that government is unable ''to counter population frustration with the lack of progress in reform and national development,'' General Eikenberry said, ''the Afghan people may lose confidence in the nature of their political system,'' and ''the goal of establishing a democratic, moderate, self-sustaining state could be lost forever.'' 
 Besides drawing America's attention away from Afghanistan, Mr. Jones says, the Iraq war had other side effects as well. It undermined the Atlantic alliance, contributing to tensions within NATO -- which, hobbled by divergent national caveats and insufficient troops, did a poor job of taking over for United States forces diverted to Iraq. And Iraq became a sort of laboratory for terror tactics that were exported to Afghanistan, including beheadings and the use of armor-penetrating weapons and the remote-controlled improvised explosive devices known as TV bombs. Suicide attacks in Afghanistan increased to 140 in 2007 from 2 in 2003, Mr. Jones reports, while the number of remotely detonated bombings more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, to 1,677 from 783. 
 The country that contributed even more directly to the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan was its close neighbor Pakistan, which offered a haven to many Qaeda and Taliban fighters. In addition, Mr. Jones writes, members of Pakistan's shadowy military intelligence agency, the Interservices Intelligence directorate, I.S.I., ''sent money and logistical support to insurgents'' and kept in regular contact with militant leaders. 
 Of the Bush administration's dealings with the government of Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's former president, Mr. Jones writes: ''The vast majority of U.S. planning was on paper, not in practice. The United States refused to take concerted action against the Taliban and other insurgents in Pakistan'' or ''to put serious pressure on Pakistan to do it. At least one White House official acknowledged that the U.S. government did not place any serious conditions on its assistance to Pakistan. It did not request a quid pro quo in which the United States provided money and equipment and Pakistan helped capture or kill key Taliban and other militants.'' 
 So given this recent history, how can the United States defeat -- or at least contain -- the insurgency in Afghanistan? Mr. Jones's suggestions, based on his own reporting and interviews with military and counterinsurgency experts, all sound logical -- and all are easier said than done.
 First, he writes, the United States must ''address the massive corruption at the national and local levels'' in Afghanistan -- most notably, drug trafficking, bribery and extortion among the police and judges -- that has ''steadily alienated the local population and fueled support for insurgent groups.'' 
 Second, he goes on, American policy makers must come to terms with the decentralized, tribal nature of Afghani politics and cultivate bottom-up efforts to provide security and public services on a local level, instead of the top-down nation-building efforts largely pursued thus far. 
 And finally, he says, the United States must ''persuade Pakistani military and civilian leaders to conduct a sustained campaign against militants mounting attacks in Afghanistan and the region'' and threatening ''the foundation of the nuclear-armed Pakistani state.'' 
 The tragedy of Afghanistan, Mr. Jones concludes -- in a passage that echoes the conclusions about Iraq that the Washington Post special military correspondent Thomas E. Ricks drew in his 2006 book, ''Fiasco'' -- is that the ''rise of the insurgency in the wake of the U.S. victory over the Taliban'' in 2001 ''was not inevitable'' but the result of the failure of the Rumsfeld Pentagon and the Bush White House, which were preoccupied with Iraq, to listen to ''seasoned diplomats and military commanders in Afghanistan'' who were calling for more resources and troops. 
 It was also a failure, Mr. Jones reminds us, to learn from history; after all, ''past empires that have dared to enter Afghanistan -- from Alexander the Great to Great Britain and the Soviet Union -- have found initial entry possible, even easy, only to find themselves fatally mired in local resistance.'' Which is why that harsh and mountainous country has become known, in the words of his book's title, as ''the graveyard of empires.''

HEADLINE: The Key to America's Recovery: Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's proposal for a Rebuild America program to increase employment (''The Human Equation,'' column, July 11) merits consideration. 
 As Mr. Herbert pointed out, the ranks of the unemployed and underemployed, and the fears of what the future holds for those who are currently working, are rapidly growing. 
 About 70 percent of gross domestic product comes from personal consumption, including food, housing, transportation, clothes and entertainment. It will take a sustained increase in the demand for domestic goods and services at all levels, generated by sustainable employment growth, for the economy to strengthen. 
 Mr. Herbert's proposal to upgrade the domestic infrastructure will generate long-term economic gains and foreign competitive advantages at all levels of production. Moreover, if properly administered to address true needs, as opposed to bridges to nowhere, it will leave a legacy of accomplishment.
 Thomas E. Gregg San Francisco, July 12, 2009
 To the Editor:
 On the campaign trail, Barack Obama acknowledged that he was not perfect. He said something like, I'll make mistakes and you need to let me know when that happens.
 Well, Bob Herbert and a lot of others are letting him know that his stimulus package needs to be more focused on joblessness.
 So much human energy lies untapped instead of being put to work on our recovery -- the recovery of our failing schools, our failing infrastructure and our failing health care, and the resurrection of our failed manufacturing sector.
 The bottom line: the ''best and the brightest'' working for President Obama need to tap into that human energy. Unlike ''trickle down'' half measures, that explosive geyser of human energy, when unleashed, will surge upward with a powerful roar.

 To the Editor:
 I have a simple solution to the underemployment problem we are facing, as well as the problem many graduating college students face in making the transition to a career: a government-financed tour of duty in a child-care center or afterschool program for two years, similar to the draft for military service of past generations. 
 Such a program would solve so many problems. It would help our young adults by providing them with a starter income; teaching them good parenting skills; and helping them recognize that parenting can be as challenging as a traditional job, if not more.
 It would benefit society by providing a steady supply of high-energy workers to help raise our children, and indoctrinating our young men to be equal parents to our young women.
 It's time we recognize as a society that collectively we need to put as much thought and resources into raising the next generation as we have historically put into defending our country.
 Rebecca Rosenberger Smolen Bala Cynwyd, Pa., July 12, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert is correct that our economic crisis will be solved only by getting all able-bodied and willing Americans back to work. There is so much that needs doing that we will never run out of work to restore America.
 Yes, we can afford to do it. In fact, we can't afford not to do it.
 Don't blame President Obama. If blame is to be assigned, look to Congress, whose members have forgotten why we elected Barack Obama.

HEADLINE: Clinton Says Candidate for Aid Agency Is Tangled in Vetting

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a rare burst of public frustration with the White House, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that she could not announce a new director for the United States Agency for International Development because the candidate was stuck in a lengthy vetting process. 
 ''It's frustrating beyond words,'' she declared at a town hall meeting of agency employees. ''I pushed very hard, when I knew I was coming here, to get permission from the White House to be able to tell you that help is on the way and someone will be nominated shortly.''
 ''I was unable,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''The message came back: 'We're not ready.' '' 
 The White House declined to comment on the matter.
 The exhaustive vetting process has left posts unfilled across the Obama administration, but the international development agency has been hit particularly hard, with no director since President Obama took office. The administration is expected to name Paul Farmer, a Harvard physician who is also an anthropologist and who has run public health programs in Haiti and Rwanda. 
 Mrs. Clinton said several people had declined the job, now filled by an acting director, because the financial and personal reporting requirements were so onerous. ''I mean, it's ridiculous,'' she said. ''Some very good people just didn't want to be vetted.''
 The process has become more demanding in the Obama administration, with candidates required, for example, to list every place they have lived since age 18.

HEADLINE: Seoul Says European Trade Deal Is Near

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
South Korea announced on Monday that it had concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union that it hoped would encourage United States lawmakers to ratify a free trade deal with the country. 
 President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea had hoped to formally declare a tentative trade deal when he met in Stockholm on Monday with Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt of Sweden, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. 
 But while both leaders acknowledged a breakthrough, Mr. Reinfeldt sounded more cautious.
 ''When you finalize this kind of agreement with the European Union, we need to also finalize it with our different member countries,'' he told reporters after the meeting. ''There might still be some outstanding questions, and we need to follow up on them before we could say that it's absolutely all clear and all ready to sign.''
 In Seoul, officials emphasized that a tentative deal had been struck. Both sides just need a ''legal review'' before signing the deal, most likely in September, and submitting it for approval by their parliaments, Lee Hye-min, the deputy trade minister, said.
 Mr. Reinfeldt said he had ''good hope'' to complete the agreement during Sweden's presidency. President Lee said that the free trade deal gave the two sides ''new opportunities'' during a world economic crisis and sent ''a strong signal against protectionism globally.''
 South Korea and the European Union began negotiating an accord to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade in May 2007, soon after Seoul struck a similar deal with Washington. 
 South Korea aspired to become the first Asian economy to reach a free trade deal with both the United States and the European Union. The deal with South Korea would also be the European Union's first with a major Asian economy.
 But Seoul's deal with Washington remains stalled because lawmakers have refused to ratify it until it is renegotiated to give American carmakers more access to South Korea.
 South Korean auto exports also emerged as a serious stumbling block in talks with the European Union. Some European carmakers and governments protested the so-called customs drawback advantage that South Korean car makers enjoy. Under duty drawback, South Korean auto exporters can import cheap components and be reimbursed for all import duties on those parts if they are in cars destined for the European market. 
 Lee Hye-min said that the differences were cleared by a provision that would allow each side to file a complaint with a panel if it suspected the other side was abusing the drawback.

HEADLINE: Chutzpah On Steroids

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 What is up with the banks and the rest of the financial industry? The people running this system remind me of gangsters who manage to walk out of the courthouse with a suspended sentence and can't wait to get back to their nefarious activities.
 These malefactors of great wealth (thank you, Teddy) developed hideously destructive credit policies and took insane risks that hurt millions of American families and nearly wrecked the economy. Then they were bailed out with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, money that came from the very people victimized by the industry's outlandish practices. 
 Now the industry is fighting against creation of an agency that would protect taxpayers and ordinary consumers from a similarly devastating onslaught in the future. And at the same time they are scrambling to raise credit card interest rates and all manner of exploitive fees to build a brand new superstructure of questionable profits on the backs of the taxpayers who came to their rescue. 
 We're reaching a whole new level of chutzpah here.
 The Obama administration wants to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would shield individuals and families from deceptive practices and outright fraud by banks and other businesses offering credit cards, mortgages, home loans and other forms of consumer finance. 
 Everything we've learned in this recession tells us we need such an agency. As Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner described it, ''This agency will have only one mission: to protect consumers.''
 Protecting the consumer is, of course, anathema to the industry. So it's preparing for war. The Times's Edmund Andrews neatly summed up the matter when he wrote that ''banks and mortgage lenders are placing top priority on killing'' the president's proposal.
 The proposed agency developed from an idea offered some time ago by Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who currently chairs the Congressional Oversight Panel, which has been monitoring the financial industry bailouts. She is a strong contender to lead the proposed new agency. 
 Ms. Warren told a Congressional committee last month about the stark difference between the warm and fuzzy advertising approach used by lenders competing for consumer dollars and the treachery that is so often hidden in the fine print.
 ''Giant lenders compete for business by talking about nominal interest rates, free gifts and warm feelings,'' she said, ''but the fine print hides the things that really rake in the cash. Today's business model is about making money through tricks and traps.''
 It should be clear by now that it is often the goal of financial institutions to see that the consumer is not well informed. ''In the early-1980s,'' said Professor Warren, the average credit card contract was about a page long. ''Today, it is more than 30 pages. ... I am a contract law professor, and I cannot make out some of the fine print.''
 She added, ''Study after study shows that credit products are designed in ways that obscure the meaning and trick customers.''
 There is nothing free or fair about a market in which one side uses double talk and mumbo jumbo to obscure important information and deliberately dupe the other side into making decisions against its own interests. 
 When I think of the banking industry fighting to kill this proposed agency, it brings to mind the decades in which tobacco companies insisted that cigarettes were safe, and those days long ago when the auto companies fought against seat belts, and all the dopey arguments that were made against protecting the public from unsafe drugs and kitchen appliances that might burst into flames, and so on.
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development has concluded that Americans spend approximately $55 billion each year on closing costs that they don't fully understand. As Ms. Warren noted, ''Mortgage lenders furnish reams of unreadable documents shortly before closing, often leaving people with no practical option but to take whatever terms the lender has filled in.''
 The family home is the largest purchase most Americans ever make. Paying it off can take much of a lifetime. Everything about that contract should be crystal clear to the buyer.
 I had a breakfast interview with Ms. Warren on a variety of subjects last week. On the day of the meeting, USA Today had a front-page article that began: ''Even as regulators crack down on abusive mortgage and credit card practices, another type of lending threatens to mire consumers in a credit trap.''
 The article detailed the ways in which banks are wringing huge profits from overdraft fees that often are sky high and in many cases are handled in ways that are exploitive, if not predatory. 
 The malefactors of great wealth view an informed consumer as Public Enemy No. 1. The last thing in the world that they want is a fair marketplace, which is why the Consumer Financial Protection Agency can't come fast enough.

HEADLINE: Away From the Glitter, Simpler Cuisines Flourish

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

DATELINE: Las Vegas 

 BODY:
 ON the Strip, the recession-battered casinos of Glitter Gulch are suddenly marketing to residents, with 50-percent-off coupons. But this has not deterred locals from seeking out Memphis Championship Barbecue at 1401 South Rainbow Boulevard, with its barnlike building and its ''We've been wait'n fer ya'll'' sign out front. 
 ''We offer customers lots of good food for a good price, and it makes them feel good,'' said Mike Mills, the owner, referring to menu items like his Memphis slow-smoked $9.99 pork shoulder. He has two other restaurants in town.
 The collapsing economy has left islands of valiant survivors in the neon jungle. The Original Siena Deli, at 2250 East Tropicana Avenue in the Renaissance Center Strip Mall, has overcome the failure of the Albertsons grocery next to the shuttered Blockbuster Video, ''not to mention the many restaurant closings in the area,'' said Giancarlo Bomparola, 44, the general manager. 
 Loyal customers seek out his Italian specialties, and ''it's the only place I've found in Las Vegas that has these great raviolis,'' said Jodi Carness, 43, a time-share marketer. 
 Increasing numbers of diners are coming from the strip to Hash House a Go Go, a 200-seat restaurant at 6800 West Sahara Avenue that offers canal-boat-size plates of hammered pork tenderloin and burgers the size of dinner platters. ''When things get tough people turn to comfort food, and we offer big portions of home cooking made from scratch,'' said Jim Rees, the 55-year-old owner, who added that sales are up more than 10 percent over last year. 
 Also doing well is a favorite after-hours spot for both culinary stars and kitchen grunts: the gemlike 31-seat Aburiya Raku Japanese grill, tucked away in the bare-bones Seoul Plaza strip mall on Spring Mountain Road. Think $2.50 Kurobuta pork cheeks and $9 steamed egg custard with foie gras. And it's open until 3 a.m.

HEADLINE: To Shrink A U.S. Car, Chrysler Goes To Poland

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: TYCHY, Poland 

 BODY:
For decades, automakers looking for the secret to small-car success would journey to Toyota City in Japan. These days, they are coming to Tychy.
 Since Fiat effectively took over Chrysler this year, engineers from Detroit have been making monthly pilgrimages here to see something they can only envy: an auto plant that is hiring workers and earning a profit. 
 The mammoth Fiat plant here, which churned out nearly half a million cars last year, may hold some of the answers for Chrysler (as well as Ford Motor and General Motors), as it struggles to regain its footing after its bankruptcy and reduce its dependence on muscle-bound trucks and sport utility vehicles.
 For those who remember Fiat before its ignominious retreat from the American market -- the name was said to stand for ''Fix It Again, Tony'' -- the Italian automaker may seem an unlikely role model. It left the United States in the early 1980s after widespread quality problems. 
 But Fiat itself has undergone a revolution under Sergio Marchionne, who became its chief executive in 2004, raising standards for quality and reliability at plants like Tychy and mastering the art of building smaller cars with high efficiency. Chrysler hopes he can do the same thing for it now that he has assumed control of the American company.
 ''We are lucky there is a crisis,'' said the director of the Tychy plant, Zdzislaw Arlet, unable to resist a gibe at the bigger cars and trucks that have traditionally stolen the industry spotlight. ''Everybody wants to build small cars now.''
 At Tychy (pronounced TICK-ee), one secret is flexibility: The latest robotic technology is balanced by workers who can quickly shift models to match demand. That is one reason Tychy is operating around the clock, six days a week, while most other auto plants in Europe and the United States are running at a fraction of capacity, increasing costly nonproductive downtime. 
 Indeed, for visiting Chrysler engineers, going to Tychy is akin to an aging heavyweight boxer stepping into a gym where more agile bantamweight fighters train. 
 Chrysler's smallest car, the Dodge Caliber compact, is one-third heavier (about 1,000 pounds) than the fast-selling Fiat 500, which is made exclusively at Tychy.
 Fiat executives say their goal is not only to produce subcompact European models at Chrysler's North American plants -- but also for Chrysler managers to learn how to speed the introduction of smaller cars in the United States that Americans will want to buy, like a new version of the Sebring, while increasing efficiency the way Fiat has at Tychy.
 Chrysler's offerings, unlike those from Fiat, have long been dominated by Jeeps and S.U.V.'s and big trucks like the Dodge Ram, with cars making up just 30 percent of Chrysler's worldwide sales last year. As bigger vehicles fell out of favor because of high gasoline prices and the recession, Chrysler's overall sales dived, falling 44 percent in the first half of 2009 compared with the period a year earlier.
 ''It's very difficult to go from big to small, but they are here to compare and learn,'' Mr. Arlet said as he walked amid the sparks thrown off by robots along his production lines. ''This plant was designed to produce small cars.''
 The ideal combination of automated robots and individual workers has been critical to Tychy's success, said Ron Harbour, an American industry consultant with Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. Success is not as simple as the more robots, the better.
 ''With people, you can change the mix in one day or one week,'' Mr. Harbour said, referring to the models a production line churns out. ''You can't do that with robots.''
 The Tychy plant employs about 5,000 people, including about 1,700 hired last year to make more Fiats, as well as the Ford Ka.
 Tychy's huge scale -- it covers more than 4.3 million square feet -- also works to its advantage.
 Although exact benchmarks are difficult, Mr. Harbour mentions Chrysler's plant in Belvidere, Ill., as a comparable site, since it produces smaller cars. But its annual production capacity of 265,000 is just over half of the plant at Tychy.
 Mr. Arlet is also constantly on the lookout for time- and money-saving improvements, adding that he himself looks to Toyota's famous Kaizen system for inspiration: Instead of filling up cars at different production points with brake fluid, gasoline, water and other liquids, one machine on each of Tychy's three lines fills each vehicle.
 ''A car comes off the assembly line every 55 seconds,'' Mr. Arlet said. ''In 1996, it took twice as long.'' 
 Along with the new technology came a new focus on quality. About three years ago, workers were assigned an individual identification number that is stamped on whatever sections of the car they assemble so any problems at the end of the line can be traced to the source.
 As a result, Mr. Arlet said, the number of cars coming off the line with defects has fallen from 20 percent in 1996 to just 4 percent now -- a figure Mr. Harbour said compared favorably to factories in the United States or Western Europe. 
 ''At the moment, Tychy is the best of Fiat as far as quality is concerned,'' said Giuseppe Volpato, a professor of economics at the University of Venice who has long studied the company. ''I think Poland is becoming the reference point for the whole organization, even in Italy.'' 
 For Mr. Marchionne, turning around Chrysler will probably be harder than getting Fiat back on track. Chrysler not only relies on trucks and S.U.V.'s, it derives 75 percent of its sales from the now-moribund American market.
 At the same time, Chrysler is facing increased pressure from Ford, as well as G.M., which emerged from bankruptcy last week. And of course, the original high-quality, small-car brands, like Toyota and Honda, remain fierce competitors, even if Toyota is suffering great losses of its own.
 Partly because of the need to move quickly, the pace of cultural exchanges like the visits to Tychy has quickened since Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy on June 10. Fiat took a 20 percent stake in return for technology and know-how that the Italian automaker says is worth $10 billion in lieu of any cash.
 Not only engineers and line managers are heading to Europe for the grand tour -- so is the top brass.
 Late last month, the executives responsible for Chrysler's three brands, along with the heads of manufacturing, engineering and styling, traveled to a proving ground halfway between Milan and Turin for a weekend of meetings and motoring with their Italian counterparts.
 Back in Tychy, Mr. Arlet seemed amazed at the tectonic shift under way in the global auto industry, with Americans coming to Poland in search of the secrets of carmaking, rather than the other way around. 
 With a confident smile, he declared, ''I am looking forward to when the Fiat 500 is made in the U.S.A. and also made here, and we can compare.''

HEADLINE: In Recession, a Bleaker Path for Workers to Slog

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Victoria Cherrie contributed reporting.. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In California and a handful of other states, one out of every five people who would like to be working full time is not now doing so.
 It is a startling sign of the pain that the Great Recession is inflicting, and it is largely missed by the official, oft-repeated statistics on unemployment. The national unemployment rate has risen to 9.5 percent, the highest level in more than a quarter-century. Yet it still excludes all those who have given up looking for a job and those part-time workers who want to be working full time.
 Include them -- as the Labor Department does when calculating its broadest measure of the job market -- and the rate reached 23.5 percent in Oregon this spring, according to a New York Times analysis of state-by-state data. It was 21.5 percent in both Michigan and Rhode Island and 20.3 percent in California. In Tennessee, Nevada and several other states that have relied heavily on manufacturing or housing, the rate was just under 20 percent this spring and may have since surpassed it.
 Almost nobody believes that unemployment has finished rising, either. On Tuesday, President Obama said he expected it to ''tick up for several months.'' 
 It's fair to say, then, that the downturn is moving into a new stage. It has already been through three: the prologue, when credit markets began to quiver in 2007; the big shock, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in September 2008, led into almost six months of terrible economic news; and the stabilization, when the news became more mixed.
 Now comes Stage 4: the slog.
 ''It's not going to be an overnight turnaround,'' as Bernard Smith, an unemployed engineer in Greenville, S.C. (a state where the broader jobless rate was 20.5 percent this spring), who has been looking for work since May, told me. ''It's going to take time.''
 Various indicators suggest the nation's economic output could start growing again this summer, which would mean the end of the recession. But the economy will still be weighed down by troubled credit markets and huge household debts. So it may be awhile before growth is fast enough to persuade companies to hire large numbers of workers. 
 This would make for an odd contrast, in which the economy was getting better but feeling worse. These broad measures of unemployment and underemployment could approach a hard-to-fathom 25 percent in California, up from 12 percent a year ago. In several other states, including Florida, North Carolina and Washington, the rate could yet reach 20 percent -- and, unfortunately, the stimulus bill does not do a good enough job of targeting the hardest-hit states. 
 After a decade in which household income barely outpaced inflation, a slow recovery could leave many people hard-pressed and frustrated. In just the last week, the Labor Department reported that the number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped -- but so did consumer confidence and Mr. Obama's approval rating. Welcome to the slog.
 A jobless rate of 20 percent is clearly a bit shocking. It sounds like something out of the Great Depression, and as bad as this recession is, it's no Great Depression. So what's going on?
 For starters, this rate does include part-time workers who want to be full time. Such people are not quite unemployed or fully employed. 
 On average, they are working three days a week, and many are struggling to get by. Richard Smith (not related to Bernard) and his wife, Lynn, for example, moved from Michigan to Charlotte, N.C., last summer, after he had been laid off from white-collar jobs by both Ford and General Motors in the last five years. But after talking with 35 headhunters and sending out hundreds of applications, Mr. Smith, who's 58, still hasn't found full-time work.
 Instead, he works a few days a week at a golf shop, repairing clubs and making $9.50 an hour. The money has helped the Smiths buy a bargain-basement foreclosed house. ''You get depressed, obviously,'' he said. ''But that never changes my attitude about my capability.'' 
 Part-time workers like Mr. Smith make up about one-third of those counted in the broader rates, which leaves roughly 13 percent of the work force in states like Oregon and Michigan who are completely out of work. 
 And even that is probably an understatement, because it includes only people who have looked for work at some point in the last year. (To be counted in the official jobless rate, someone must have looked in the last four weeks.) Anyone who has spent time in old industrial areas knows that plenty of former factory workers would like a decent-paying job but haven't looked for one in more than a year. 
 When I saw these statistics last week, my first reaction was to wonder why there weren't more tangible signs of joblessness. Many communities are pockmarked with foreclosure signs and postponed construction projects. But unless you go looking for the unemployed, they are mostly invisible.
 As Susan Rose -- a lawyer at a nonprofit group in South Carolina who represented the unemployed until she herself was recently laid off -- said, ''It's almost as if unemployed people are a forgotten, silent crowd.''
 The stimulus bill is helping somewhat. It has extended jobless benefits and prevented layoffs by state and local governments. A lot more stimulus is on the way, too. So far, about $90 billion has gone out the door, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. From now until the end of 2010, an additional $25 billion or so will be spent every month.
 But the stimulus isn't helping as much as it could, because too much of the money is going to states that need it the least. In most of the Great Plains and Mountain West, the broad jobless rate was still below 12 percent this spring. In North Dakota, it was 7.8 percent. Yet these are some of the places receiving a disproportionate share of stimulus, as recent articles by The Associated Press and The Times have shown. It's a classic case of politics trumping economics.
 Barring an unexpected bit of bad news -- something that turns the slog into a relapse -- Congress and the White House are not likely to pursue another stimulus bill until September. By then, more of the money from the last stimulus will have been spent, and the economy's condition will be clearer. 
 If lawmakers do decide more is needed, they would do well to remember that this is not an equal opportunity recession. By September, one out of every four Californians -- and Oregonians and South Carolinians and Michiganders -- who would like to have a full-time job might not have one. 
 Who ever thought we would be saying such a thing?

HEADLINE: The Met's Outdoor Future May Rest on a Screen

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
In the summer of 1967, after the first season at its new Lincoln Center house, the Metropolitan Opera inaugurated its Met in the Parks program, presenting concert performances of complete operas with leading singers and the Met orchestra. Eventually these tours took opera to parks in every borough as well as New Jersey. 
 The Met had corporate sponsors and received some financing from the city to present these performances. Still, it was a costly venture for the company, not just financially, but in the strain on singers, choristers, orchestra players and the crew. 
 This summer the Met in the Parks tours has been replaced with a free Summer Recital Series, six programs of arias and duets accompanied by piano, presented in all five boroughs, which opened on Monday night at SummerStage in Central Park. Starting on Aug. 29, the Met will also present a Summer HD Festival, 10 free screenings of some of the company's recent productions, first seen on the ''Live in HD'' series. The screenings will take place in Lincoln Center Plaza. It seems clear that these popular HD screenings are becoming the public face of the Met and pushing aside the company's live outdoor performances. 
 Still, roughly 4,300 enthusiastic audience members, including picnickers, packed SummerStage on a balmy Monday night to hear three gifted and attractive singers. The headliner was the baritone Paulo Szot, a Tony Award winner for his portrayal of Emile de Becque in Lincoln Center Theater's acclaimed production of ''South Pacific.'' Mr. Szot will make his Met debut this season in the premiere production of ''The Nose,'' a darkly bizarre opera by Shostakovich, not exactly Rodgers and Hammerstein. 
 Joining Mr. Szot on Monday were the vivacious young Met soprano Lisette Oropesa and the rising young tenor Alek Shrader. The able pianist was Vlad Iftinca. Though a clear success with the audience, the recital was hardly comparable to complete performances of ''Rigoletto'' or ''La Boheme,'' events that often drew 35,000 people to the Great Lawn at Central Park. 
 Last year, in lieu of taking concert opera to the boroughs, the Met presented a single splashy gala with the soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the tenor Roberto Alagna, opera's best-known married couple, singing arias and duets with the Met Orchestra in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. It drew an impressive audience of 50,000 people. 
 In a statement Monday, Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said that the weak economy was ''certainly a factor'' in the company's decision to scale back its parks offerings, along with ''our desire to try something new with our outdoor Summer HD Festival.'' He added that the company had made no definite decision about the future of the parks concerts.
 The Met's pullback will distress many opera lovers. Even in amplified outdoor settings, there was a magic to having Met singers and the entire orchestra visit your neighborhood park. Yet over the last 15 years the turnouts for some of the concert opera performances have been disappointing. I remember a ''Carmen'' at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx starring Denyce Graves that drew about 3,000 people, an appreciative though sadly small audience. 
 That aside, during Monday night's recital the three exuberant singers gave their all. The Carlos Moseley Music Pavilion that the Met once used (and the New York Philharmonic, which began its outdoor concerts this week, still employs) has a sound system that is about as adequate as amplified outdoor classical music can get. The system at SummerStage is hopeless for opera, though during pre-performance greetings from officials it was announced that thanks to the efforts of Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, who also spoke, a new $500,000 sound system is expected.
 For this recital, the three artists, like cast members from ''Rent,'' wore headset microphones, which allowed them to move and interact with one another. It would be unfair to assess the true vocal quality of these appealing singers from the bright, blaring, sometimes grating sounds that came from the speakers.
 Still, Mr. Szot exuded charisma and sang with suave expressivity in arias from ''Don Giovanni,'' ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' ''Carmen'' (a coolly seductive ''Toreador's Song'') and more. Casting caution aside, Mr. Shrader sang a series of highly demanding bel canto arias, replete with ornate passagework, including ''Ah! mes amis'' from ''La Fille du Regiment,'' with its nine high C's. High C is Mr. Shrader's money note, and the audience went wild after his full-voiced final one. Ms. Oropesa gave agile, clean and stylish accounts of some coloratura aria favorites, including ''Caro Nome'' from ''Rigoletto.''
 Turning to show songs, Mr. Shrader sang a disarmingly sweet account of ''Maria'' from ''West Side Story.'' And Mr. Szot showed why by now he owns ''Some Enchanted Evening.'' There were cheers and encores. Still, the recital signaled a pullback from the Met's commitment to live outdoor opera. As some commentators have said, for better or worse, the real ''people's opera'' these days may be the Met's HD broadcasts.
 The next performance in the Metropolitan Opera's Summer Recital Series will be on Friday at Crotona Park, 173rd Street and Crotona Avenue, the Bronx; (212) 362-6000, metopera.org/parks.

HEADLINE: Chinese Scholars Call for Release of Uighur

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Huang Yuanxi contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Prominent Chinese intellectuals and writers have signed a petition calling for the release of a well-known ethnic Uighur economist in Beijing who was apparently detained last week during a bloody outbreak of ethnic violence in western China.
 The economist, Ilham Tohti, 39, who had written critically about government policies toward the Uighurs, is the best known person to be detained so far in relation to the ethnic strife.
 Mr. Tohti, a professor at the Central University for Nationalities, vanished from his Beijing home sometime last week and made a call to a friend to say he would be detained. 
 Mr. Tohti ran a Web site called Uighur Online, which had become a popular forum for discussion of issues important to the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking ethnic group of mostly Sunni Muslims that is the largest in oil-rich Xinjiang, China's biggest administrative region. The site is now blocked in China.
 Ethnic tensions between the Uighurs and the Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, exploded last week after a Uighur protest on July 5 in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, turned violent when riot police officers tried to halt the rally. Uighur mobs rampaged through the city, killing many Han civilians and setting fire to cars and buildings.
 For days afterward, Han mobs with sticks and knives attacked and killed Uighurs.
 The government says at least 184 people were killed and 1,680 injured, the vast majority being Han. But many Uighurs in Urumqi say that count does not include hundreds of Uighurs killed by security forces or by Han vigilantes. The state news agency reported Monday that police officers shot dead two armed Uighurs and wounded a third.
 On July 6, Nur Bekri, the governor of Xinjiang, said in a speech that Uighur Online had helped instigate the rioting by spreading rumors. 
 Chinese officials insist that Uighurs abroad and some inside China were responsible for starting the violence. The officials avoid any discussion of systemic problems in Xinjiang that have led to deep-rooted resentment among many Uighurs: the large numbers of Han migrating to Xinjiang in the past decades and taking jobs, for example, or the restrictions on religious practice.
 Mr. Tohti had been increasingly critical of the lack of jobs for Uighurs and policies that encouraged the influx of Han settlers. 
 ''Unemployment among Uighurs is among the highest in the world,'' he said in an interview in March with Radio Free Asia, which is supported by the United States government. While doing research for the Chinese government at one point in the 1990s, Mr. Tohti said, he discovered that there were 1.5 million unemployed workers in Xinjiang.
 The petition to free Mr. Tohti was started by Wang Lixiong, one of China's leading experts on ethnic minority issues and the husband of Woeser, a well-known Tibetan blogger. The petition had 158 signatures early Wednesday. The signers are mostly ethnic Han and are from all over China.
 One of the signers, Ran Yunfei, a well-known magazine editor and blogger who is of Monguor, or Tu, ethnicity, said in a telephone interview: ''Even if we don't have democracy, we should have freedom of speech. And they should not detain someone for his remarks. As far as I know, Professor Ilham's Web site is a very gentle and rational one.''
 In the radio interview in March, Mr. Tohti said he was concerned about being imprisoned for his writings.
 ''Of course I worry, but what I have said doesn't conflict with Chinese law,'' he said. ''If they put me in jail, I am ready. I've sat in front of a computer for so many years -- jail would give me a chance to exercise and lose weight.''

HEADLINE: Daffy's, Discounter of Clothes, Promotes a Rental Bargain

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
IT has been 22 years since Irving Shulman shortened the name of his discount clothing chain from Daffy Dan's to Daffy's in a bid to class up the brand, which was known for goofy marketing stunts like perching mannequins on the roof so passers-by would run in to warn of suicide jumpers, then hopefully stay for the bargains. 
 Today Daffy's is one of the oldest operating discount chains in the Northeast. But lately it has found itself in competition with some unlikely rivals: luxury department stores like Saks and Neiman Marcus that have started advertising on Daffy's turf, stressing low prices over fashion or luxury. 
 ''If you walk down the street, every shop window's got a discount sign on it now,'' said Jan Jacobs, co-founder of Johannes Leonardo, Daffy's new creative agency, which is backed by the WPP Group. Daffy's has had a firm hold on the off-price market since it was founded 48 years ago, he said, ''but because of the economy and everyone offering discounts, they are disappearing into the background.'' 
 Looking to reclaim the discount mantle, Daffy's is starting a quirky marketing campaign centered on a contest that will award one person the kind of value not generally associated with a clothing store: a one-year lease on a fully furnished $7,000-a-month apartment in Manhattan's West Village neighborhood at $700 a month. 
 Starting July 23, people can go to select Daffy's locations and create a 30-second video explaining why they deserve the apartment. The company will post the best videos on its Web site, eventually nominating five finalists from which the public will choose a winner by Sept. 16. 
 Daffy's, which is based in North Bergen, N.J., will advertise the contest in some nontraditional (read: inexpensive) ways. The company will post ads for the apartment in the housing section of Craigslist and tape handwritten fliers around the city with tear-off tabs bearing the number of a contest hotline. 
 More traditional prints ads -- featuring glamour shots of the apartment from inside and out--will appear in magazines like New York and Time Out New York, and promotional materials will appear in all Daffy's stores. The company will also operate a pop-up store for the length of the campaign out of the ground floor of the building in which the apartment is located, which is One Seventh Avenue South. The apartment will be open for tours by the public, and a sign in the window will identify it for people on the street. 
 The hope is that the wildly discounted apartment will strike a chord with rent-conscious New Yorkers, and generate conversation about Daffy's.
 ''One thing we all have in common in New York is that we all pay too much to live here,'' Mr. Jacobs, whose agency is based in the West Village, said. ''Real estate is sort of the No. 1 dinnertime conversation in New York, and we wanted to engage that.''
 Will Bracker, director of marketing at Daffy's, said the campaign was ''beautifully fused to what this brand is all about,'' and furthered Daffy's tradition of marketing efforts that focused on creating buzz. (In addition to the mannequin stunt, Daffy's once sold silver dollars for 88 cents.)
 ''The mannequin on the roof, that got the cops involved,'' Mr. Bracker said. ''We don't expect that to happen this time around, but the idea did make us uncomfortable in a good way.''
 Daffy's operates 17 stores in New York and North Jersey, and one in Philadelphia. People wanting to enter the contest will be encouraged to check the store's Web site to find out which stores will have video booths and when. 
 It's not hard to understand why Daffy's chose now to hire an agency and produce a coordinated marketing effort -- things it has done only sporadically during its history. 
 Since the economy took a nosedive last year, shoppers have sought out stores that they believe give them more for their money. In the last 12 months, sales at discount retail chains like Daffy's, T. J. Maxx and Filene's Basement have risen 0.6 percent, while department store sales have dropped 6.3 percent and specialty store sales have dropped 5.5 percent, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. 
 Of course, a sales bump of less than 1 percent hardly translates to boom times for any company. Filene's Basement filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year, and Mr. Bracker said that while ''this is the year to be in the off-price business,'' Daffy's was ''striving to hold our own'' against increased competition and scaled-back spending.
 Still, the numbers suggest that discount shopping has, at least for now, lost its stigma among more upscale customers, said Marshal Cohen, an NPD analyst, in part because luxury brands themselves have been flying the discount flag, creating opportunity for Daffy's. 
 ''It is no longer a necessity to keep it a secret if you shop at these discount, off-price retailers,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''In fact, it has almost become more fashionable'' than shopping at luxury brands.
 He also said Daffy's knew what it was doing by focusing on buzz over traditional advertising. 
 ''By far the No. 1 influence on why a consumer will shop in an off-price store is word of mouth,'' he said. ''The kind of conversation where someone says to a friend, 'Hey, great jacket you're wearing. Where did you get it?' ''
 Daffy's may not need to fight for the discount title much longer, however. Unlike luxury and department stores, companies like Daffy's and Filene's Basement are able to offer steep discounts by buying leftover inventory that manufacturers' warehouses are unable to sell to department stores. Mr. Cohen said that stores like Neiman Marcus and Saks would soon have to return to higher prices to stay solvent. 
 ''Daffy's will have an opportunity when other retailers go back to try and get full price if they can keep this momentum alive,'' he said. ''The pressure will be on them to stay front-and-center in the consumer's mind when the economy turns around.''

HEADLINE: Germany Has Been Slow to Fix Its Banks

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Farhad Farassat, a Munich-based entrepreneur, blames fickle banks for his difficulty getting a loan. But, like many Germans, his problem may be largely political.
 Mr. Farassat tried to borrow 900,000 euros, or about $1.25 million, to keep his computer chip manufacturer, based just outside Munich, afloat. But last April, the bank he has been using for 17 years balked.
 ''The managers hid from us,'' Mr. Farassat said. When he finally spoke to them they told him ''it just would not work.'' 
 Germany, the largest economy in Europe, is showing signs of being an unfortunate example of what happens when a country does not move quickly to deal with an embattled banking system as lending dries up. And many experts blame the German government's refusal to force a restructuring onto its financial system.
 With national elections two months away, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has tiptoed around the hard choices needed to recapitalize and restructure the banking system, experts and analysts said. The end result, they fear, will be a longer recession in Germany, where the economy is expected to shrink by at least 6 percent this year, and Germany's export-driven economy may lose out when the rest of the world gets back to business. 
 ''The problem is going to come when we want to get out of the crisis,'' said Klaus Zimmermann, head of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. ''The banking sector has to be there and be healthy. And the banks won't be able to participate in the process.''
 Germany lies at the heart of a Europe that generally has been slower to clean up its financial system than the United States, according to the International Monetary Fund. In its recent Global Financial Stability report, the I.M.F. pointed out that capital ratios among banks in the 16-nation euro area were 7.3 percent at the end of 2008, compared with 10.4 percent in the United States.
 And a fund official who requested anonymity while speaking about specific countries said the recent move by American officials to stress-test banks, and compel those who do poorly to raise new money, probably extended the United States' lead.
 ''As a whole Europe is simply not tackling the banking problem,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London and a Germany expert. ''Germany is the most worrisome case, and denial of problems has been more pronounced there than elsewhere.''
 Banks have fought the notion of a widespread credit crisis by pointing to data showing continued growth in lending in Germany. Data from the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, for example, shows that the volume of new short-term loans -- those extended for up to a year -- grew by 15.9 percent in May compared with the same month last year.
 But lenders have pulled back sharply on larger loans at longer maturities, the statistics show. In May, the volume of new loans for up to five years fell 32.7 percent compared with the same month in 2008.
 That breeds immense frustration among German companies. After the free fall in the world economy early this year, many want to plan for the upswing, but feel starved of credit.
 A poll of electrical engineering firms revealed that 57 percent of the 1,600 questioned said they had problems getting loans, up from only 5 percent in March. 
 ''It's pretty clear that the banks are turning the screws,'' said Hanns-Peter Ohl, a director of VDMA, an association of machine-tool makers in Bavaria.
 Lars Hofer, a spokesman for the German Association of Banks, did not dispute that longer-term loans were harder to grant, but blamed it on the general financial turbulence.
 ''There are fewer syndicates for loans, and a weak long-term financing system,'' he said.
 The German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, has strongly criticized banks, in public and in a letter last week to bank lobbyists, for not passing on lower interest rates to their clients, and threatened government measures to lend directly. 
 But Germany has been notably reluctant to push through changes to its banking system that might ease the crisis.
 Unlike the United States, Britain and France, Germany made government recapitalization voluntary last fall; most private sector banks declined to take part. 
 ''What the government has done was much delayed,'' said Gernot Nerb, an economist at the Ifo Institute in Munich. ''And what they agreed on was the least-common denominator of the various interests at hand.''
 Germany's plan to sequester bad assets from the banking system has drawn nearly universal condemnation. The mechanism allows banks to swap illiquid securities for government-guaranteed bonds for 20 years, instead of pushing the troubled assets off bank books entirely.
 Its virtue, Mr. Nerb pointed out, is mainly political: no taxpayer money is required at the moment.
 A document leaked recently from Bafin, the country's financial regulator, stated that German banks had 800 billion euros in bad debt on their books. Bafin later added, without clarification, that 200 billion euros were truly ''toxic,'' while the rest were ''nonstrategic'' assets.
 The most serious problems have been at Germany's Landesbanks, regional lenders that speculated heavily in securities linked to the flailing American housing market. Many of the bad assets lie with them, experts believe.
 In her bid to win re-election in the Sept. 27 polling, Chancellor Merkel, a conservative, is angling to ditch her unwieldy coalition with the leftist Social Democrats in favor of the centrist Free Democrats. That means balancing alleviating the economic crisis with Germans' well-known aversion to debt, especially when the cash might go to banks, which are unpopular even in the best of times.
 The result has been a tendency to emphasize the foreign nature of the crisis, despite Germany's own contribution to it. ''It makes political sense for Merkel to play down the structural problems in Germany and play up the crisis as an Anglo-Saxon creation,'' Mr. Tilford said.

HEADLINE: As Board Convenes, Pessimism Looms

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Commissioner David Stern said Tuesday that less than half the N.B.A.'s teams turned a profit last season and that some owners had argued that a worst-case decrease in the salary cap of 5 percent might be too optimistic. 
 The league's board of governors convened here and will meet again Aug. 4 with the players union in hopes of jump-starting negotiations toward reaching a new collective bargaining agreement. The current one expires in June 2011.
 Last week, the league predicted that its salary cap could drop to between $50.4 million and $53.6 million in 2010-11, which would represent a loss between 2.5 percent and 5 percent in basketball-related revenue. On Tuesday, Stern added that teams could face at least a 10 percent drop in ticket revenue next season.
 ''We are anxious to get going,'' Stern said of the negotiations. ''We're not planning on a miracle here, but on the other hand, we'd be prepared to accept one.'' 
 Stern also announced the appointment of a labor-relations committee of 10 owners that would be headed by the San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt.
 ''There is complete agreement that we need to look for a system that keeps our players -- as well paid as they are -- at the top of the heap, but on the other hand returns the league to profitability at the same time,'' Stern said.
 Some observers predict that the next collective bargaining agreement will feature drastic changes and that players will be forced to make concessions because of the economy. 
 In response to the league memorandum that the salary cap will probably decrease next season, Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, cautioned that it could have a chilling effect on future signings. 
 ''If it later turns out that the league did not have a good-faith basis for making these projections, the N.B.P.A. will pursue all available legal remedies, including a treble damages claim for collusion,'' Hunter told ESPN.com last week. 
 When asked about Hunter's statement, Stern smiled. 
 ''We've been in touch,'' Stern said. ''He knows that we welcome him saying whatever he needs to say, but the facts are out and you'll see our numbers and our projections out there.''

HEADLINE: Johnson & Johnson Profit Fell 3.5% in 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday that its second-quarter profit fell 3.6 percent as the global recession, weak dollar and generic competition took their toll on sales, particularly for prescription drugs. 
 Still, the company beat Wall Street's expectations, as the firm reduced spending on sales, administration and research by about 13 percent and production costs by 6 percent.
 Johnson & Johnson, whose products include baby shampoo, Tylenol, contraceptives and biotech drugs, earned $3.21 billion, or $1.15 a share, down from $3.33 billion, or $1.17 a share, a year ago.
 Revenue fell 7.4 percent, to $15.24 billion, from $16.45 billion a year ago. The decline was partly because of a combined drop of nearly $1 billion for two medicines that recently lost patent protection, allowing generic competitors to be introduced -- Risperdal, an antipsychotic drug, and Topamax, an epilepsy treatment.
 Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, were looking for earnings of $1.11 a share and revenue of $15 billion.
 ''This was one of the most difficult years in our history,'' Dominic Caruso, the company's chief financial officer, told analysts during a conference call.
 But he said operational results -- sales excluding the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, which cut total revenue by about 6 percent -- were better than expected.
 In an interview, Mr. Caruso said currency rates hurt the quarter's results the most, followed by lower sales of Risperdal and Topamax, each down two-thirds or more. Excluding those factors, he said, sales would have been up roughly $770 million, or 4.6 percent.
 Johnson & Johnson confirmed its 2009 profit forecast, at $4.45 to $4.55 a share, excluding items. Analysts forecast $4.51 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Sales declined in the United States and abroad, and in all three business segments. Pharmaceutical sales fell the most, by just over 13 percent. Bright spots included Concerta, for attention deficit disorder, and Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis.

HEADLINE: The Gyro's History Unfolds

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
 SHOUTING over the hiss and screech of an assembly line, Chris Tomaras described the feat of food engineering that made him rich.
 ''The trick,'' he yelled in a heavy Greek accent, ''is to use certain forces, like temperature and pressure, to preserve the product as a solid mass, so it doesn't deteriorate.''
 A dapper man with a rich baritone voice and a gray mustache, Mr. Tomaras, 73, was narrating a tour of Kronos Foods, the world's largest manufacturer of gyros (pronounced YEE-ros, Greek for ''spin''), the don't-ask mystery meat that has been a Greek restaurant staple in the United States since the mid 1970s. Cones of gyro meat rotate on an estimated 50,000 vertical broilers across the country, to be carved a few slices at a time and folded in pita bread along with a dollop of yogurt sauce.
 Kronos is the perfect place to pose a couple of questions that seem as if they should have been answered many hurried lunches ago: What are gyros anyway, and who made them a ubiquitous feature of Greek menus across the United States? 
 And now is an appropriate time to delve into this enigma wrapped in a flatbread. A cheap meal looks pretty appealing lately, and more people than ever seem to be succumbing to this $5 temptation.
 While almost all segments of the restaurant industry are suffering, the titans of the gyro -- all of them based in Chicago -- report that sales are either steady or way up.
 These companies are private, so their word will have to do. But Kronos is preparing to move to a new plant that will enable it to crank out enough cones for 600,000 sandwiches a day, about twice the capacity in its current address. A few miles away, at Devanco Foods, Peter Bartzis, the president of the company, reports record sales. ''I've been through a few recessions,'' Mr. Bartzis said, ''and they're good times to be in the gyros business.''
 Mr. Tomaras opened Kronos in 1975 and sold it to a private equity firm in 1994. But he returned to the plant, on a dead-end industrial road in Chicago's southwest side, to explain how gyros are made. It's a show and tell that is not for the squeamish.
 The process starts with boxes of raw beef and lamb trimmings, and ends with what that looks like oversized Popsicles the shade of a Band-Aid. In between, the meat is run through a four-ton grinder, where bread crumbs, water, oregano and other seasonings are added. A clumpy paste emerges and is squeezed into a machine that checks for metal and bone. (''You can never be too careful,'' Mr. Tomaras said.) Hydraulic pressure -- 60 pounds per square inch -- is used to fuse the meat into cylinders, which are stacked on trays and then rolled into a flash freezer, where the temperature is 20 degrees below zero.
 Gyros are believed to have originated in Greece. (They're similar to the doner kebabs of Turkey and shawarma of the Middle East, which are slices of meat, rather than a minced loaf.) But they were never mass produced in Europe, according to the gyro magnates of this city. Until the early 1970s, the cones were made one at a time, in restaurant kitchens using family recipes.
 Then someone thought, why not make gyro cones the same way you make cars?
 The question is: Who is the Henry Ford of the gyro? It turns out there are a handful of contenders, all of whom know one another and have been friendly competitors for decades. They include George Apostolou, who says he served the first gyros in the United States, in the Parkview Restaurant in Chicago, in 1965, and nine years later opened a 3,000-square-foot manufacturing plant, Central Gyros Wholesale.
 ''The response to the product was tremendous,'' Mr. Apostolou said. ''My two brothers and I, we became millionaires in two years' time.''
 And what of Mr. Tomaras?
 ''Chris claims that he brought the product here,'' Mr. Apostolou said, rather dryly. ''This is a lie.''
 But an engineer named Peter Parthenis says he beat Mr. Apostolou to mass production by a year, with Gyros Inc., in 1973. Mr. Parthenis started by building rotisseries, but soon realized the money was in the meat. 
 ''We didn't have a distribution deal in the early days,'' said Mr. Parthenis, who like Mr. Apostolou is now retired. ''So the first gyros ever shipped out of Chicago we put on a Greyhound bus, headed to Atlanta. Frozen in a double corrugated box, with the luggage.''
 Case closed? Well, another contender, Andre Papantoniou, a founder and the president of Olympia Food Industries, says the gyro plant was actually the brainchild of the improbably named John Garlic.
 This initially sounds like a joke, but Mr. Papantoniou swears that during the rotisserie-making phase of Mr. Parthenis's career, one John Garlic showed up in Chicago in search of a partner in a gyro plant he'd started in Milwaukee.
 It's true, Mr. Parthenis said in a second call, though he remembers little about his former partner, except that the guy looked like a hippie. Who Mr. Garlic was and why he made gyros are questions that Mr. Parthenis can't answer: ''He was like a phantom. He came out of nowhere.''
 There is little about John Garlic in news archives, aside from a 1978 story in The Milwaukee Sentinel, in which a John J. Garlic discusses his plans to keep trained dolphins in a former municipal pool he'd bought in the city and wanted to turn into a restaurant with a kind of Sea World sideshow.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Garlic is no longer around to discuss matters; he died of kidney failure in 1994. But his wife, Margaret Garlic, can provide answers.
 So, who was John Garlic?
 ''He was this big guy,'' she said, ''like 6 foot 2 inches tall, dark curly hair, couple hundred pounds. A former Marine. A super intelligent, super entertaining man. My brother used to say, 'When John Garlic enters a room, you know you're going to have fun.' ''
 And he was Greek?
 ''No, no,'' she said. ''He was Jewish.''
 As we digest the fact that the Father of the American Gyro was Jewish, we ask the obvious next question: Where did he get the idea?
 ''From me,'' Ms. Garlic said. ''One afternoon, I was watching 'What's My Line?' and there was a Greek restaurant owner on the show, and he did this demonstration, carving meat off a gyro. I immediately called an operator and asked for the number of a Greek restaurant in New York. The owner I got on the phone said, 'Go to Chicago, there's a huge Greek community.' '' At the time, Mr. Garlic was a Cadillac salesman, in his late 30s, but he quickly saw his future in gyro cones. After finding a Chicago chef willing to share a recipe, the couple rented space in a sausage plant and cranked out history's first assembly-line gyro cones. They were a hit.
 ''We supplied summer festivals, universities, some restaurants,'' Ms. Garlic said. ''John could sell anything.''
 Hoping to expand, he sought out Peter Parthenis. There were tensions from the start; Mr. Parthenis says his own buttoned-down style didn't jibe with the unbuttoned Mr. Garlic. According to Ms. Garlic, Mr. Parthenis wanted to run the company on his own. Mr. Parthenis paid the Garlics a modest buyout fee -- nobody recalls how much -- and the partnership dissolved.
 Feeling somewhat burned but eager to move on, the couple eventually opened that restaurant with the dolphins, and two others, none of which sold gyros.
 The Garlics moved to Orlando, Fla., in the early 1980s, where John sold subdivisions for a developer. He did well, but when he became sick, the family's savings were drained to pay for treatments not covered by insurance. After herhusband died, Ms. Garlic waited tables to support her children.
 As gyros went nationwide and earned millions for a handful of entrepreneurs, the sight of rotisseries broke Ms. Garlic's heart a little. ''That was our idea,'' she would think. She's rarely discussed her and her husband's role in Greek-American food history, but only because the subject rarely comes up. When it does, people think she's kidding.
 No hard feelings, though. 
 ''What's done is done,'' she said. ''We did other things with our lives, and we've got a lot of great memories.''

HEADLINE: Madoff Arrives at a Federal Prison in North Carolina

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
Bernard L. Madoff lived most of his life in spacious mansions and sun-drenched beachfront villas or aboard luxurious yachts.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Madoff arrived at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in a blue prison jumpsuit, his hands and feet shackled, to begin serving a 150-year prison sentence for orchestrating one of the largest frauds in history. 
 Inside its prison fencing, the complex, about 45 minutes northwest of Raleigh, N.C., may look like a sedate college campus. But its medium-security facility, where Mr. Madoff, 71, the former Wall Street financier, will initially live, is populated with violent criminals, drug dealers and gang members, most of them serving life sentences of their own. The Bureau of Prisons has projected a release date of Nov. 14, 2139, for Mr. Madoff, assuming he gets early release credit for good behavior.
 ''The problem is really not going to be Bernie Madoff; he will likely be a model inmate,'' said Edward S. Bales, who runs Federal Prison Consultants, which provides services to prospective inmates.
 ''It's going to be how the other inmates react to him. There will be people who were out of work and who have lost their homes and blame him for the economy, they may also be jealous and believe he has billions of dollars hidden somewhere.''
 After prison guards strip him of his clothing and conduct a full-body search, Mr. Madoff, now inmate No. 61727-054, will probably undergo an extensive mental health evaluation to determine whether he is a potential suicide risk.
 Prison consultants said the Butner facility is known for housing criminals in need of mental health treatment. While officials evaluate his mental status, the onetime investment manager could be placed in solitary confinement, monitored day and night and allowed to leave his cell for only about an hour each day.
 If prison psychologists determine Mr. Madoff's mental health is stable, he will be transferred into the general population, where he will live with other inmates in dormitory-style housing, be allowed to receive visitors several times a week and watch television or visit the gym. 
 Mr. Madoff's lawyer had requested that he be kept in a federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., and Judge Denny Chin, who presided over the case, recommended that he stay in the Northeast. Federal prison guidelines mandate that inmates be held within 500 miles of their previous home, raising the possibility that Mr. Madoff could be transferred to a prison in the Northeast later.
 Other inmates in Butner include John Rigas, founder of Adelphia Communications, and his son, Timothy, who were convicted of fraud in 2004. Both men are in the prison's low-security facility, which houses inmates convicted of lesser crimes.
 Butner also holds Randy Cunningham, the former California congressman, and Omar Abdel-Rahman, also known as the blind sheik, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 for his role in a plot to kill President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and blow up New York City landmarks.
 John Hinckley Jr., who tried to kill President Reagan, and the evangelist Jim Bakker also served time at Butner. 
 ''He will survive, but it is not going to be an easy road,'' Mr. Bales said.

HEADLINE: Higher Energy Costs Lift Prices and Retail Sales

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
A recent surge in energy prices helped drive up both retail sales and prices that producers paid, the government reported Tuesday.
 Retail sales rose 0.6 percent, slightly more than economists expected, as car dealerships enjoyed their best month since January and oil prices lifted receipts at gas stations, the Commerce Department reported.
 Analysts dismissed the jump in vehicle sales, attributing it to a result of pent-up demand and discount offers. A separate set of industry figures that were previously released and used for preliminary calculations for the second-quarter gross domestic product showed a drop in auto sales from May. 
 ''There wasn't anything extraordinary in June versus the last few months,'' said Ron Harbour, a partner at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. ''Any little uptick in demand now gets people excited.''
 Autodata, an analysis firm based in New Jersey, said June auto sales dropped 42 percent from a year earlier at Chrysler and 34 percent at General Motors. In comparison, year-to-year sales have declined 10.7 percent at the Ford Motor Company, the sole member of Detroit's Big Three to avoid bankruptcy.
 Retail sales have ''clearly improved since the winter, but they're not as good as you might hope given the amount of government stimulus that's gone to people's wallets,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Consultants. ''There are considerable headwinds that fiscal policy is going up against. Household balance sheets are a wreck and the labor market is still extremely weak.''
 But consumers kept their pocketbooks zipped for nonessential items. Clothing and food spending largely stabilized, while expenses for building materials, health care goods and general merchandise continued to fall.
 Excluding sales of cars and gasoline, overall sales fell 0.2 percent, continuing a downward slide that began in February.
 Separately, the Labor Department reported a 1.8 percent increase in the Producer Price Index, a measure of prices paid by retailers to factories and farmers. That increase caught economists by surprise as the index rose only 0.2 percent in May, and surveys before the government release indicated a 0.9 percent rise in June.
 The jump in producer prices will probably revive the debate over whether the economy is headed toward inflation.
 High unemployment and weak wages have largely constrained retailers' pricing power, but June proved that higher energy prices beyond the retailers' control could be significant. On the horizon, the consequences of the large financial sector bailout and stimulus package remain unclear, as the Treasury Department said Monday that the federal deficit reached nearly $1.1 trillion in June.
 On Wednesday, the government will release its Consumer Price Index reading, a measure similar to the Producer Price Index but for the prices that consumers see on the shelf.
 Many economists, however, say fears of an inflationary resurgence are as of now premature. The June figure was swayed by energy prices. 
 ''We're experiencing deflation still,'' Bernard Baumohl, of the Economic Outlook Group, said. ''That's largely because U.S. and international economies are so very weak.''
 Excluding food and energy prices, the so-called core Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in June, the most since October and also more than expected. In contrast, core prices dipped 0.1 percent in May.
 Over the last month, the cost of gasoline surged 18.5 percent and home heating oil rose 15.4 percent. Jet fuel also soared, rising 26.7 percent after a 1 percent dip in May, to further pinch the bottom line at struggling airlines. But after a mid-June high of more than $70 a barrel, crude oil has been trending downward. 
 Crude oil futures were trading around $60 a barrel on Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. ''Whatever influence energy has had, I think that is going to have a diminishing effect in the months ahead,'' Mr. Baumohl said.

HEADLINE: For Chefs, The Odds Grow Longer

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

DATELINE: Las Vegas 

 BODY:
 IN the late, lamented boom, waiters at luxury restaurants here could make $150,000 a year and more thanks to the electrifying arrival of high rollers renowned as ''the whales.'' 
 Robert Martinez, a 33-year-old waiter at Rao's in Caesars Palace, said these heavyweights ''had wads of $100 bills and gave them to everyone on the staff, and tipped generously on $12,000 to $15,000 checks.'' 
 But now, said Kevin Carter, a 49-year-old waiter at Craftsteak in the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, ''the whales have migrated.'' 
 Last year, a fourth of the country's highest-grossing restaurants were in Las Vegas. But the feast has transitioned to famine. Fewer revelers are arriving, and they are spending less. With the economy reeling, more than 5,000 food and restaurant workers are unemployed here. 
 ''We look out and we see every jet coming and going,'' said Michael N. Baker, 50, a waiter for eight years at the Top of the World restaurant in the Stratosphere Casino Hotel tower. ''They used to be stacked up all day long,'' he added. ''Then there was nothing out there. That was scary.''
 Many of the town's 2,900 restaurants are beset by fabulousness fatigue. 
 ''It was gold, and suddenly it became fool's gold,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a restaurant consulting firm that bears his name. 
 Bill Lerner, a principal of Union Gaming, a research company, said that there were ''too many five-star restaurants, shows, spas -- too many celebrity chefs.'' 
 On the Strip, near Circus Circus, is the yawning emptiness of the $4.8 billion, 87-acre Echelon project, halted last August along with its 12 to 15 new restaurants, including those of chefs such as David Chang of Momofuku Ko in Manhattan. 
 The unfinished, mirrored blue eyesore of the $2.9 billion 3,815-room Fontainebleau tower across from Circus Circus looms over the city like a prophecy. It went bankrupt and took 6,000 jobs with it. 
 But in the desert restaurant universe, a mirage has now arisen that could mean either salvation or doom: the $8.5 billion CityCenter project. 
 Bristling with construction cranes and gleaming in the 100-degree sun, the CityCenter casino, hotel, convention center, mall, residential and entertainment metropolis looks like a hallucinogenic 67-acre Red Grooms parody of the Las Vegas Strip. The development spans a quarter-mile, from the Bellagio to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, and is scheduled to open in December. 
 Some 30 restaurants are to inhabit the jumble of seven buildings -- from tapered towers to crystalline shards -- designed by eight celebrity architects, including Sir Norman Foster and Daniel Libeskind. On display, and on trial, will be the concepts of lionized chefs, among them Pierre Gagnaire, Michael Mina, Masayoshi Takayama, Wolfgang Puck and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. 
 For some, CityCenter, developed by MGM Mirage and Dubai World, will offer treasures that transcend buzz and hype: 4,000 food and restaurant jobs, a third of the complex's 12,000 new jobs. 
 But if it cannibalizes existing restaurants it could further wound this once-sleepy railroad watering stop beset by a sere immensity of sand. 
 Already sin city has become a sandbox of incentives, discounts and promotions, where even luxury properties like the Bellagio are offering free hotel nights, plus gambling, food and drink coupons to their club-card customers. 
 Some economizing tourists are fleeing their casinos to dine off-Strip. But neighborhood restaurants are under growing pressure from the Strip, since residents are being courted as never before by casinos with ''staycation packages'' that include restaurant meals. 
 And so, amid the hawkers and escort-service card-flippers, a dizzying profusion of bargain-eats signs are competing. They include giant come-ons for the ''$5.99 New York Steak N Eggs'' at Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon; the mammoth billboard at the Tropicana Casino & Resort vaunting its ''Legendary Lobster Special $19.95,'' and the ultimate deal, the Siegel Suites billboards proclaiming ''Live Here Eat Free.'' 
 On the high end, there is a desert fiesta of advertised ''summer tasting menus'' at the MGM Grand ($60 at Craftsteak, $59 at Shibuya, $45 at SeaBlue, $39 at Nobhill Tavern). At Aureole and Mix in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, there are new prix fixe menus. Also offering deals are Mario Batali and David Burke in the Venetian, Wolfgang Puck at Spago in Caesars Palace and reduced-price ''Taste of Wynn'' promotions (including $36 menus at Society Cafe Encore and Daniel Boulud Brasserie).
 Steve Wynn, the chairman of Wynn Resorts, said that his customers ''aren't buying that bottle of Margaux, and they aren't ordering as much -- but they are here.'' His Wynn and Encore, like several properties at the high end, have 90 percent occupancy. 
 Mr. Wynn said he is encouraged that ''each month the booking window is getting longer -- it used to be 90 days, then 30 last fall, now it's coming back -- and bookings are up as well.'' 
 Last year, ''the sky was falling, and people were terrified,'' said Elizabeth Blau, a restaurant consultant. ''Now things have stabilized.'' 
 But for many Las Vegas restaurateurs, flat is still the new up, and for some, ''being down 10 percent, that's the new flat,'' said Joseph Bastianich, Mario Batali's partner in three restaurants at the Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino.
 Mr. Bastianich said his Carnevino Italian Steakhouse in the Palazzo at the Venetian was projecting $18 million in revenues this year but now ''we expect to do $13 million to $14 million.''
 Sirio Maccioni, a Las Vegas fine-dining pioneer with his restaurants Le Cirque and Osteria del Circo at the Bellagio, cautioned that ''it will take a very long time for it to come back to the way it was.'' He noted that recently revenues from his restaurants have been down 5 to 10 percent, and last year were off 25 percent.
 Waiters at high-end properties have suffered a reduction in tips from 20 to 50 percent. ''Our membership has declined 10 or 11 percent since last year,'' said D. Taylor, the secretary treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents 50,000 food and beverage workers and other employees in hotels and casinos. 
 Mr. Martinez of Rao's said the staff had agreed to a reduction in the workweek from 5 days to 4, and in the workday from 8 hours to 6, just to save all their jobs. He estimated the average check cost for his tables was down $30, to $50. 
 And a grim recession game of musical-chair seniority has commenced. Francisco Rufino, a 33-year-old fry cook at the Paris Las Vegas casino hotel for the last nine years, was bumped down to a cafe there because of cutbacks at a higher-end casino restaurant. ''In turn, I displaced another cook -- who was laid off,'' he said. 
 Nevertheless, many still have hopes. Mr. Bastianich is planning a restaurant at the Venetian, tentatively titled Nancy's Luncheonette, offering the food of Nancy Silverton, his Los Angeles partner in Osteria Mozza with Mr. Batali.
 Mr. Maccioni, who said he is 75, has not been deterred from opening a Tuscan-themed restaurant in CityCenter -- ''with 175 seats and a beautiful bar,'' he said -- to be called Sirio.
 The city's restaurateurs have hardly stopped rising to astounding levels in offering luxury to refined palates. The 300-seat Carnevino offers source-verified grass-fed beef, dry-aged for seven weeks in its own Las Vegas aging facility where computer chips control air flow and humidity. 
 And the 230-seat Bartolotta Ristorante di Mare in the Wynn flies in a ton of seafood every week from the Mediterranean, including soft-shell crabs from Venice and imperial red shrimp from Morocco. Some of the fish is delivered live, and all of it is transported ''on passenger airliners that would be flying whether my fish is on them or not,'' said Paul Bartolotta, 48, who once trained at Taillevent in Paris and cooked at Spiaggia in Chicago.
 Rick Moonen at RM Seafood in the Mandalay Bay offers three kinds of East Coast oysters, as well as live Dungeness crabs and Maine lobsters. ''You have to be crazy to want to offer sustainable seafood in the middle of the desert,'' said Mr. Moonen, who was awarded three stars from The New York Times in 2002 for his work at RM Seafood in Manhattan, and now, like Mr. Bartolotta, lives out here. 
 But Mr. Moonen and others are finding that luxury can only take them so far these days. At his sleek $6 million nautically themed restaurant, volume is up, he said, but the check average, which used to be $65 to $70, is now ''in the 40s.'' Three months ago, Mr. Moonen had to close his 80-seat fine-dining restaurant, RM Seafood Upstairs, where the average check was $120. ''It was a terrible day,'' he said, ''but we'll reopen in the fall.'' 
 Alessandro Stratta said his casual restaurant at Wynn Las Vegas, Stratta, with its average check cost of $60, ''is 30 percent busier this year than it was last year.'' But his high-end restaurant, Alex, with an average $320 check per person, is down 15 percent in revenues, and is now open four days instead of five. 
 In this economy, said David McIntyre, vice president for food and beverage at the MGM Grand, ''it's not enough to just come out with a prix fixe menu, you have to redefine your product.'' 
 So the casino's Nobhill Tavern reconceived its menu boards and now ''there is a 40 percent decline per check,'' Mr. McIntyre said. ''But now we're up 60 percent in total volume.''
 And though the 66-seat Joel Robuchon still offers a 16-course $385 menu degustation, it now serves two courses for $89. 
 Therefore, the arrival of competing restaurants at CityCenter is not universally awaited. 
 ''I don't wish ill to anyone,'' Mr. Bartolotta said, ''but do we need 20 more restaurants? No. Now, everyone is vying for a part of a shrinking pie.''
 But Bart Mahoney, vice president for food and beverage of the CityCenter partner MGM Mirage, said that ''We hope to grow the market.'' 
 Robert Goldstein, the 54-year-old president of a competitor, the Venetian, sounded sanguine about CityCenter as he sat in his second-floor office overlooking the casino's signature 90-percent-scale replicas of the Campanile and the Bridge of Sighs. ''It's not going to be the end of the world, and it's not going to restart tourism in Las Vegas,'' he said. ''It's just another project opening in a tough time.'' 
 He referred to a Life magazine cover article of June 20, 1955, that he had framed, depicting casino cancan dancers and proclaiming: ''Las Vegas -- Is Boom Overextended?'' 
 He added: ''Las Vegas is down a bit now, and right now the town is overbuilt. But do you really think all of this is going to fade away and go to black?''

HEADLINE: An Advertising Campaign To Protest a Bank's Advice

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Investors who have lost money in the financial crisis have protested outside the Manhattan headquarters of Lehman Brothers and at the Congressional hearings in Washington that examined what went wrong at the American International Group. Others teamed up in lawsuits against their financial advisers for failing to warn them about risks. 
 But until recently, no one had gone so far as to hire an advertising agency to create a campaign, complete with billboards and newspaper advertisements, to pressure a British bank to guarantee the recovery of investments made through it. 
 Keith Mills, a wealthy British investor, has had billboards plastered at the bustling Charing Cross underground station and elsewhere here to protest a recommendation he said was made to him in 2007 by Coutts & Company, one of the oldest private banks in Britain, whose clients include Queen Elizabeth II. 
 Mr. Mills, 59, has accused Coutts, the private banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, of presenting its A.I.G. Life premier bonds, which were backed by the A.I.G. enhanced fund, as a safer investment than it really was and then failing to inform him and other clients of A.I.G.'s problems, even when customers asked whether their investments were secure. 
 Mr. Mills, who made his fortune by bringing the frequent-flier loyalty concept to Europe, contends the bank's ''negligent'' advice cost him $:8.1 million, or $13 million. 
 ''The message was 'I want a safe place for my money,' and they persuaded me to put it into A.I.G. bonds,'' Mr. Mills said. ''I've made and lost money before and I've invested in hedge funds. But this was an instruction to protect my capital, and that's not what they did.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Coutts said the bank denied all of Mr. Mills's allegations and declined to comment on the advertising campaign. 
 Mr. Mills said he was especially angry because when he had doubts about the safety of his investment three months later and told Coutts that he was contemplating moving the money into gilt-edged securities issued by the Bank of England, he said he was told that Coutts was not ''concerned with any risk to investors such as yourself.'' 
 The black-and-white posters, which Mr. Mills has paid to have put up at underground stations near Coutts's headquarters in London's theater district, have appeared in tandem with similar advertisements in British newspapers that he said would run for the next two weeks. 
 The ads show media headlines from last year about A.I.G.'s record fourth-quarter loss and the company's warning of subprime write-downs and then ask: ''Why did Coutts carry on recommending A.I.G. Life Enhanced Fund Bonds?'' 
 Mr. Mills said the legal effort and media campaign had cost him several hundred thousand pounds so far. 
 Mr. Mills said he became a client of Coutts, the 317-year-old private bank, about 15 years ago when he was invited to a bank reception to discuss using his expertise in loyalty programs to create a Coutts credit card that would allow customers to collect air miles. 
 Crispin Money-Coutts, the last family heir to head the bank before it was sold to Royal Bank of Scotland in 2000, persuaded Mr. Mills to become a client. The bank then advised Mr. Mills when he sold his company, Airmiles Travel Promotions, to British Airways in 1994, and more recently when he set up Team Origin, the British team to compete at the America's Cup sailing regatta. 
 Now, Mr. Mills, the son of a factory worker who was raised in Brentwood, England, says he is eager to sever his ties with the bank. 
 Mr. Mills said he first heard of the A.I.G. Life bonds at the end of 2007 shortly after he sold his second customer-loyalty product, the Nectar card, to the Canadian company Aeroplan for about $:380 million and was looking for a haven for the money as the global financial turmoil gathered pace. 
 But in September 2008, the A.I.G. enhanced fund was frozen after too many clients tried to withdraw their money. For Mr. Mills, this was evidence that the investment was not as sound as Coutts had promised. 
 For Coutts, it was the ''unprecedented run'' on the fund and not its underlying assets that led to its closing. ''Coutts remains confident that the A.I.G. Life product was sold with the appropriate advice,'' the bank said. ''It was sold as a low-risk, not no-risk, product.'' 
 Coutts said it repaid half of the $:6 billion left in the fund to investors and put the remainder into a new fund aimed at recouping as much of the investment losses as possible by July 2012, at which time A.I.G. Life had guaranteed to cover any shortfalls. 
 Unsatisfied with a guarantee from A.I.G. and by the fact that Coutts refused to also guarantee the investment, Mr. Mills sent a ''letter of claim'' to Coutts, a legal step before filing a lawsuit. Coutts has until the middle of September to offer Mr. Mills a settlement or face a court case. 
 Mr. Mills said his advertising campaign had the backing of several wealthy individuals who were also clients of Coutts, but he declined to identify them, adding that ''the queen has not signed up yet.''

HEADLINE: Goldman's Strong Profit Lifts Issues Only Slightly

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
The stock market posted modest gains on Tuesday after better-than-expected earnings from Goldman Sachs, counteracting reports of weakness in discretionary consumer spending. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.81 points, or 0.33 percent, to 8,359.49. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.79 points, or 0.53 percent, to 905.84, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 6.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,799.73. 
 The markets had already posted strong gains on Monday in anticipation of solid Goldman earnings.
 ''Goldman was center focus today,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price.
 The news from Goldman, which well-exceeded analysts' forecasts with second-quarter profits of $3.44 billion, or $4.93 a share, gave the market a slight bounce before 10 a.m. and lifted market sentiment throughout the day, traders said.
 Shares of Goldman, which jumped 5.3 percent on Monday in anticipation of the strong earnings, rose 22 cents Tuesday, to $149.66. 
 Johnson & Johnson, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, also beat expectations by severely cutting back costs in production, research and wages. But the health care company still reported that its quarterly profits fell by 3.6 percent and its revenue by 7.4 percent as its pharmaceutical division faces mounting competition from generic drugs. Shares of J.& J. rose 51 cents, to $58.23.
 The Commerce Department reported a 0.6 percent increase in June retail sales, the biggest gain since January, which came mostly from higher gasoline prices. Sales at department stores and restaurants continued to slide.
 Overseas, the major European exchanges rose after industrial production figures lifted hopes that Europe might be headed for a recovery. Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, said industrial production rose by 0.5 percent in May from the previous month -- the first increase in nine months.
 In Asia, markets benefited from Wall Street's rally on Monday. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan rose 211.48 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,261.81. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 631.10 points, or 3.66 percent, to 17,885.73. 
 Oil prices fell modestly on Tuesday. Crude oil for August delivery dropped 17 cents, to $59.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 point, to 97 4/32. The yield rose to 3.47 percent, from 3.35 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Intel Results Raise Hope For PC Sales

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
The darkest time in the personal computer industry's history may have ended.
 In the last few months, hardware makers like Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell have suffered as one-fifth to one-quarter of their computer sales vanished. For the first time ever, Microsoft, the world's largest PC software company, experienced a drop in sales of its Windows software and carried out large-scale layoffs. 
 As a result, analysts predicted that computer sales would decline at a rate four times greater than during the dot-com bust, the previous low-water mark. 
 But now there are signs that companies tied to the PC industry may stop setting unwelcome records. 
 On Tuesday, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., reported second-quarter sales of $8 billion for the quarter ended June 30. While that was a far cry from the $9.5 billion it posted in the same period last year, it beat analysts' expectations by $700 million. 
 And for the first time since the recession hit, Intel felt comfortable enough to provide a forecast for its current quarter, saying it expects revenue of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast earlier that Intel would post revenue of $7.8 billion this quarter. 
 ''Our second-quarter results were clearly better than we expected,'' said Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, during a conference call with analysts. 
 In April, Mr. Otellini declared that he thought the PC slump had reached bottom, and the company's recent financial results appear to confirm this. 
 As the world's largest chip maker, Intel helps set the pace for the computing industry. For that reason, analysts keep a close eye on the company's take on the overall market. Increases in the sales of Intel's chips tend to translate into higher computer sales for H.P., Dell and others down the road. 
 Intel has warned that businesses remain cautious about buying new PCs given the still-limping global economy. Consumers have been the ones who are proving more willing to buy new computers, particularly laptops and their diminutive low-cost cousins, netbooks. 
 ''We saw strengthening through June,'' said Stacy J. Smith, the chief financial officer at Intel, during an interview. Intel expects the rising demand to carry over into the second half of this year. 
 Mr. Smith added that sales in Asia had picked up, particularly in China, and that sales in the United States were solid. Over all, however, the immediate fiscal conditions remain sobering for Intel. 
 During its second quarter, Intel's net income fell to $1.0 billion from the $1.6 billion it reported during the same period last year. Intel earned 18 cents a share, down from 28 cents, beating analyst estimates by 10 cents. 
 Those figures exclude charges tied to a $1.45 billion fine levied against Intel by the European Commission for anticompetitive practices in the PC market. With the fine included, Intel posted a loss of $398 million, or 7 cents a share. 
 Still, Intel reported higher-than-expected gross margins and a quarter-to-quarter rise in sales of chips, lifted by healthier sales of laptop chips. 
 ''I would say the worst is behind us,'' said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at Calyon Securities. But he warned that Intel's strong results appeared to have come on the back of retailers and other sellers restocking in anticipation of higher demand in the coming months. For there to be a true PC recovery, those products will actually have to make their way into consumers' hands. 
 ''That's the part we don't know about,'' Mr. Pajjuri said.
 All of the major PC companies maintain hope that the release of Microsoft's new version of its Windows software will coax businesses and consumers to upgrade their computers. The software, Windows 7, should reach the market in October. 
 ''Hopefully, Windows 7 will be part of a catalyst,'' said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, during a speech Tuesday. ''Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.''
 The PC doldrums have put intense pressure on some of the industry's largest players. Dell, in particular, has had a steeper decline in sales than its main rivals, H.P. and Acer, because it is more dependent on PC shipments to business customers. 
 To bring its costs more in line with those of H.P. and Acer, Dell has spent much of the recession increasing its use of contract manufacturers to build its computers. That strategy runs counter to Dell's traditional approach of producing PCs at its own factories. 
 ''That stuff is behind us, and we have made those decisions,'' said Brian T. Gladden, the chief financial officer at Dell, during a meeting Tuesday with analysts. ''I think we have a path to do better here.''
 Dell believes large businesses will begin upgrading their computers in the months to come. ''Frankly, this PC refresh that we expect to happen will give us a nice path,'' Mr. Gladden said.
 Shares of Intel rose 2 percent to $16.83 ahead of the company's earnings announcement. In after-hours trading, Intel's stock jumped more than 7 percent to just above $18.

HEADLINE: For 7-Eleven, A Time to Open Doors

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Already seemingly ubiquitous, 7-Eleven, the convenience store chain, is taking advantage of the weak commercial real estate market to carry out a major expansion plan.
 The company -- which now operates or franchises approximately 5,700 stores across the United States -- announced its growth strategy in May, saying it would add more than 200 new outlets this year.
 Company officials said the two regions where growth would be strongest were California, which had almost 1,300 stores at the end of 2008, and the New York metropolitan area, which had 431 stores at the end of 2008. At least 44 stores will open this year in metropolitan New York, more than twice the number that opened last year. 
 In the longer term, Dan Porter, vice president for real estate and new store development at 7-Eleven, said that the company saw the possibility of adding 350 stores in the metropolitan area in five to seven years. 
 The growth plan of 7-Eleven, officials said, reflects relatively strong demand for its products. In addition, they said, the retailer is getting access to desirable retail space that it was not previously offered or that was too expensive.
 ''While the business is not recession-proof, it's recession-resistant, and doing well, given the marketplace,'' said Mike Friedman, a senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services firm that is helping 7-Eleven identify potential store sites. 
 According to Kenneth Barnes, manager of real estate for 7-Eleven's Northeast division, there are 15 sites in the metropolitan area that ''the company has had its eyes on for years that have become available for us to pursue in the last year.'' And he said the leases it was currently negotiating carried rents more than 30 percent below the level of six months ago. 
 Founded in Dallas in 1927, 7-Eleven is now a subsidiary of the Seven & i Holdings Company, based in Japan.
 Of the 7-Eleven stores in the United States, about 1,300 are owned and operated by the company itself and about 4,400 are franchises. Under its franchise system, 7-Eleven owns or leases a store's space and provides equipment, accounting and other services, while the franchisee who runs the store gives 7-Eleven an average of 50 percent of the sales of goods minus their actual cost.
 Alternatively, under 7-Eleven's business conversion program, the owner of an existing convenience store retains the space and converts it into a 7-Eleven. Current 7-Eleven franchisees and prospective franchisees who are able to find suitable new locations can also participate in the program. The company in turn invests an average of $280,000 in the store -- for new equipment, furnishings, technology that helps run the store and other modifications -- and it receives 25 percent of the sales of goods minus their actual cost.
 According to Mr. Barnes, 20 of the new stores in the metropolitan area this year will open under the business conversion program. In New Jersey, southern Connecticut and Long Island, new stores will mostly be in strip malls, while in the five boroughs they will be in walk-up locations. 
 Factors determining the suitability of sites include pedestrian or vehicular traffic, proximity to public transportation and the existence of zoning laws that permit a 24-hour operation and the sale of beer and wine.
 Paul Kandhari, a 7-Eleven franchisee who operates a store in the Bronx and two stores in Manhattan -- one on the Upper East Side and another at 140 Church Street -- is opening a fourth later this summer: a 2,500-square-foot store at 103 West 14th Street in Manhattan.
 Mr. Kandhari, who also owns two Hallmark Gold Crown card stores in Manhattan, calls 7-Eleven a ''recession-proof business.'' He said sales at his Hallmark stores were down 15 to 20 percent in the first five months of 2009, compared with the same period in 2008, while sales at his 7-Eleven stores on the Upper East Side and in the Bronx were up 7 to 10 percent in the same period. 
 Mr. Kandhari is renting space for his new store under the business conversion program; his landlord is Stonehenge Partners, a New York company that owns apartment buildings as well as the Brill Building, which is on Broadway near 49th Street. The new store is in a six-story rental apartment building whose entrance is at 108 West 15th Street. 
 This new site appealed to Mr. Kandhari because it was near the subway and heavy foot traffic. He said the annual rent was $91 per square foot -- reduced from an asking price of $140 -- on a 15-year lease.
 Jonathan Fishman, director of business development for Stonehenge Partners, said 7-Eleven was an attractive tenant because the company was ''seen to be well capitalized. We're comfortable it can build out the space.'' He declined to discuss terms of the lease.
 Another franchisee in an expansion mode is Sunil Sharma, who opened a 2,500-square-foot 7-Eleven at 557 Grand Concourse in the Bronx in December 2007 under the business conversion program, and franchised a 7-Eleven store in Brooklyn in May. His Bronx store is in a complex that also holds a Burger King, Popeyes Chicken, a PostNet shipping and printing shop and a law firm, and it is near a post office, several schools and a hospital. Mr. Sharma said his annual rent was $45 per square feet under a 10-year lease.
 His landlord, Adam Wolf, is vice president of Bill Wolf Petroleum, a real estate holding and gasoline distribution company in Jericho, Long Island, which leases space to three other 7-Elevens. He said the retailer was an appealing tenant because of its 24-hour operation, ''which we like because it keeps crime down.'' He said his company also preferred doing business with ''nationally branded stores if we can.''
 Steven Gillman, a vice president of Northwest Atlantic Real Estate Services, a real estate brokerage firm in White Plains, predicted the business conversion program would help 7-Eleven grow. ''This could be a chance for the owner of a deli or small grocery store to sell or get additional capital from 7-Eleven,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Takes a Step Back From Health Care for All

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The new state budget in Massachusetts eliminates health care coverage for some 30,000 legal immigrants to help close a growing deficit, reversing progress toward universal coverage just as Congress looks to the state as a model for overhauling the nation's health care system.
 The affected immigrants, permanent residents who have had green cards for less than five years, are now covered under Commonwealth Care, a subsidized insurance program for low-income residents that is central to the groundbreaking health care law enacted here in 2006. 
 Critics of the cut, which would save an estimated $130 million, say it unfairly targets taxpaying residents and threatens the state's health care experiment at a critical time. 
 ''It either sends the message that health care reform cannot be done, period,'' said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, ''or it opens the door to doing it halfway and excluding immigrants from the process.''
 Gov. Deval Patrick has proposed restoring $70 million to the program, which would partly restore the immigrants' coverage. But legislative leaders have balked, saying vital programs for other groups would have to be cut as a result. The cut, which would affect only nondisabled adults from 18 to 65 years old, would take effect in August unless the legislature approves Mr. Patrick's proposal. 
 ''The governor has made a very good and compelling case relative to providing for legal immigrants,'' Robert A. DeLeo, the speaker of the State House of Representatives, said Monday. ''On the other hand, there is only so much money that we have.'' 
 With tax collections down by $2.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30 and still dropping, lawmakers may have no choice but to make further cuts in the $27 billion budget approved this month. That makes Mr. Patrick's proposal all the more problematic, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group.
 ''It's bad timing,'' said Michael J. Widmer, the group's president. ''This budget casualty may be more under the national microscope than others, but there is no shortage of casualties across the board.''
 Because of its three-year-old law, Massachusetts has the country's lowest percentage of uninsured residents: 2.6 percent, compared with a national average of 15 percent. The law requires that almost every resident have insurance, and to meet that goal, the state subsidizes coverage for those earning up to three times the federal poverty level, or $66,150 for a family of four. 
 But the recession has made an already difficult experiment far more challenging. Enrollment in Commonwealth Care has risen sharply in recent months, to 181,000, as more people have lost jobs. That increase, combined with plummeting state revenues, made it impossible to maintain last year's level of service, said Cyndi Roy, a spokeswoman for the state's Executive Office for Administration and Finance. 
 In addition to dropping the immigrant insurance program, Commonwealth Care will save an estimated $63 million by no longer automatically enrolling low-income residents who fail to enroll themselves.
 Under the 1996 federal law that overhauled the nation's welfare system, the 30,000 immigrants affected by the loss of coverage also do not qualify for Medicaid or other federal aid. Massachusetts is one of the states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania, that nonetheless provide at least some health coverage for such immigrants.
 Laura Porto, who moved here from Venezuela and has had permanent residency for three years, said losing her state-subsidized coverage would end her treatment for bipolar disorder, including weekly therapy, monthly consultations with a psychiatrist and medication.
 ''I am so afraid -- if I lose it, I don't know what my life is going to be,'' said Ms. Porto, 58, who said she lost employer-sponsored coverage when she was fired because of her illness. ''If I don't have it, I am going to be in danger, and I don't have any other way to have insurance unless I find a job, which is very difficult right now because no one is hiring.'' 
 Mr. Patrick, a Democrat who is up for re-election next year, said Tuesday in an interview that dropping insurance for legal immigrants would send the wrong message about the state's commitment to universal health care.
 ''I know we don't have very much money, but we made a commitment in this commonwealth to embark down this health care reform path,'' he said. ''We ought to do what we can to keep it intact, and rather than just drop these folks who are good, hard-working, contributing members of our community, I'm just looking for some way to find a compromise here.''
 Mr. Patrick said it was too early to elaborate on what form the curtailed coverage would take. 
 Lindsey M. Tucker, health reform policy manager at Health Care for All, an advocacy group in Boston, said that restoring $70 million to the program might provide some preventive and emergency care. 
 ''It's in no way the best solution,'' she said, ''but it looks like we are going to need a compromise given the difficult climate.''
 If the full $130 million cut survives, hospitals that provide free care to the poor will need to spend an additional $87 million this year treating immigrants who lose their coverage, according to the Massachusetts Hospital Association. That would come on top of a $40 million cut in the state's Health Safety Net, which reimburses such hospitals, said Tim Gens, the association's executive vice president. 
 What the state needs, said Philip W. Johnston, chairman of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation and a former state secretary of health and human services, is a dedicated revenue stream to protect its pioneering system from cyclical downturns in the economy.
 The revenue, Mr. Johnston said, should come from an income tax surcharge on the wealthiest, as House leaders in Washington have proposed for a federal health plan. ''Otherwise,'' he said, ''the program is going to be subject to the ups and downs of the economy forever.''

HEADLINE: $3.4 Billion Profit at Goldman Revives Gilded Pay Packages

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Even on Wall Street, the land of six- and seven-figure incomes, jaws dropped at the news on Tuesday: After all that federal aid, a resurgent Goldman Sachs is on course to dole out bonuses that could rival the record paydays of the heady bull-market years.
 Goldman posted the richest quarterly profit in its 140-year history and, to the envy of its rivals, announced that it had earmarked $11.4 billion so far this year to compensate its workers. 
 At that rate, Goldman employees could, on average, earn roughly $770,000 each this year -- or nearly what they did at the height of the boom. 
 Senior Goldman executives and bankers would be paid considerably more. Only three years ago, Goldman paid more than 50 employees above $20 million each. In 2007, its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, collected one of the biggest bonuses in corporate history. The latest headline results -- $3.44 billion in profits -- were powered by earnings from the bank's secretive trading operations and exceeded even the most optimistic predictions. 
 But Goldman's sudden good fortune, coming only a month after the bank repaid billions of bailout dollars, raises questions for Washington policy makers. Goldman, analysts warned, is embracing financial risks that many of its competitors are unable or unwilling to take. While Goldman managed those risks this time, its strategy could backfire if the markets turn against it. 
 Another concern is that the blowout profits might encourage rivals to try to match Goldman in the markets so they, too, can return to paying hefty bonuses. Wall Street's bonus culture is widely seen as having encouraged the excessive risk-taking that set off the financial crisis. 
 ''I find this disconcerting,'' said Lucian A. Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor. ''My main concern is that it seems to be a return to some of the flawed short-term compensation structures that played an important role in the run-up to the financial crisis.''
 Even inside Goldman, executives acknowledged that the bank's stunning profits, coming when so many Americans are grappling with a deep, painful recession, presents something of a P.R. challenge. 
 ''We are cognizant of it,'' said David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer. ''We understand that we are living in a very uncertain world where a lot of people are out of work.''
 Goldman said pay fell last year when its profitability fell -- after his blowout salary in 2007, Mr. Blankfein earned $1.1 million for the year and bonuses across the firm fell by an average of 50 percent. But Mr. Viniar said pay increases this year were justified by the return to strong profits.
 ''We pay for performance,'' he said, although he underscored that the bank would not set its final compensation levels until the end of 2009, and held out the prospect that the rest of the year might not be as profitable as the first half, which compensation consultants also emphasized.
 Still, in Washington, some lawmakers warned on Tuesday that a quick return to such high pay would stoke public anger as the Obama administration tried to overhaul financial regulation. They warned that Wall Street lobbyists were already trying to block financial reforms. 
 ''People all over this country feel an incredible frustration that they are seeing their neighbors lose their jobs and the government is helping companies like A.I.G. and Goldman Sachs and then the next thing they are reporting huge profits and huge compensation,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and a member of the banking committee. ''I think people are incredulous that this system is working this way.''
 Other analysts welcomed Goldman's results as a sign the financial industry was on the mend.
 Last autumn, Goldman partners were hit hard personally as the bank's stock, which represents a considerable part of many employees' wealth, sank along with other financial shares. 
 As recently as the fourth quarter last year, Goldman itself had a quarterly loss and laid off workers; it has around 29,400, compared with 35,000 a year ago. But Goldman's share price has rebounded smartly this year as the outlook for the bank brightened. Its share price, which closed at $149.66 Tuesday, is up about 77 percent since the start of the year, though still below its peak of $250 a share in 2007. 
 ''We have two opposing principles that are about to smash together,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow of the Brookings Institution, who added that the sense of outrage was palpable. ''If people earn money for a financial firm, they feel entitled to a share of it. But that runs against the principle that they had to be helped through a very severe financial crisis and it does not feel right that bankers should be making so much money.'' 
 Goldman's profit was lifted by record quarterly revenue of $6.8 billion in its fixed-income, currency and commodities unit, where mortgage and other credit instruments are traded, and a unit where Goldman has embraced bolder risk-taking.
 The latest results continue a robust turnaround for Goldman since it rode out the final tumultuous months of last year with aid from the government's banking rescue. The earnings announcement came just one month after the bank paid back $10 billion in federal aid. Its equity underwriting business also generated record net revenue, worth $736 million in the second quarter, Goldman said, as the bank benefited among other things from a rush by other troubled banks to issue shares and raise their capital levels.
 ''We are performing well across the board,'' said Mr. Viniar, the chief financial officer, adding that the strong performance reflected ''blocking and tackling every day'' by Goldman's employees.
 Many analysts welcomed the news as another sign that the financial industry was stabilizing. ''These are pretty good results,'' said Peter Nerby, an analyst at Moody's, adding that this was an understatement. Other banks like JPMorgan Chase have been emerging as strong players since the financial troubles last year, and analysts also expect them to record strong results. 
 As well as receiving federal assistance last fall under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, Goldman, along with other banks, has benefited from a government program that allows it to issue debt cheaply with the backing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, it received money from the government's bailout of the American International Group, being paid 100 cents on the dollar for its $13 billion counterparty exposure to the insurer.
 While some other banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, have not yet been able to pay back the money they received under the bailout program, Goldman Sachs has done so, along with dividends on preferred shares issued to the government. It is also in talks to buy back a warrant on Goldman stock held by the government.

HEADLINE: Waiting Game

 BODY:
Unemployment is rising. Foreclosures are surging. Lending is still constrained. So why exactly is the Obama administration waiting to act?
 It is true that more time is needed to show results for policies that are currently in place, including stimulus spending, foreclosure relief and the bank rescue. But it is also clear that joblessness and defaults are worse now than was assumed when those policies were formed. So the need for more federal help is all but inevitable, as are political fights over renewed aid. President Obama may want to avoid those battles until health reform passes, but he still should lay the groundwork in three main areas: 
 STIMULUS SPENDING One of the arguments against another round of stimulus is that more deficit spending might spook bond investors, forcing up interest rates. The solution to the deficit, however, is not to forgo temporary stimulus in a time of need but to lock in long-term fiscal discipline. The best way for the administration and its Congressional allies to do that is to credibly pay for health care reform. That, more than anything, would show that the budget is in responsible hands. 
 On the other hand, if health care is ''paid for'' with gimmicks, the bond market will get understandably nervous -- and the administration will lose the credibility it needs to argue for more stimulus spending. 
 FORECLOSURE RELIEF In a recent letter, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, summoned the top 25 mortgage servicers to Washington later this month, apparently for a dressing-down over the lack of progress on modifying bad loans. It's still not clear, however, if Mr. Geithner and Mr. Donovan understand what's really holding up the show. 
 Their letter said that preventing avoidable foreclosures is an objective ''we all share.'' In fact, lenders and mortgage investors have several reasons to prefer foreclosures over modifications. Among them, foreclosures allow a bank to postpone taking a loss until the process is complete, which can take a year or longer. 
 If the administration really wants to kick-start loan modifications, it should revive efforts to allow bankruptcy judges to modify bad loans. At the least, it should impose costs on laggard banks, like higher charges for debt guarantees or higher deposit-insurance premiums. 
 BANK RESCUE The Obama administration has largely shelved, for now, its plan to finance the purchase of banks' toxic assets, ostensibly because of the banks' recent success in raising capital. An alternative explanation is that the banks won't sell. Recent accounting changes make it less painful for them to keep bad assets on their books. Why admit to losses if you don't have to? 
 In any event, the adequacy of banks' capital cushions hinges, in large part, on success in stimulating the economy and preventing foreclosures: If those efforts fall short, employment, household wealth and consumer spending will not rebound and bank losses will deepen -- not only on home mortgages, but on credit cards, commercial real estate and other loans. The result would be a long period of tight lending and of subpar economic growth, if not outright contraction. 
 If wait-and-see is anything other than a near-term tactic, it's bound to be a miscalculation. The need for expanded relief and recovery efforts is compelling. Rather than avoid those fights, the Obama team must win them.

HEADLINE: Spur for Reform In London Post Is M.T.A. Pick

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Simon Akam contributed reporting.

 BODY:
He put computer chips in the wallets of commuters in London, charged a fee to drive in the center of the city and helped lure the next Summer Olympics there. 
 Now Jay Walder, the public transportation expert who helped turn London's aging transit system into an (albeit expensive) envy of the globe, wants to take his brand of high-tech transit reform to the city where he got his start, New York. 
 Mr. Walder, 50, was nominated on Tuesday as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the nation's biggest transit agency, which was on the brink of financial collapse just two months ago. 
 Gov. David A. Paterson said he chose Mr. Walder because he was an independent leader who would bring efficiency and accountability to a notoriously unwieldy agency. 
 Mr. Walder said he planned to ''restore the public trust and confidence'' in the authority, a perennial target of the city's collective kvetching. 
 Still, a vote by the State Senate on the confirmation of Mr. Walder is unlikely to happen for months, until it returns from its summer break. And he did not elaborate on his plans if he is confirmed, except to say he expected ''to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions.''
 ''I certainly go in with my eyes open,'' Mr. Walder said at a news conference. ''I've been away for nearly 15 years, and I've certainly got a lot of catching up to do.''
 A native of the Rockaways who rode the A train as a child, Mr. Walder began his career in public service in the darker days of New York's transit system, when graffiti and crime were rampant. He helped lead the transportation authority out of a financial black hole in the mid-1980s and held several leadership positions, including chief financial officer, before moving to London in 2001. 
 His experience there, as the planning and finance director of Transport for London under Robert R. Kiley, his former boss in New York, offers hints about what might lie in store for New Yorkers. 
 Mr. Walder led the introduction of the Oyster card, a ''smart card'' that uses a computer chip to track riders' fares and account balances. Unlike the MetroCard, with its familiar swipe, the thicker Oyster requires no contact: it is waved over a sensor.
 In a report presented to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last spring, Mr. Walder -- in his capacity as a consultant at McKinsey & Company, where he has worked since leaving the London transit system in 2006 -- said that elements of the smart-card plan would be feasible for New York. The transportation authority has started a pilot program involving fare cards that do not require contact.
 At the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Walder spoke highly of the Oyster card but stopped short of saying he would import the program. And he did not address the issue of fare increases; in London, subway rides start at $2.60 but can rise above $20, depending on the length of the ride and the time of day. 
 Mr. Walder also was instrumental in starting the program to charge drivers in central London, where it initially incensed drivers but eventually was welcomed as a way to reduce congestion. A similar plan, advanced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was scuttled by the Legislature last year.
 The governor's announcement came less than 24 hours before the State Senate was to reconvene, and lawmakers said they did not expect a vote soon. 
 ''This week? That's ludicrous,'' said Carl Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat who laughed when asked whether the committee he chaired would review Mr. Walder in the next few days. 
 ''This is the M.T.A.,'' Mr. Kruger said. ''It's not as if we're confirming somebody to be game warden of the Adirondack Park.'' 
 Many top officials, including Mr. Bloomberg, had yet to meet with Mr. Walder before the governor made his announcement. 
 The board of the transportation authority had its first talk with the nominee in a hastily arranged meeting on Tuesday morning, hours after Mr. Walder flew in from London, where he lives with his wife and three children. 
 Several board members said they were impressed with Mr. Walder's credentials, but they added that the half-hour discussion did not delve into many details. 
 ''Trying to have a deeper conversation with someone that jet-lagged is a little silly,'' said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, who has been leading the authority since Elliot G. Sander resigned as chief executive in May.
 If confirmed, Mr. Walder will have to navigate a political minefield where he must consider the competing interests of state, city and county groups, while balancing a multibillion-dollar budget that nearly forced drastic service cuts and fare increases this year.
 ''He's taking on being the head of the M.T.A. at the time when its finances are the worst they've been in at least a quarter of a century,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for riders. 
 Public faith in the agency is also low. ''Any long-term solution to funding requires us as the M.T.A. to show people we are using funding as efficiently and effectively as possible,'' Mr. Walder said. 
 One board member suggested that even if he was confirmed, it might take some time for Mr. Walder to bring about changes. 
 ''He's going to do a lot more listening than talking in the next six months,'' said Mitchell H. Pally, a board member from Suffolk County. ''People in the system need someone to yell at.''

HEADLINE: In Wake of Madoff, S.E.C. Head Says Agency Will Do More to Protect Investors

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House lawmakers voiced approval Tuesday for recent changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission following the Madoff scandal, but some Republicans chafed at new proposed regulations.
 The S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, said the agency had been revamping itself, buttressing enforcement efforts and taking initiatives to protect investors in the wake of both the financial crisis and the Madoff fraud. 
 The changes ''will reinforce our focus on investor protection and market integrity,'' Ms. Schapiro told the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets.
 Recent S.E.C. regulatory proposals include restricting short-selling in down markets, strengthening oversight of mutual funds, tightening scrutiny of investment advisers and making it easier for shareholders to seat directors on company boards. The S.E.C. is also working to identify emerging risks to investors, including so-called dark pools, or automated trading systems that do not publicly provide price quotes, Ms. Schapiro said.
 The agency may also extend its work on tightening oversight of Wall Street's credit rating agencies by preventing companies from ''shopping'' for favorable ratings for their securities -- possibly by requiring companies to disclose all the preliminary assessments they receive, she said. 
 It's a ''great start,'' said Representative Paul Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, the subcommittee's chairman, but the S.E.C. ''must continue to take bold and assertive action.'' The rule proposals must be made final and the hard work lies ahead, he said.
 Several Republicans expressed concern, however, over the recent initiatives.
 Legislation proposed last week by the Obama administration, for example, would empower the S.E.C. to ban compensation plans for brokers and investment advisers it deemed contrary to investors' interests.
 Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, warned against regulatory overkill by the agency in the wake of the Madoff scandal. He said it was not a lack of regulation that caused problems, he said, but ''dumb regulation.''
 Appointed by President Obama, Ms. Schapiro became head of the agency in January, a time when it was demoralized over its failure to detect the Madoff fraud and its oversight of Wall Street investment banks in the period leading up to the financial crisis.
 ''We have to hold people accountable at all levels of the agency,'' Ms. Schapiro testified. ''We've tried to pull all the lessons we can from those failings.''
 The House is considering an increase of 8 percent in the S.E.C.'s proposed $1.03 billion budget for the fiscal year starting in October. Ms. Schapiro said the increase was needed for the agency, which has 3,600 workers, to have sufficient staff to police sophisticated markets and 35,000 registered companies, investment funds and other entities.

HEADLINE: A Boon to 2-Year Colleges, Affirming Their Value

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The Obama administration's proposal to provide $12 billion to community colleges is widely seen by educators as explicit recognition of the two-year colleges' importance to the economy. 
 ''For years, the Washington conversation about public education has all been about k-12, and increasing access to college,'' said Andy Van Kleunen, executive director of The Workforce Alliance, a national group of employers, unions, and education and training providers. ''This changes the whole game.''
President Obama's goal of five million more community college graduates by 2020 would require nearly doubling graduation rates at most community colleges. 
 According to the American Association of Community Colleges, more than six million students a year enroll for credit at the nation's 1,200 community colleges, but only about 555,000 a year earn a two-year degree, and another 295,000 a year earn a vocational certificate.
 ''This is the higher education equivalent of the moon shot,'' said Jamie Merisotis, president of the Lumina Foundation, which supports community-college initiatives. ''The president is putting a bet on one sector to get a lot more graduates. They want to have a measurable impact on work force development.'' 
 Even before the announcement Tuesday, the Obama administration had put unprecedented emphasis on two-year institutions. Martha J. Kanter, the former chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College district in California, was tapped for the second-highest job in the Education Department. 
 Secretary of Education Arne Duncan chose a Miami community college for his first official visit to an institution of higher education, and last month Mr. Duncan announced a $7 million grant program for community colleges to train laid-off auto workers and other displaced workers. And it has not hurt that Jill Biden, the vice president's wife, teaches at a community college. 
 Historically, the mission of community colleges has been to provide postsecondary schooling -- usually through open admissions -- for low-income students who have few other options. Most community-college students are employed adults who attend classes part-time; according to some studies, more than half need remedial courses before they can tackle college-level work. 
 The Obama proposal would require stronger efforts to retain students until graduation, and encourage partnerships between community colleges and employers to offer work force training. 
 ''Higher retention rates certainly wouldn't be possible without the funding, when most community colleges are facing large enrollment increases just as states are cutting their budgets,'' said Debra Bragg, co-director of the Forum on the Future of Public Education at the University of Illinois. 
 Ms. Bragg predicted that most new graduates produced under the Obama proposal would not get two-year degrees. Instead, she said, they would complete certificate programs, usually lasting six months to a year, offering specific credentials for what are known as middle-skill jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but less than a four-year degree. 
 ''There's all kinds of jobs in health care, information technology, in some regions, manufacturing or transportation logistics,'' Ms. Bragg said.

HEADLINE: Office to Aid Consumers Draws Fire And Support

BYLINE: By ANDREA FULLER

 BODY:
President Obama's plan for a single consumer financial protection agency to regulate mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and other financial products met with stiff opposition from Republicans and industry representatives in Congressional hearings on Tuesday. 
 Even some Democrats seemed uneasy about the extent of the proposed agency's powers. 
 Michael S. Barr, an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department, defended the president's plan before the Senate Banking Committee, arguing that the present system of consumer protection had been ''designed to fail'' and had contributed to the economic crisis. 
 ''The system we've had that led to this is structurally flawed,'' Mr. Barr said. ''It is not capable of being fixed through tinkering around the edges.''
 But Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, said he was not willing to sign on to an entire agency devoted to consumer protection. ''I find it a bit disturbing and somewhat offensive that the concept of the intellectually deficient consumer has found a voice in our legislative process,'' he said.
 At the hearing, Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, peppered Mr. Barr with questions about financing for the agency and asked whether it was fair to clamp down on well-behaved community banks as hard as on Wall Street institutions. 
 Mr. Obama unveiled the plan for the new agency last month to opposition from banking leaders, who have voiced concern about what they say is needless government intervention into their lending practices. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a bill establishing the agency in the House last week. 
 The proposed agency would pull existing authority from many federal departments that oversee financial services. Mr. Barr said he expected the new agency to use a mix of appropriations and fees that financial service providers are now assessed for regulatory oversight. 
 He said the new agency would not require a fee increase, and could result in lower fees because of the consolidation of regulatory functions.
 The new agency would be more powerful than any of the older ones in that it would be able to define and ban deceptive lending practices and require organizations to offer what it considers low-risk, plain products. The legislation would also subject nonbank lenders to the same standards that banks must follow.
 Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, questioned whether it was wise to separate consumer protection from the duties of other agencies. 
 ''We have a fractured system where everybody can point fingers and nobody gets the job done,'' Mr. Barr responded. 
 Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said the agency would stifle innovation by requiring all lenders to offer one-size-fits-all products. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the banking committee chairman, and other Democrats vigorously defended the White House proposal.
 ''The present structure has been an abject failure,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who co-sponsored a bill proposing a similar agency in March. ''We've had such a sorry history in regulation of consumer financial products.''

HEADLINE: Obama Attacks on Economy and Seeks Billions for Community Colleges

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich. 

 BODY:
President Obama came to this struggling auto industry town Tuesday to urge patience for his economic policies, to thunder at his newly emboldened critics in Washington and to introduce an education plan intended to help displaced workers find jobs.
 After spending last week abroad, Mr. Obama made clear that he was renewing his focus on his domestic agenda, delivering a campaign-style speech that sought to beat back Republican efforts to capitalize on the public uneasiness with the economy.
 ''I love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then suddenly say, 'Well, this is Obama's economy,' '' the president said before an overwhelmingly supportive outdoor crowd at Macomb Community College. ''That's fine -- give it to me. My job is to solve problems, not stand on the sidelines and carp and gripe.'' 
 The jab was not included in his prepared remarks, which focused on an announcement that the administration was proposing to spend $12 billion to bolster the nation's network of community colleges.
 Community colleges are heavily attended by working adults, some seeking new expertise, others remedial instruction on the way to four-year college.
 So the administration's proposal should have particular resonance in places like Warren, a Detroit suburb that has experienced heavy layoffs related to the slowdown in the automobile industry and the administration-sponsored restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler. Those factors have helped give Michigan the nation's highest unemployment rate, at more than 14 percent.
 Many laid-off workers are seeking new skills and new career paths under the assumption that, as Mr. Obama said Tuesday, ''the hard truth is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.''
 Mr. Obama was met here by an editorial in The Detroit News titled, ''Obama's Stimulus Plan Is Not Working,'' and another in The Detroit Free Press with a headline reading, ''Above All, Mr. President, Michigan Needs Promise of Jobs.''
 The Free Press editorial said the president's new community college plan was ''not a bad idea on its face,'' but added skeptically, ''Michigan has emphasized job retraining for months, if not years now -- and yet people keep losing their jobs.''
 Amid nervous chatter from fellow Democrats and saber rattling by Republicans, who gleefully sent the local editorials to reporters covering the president here Tuesday, Mr. Obama's aides said he would spend the coming days seeking to regain control of the debate by urging patience.
 In his remarks, the president himself acknowledged that job training was not a ''silver bullet.'' But he said his new proposal, hailed as significant by education advocates, would greatly increase the number of people who earn the sort of two-year associate's degrees that employers increasingly demand.
 ''In the coming years,'' Mr. Obama said, ''jobs requiring at least an associate degree are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience. We will not fill those jobs, or keep those jobs on our shores, without the training offered by community colleges.'' 
 Most of the $12 billion in Mr. Obama's plan would go toward programs enticing community colleges to do more to lift graduation rates and better prepare students for jobs. Some would go to the modernizing of facilities as well, and some to the development of an Internet curriculum available to students everywhere.
 Officials said that over the next 12 years, the plan would increase the number of community college graduates by a total of five million beyond the number who would graduate without it.
 The new federal money would be spent over the course of a decade, starting with the fiscal year that begins in October. Officials said the cost of the legislation would be covered by savings from the president's plan to end the role of private banks in the federal education lending system. 
 Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who heads the House Education and Labor Committee, said Tuesday that he would incorporate the president's community college plan into the student loan bill, which Mr. Miller expects to introduce on Wednesday.
 The loan legislation is facing an intense lobbying campaign by banks, making it one of several tough initiatives Mr. Obama is trying to push through Congress before the August recess. 
 In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Obama lashed out at critics who have said he is taking on too many hard fights in his first year as president, including health care and environmental overhauls that would drastically change government policy.
 But here, the No. 1 subject is his auto industry overhaul, and his remarks were sprinkled with a defense of his approach to reworking Chrysler and General Motors.
 ''After a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice,'' he said, ''both companies have emerged from bankruptcy -- far faster than some thought possible -- with a leaner structure, new management and a viable vision of how to compete and win in the 21st century.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Ways Out of the Health Maze

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Two Sides to Every Health Care Debate'' (Op-Ed, July 12), a collection of six essays taking opposing views on aspects of health care reform:
 There is a third side to the health care debate that gets too little attention in the media -- what health care reform means for individuals and their families. Will Plan A make it harder for me to see a specialist? Will Plan B raise my premiums? Will Plan C allow me to buy health insurance if I have a pre-existing condition (an especially important question)? Will Plan D cover my mother's home health care?
 Until people know what the various proposals mean for them, all of the talk is simply rhetoric.

 To the Editor:
 Nancy Kane (''Keep Hospitals Whole'') is correct that fundamental reform of our payment system is required to lower health care costs. 
 All health care providers should be prepared to sacrifice some autonomy or income to achieve a sustainable system that delivers health care to all Americans. Physicians and other providers must put the needs of patients first in our reform debate.
 James B. Rickert Bloomington, Ind., July 12, 2009
 The writer, a physician, is president of the Society for Patient Centered Orthopedics.
 To the Editor:
 ''Two Sides to Every Health Care Debate'' serves as a microcosm of what is wrong with the dialogue on health care: nonphysician experts each offering inflexible, oversimplified, dogmatic solutions to isolated parts of an infinitely complex problem.
 The goals of reform have been well articulated by the president: increase access to health care, improve quality of care and reduce costs. Legislators, providers, hospitals, insurers, lawyers, patients, and drug and device manufacturers must all work together, recognizing the conflicting facets of the debate.
 Each party must concede a little to meet these goals, which will strengthen our economy, improve outcomes and recognize health care as a right, not a privilege. To this end, physicians must expect reduced reimbursement, hospitals more cost-cutting, insurers and suppliers lower profits, businesses and individuals higher taxes, and patients more personal responsibility and more realistic expectations of what medical care can deliver.
 Through compromise and a shared vision, real reform can be achieved. However, the challenge will be our society's aversion to sacrifice in the short term for long-term gain.

 Re ''The Cap Doesn't Fit,'' by Michelle Mello and Amitabh Chandra:
 There is certainly nothing wrong with bringing evidence-based medicine into health care practice. But allowing clinical practice guidelines to become the sole legal standard for deciding negligence is a terrible idea.
 First, there are already more than a thousand such guidelines in existence. Not only are some contradictory, but also patient safety could greatly suffer from a ''one size fits all'' approach, because patients often present widely varying and complicated conditions. Furthermore, conflicts of interest and specialty bias are problems in the development of these guidelines.
 The few states that experimented in the 1990s with using guidelines as medical standards, like Florida, failed to garner support among physicians.
 Joanne Doroshow Executive Director Center for Justice and Democracy New York, July 12, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Liability = Responsibility,'' by Tom Baker: New York State needs fair and objective liability reform to improve patient safety and access to care, and to ensure stability in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. 
 The current system does not deter negligence. Research has shown that neurological impairments like cerebral palsy have little, if anything, to do with birth events. Even so, millions are awarded in lawsuits. Such awards do nothing to improve patient safety because the incidence of cerebral palsy hasn't changed in 30 years. 
 New York's flawed system has obstetrician-gynecologists paying some of the highest liability rates in America and has caused some medical liability insurance companies to discontinue obstetric coverage. When doctors are forced to stop delivering babies or leave New York for states that have appropriate and fair liability rates, it is the patients who suffer.
 This is unacceptable. New York needs liability reform now.
 Scott D. Hayworth Chairman The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, District II Mount Kisco, N.Y., July 14, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Tom Baker makes a false analogy between defensive driving and defensive medicine. Medicine is not an exact science. A proverb says, ''Medicine cures the man who is fated not to die.''
 Often, despite the efforts of researchers, the best method of evaluation or course of treatment for a malady is ambiguous, and the result uncertain. Imagine how clogged our roads would be if there were no posted speed limits and fines were imposed arbitrarily.

HEADLINE: American Officials Press China on Efforts to Curb Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
The top American energy and commerce officials called in speeches here on Wednesday for China to do more to address global warming, contending that the country was particularly vulnerable to a changing climate.
 Energy Secretary Steven Chu warned in a speech at Tsinghua University, China's top science university, that if humans did not reverse the rising pace of their emissions of greenhouse gases, more people would be displaced by rising sea levels in China than in any other country, even Bangladesh.
 If China's emissions of global warming gases keep growing at the pace of the last 30 years, the country will emit more such gases in the next three decades than the United States has in its entire history, said Mr. Chu, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics. 
 While Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Obama administration officials have mentioned China's contribution to global warming during visits here this year, the remarks by Mr. Chu and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke were by far the strongest public criticisms yet, and the clearest demands that China take action. 
 Mr. Locke said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce that China shared a special responsibility with the United States to address global warming. China passed the United States two years ago as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and together the two countries account for 42 percent of emissions caused by humans.
 ''Fifty years from now, we do not want the world to lay the blame for environmental catastrophe at the feet of China,'' Mr. Locke said.
 Mr. Chu and Mr. Locke, who are both of Chinese heritage, called for the United States and China to work together to develop new technologies to generate clean energy and to improve energy efficiency.
 After meeting Wednesday afternoon with senior Chinese officials, they announced that each country would put up $15 million for a joint research center on clean energy, with headquarters in each country at locations not yet decided.
 They are to meet again with Chinese officials on Thursday. 
 Xinhua, China's official news agency, from which the other news media in China tend to take their cue, carried a long article on the two cabinet secretaries' speeches and a shorter one on the creation of the joint research center. 
 But while the long article included a quotation from Mr. Locke in which he acknowledged that the United States had been emitting greenhouse gases for 150 years, neither Xinhua article included any mention of China's role or of the American criticisms of that role.
 The longer article made only a passing mention that China and the United States were the top two emitters, but did not say that China had surpassed the United States in that regard. Chinese officials issued no response to any of the secretaries' remarks.
 In separate interviews, Mr. Chu and Mr. Locke also said they wanted China to show respect for American intellectual property and to remove trade barriers to American energy technologies.
 As China seeks to develop and shelter its own energy industries, its growing trade restrictions are a potentially serious obstacle to such cooperation, a factor underlined by the signing of a General Electric contract that Mr. Locke attended in Beijing.
 G.E. signed a contract with the Pucheng Clean Energy Chemical Company to license G.E.'s technology for turning coal into a gas for use in a Chinese chemical factory. 
 The Chinese government prefers technology licensing agreements, in which Western companies transfer technology to Chinese factories, to buying finished goods from factories abroad.
 The chemical factory licensing agreement is also a small transaction, estimated at $20 million, compared with the construction of a $375 million power plant China recently started on the outskirts of Tianjin, 90 miles from Beijing, that will turn coal into a gas before burning it.
 G.E. executives spent more than a decade trying to win a contract to build such a power plant in China, sharing extensive technical information with Chinese power engineers on how they would go about it.
 But at a ceremony in Tianjin on July 6, Chinese officials announced that they were ready to build the 250-megawatt power plant themselves and that they would no longer need to buy Western technology.
 Jack Wen, the president of G.E.'s China energy division, welcomed the Pucheng contract and said his company was interested in working with China to build a similar power plant even bigger than the one now under construction in Tianjin.
 Chinese officials have strenuously opposed binding limits on emissions of greenhouse gases by developing countries, most recently at the Group of 8 meeting in Italy last week. They have emphasized that industrialized countries are responsible for most of the emissions already in the atmosphere, and that emissions per person remain higher in rich countries than in developing ones.
 Mr. Chu acknowledged these points by presenting charts showing that Chinese emissions per person were still roughly a quarter of American emissions per person and showing that the United States had put three times the amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as China since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. He also acknowledged that China had more stringent automotive fuel economy standards than the United States.
 But Mr. Chu and Mr. Locke were clearly trying to hone counterarguments, based mainly on the dangers to China and the world if Chinese emissions continued to rise quickly.
 ''We're not talking about their giving up prosperity; we're talking about their using energy in a more efficient way,'' Mr. Chu said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Florida Drops Budget Plan That Favored Prep Football

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
As school districts nationwide grapple with severe budget cuts, one sport has weathered the recession better than most: football. State high school athletic officials in Florida, Nevada and Delaware have exempted the popular and lucrative sport from widespread schedule cuts aimed at easing the financial burden on schools.
 But under threat of a federal lawsuit, officials in Florida on Wednesday abandoned scheduling cuts to other sports. The lawsuit argued that exempting football was a violation of the gender-equity law known as Title IX. Opponents of the scheduling, which also excluded competitive cheerleading, complained that it disproportionately favored boys: about 40,400 male football players were unaffected by the cuts, compared with about 5,500 female cheerleaders. 
 In an emergency meeting held two days before the parties were due to appear in court -- and after the Justice Department filed a brief supporting the plaintiffs Tuesday -- the board of the Florida High School Athletic Association voted unanimously to revert to its original policy that permitted more robust scheduling. Individual school districts will still be able to decide whether to limit their games.
 In a statement released after the vote, Greg Zornes, president of the association's board of directors, stood by the board's initial decision for schedule cuts earlier this year. ''I believe what we did in April was the best thing for the membership then, and given the situation, what we did today was in its best interest now,'' he said.
 The decision drew cautious praise from Nancy Hogshead-Makar, the lawyer for the parents who sued. ''My clients are going to be thrilled because they're going to get their games back,'' said Hogshead-Makar, a four-time Olympic medalist in swimming and a professor at the Florida Coastal School of Law. She said she was open to a settlement.
 In seeking to dismiss the case, the association argued in part that the action did not discriminate because football is technically a co-ed sport -- even though only eight girls participate statewide.
 ''I saw no 'aha' moment,'' Hogshead-Makar said. ''I saw nothing that would indicate that Title IX and gender-equity laws would always be in the background of whatever decision-making they have.''
 The Florida association trimmed the schedules in April after several of the state's 67 school districts proposed various cuts to their athletics programs. Some considered eliminating junior varsity programs, others canceled entire seasons and still others planned to do away with sports like golf or tennis.
 ''What we saw was a patchwork-quilt solution,'' said Roger Dearing, the executive director of the association. ''It was getting to be impossible to try to schedule events.''
 In an attempt to help districts contain costs while maintaining a competitive schedule, the association voted to reduce all varsity schedules by 20 percent, and all sports below the varsity level by 40 percent. Because football has only 10 games per season, Dearing said, the sport was excluded. Cheerleading, only recently recognized as a competitive sport, has no limits on the number of meets, but Dearing said most teams typically participate in only a handful of events.
 ''The board was in no way acting in a discriminatory way against girls,'' Dearing said. ''We were reacting to a crisis in the state of Florida.''
 Florida's is one of several state high school associations that has limited athletic schedules in an effort to cut costs. In June, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association voted to reduce most athletic schedules by 10 percent. It chose to exempt football, as well as soccer, wrestling, swimming and diving. In May, the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association trimmed schedules, exempting varsity football, according to news reports.
 Not every state has spared football. New York cut football schedules to 9 games from 10. Maine reduced the number of all teams that can advance to the playoffs, including football, said Bruce Howard, a spokesman for the National Federation of State High School Associations.
 Howard said districts nationwide have dealt with budget cuts in a range of ways, including requiring that students pay for sports and accepting corporate sponsorships. ''All of the country is hurting in some form or fashion,'' Howard said. ''There's little reason to think that high school athletics won't be affected as well.''
 Limiting football is out of the question in many parts of the country, including Florida, where games are played before sold-out crowds. The sport more than pays for itself, said Jay Beesemyer, assistant director of the Nevada association. ''The fact of the matter is, schools need these football games to have the other programs that they currently have,'' he said.
 Hogshead-Makar said that under the law, cost cannot be a factor in gender-equity cases. '' 'We don't have enough money for gender equity' has been tried as a defense and has lost,'' she said, noting that previous court cases and legislative proposals to exempt football from Title IX have failed.
 Even though the board reversed course, the schedules are likely to remain through the fall, with reductions in everything but football and cheerleading. Many school districts established their schedules in the spring, after the board's initial decision. Wednesday's vote establishes only a maximum number of competitions. Bill Vogel, superintendent of the Seminole County School District in central Florida, said many school districts will be eager to avoid transportation costs and other expenses associated with extra games. The decision Wednesday, he said, ''will probably have a minimal effect.''
 Hogshead-Makar said she intended to turn her attention to whether individual districts are complying with the federal law.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Pushes Up Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose in June at their quickest rate since last summer as gasoline claimed a larger portion of family budgets while real incomes fell. The trend poses a challenge to Washington policy makers who are hoping for household spending to lead an economic rebound. 
 The Labor Department said Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index climbed 0.7 percent last month from May, slightly more than the 0.6 percent increase expected by economists. The index's core rate, which excludes energy and food prices, also accelerated quicker than expected, to 0.2 percent. 
 A separate Labor Department report released Wednesday said that American wages, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.2 percent in June, a period when unemployment rose to 9.5 percent.
 From the larger economic perspective, analysts say the price figures are not alarming. Fears of broad-based inflation are not likely to be set off now, after economists anticipated that a month of roller-coaster trading in the oil markets might skew the June index.
 ''The C.P.I. is not much of a story this month,'' said Mickey Levy, the Bank of America's chief economist. ''The core is just moving sideways, and then you have the upward pressure on energy and gas prices.''
 But for families across the country that have cut back spending, a 17.3 percent jump in gasoline prices in June further pinched pocketbooks. A retail sales report on Tuesday said that clothing and food spending stayed mostly flat last month. 
 Minutes from the June 23-24 meeting of Federal Reserve officials, released Wednesday, also showed that policy makers were concerned about the short-lived impact of the $787 billion federal stimulus package and feared that consumer spending would continue to decline. Families are also saving more of their income in uncertain times and thwarting efforts at consumer stimulus.
 The officials projected that unemployment would reach 10 percent by the end of 2010 and would remain high for several years. The gross domestic product for 2009 is also expected to shrink by up to 1.5 percent.
 At the least, the price data soothed worries that the economy might be slipping into a deflationary trap -- when unemployment, wages, aggregate demand and shelf prices spiral downward -- such as what happened to Japan during its ''lost decade'' after an asset bubble collapse in the early 1990s. Mr. Levy, the Bank of America economist, said that prices had held up surprisingly well despite the severity and length of the recession. ''I expect core C.P.I. to drift lower but not outright decline,'' he said.
 Compared with a year ago, the Consumer Price Index has fallen 1.4 percent, the steepest decline since 1950, as the prolonged downturn takes its toll on demand in the economy. 
 A report on Tuesday said that the Producer Price Index, a measure of prices at the wholesale level, surged 1.8 percent in June, as manufacturers also feel squeezed by higher energy costs.
 Since hitting a high this year of $72.68 a barrel on June 11, crude oil prices have held steady around $60 a barrel so far this month. Economists expect gas prices to ease.
 The Labor Department said that energy prices in general rose 7.6 percent in June. The average cost of gasoline in June was $2.63 a gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration.

HEADLINE: At Wal-Mart, Labeling To Reflect Green Intent

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Shoppers expect the tags on Wal-Mart items to have rock-bottom prices. In the future they may also have information about the product's carbon footprint, the gallons of water used to create it, and the air pollution left in its wake. 
 As the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores is on a mission to determine the social and environmental impact of every item it puts on its shelves. And it has recruited scholars, suppliers, and environmental groups to help it create an electronic indexing system to do that. 
 The idea is to create a universal rating system that scores products based on how environmentally and socially sustainable they are over the course of their lives. Consider it the green equivalent to nutrition labels. 
 Rather than a retailer or a product supplier's focusing on only a few sustainability goals -- lower emissions or water conservation or waste reduction -- the index would help them take a broader view of sustainability by scrutinizing and rating all sorts of environmental and social implications. 
 Did this T-shirt come from a cotton crop that was sprayed with pesticide? Was excessive packaging used to ship these diapers?
 Wal-Mart's goal is to have other retailers eventually adopt the indexing system, which will be created over the next five years.
 ''We have to change how we make and sell products,'' Michael T. Duke, Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, plans to tell about 1,500 of the company's suppliers and employees on Thursday at a ''sustainability meeting,'' according to a copy of his prepared remarks. ''We have to make consumption itself smarter and sustainable.''
 The only thing less likely than a Wal-Mart meeting that sounds as if it were dreamed up by liberal-arts environmentalists may be that a number of scholars and environmental groups say that Wal-Mart is the only entity capable of making ''sustainable consumption'' a retailing reality. 
 ''Nobody else could pull this off,'' said Michelle Harvey at Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups involved in the creation of the index.
 The question, of course, is whether even Wal-Mart can make it happen. 
 ''I think it's going to be a lot of work for a lot of people,'' said Jon Johnson, a professor in the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, whom the company asked to help create the index, along with Jay Golden at Arizona State University. ''But obviously we're optimistic about the prospects.''
 Joe Cavaliere, a senior vice president for customer development at Unilever, a big Wal-Mart supplier, called the indexing idea ''a great move forward for the industry.'' 
 Wal-Mart's sheer size has long enabled it to create ripple effects throughout corporate America whenever it adopts new ways of doing business. 
 For instance, Len Sauers, the vice president for global sustainability at Procter & Gamble, recalls that a few years ago, when his company and a few others began selling concentrated laundry detergent that uses 50 percent less water -- and allows for a smaller container using less plastic -- that version was slow to catch on. 
 In 2007, Wal-Mart decided it would sell only the concentrated detergents. 
 ''Because of Wal-Mart's leadership in that area, they were able to set a standard for the entire industry,'' Mr. Sauers said. ''That opened the door to allow it to progress very, very quickly.''
 Procter & Gamble said sharing the new sustainability index across the industry was important. 
 ''The last thing a supplier really wants is when you're doing a separate index for every retailer,'' said Tim Marrin, associate director of external relations for Procter & Gamble. ''Wal-Mart has invited the Targets, the Costcos, the Tescos of the world,'' he said, ''to come up with a solution so that there are not 5, 10, 15, 20 different standards that retailers are implementing in their markets.'' 
 But creating a single set of measurements for the entire retailing industry will be complicated. For one thing, some suppliers have concerns about their proprietary information. 
 And environmentally sustainable production and distribution methods will not necessarily be cheap. 
 ''The first question is always, 'It's going to cost more,' '' John E. Fleming, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer, said in an interview this week. ''But you know, I think we've demonstrated time and time again, if you reduce packaging, if you reduce energy, the costs go down.'' 
 Wal-Mart plans to begin by asking its more than 100,000 suppliers around the world to answer 15 simple questions about the sustainable practices of their companies. Questions include ''Have you set publicly available greenhouse gas reduction targets? If yes, what are those targets?'' 
 The largest United States suppliers will be asked to respond by October. Deadlines outside the United States have not been set. 
 Wal-Mart said suppliers that choose not to participate would not be penalized, but warned, ''then they're probably less relevant to us.'' 
 Whatever grumbling the index might create, Wal-Mart executives said that more and more consumers, especially those born from 1980 to 2000, will be making purchasing decisions based not only on price but also on which products do the least harm to the environment and the people, often in poorer countries, who produce them. 
 ''These younger consumers, they care deeply about this regardless of what happens in the economy,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''When I go around to colleges and universities to recruit, sustainability is tops on their list. So I think this will help us build a better business model.'' 
 If successful, the index could compel manufacturers and suppliers to create more sustainable products.
 ''If we could take a snapshot of products today in the store and then fast forward 10 years from now,'' said Matt Kistler, Wal-Mart's senior vice president for sustainability, we would see ''dramatic changes.''

HEADLINE: Weapon Billed to Save Russia's Military Is in Need of Rescue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
It was intended to be a symbol of Russia's post-Soviet military might. The nuclear-armed Bulava missile would be unlike any weapon in the world in its speed, accuracy and ability to defeat any defense the West might throw up, Russian officials claimed, helping to propel the country's armed forces into the 21st century.
 Today, however, the Bulava is having trouble just propelling itself. 
 A test flight in December went wildly off course. So did a string of launchings in 2006 and 2007. Only half the tests since 2003 have been even partly successful.
 Now, sometime this month, another test is scheduled, perhaps the most important yet. One more failure would endanger the project, which is facing mounting criticism from military and security experts, and embarrass Russia's leaders, who have staked their country's prestige in part on its success. 
 The Bulava, whose name is Russian for a mace, the medieval weapon, was once praised by Vladimir V. Putin as a reflection of Russia's military revival after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disarray of the 1990s, when the military suffered greatly.
 Shortly before December's failed test, Sergei B. Ivanov, a senior government official who oversees the project, predicted that the missile would enter production by the end of 2009. At a news conference in June, he said tests would continue at least through 2010. 
 But as Russia and the United States work on slashing their nuclear arsenals, the emerging question for many critics is not whether the Bulava can fly, but whether it should. 
 ''My view is that the government is failing to recognize the current threats,'' said Nikolai Zlobin, a Russian defense analyst at the Washington-based Center for Defense Information. ''This is very much an old way of thinking, when you believe that if you have better weapons you are more secure.''
 Officials claim that weapons like the Bulava are aimed against modern threats like the missile defense shield the United States might deploy in Eastern Europe. (Washington insists that the defensive system, if it is ever built, will not be directed against Russia, though this has not soothed Moscow's agitation over the program.)
 Still, many Russian military analysts see the emphasis on nuclear modernization here as less strategic than political.
 ''Every fourth ruble of government military orders goes toward atomic weapons,'' said Viktor N. Litovkin, deputy editor of the magazine Independent Military Review. ''If you have strategic nuclear weapons, then you are a great power; if not, then you are no one.''
 Upon becoming president in 2000, Mr. Putin, now prime minister, vowed to restore Russia's strength. As oil prices soared and Russia's energy-driven economy hummed, the Kremlin began pumping cash into the military, particularly its nuclear arsenal. The submarine-launched Bulava together with the land-based Topol-M, Mr. Putin said in a 2006 speech, would form the base of Russia's newly revamped nuclear forces. Perhaps more important, it would be a new source of pride.
 President Dmitri A. Medvedev has vowed to continue his predecessor's nuclear policy, and Russia did successfully test-fire the less sophisticated Sineva missile this week.
 But even while Russia is spending billions to develop the Bulava, a significant portion of its conventional military has fallen into disarray. Hardware is aging, the ranks are rife with abuse and even officers live in conditions that can in some cases be described as squalid. 
 In a sign of the state of Russia's once mighty military industrial complex, Adm. Vladimir S. Vysotsky, the commander of the Russian Navy, said in June that Russia might begin purchasing foreign-made ships. 
 Yet, few think that Russia will back off the program, even if the test this month fails. 
 ''Russia really needs this rocket to maintain nuclear parity with the United States,'' said Aleksandr Golts, an independent Russian military analyst. ''This task is political, and no effort or expense has been spared.'' 
 Indeed, Russian officials have played down the Bulava's setbacks and defended Russia's nuclear priorities. 
 ''Deploying any new rocket is difficult, and, unfortunately, takes a long time,'' Anatoly E. Serdyukov, Russia's defense minister, told the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta in May. ''The Bulava is no exception.'' 
 The American Trident 2 submarine-launched missile also got off to an inauspicious start in the late 1980s with several high-profile failures. So far, however, Bulava appears to have fared worse. 
 Some Russian news agencies have even speculated that the United States, the news media's favorite scapegoat, has been sabotaging the missiles. Mr. Serdyukov denied the claims. 
 Rather, Mr. Ivanov and others have said that part of the problem has been coordinating the dozens of subcontractors involved. Many military analysts also say that the timeline for completing the missile was unrealistic from the start. 
 The Russian military plans to conduct at least four more sea-based tests of the Bulava by the end of 2009, during which the remaining problems will be resolved, Admiral Vysotsky said last month, according to the Interfax news agency. 
 ''We will have the Bulava this year,'' he said. ''It will fly.''

HEADLINE: In Central Park, Nearing Consensus on Perfection

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
Nick Nerio, Jeremy Pasha and Tyler Albright, all 26, all living in Astoria, Queens, and all pursuing the New York City dream of theater acting, walked up a sunny, clover-dotted slope just inside Central Park at 79th Street, in the direction of the choppy strains of an orchestra tuning up.
 They carried wine from Trader Joe's, blankets, almonds and goldfish (the Pepperidge Farm kind), and they were headed to the Great Lawn in search of a patch of grass. It was 6:15 on Tuesday evening, a breezy, golden 77 degrees, and people were streaming into the park with plastic bags of picnic food, like pilgrims bearing offerings, for one of the city's great summer rites: At 8 p.m., on the grassy oval ringed by oaks, skyscrapers and the almost-too-cute turrets of Belvedere Castle, the New York Philharmonic would start to play. Free. 
 ''It's really relaxing -- and almost therapeutic in a certain kind of way when you're out running around and having people bump into you in the subway -- to have this music under the stars,'' Mr. Nerio said. ''It almost sounds cheesy, but it's perfect.'' 
 His companions could think of other versions of perfection -- ''a Broadway show,'' Mr. Pasha said, and Mr. Albright suggested ''dinner followed by a cupcake at Billy's Bakery'' -- but thousands of people, especially after what Mr. Nerio called ''the horrible June of endless rain,'' seemed to agree.
 It is certainly hard to measure, achieve or proclaim perfection. Every person in the park -- indeed, every person scattered around every corner of the five boroughs -- probably has his or her own criteria for perfection, especially the New York City variety. Is it sitting on a stoop? Going on a third date? Being happily asleep?
 Yet, if you were to invoke this highly subjective word to describe one evening in the middle of Manhattan island, in the middle of summer, in earshot of the expectant tunings of the instruments, you could do a lot worse than late Tuesday. 
 So ... it was the perfect New York night.
 A few blocks south, golden light glinted off the statue of Alice in Wonderland as Ariel Polanco, 31, and LaSherma Waring, 30 -- he in snazzy black and white glasses and a linen blazer, she resplendent in a purple silk pantsuit with pink spaghetti straps -- idled away the hour before their anniversary dinner reservation. People stretched out on the grass to read as the sunset turned Fifth Avenue's limestone towers orange. 
 But the Great Lawn most of all seemed to exert a gravitational pull. It was the most packed Philharmonic park night in memory, so said the unofficial consensus. People had not only staked out every inch of the lawn but had spilled onto side lawns, under the trees, all the way to Cleopatra's Needle -- and even as far back as the random bronze Polish guy on horseback, with the crossed swords. (King Wladyslaw Jagiello, the ''Victor Over the Teutonic Aggressors'' in 1410, but you know the one.)
 People wore Lilly Pulitzer dresses or chino shorts or flowered headscarves. They brought hammocks or portable tables or sat right down on the ground, and signaled straggling friends with the usual talismans: a Turkish flag, an inflatable fish, a bunch of balloons. 
 In a lawn chair, Jaysen Medhurst, 35, placidly studied Fine Woodworking Magazine. His girlfriend, Dawn Fuller, 36, was asked to describe her perfect New York night.
 ''This is it,'' she said. ''We can see the stars. We can come here with friends. I'm with the love of my life. We're in the spirit of New York.''
 Mr. Medhurst spends most nights on what might qualify as some people's perfect New York evening -- ''underemployed,'' as he put it, tending bar at Yankee Stadium's luxury boxes. But he prefers extemporaneous nights -- ''hearing a band through an open window and you pop in,'' or, in this case, bringing a Bubba Keg of Bass and a bottle of Recession Red ($5.99) to the park.
 As far from the stage as you could get and still arguably be on the Great Lawn, Lee Linde and Codie Conigliaro, both in their 60s, administrators at the City University of New York, watched a great egret fly over the picturesquely lime-green patches of algae that dotted Turtle Pond. The two have been coming with friends for decades, even in the days before the city's 1990s inhalation of money and security, when the Great Lawn was mostly dust and feeling safe in the park at night was a special occasion.
 ''This is why you live in New York,'' Ms. Conigliaro said. She marveled at the number of different leaves she could see from her picnic blanket -- willow, linden and oak -- not to mention the San Remo towers in the distance.
 Jettisoned balloons started to rise over the lawn. ''They have gone free in clusters of six, only pink so far,'' observed Ms. Linde. Asked why the crowd was so huge, she pondered.
 ''Dry,'' she said. ''Warm. Free. And dry.'' 
 The sun set without drama, as if deferring to the opening bars of Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony (Symphony No. 41). The paths between the lawns were packed with latecomers, who met one another's eyes with mild embarrassment, like losers in a giant game of musical chairs. 
 ''How deep is that swamp?'' one man wondered aloud.
 ''Are you guys behind the Port-o-Potties?'' another asked on his cellphone.
 Some people could barely hear from their perches, but that did not bother Michelle Wiltshire-Clement, 45; Mark Dvorizniak, 50; and their 1- and 10-year-old daughters.
 ''I don't think people are expecting a symphonic experience,'' Mr. Dvorizniak said.
 ''People keep moving over and letting other people sit down even though they saved all this space,'' said Ms. Wiltshire-Clement, wrinkling her face with a New Yorker's distaste for the corny. ''There's this peaceful camaraderie and all this peace, love and happiness. It's very Woodstocky.''

HEADLINE: Out on Their Own, and Making It Work

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
EVER since Prabal Gurung left his employer in the garment district, last winter, and sank his savings into his own label -- at the worst possible time -- he has been more aware of the silly and duplicitous nature of fashion. It may just be him, or the economy, but he doesn't think so.
 Mr. Gurung learned to make beautiful clothes at Bill Blass. There was really no reason for a young man to work at a dusty firm like Blass except to learn things that only old tailors knew. He stayed five years. But when friends in the industry heard of his plans to start a line, they seemed to forget about tailoring and craft. They told him he should make clothes like Balmain. 
 Mr. Gurung wanted to laugh. Balmain was hot, but he couldn't see how it benefited anyone to have another designer do torn jeans and $12,000 beaded minidresses.
 ''It's not my voice,'' he said.
 Before the recession hit, the sophisticated voice was something that American buyers and editors said they wanted to see. It was as though the system, at least in New York, had become awash in brand-spouting hipsters, trust-fund kids with handbag lines and ''Project Runway'' rejects. Where were the smart grown-ups?
 Mr. Gurung, a calm, observant 30-year-old who grew up in Katmandu, in Nepal, impressed people at his debut in February. His clothes had conspicuous polish, both in sensibility and cut. Nobody uses the word chic much today, but that's what they were. His lanky cashmere jackets, masculine trousers in wool or leather, and splashes of feathers recalled Saint Laurent. The proportions were modern. 
 Women's Wear Daily put his one-shoulder red silk faille dress on its cover. Four stores bought the line, including Bloomingdale's and DNA, a boutique in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, owned by Princess Deena Abdulaziz, whose advance payment helped Mr. Gurung pay some bills.
 Although sexier, the clothes of Joseph Altuzarra, another new designer (he spent two years at Givenchy), have also shown unusual finesse. Mr. Altuzarra, 25, who designs and produces his clothes in Europe but lives in a small one-bedroom apartment on Lexington Avenue, admits he is pushed by the creativity of European stars like Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga. Yet the designer he probably admires most is Tom Ford, the former Gucci creative director, because ''he knew what women wanted at a certain moment.''
 Mr. Altuzarra's draped dresses in ivory or lilac georgette dresses with ruched details express that balance between extreme modernity and feminine practicality. In business for two seasons, he picked up half a dozen new stores for fall, including Holt Renfrew and Colette in Paris, in addition to Barneys and Ikram in Chicago (the pipeline retailer to Michelle Obama). 
 Despite the terrifying economic news of last winter and then the broad reappraisal of luxury spending, Mr. Gurung and Mr. Altuzarra, whose prices are about $1,500 to $2,500, have done pretty well for themselves.
 Yet it is clear from talking to them that their main struggle has been with the expectations of an industry that has enjoyed too much money and celebrity, is prone to mystification and is fast losing the ability to recognize what makes a design original or modern -- and not.
 ''I've certainly been told who I need to be hanging out with,'' Mr. Gurung said one afternoon in his tiny studio apartment on East Fourth Street. Although the place was clean and neat, with room for a bed, a bookcase, a table and an area for fittings, he typically shows his clothes to buyers in an apartment that belongs to a rich friend. 
 Five or six years ago buyers expected to find a young designer sleeping in a hole next to his fabrics. That's where they found Miguel Adrover. He had even stopped paying the rent, he was so down and out. Now, though, they expect to see a designer in a luxury apartment he can't possibly afford. 
 So Mr. Gurung obliges. That's the game. 
 ''I like being frugal,'' he said. ''It limits you; it makes you think.'' Because of the recession he has been able to get deals on fabrics. And because of his background on Seventh Avenue, he has been able to negotiate with local factories eager for extra sewing to keep their workers busy. ''You have to go to Nepal to understand what real difficulty is,'' he said. ''The East Village -- it's not that bad.'' 
 Both Mr. Gurung and Mr. Altuzarra said they had received good advice from retailers. Mr. Altuzarra, who started his business with money from his father, an investment banker -- and recently needed a new injection to cover production costs -- said buyers wanted to see more variety in his line. They said American women won't wear dresses without a bra.
 ''The bra thing in America is huge, in comparison to Europe,'' he said.
 But there is also the question of whether buyers really know what they want. Can they recognize the difference they craved? Mr. Gurung said a number of retailers told him they wanted to see ''modern fabrics.''
 He thought that was an excuse not to buy the line, so he asked them, ''What is modern to you?'' They answered, ''Some kind of modern feel.'' 
 Mr. Gurung, who uses cashmere and wool, laughed. ''I think they meant some kind of techy fabric,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Strong Health Reform Bill

 BODY:
While the Senate continues to struggle over its approach to health care reform, House Democratic leaders have unveiled a bill that would go a long way toward solving the nation's health insurance problems without driving up the deficit. It is already drawing fierce opposition from business groups and many Republicans. This is a bill worth fighting for. 
 The bill would require virtually all Americans to carry health insurance or pay a penalty. And it would require all but the smallest businesses to provide health insurance for their workers or pay a substantial fee. It would also expand Medicaid to cover many more poor people, and it would create new exchanges through which millions of middle-class Americans could buy health insurance with the help of government subsidies. The result would be near-universal coverage at a surprisingly manageable cost to the federal government. 
 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2015, 97 percent of all residents, excluding illegal immigrants, would have health insurance. The price tag for this near-universal coverage was pegged by the budget office at just more than $1 trillion over 10 years -- at the low-end of the estimates we've heard in recent weeks. 
 The legislation would pay for half that cost by reducing spending on Medicare, a staple of all reform plans. It would pay for the other half by raising $544 billion over the next decade with a graduated income surtax on the wealthiest Americans: families with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $350,000 and individuals making more than $280,000.
 Predictably, the idea of raising taxes this way has critics outraged, with some charging that it is unfair to require a small sliver of the population to bear the brunt of the cost. 
 The wealthy have benefited greatly from Bush-era tax cuts, and their incomes have risen disproportionately in recent years. It seems proper that they should contribute heavily to an effort that is vital to hard-pressed Americans and to the long-term health of the economy. 
 The legislation also includes some sound ideas for slowing the inexorable rise in health care costs. Such savings are also essential for the nation's economic health. It adjusts Medicare reimbursements to encourage health care providers to improve productivity, reduce costly hospital readmissions and spend more time on primary care that can head off the need for costly specialists. It expands prevention and wellness activities.
 And it establishes a center to compare the effectiveness of various drugs, devices and procedures. Unfortunately, it prohibits the government from requiring public or private insurers to set reimbursement policies based on the findings. These steps may not produce big savings quickly but could lower costs in future years.
 The bill makes a mockery of Republican claims that the Democrats are pushing a hugely costly government takeover of medicine. 
 This bill is clearly not hugely costly. It would expand the government's role in financing and regulating coverage but would also bolster private coverage. It would increase employer-based coverage, mostly by requiring employers to participate. And it would send more clients to the private insurance industry. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that perhaps 10 million people might enroll in a new public plan, while twice that number might enroll in competing private policies.
 The Senate health committee has approved, by a party-line vote, a bill that in many respects parallels the House bill. The Senate Finance Committee, hoping to win over Republicans and conservative Democrats, is balking at a public plan and raising taxes on the wealthy. If there is a deal to be had, it is worth discussing. But the House has set a clear standard for health care reform: It must cover all Americans without driving up the deficit.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Jake

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
JIM WETZEL and Lance Lawson are two beefy Midwesterners who love fashion. As the owners of Jake, a five-year-old Chicago luxury boutique named after the hunky boy-crush from ''Sixteen Candles,'' they made it their business to seek out and promote new designers even before they were stars.
 It is for that reason -- Jake would take a chance on untested labels -- that so many designers loved them. 
 ''We considered them friends -- they were so sweet,'' said Doo-Ri Chung, who insisted that Mr. Wetzel and Mr. Lawson sit in the front row of her runway shows, territory usually reserved for buyers from the big guns like Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York. 
 In 2007, she made an appearance at the Jake store on Rush Street -- on Chicago's Gold Coast -- and sold $50,000 in clothes in a single day.
 Ms. Chung was grateful for the support. And so she also made what in hindsight, she said, was a misjudgment by delivering orders to Mr. Wetzel and Mr. Lawson over four seasons in 2007 and 2008, when it was not evident that the store, zapped by the worsening economy, would be able to pay.
 ''You kind of feel this familiarity with people who supported you for so long,'' Ms. Chung said. ''When they have cash-flow issues, you want to make sure you are there for them as well.''
 As a result, she is owed more than $60,000, she said, and Mr. Wetzel and Mr. Lawson have stopped returning her phone calls. 
 Jake is just one store struggling to keep up with its bills during the worst retail economy in decades, but its troubles illustrate a dilemma facing an important swath of the fashion industry. While the recession has taken a toll on luxury fashion retailers of all sizes, it is the smaller, independent stores like Jake -- known in the industry as specialty stores -- that have been hardest hit. That, in turn, is having a ripple effect on the smaller designer businesses that count on them. Some of the best-known independent boutiques -- Tracey Ross and Presse in Los Angeles, LFT in Dallas, Georgina on Long Island and Linda Dresner in Manhattan -- have closed their doors in the last year. Many others are expected to follow. 
 Jake, considered the hot young retailer of the Midwest, is hanging on for now. But survival has apparently come at the expense of many of its suppliers, most of them up-and-comers. 
 Ms. Chung said she has heard from other designers who say that they, too, are owed money by Jake. They include the creative teams behind the labels Costello Tagliapietra, Lutz & Patmos, Unis and Lyell, as well as Tim Hamilton, the winner of a Council of Fashion Designers of America award for men's wear this year, and Nicholas Kirkwood, a rising star of stilettos, all of them feeling the many stings that can result from one store's pain.
 ''Some lines do better in specialty stores than in department stores, and we are one that does better in specialty stores,'' said Brian Reyes, who had sold the collection he designs under his name at Jake until last spring, when he refused to continue delivering clothes without a guarantee he would be paid. Smaller stores often have more personalized customer service and sales staff who can help introduce a designer to wealthy customers. 
 ''Now specialty stores are going through a really tough time,'' Mr. Reyes said.
 While designers have been more accommodating to stores, questions about Jake's financial circumstances, and its owners' refusal to pay for several orders over the last year, have engendered an unusual degree of hostility toward Mr. Lawson and Mr. Wetzel. 
 Mr. Lawson, after speaking with a lawyer, agreed to discuss only the broad outline of the difficulties. ''Personally, Jim and I view the situation as tragic,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''The fallout hurt our lenders, vendors, employees and Jim and me. We truly regret this.''
 One designer whose feelings are still raw is Emma Fletcher, the designer of Lyell, a small collection of delicate 1930s-era designs. ''The economy was slipping so fast, and everybody else was so cool,'' Ms. Fletcher said. ''But they were just unprofessional and mean.''
 Ms. Fletcher said that last fall, Jake's owners placed an order for $10,000 of her designs for the holiday season. ''It was a store I was really happy to get into,'' said Ms. Fletcher, who has her own store on Elizabeth Street in NoLIta.
 Jake carried a finely edited mix of cult labels like Band of Outsiders, Patrik Ervell, Phillip Lim and Opening Ceremony, and had such a good reputation that DNR, the men's wear trade publication, included the store on its annual ranking of the 50 most influential stores.
 Even though Ms. Fletcher's bank did not consider the store to be credit-worthy, she decided to complete the order, requesting cash on delivery. Jake wrote a check for the full amount, but it was drawn on an account that was frozen, Ms. Fletcher said. When she called Mr. Lawson to ask him to return the clothes, she was told the matter was out of his hands.
 Jake was facing its own problems. 
 Beginning last fall, as the depth of the recession was becoming apparent, its sales virtually came to a halt. Several designers, including Ms. Chung and Ms. Fletcher, said they were told by Jake's owners that they were working out credit issues with their bank. Later, they learned that the bank had begun a foreclosure of the business and that its assets had been acquired by a third-party investment company.
 Mr. Lawson declined to identify Jake's current owners, but Illinois public records show that Belcorp Financial Services, a small lending company based in Hinsdale, Ill., provided the financing. He said that the former company, operating as Price Allen Inc., had gone out of business and that he and Mr. Wetzel are now running Jake as employees of the new owner, Jake Retail Group, which did not assume responsibilities for their debts.
 When the bank placed Price Allen in default, Mr. Lawson said, he was no longer in control of the company and powerless to direct payments or make decisions about inventory.
 ''Price Allen encountered a perfect storm caused by the confluence of the credit crisis, the recession and the radical decline in consumer spending,'' he said by e-mail. 
 Mr. Wetzel and Mr. Lawson, each with years of experience working for other retailers, understood the value of building relationships with young designers, courted them enthusiastically and became emblematic of the wave of excitement centered around new American fashion in the last decade. But Jake's problems also illustrate what can result from the naive indulgences that young designers often make, even against the advice of their business advisers, as they struggle to translate creative ideas into commercial success.
 It was a harsh reality check when those designers who had shipped clothes to Jake before the reorganization were told that the new corporation was not liable for old debts. Ms. Fletcher, who absorbed the cost to produce and ship clothes to Jake, is behind on some of her bills, she said. She and her business partner, Mike Kresse, decided to close their Manhattan store for the month of July -- ''in the spirit of the economy,'' as its Web site notes.
 ''It was really hard on my morale,'' Ms. Fletcher said of Jake's insolvency. ''I feel like the timing was premeditated. They sold the clothes. They kept the money. They didn't pay me.''
 The abrupt change in circumstances at Jake came as a surprise to many designers who were accustomed to the extravagant style of Mr. Wetzel and Mr. Lawson. At the collections in New York and Paris, they were described in glowing profiles as wearing Martin Margiela and Burberry and, for Mr. Lawson, a Breitling watch. In Chicago, they lavished their best customers with free tailoring, fashion shows and lunches, seeking to establish themselves as players along with the city's other exclusive stores like Ikram and Blake. A 2006 article in Crain's Chicago Business listed their sales at $5 million.
 Because the company failed, Mr. Lawson said, he and Mr. Wetzel, who mortgaged their home to open the store, are personally liable for debts around $1 million. Separately, a $261,145 federal tax lien was placed against Price Allen in March. 
 Mr. Lawson said he empathized with the designers who were owed money, but he noted that the store had paid more than $10 million to designers before spring 2008, when its problems began. And unlike other retailers that simply closed their doors, they hope to make the new Jake a profitable business. It currently carries a mix of labels like Alexander Wang, Jenni Kayne and Keith Lissner. Mr. Lawson said the store is now prepaying vendors for merchandise.
 But designers who are still owed money are frustrated that the owners did not communicate the severity of their financial problems. Mr. Hamilton said he was owed for three seasons, though he would not disclose the amount. He continued to ship clothes to Jake even though he had not been paid for previous seasons, he said, because it was the first store to buy his line. When he finally negotiated a payment from Jake last fall, the check bounced, he said. (After inquiries were made by The New York Times, Mr. Hamilton said he received word that Jake would attempt to work out a payment, which he viewed as a positive sign that the store was trying to salvage their relationship.)
 ''I know the product sold, I just don't know what happened to the money,'' he said. ''It's not cool.''
 Ms. Chung also said she had been lax in collecting what was owed because of her relationship with the store, ''but when they stopped taking phone calls, we really felt betrayed.
 ''I feel awful, because I vouched for these people to other designers. We had no idea how many people were affected by this one tiny store.''

HEADLINE: Partnerships in Science, at Nano Level

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
THE economic news in California has been pretty bleak lately. Its businesses, small and large, are becalmed by the recession. The state has taken to issuing i.o.u.'s in the wake of political wrangling over how to resolve a $26 billion budget deficit. Most ominous, the state's once-great public universities and its community colleges and local schools face budget cuts that amount to critical surgery.
 Yet in the midst of all that, there is a promise for the future in the collaboration by California's university research centers, small companies and venture finance firms in an emerging area called nanotechnology. 
 Working with materials that are a thousandth the diameter of a human hair, nanotechnology companies do not produce finished products in any one industry. Rather, nano particles improve performance and open new possibilities in activities as varied as water purification, biomedicine, battery power, environmental repair and agriculture. 
 The universities have been essential in this development process. In some cases, they make direct equity investments in start-up companies. Other times, universities grant licenses to their research and give small companies access to expensive laboratory equipment in return for user fees. And some universities have set up incubators where small companies develop technological products and processes. 
 Why are universities investing scarce budget cash in start-up companies? ''Partnerships with private industry are a way of making this new technology available for public benefit,'' said Leonard H. Rome, interim director of the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. Also, in times of strained budgets, such partnerships bring needed funds. The NanoSystems Institute, Mr. Rome said, ''has attracted more than $350 million in research and development grants from industry.'' 
 Moreover, the new nanotechnology industry demands interdisciplinary collaboration. ''The medical school needs to be collaborating with the engineering school,'' said Mr. Rome, who is also senior associate dean of research at the university's School of Medicine. In fact, the institute was first authorized in 2000 as part of a $100 million grant from the state of California to spur university research.
 Examples from several universities and fledgling companies demonstrate the potential. NanoH2O Inc., for instance, uses nano materials to improve the performance of reverse osmosis membranes in making dirty water clean or in desalination. Two years ago, the company licensed the membrane research of Eric Hoek, a professor of environmental engineering at U.C.L.A. Then it leased lab space in the NanoSystems Institute, which opened in 2007, because being at U.C.L.A. allowed the company to use expensive electron microscopes and other equipment. 
 ''Being able to use the core facilities of the university couldn't help but accelerate our progress,'' said Jeff Green, chief executive of NanoH2O. It also helped attract $20 million in venture capital from Oak Investment Partners and Khosla Ventures. Now, NanoH2O is moving to a factory where it can manufacture membranes composed partly of nano-size elements of alumina and silicon. The membranes filter out salts and impurities yet allow water to flow faster, thus saving energy in desalination or water reuse processes. 
 Matrix Sensors Inc. is a new tenant at the NanoSystems Institute. The company is developing nano membranes that are so sensitive to resonance they can detect molecules of bacteria as well as proteins and DNA and thus diagnose early stages of illness. Matrix Sensors is working on licensed research of three professors, James K. Gimzewski of U.C.L.A., and Calvin F. Quate and Butros T. Khuri-Yakub of Stanford University. U.C.L.A. and Stanford have invested in the company, along with Miramar Venture Partners of San Diego, which has put in $1 million. That is a sign, said Michael Cable, chief executive of Matrix, that investors, even in the recession, are supporting nanotechnology. 
 QuantumSphere Inc., in Santa Ana, Calif., is approaching nanotechnology on a broad scale by making an array of catalysts that allow batteries to operate for longer periods, electronic displays to be manufactured at lower costs and ammonia fertilizers to be produced using less energy while also generating less carbon dioxide. 
 ''It's not a question of making nano materials alone but what applications are you using nano for,'' said Kevin D. Maloney, president of QuantumSphere, a seven-year-old company that got its start with $100,000 investment from two angel investors: Jon Faiz Kayyem, a trustee of California Institute of Technology, and Marc H. Goroff, who has a doctorate from Caltech and is the founder of several companies. 
 The reason infinitesimal nano particles can give batteries more power is, paradoxically, ''that at the nano stage there are more atoms available on the surface of a molecule proportionate to its volume, so there are more active atoms to store and release electricity,'' said Douglas Carpenter, co-founder and senior science adviser of QuantumSphere. Mr. Carpenter designed rocket fuel for aerospace companies for many years and helped invent Quantum's nano catalysts. 
 ''At the nano level, elements change their properties,'' Mr. Carpenter explained. Aluminum, for instance, cannot burn at micron levels, or one millionth of a meter, but burns and gives off an intensely glowing light at nano levels, or one billionth of a meter. QuantumSphere gets to do research on powerful microscopes and other equipment at the University of California, Irvine, paying fees to the university for each use. It has raised $17 million from private equity and venture funds, including $2 million from OM Group Inc., a specialty chemicals company based in Cleveland. 
 In an example of global collaboration, Rachid Yazami, research director of France's National Center for Scientific Research, has done his work on battery technology since 2000 at Caltech. He is co-founder along with a Caltech professor, Robert H. Grubbs, of CFX Battery Inc., of Azusa, Calif., which makes lithium ion batteries that can power electric cars, medical devices, mobile phones and computers. The technology transfer office at Caltech invested in CFX and helped raise $15 million to get the company started. 
 ''But lithium is expensive and coming into short supply,'' Mr. Yazami said. So he is trying to develop a battery powered by nano particles of sodium and water. ''You know the work of Jules Verne,'' Mr. Yazami asked, referring to ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.'' ''He wrote of using seawater as a battery.''

HEADLINE: As U.S. Market Wanes, Norman Sees Golf's Future in Global Terms

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

DATELINE: TURNBERRY, Scotland 

 BODY:
Greg Norman's golf game has made an impressive comeback in the last year, but the recession has taken a toll on his golf club design business. Norman, who won the 1986 British Open here, said Wednesday that he has had to lay off 20 employees and was not optimistic about a quick return to normalcy in the United States market. 
 ''America is absolutely dead, and it doesn't look like it's going to come back for quite a while, to tell you the truth,'' Norman said. ''We see, in our business, the rest of the world leading the comeback from the recession before the United States. I think the United States has got to get a lot of understanding of regulations that are being put in place by President Obama. 
 ''I spent time in China two weeks ago. I think I've got a lot of belief in China, like a lot of what the rest of the world does, not just in resources, but in development.'' 
 Norman said he believed golf would expand globally if it is included as a medal sport in the 2016 Olympics. China is experiencing a growth boom in the sport, he added, and officials there have said they expected that the country will have 26 million golfers by 2020. The latest estimate by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association of the number of golfers in the United States is 27.3 million, based on a 2007 study. 
 ARE CONDITIONS RIGHT FOR GARCIA? When he is on his game, Sergio Garcia might be the best driver in the game. That skill will be at a premium in the wind this week at the heavily bunkered and rough-encircled Ailsa course at Turnberry. Garcia feels as if this could be the year he breaks through to win his first major championship. 
 ''Usually here at the Open we have windy conditions,'' Garcia said. ''I've always enjoyed playing in the wind. I feel like when the courses get tough like that, yeah, you can depend a little bit more on your ball-striking abilities. 
 ''But anyway, I've putted well at this championship, too, and I've had my chances. So I think it's just a combination of the way the courses set up and how much I love playing this event.'' 
 Asked to rank his current putting form on a scale of 1 to 10, Garcia quickly responded, ''15.'' 
 British bettors seem to like Garcia's recent form. They have made him their second choice behind the heavy favorite, Tiger Woods. Garcia finished second at Carnoustie in 2007, losing in a playoff to Padraig Harrington. The two previous years, he tied for fifth. 
 CAMPBELL ROUNDING INTO FORM Michael Campbell of New Zealand, the 2005 United States Open champion, has been seen on the practice tee at Turnberry. Campbell, 40, who injured his shoulder early this year, is notorious for popping up out of nowhere to contend in majors, which would fit his '09 form chart: 11 missed cuts in 11 events on the European Tour and three missed cuts in three events on the PGA Tour. Key: he shot 69 in the first round of the Barclays Scottish Open last week, his first round in the 60s this year. ... Germany's new star golfer, Martin Kaymer, has won the last two events he has played, the French and Scottish Opens, which makes him difficult to pick this week. No golfer has won all three of those events in a career, let alone in a row. ... Henrik Stenson of Sweden quietly broke out of a mini-slump at Bethpage Black with a top 10 in the United States Open. He has been in Turnberry since last Wednesday and likes the golf course and his chances.

HEADLINE: The Right to Arm Public Housing

 BODY:
Congress continues to do the gun lobby's lethal bidding, delivering a bipartisan boost in a House committee to a reckless proposal that would allow residents of public housing projects to keep guns in their homes. The measure would endanger projects in major cities that have adopted the common sense precaution of declaring public housing to be no-gun zones. 
 The gun amendment was perversely attached to a much-needed measure widening access to Section 8 subsidized housing for families hard pressed in the current recession. Why these families should be forced to face this latest duck-and-cover mischief from the gun lobby is incomprehensible. Nevertheless, the gun amendment was approved 38 to 31 in the House Financial Services Committee, with 13 Democrats once more opting for the gun lobby's zealotry over the cause of public safety.
 It's urgent that the gun amendment be stripped from the final measure, but do not expect bold or principled action from this Congress on this issue. It burdened credit card reform with an irrelevant amendment allowing visitors to carry loaded guns in national parks. President Obama signed it into law, showing no appetite to take on the gun lobby. Similarly, lawmakers poisoned the historic measure to grant the District of Columbia a vote in the House -- yielding to a vindictive amendment striking at the city's home-rule power to control gun traffic.
 Congress should be ashamed at its retreat from responsible gun controls. Even statehouse politicians -- long a pushover for unbridled gun ownership -- are showing more spine. Lately they've been rebuffing the gun lobby's lunatic priority: to force colleges to allow students to pack loaded guns in the classroom. 
 Far from authorizing the addition of guns to all the problems already rampant in public housing, Congress should be dealing with the national embarrassment that individuals barred from airlines on the terrorist watch list are free to shop for firearms. Senator Frank Lautenberg has a proposal to let the attorney general block this insanity. Security-minded Americans, however, better not count on action by this timorous Congress.

HEADLINE: After Injuries, College Athletes Are Often Left to Pay the Bills

BYLINE: By KRISTINA PETERSON

 BODY:
After years of concerns about inadequate health coverage for college athletes, the National Collegiate Athletic Association started requiring universities to make sure their athletes had insurance before competing.
 But the association never established clear standards for that coverage when it introduced the rule four years ago, leaving colleges to decide for themselves. While some colleges accept considerable responsibility for medical claims, many others assume almost none, according to a review of public documents from a cross section of universities and interviews with current and former athletes, trainers, administrators and N.C.A.A. officials.
 University officials say they go out of their way to inform students about the limits of insurance. Yet the situation has confused and frustrated athletes and their families, some of whom have had to shoulder large and unexpected medical bills.
 ''I thought I would be covered,'' said Erin Knauer, a Colgate University student who piled up $80,000 in medical bills after injuring her back and legs in training for the crew team. Insurance has covered less than a third of the cost because of the way her condition was diagnosed. ''You never think you're going to rack up that much of a bill.'' 
 Other athletes discover their financial problems long after their bodies have healed. An Ohio University football player, temporarily paralyzed during a workout, learned that he still owed $1,800 in unpaid medical bills when he went to buy a car six years after his injury. 
 Many students, whether athletes or not, have medical insurance through their parents. But these plans often exclude varsity sports injuries, limit out-of-state treatment or do not cover much of the bill. Some colleges buy secondary policies to fill the gaps, although even these plans have holes. And only players hurt badly enough to require extensive care can turn to the N.C.A.A. for coverage. Its catastrophic insurance carries a $75,000 deductible, which will increase to $90,000 next year.
 The absence of mandated coverage for athletes has prompted calls for change.
 ''That's part of the cost of having an athletic program,'' said David Dranove, a professor of health industry management at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ''It makes no more sense to tell the athletes, 'You go buy your own health insurance,' than it does to say, 'You go buy your own plane tickets and uniform.' '' 
 Some colleges provide for their athletes. At Middlebury College in Vermont, a Division III institution, all varsity athletes and students in club sports have accident insurance paid for by the college, said Tom Corbin, Middlebury's business manager. 
 Spalding University, in Louisville, Ky., also pays for secondary coverage for athletes. ''These young men and young women are representing your institution,'' said Charlie Just, the compliance director there. ''Ethically, I think it's the right thing to do.''
 Some of the nation's largest universities, which benefit from lucrative television contracts for their football and basketball programs, also provide comprehensive coverage. At Michigan State, for instance, Aisha Jefferson, a women's basketball player with no private insurance, has had four operations for sports-related injuries without receiving a single bill.
 The University of Iowa, which like Michigan State is a member of the Big Ten, provides among the most comprehensive coverage for varsity athletes. The university received 4,200 medical bills for them last year, paying $776,454, according to documents obtained through an Iowa Public Records Law request. The university has also begun paying for uninsured full-scholarship athletes to enroll in the student health care offered on campus.
 Still, many athletes are not so lucky -- victims to disagreements over who is responsible for payment or what constitutes a medical condition. 
 Knauer, 20, was a first-semester freshman at Colgate when she joined the crew team in 2007 as a walk-on. She was battling a cold when the team was scheduled for a five-kilometer workout test on rowing machines. Despite her condition, she was on a pace for her fastest time when she felt a shooting pain rip through her back to the tips of her toes.
 Over the next month, she said, the pain increased and she ended up in an emergency room twice, eventually spending a week at the University of Maryland hospital, closer to her family's home in Ellicott City, Md. She also went through physical therapy to heal her strained back and a bulged disk. 
 Her symptoms were later diagnosed as postviral myositis, a muscular inflammation that can cause weakness and pain. Because Colgate officials deemed the condition an illness -- not an athletic injury -- they said financial responsibility fell to Knauer.
 ''There has to be some direct line from the injury to what she's being treated for,'' said Steve Chouinard, an assistant athletic director at Colgate who assumed responsibility for insurance matters after this decision was made.
 In fact, the situation is more complicated, according to two medical experts. They said it would be difficult to attribute every symptom to either a virus or an injury, an illustration of the ambiguity of treating and paying for care when an athlete has more than one health concern. 
 Sustaining an injury while sick can make both situations worse, said Dr. Jerry Mendell, a professor of pediatrics and neurology at the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. An injury could have intermingled with the disease, he said. ''I don't think we can say where one starts and stops.''
 What is clear is that if Knauer had been treated the same way under the university's athletic insurance, she would have had full coverage after a $1,000 deductible. Instead, she had to tap her student health policy, which offers up to $25,000 in coverage a year, leaving her with $55,000 in debt on the original $80,000 in bills. 
 Knauer had some financial assistance and additional coverage from her family, but her father, a chemical engineer, twice lost his job and the accompanying insurance. Knauer is now working two jobs to help meet her minimum monthly payments of $200 to $250. After paying off some of the debt and negotiating discounts with the hospital, she still faces $7,000 to $8,000 in bills. 
 ''I never thought I'd be in this position today,'' she said. 
 Still in physical pain, Knauer has struggled with the stress of weekly phone calls from bill collectors, some of whom have threatened to sue her. ''I definitely have broken down over the year,'' she said.
 Even scholarship athletes in major sports can end up in similar situations.
 Jason Whitehead, a former football player at Ohio University, was so badly injured during a workout in 2001 that he had to be airlifted to a hospital. He was temporarily paralyzed. 
 ''The next day, when I woke up, the doctor came in and informed me that surgery went well, but this was a career-ending injury,'' he said. ''You're a 19-year-old kid. It took awhile to sink in.'' 
 He said he took the bills not covered by his father's insurance to the Ohio University trainers. His father's insurance and Ohio University refused to pay the claims.
 Whitehead lost his scholarship one academic year after being medically disqualified by a team physician, per university policy. University officials declined to comment on his situation, citing their commitment to student privacy. They also said they would not pay bills for procedures that occurred more than a year earlier.
 But Whitehead, now a 28-year-old district manager for Frito Lay inthe Cleveland area, said he discovered he owed roughly $1,800 in unpaid medical bills while reviewing paperwork to buy his first car about six years after his injury. 
 ''The coach says: 'You're on full scholarship. If you ever get hurt, we'll make sure to take care of you,' '' he said. ''There's a lot of us out there that get used.''
 Within a single state university system, health coverage can vary widely. At the University of Wisconsin's Division I Madison campus, all varsity athletes fall under secondary sports coverage. By contrast, the Division III campuses of the University of Wisconsin have training rooms to treat minor athletic injuries; anything beyond that is the responsibility of athletes and their families. 
 After Dustin Tervelt broke his leg while playing football for the University of Wisconsin-Stout, he spent nearly a year rehabilitating to get back on the field. Tervelt quit his part-time job at a liquor store because he said he could no longer hoist kegs or stock the shelves. 
 ''Everything was just piling up,'' he said. ''It just felt like there was no coming back out of it.'' 
 He eventually worked his way back to the field, where he earned all-conference and all-American honors for the 2008 season. By then, he was also carrying about $6,000 in medical debt, the amount left over after his private insurance coverage reached its limit. Had Tervelt played football on the Madison campus, where the Badgers compete in the Big Ten, he would have had full coverage. ''I knew I wasn't going to get the scholarship money, but I knew that I wanted to play football,'' said Tervelt, who now coaches football and plays on a team in Denmark. ''When you do something you love, not just in football but in everyday life, you take those risks.''
 The National College Players Association, an advocacy group, is lobbying for legislation to further protect athletes. The N.C.A.A.'s focus is misplaced, said Ramogi Huma, the group's executive director.
 ''Their top priority is not to do right by the players,'' said Huma, a former football player at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''It's to do right by the schools and maximize profits and exposure for the member institutions.''
 Last summer, the N.C.A.A. was required to establish a $218 million relief fund as settlement for a class-action lawsuit brought by football and basketball players who argued that their scholarships did not adequately cover certain living expenses, including medical bills. Many athletes do not know the money is available, so some of it has gone unspent.
 ''For us to insure all our athletes, it would be five figures, if not six,'' said Scott Doberstein, the head athletic trainer at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, which offers no coverage to athletes. ''I think we need health-care reform. Under the current structure, it is just too cost-prohibitive, especially in these economic times.''
 Ultimately, the N.C.A.A. is unlikely to require universities to provide more insurance any time soon.
 ''The only way to increase coverage would be to make it mandatory,'' said Joe D'Antonio, the chairman of the N.C.A.A.'s legislative council and associate commissioner of the Big East Conference. ''It could be too demanding financially on some of our institutions.''

B14) CHARTS: What the N.C.A.A. Requires: An N.C.A.A. bylaw requires that colleges certify athletes are insured before allowing them to compete. It also states that colleges are allowed to provide insurance for their athletes but are not required to do so, a change put into effect in August 2008. The N.C.A.A. provides catastrophic insurance, but only for athletes who have been severely injured and are likely to require lifelong care.
Athletic Injuries Excluded: Many universities offer healthcare plans that all enrolled students can buy into. Student plans almost always limit coverage for injuries incurred during varsity sports practice or competition. In 2008-9, students at the University at Buffalo, for example, could join an Aetna plan with the following exclusion provision shown at right.
Medical Costs The University of Iowa, a Big Ten institution that offers some of the country's most generous care, provides its insured athletes secondary, or backup, insurance to cover costs that remain after primary plans are exhausted. The university also assumes all of the expenses for athletes who are uninsured. Here are examples of what the university paid out in health expenses for athletes during the 2007-8 academic year, as noted in public records of the athletic department budget.(Sources: N.C.A.A.

HEADLINE: Retraining for the Jobless

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Job Retraining May Fall Short of High Hopes'' (front page, July 6) could leave readers wondering why Michigan is making an unprecedented investment in worker retraining -- and unclear about the outcomes we are beginning to see from our No Worker Left Behind strategy. 
 Since August 2007, Michigan has put 77,803 workers into training for in-demand jobs. Despite the fact that we have had the highest unemployment rate in the nation over this period, the results have been impressive. 
 Of participating workers financed by the federal Workforce Investment Act (the subject of the Labor Department study reported in the article) who have exited the program so far, 93 percent were employed at exit and 87 percent of those newly employed workers had jobs related to their training.
 No Worker Left Behind represents a major shift in emphasis that the Obama administration and many in Congress appear interested in following -- away from job placement services and toward longer term training that can change a worker's life, give him or her a family-sustaining job for the long haul, and lift our nation's competitiveness in the global marketplace.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Are Jamming The Ashrams

BYLINE: By SARA ECKEL

 BODY:
SHORTLY after Steven Odnoha lost his job at Intel, he drove three days from Rio Rancho, N.M., to the Himalayan Institute in Honesdale, Pa. For months, Mr. Odnoha had been wondering how he could get the time off to join a yearlong meditation program at the nonprofit yoga retreat. His pink slip, in September 2007, provided the answer. 
 ''I figured if I stayed for a year, the economy would be warming up by then, and I could head back and see what's available for a semiconductor manufacturing technician,'' said Mr. Odnoha, 40, as he picked wild thyme from a small garden outside the institute's kitchen. 
 Obviously, the economy didn't cooperate, but Mr. Odnoha doesn't mind. Now he spends his days on the Himalayan Institute's 400-acre wooded campus, practicing hatha yoga and meditation, studying spiritual texts, biking, walking and preparing meals in the institute's kitchen. In exchange for his cooking duties and an annual fee of $3,000, he gets a private room, three vegetarian meals a day and unlimited access to the institute's classes, seminars and other events. 
 The Himalayan Institute is one of many retreats where cash-strapped spiritual seekers can participate in work-study programs in which they pay typically $300 to $900 a month in exchange for a few hours a day of service, like washing dishes, cleaning rooms or weeding gardens. 
 As the unemployment rate has risen and people have sought refuge from the harsh economy, these work-exchanges have become a hot commodity. The Himalayan Institute received twice as many applications for its summer work-study programs this year as last -- its August session is full, with 22 people, compared with 11 last year -- and so did two similar retreats, Tassajara Zen Mountain Center in Carmel Valley, Calif., and Satchidananda Ashram in Buckingham, Va. (which is better known as Yogaville). 
 The people who run these programs say there seems to be a link between the troubled job market and the rising popularity of yoga retreats. Todd Wolfenberg, director of marketing at the Himalayan Institute, said he has seen an increase in applications from recent college graduates and people with professional careers. ''I suspect that is due to the fact that they haven't been able to find a job after college or are leaving a job,'' he said. The center has traditionally attracted people whose lives permit extended time off, like writers and entrepreneurs. 
 Yoga retreat programs can be as short as an overnight visit to Ananda Ashram in Monroe, N.Y., or can last for months or even years.
 The long-term residencies usually begin with a monthlong foundational program in which participants commit to a full schedule of classes and meditation. At the Himalayan Institute's 28-day self-transformation program, the day begins with a 6 a.m. meditation and continues with a full roster of hatha yoga classes, breathing and relaxation practicums and about four hours of light chores, like making beds and chopping vegetables. The program costs $825, and participants receive a private room and three vegetarian meals a day. 
 ''It's designed for individuals who are between jobs, on leave or sabbatical, or just burned out and have the ability to take time out,'' Mr. Wolfenberg said. 
 On a recent Monday afternoon, 11 participants sat in the institute's cafeteria chopping cucumbers, red peppers and Swiss chard for the next day's lunch. Among those sitting side-by-side with bandanas worn headband- or kerchief-style, were a recent college graduate, a chef, the owner of a telecommunications company and the founder of a nongovernmental organization. While some were return visitors, several had never even taken a yoga class before. 
 ''This is not my normal scene,'' said Jeffrey Webb, 52, from Augusta, Ga., as he julienned a cucumber. Mr. Webb, who owns a wheel repair business, said he wanted to learn how to slow down. ''I'm going all the time,'' he said. ''So this is an experiment in the alternative-lifestyle adventure.''
 Across the table, Laurie Smith, a bartender and waitress from Naples, Fla., explained that she didn't want to spend her vacation sitting in a beach chair. ''I thought I might as well do something that isn't just lying around and spending money,'' said Ms. Smith, 36, who was taking a 10-day course. 
 ''I might as well get something out of it.'' Like her cohorts, Ms. Smith said she didn't mind spending a substantial portion of her vacation chopping vegetables, washing dishes and making beds, pointing out that in a place dedicated to quiet contemplation, these simple tasks provide an easy outlet for conversation. ''You're not interrupting someone's quiet time,'' she said. ''You don't always want to be alone, so you can do the work and hang out at the same time.''
 Yehnemsah Oneha, work-study coordinator at Ananda Ashram, says that while cost-cutting and ice-breaking are nice benefits, the true purpose of these work exchanges, sometimes known as karma yoga, is to foster selflessness and good will. ''It helps circulate the energy,'' she said. ''You're doing it for someone else's comfort and welfare.'' 
 Ananda plays host to everyone. Weekenders from New York City, who pay full price and come to the ashram for its rolling hills, small pond, deer and geese so unafraid of people they will brush right by guests, circulate among long-term residents, who take unpaid staff positions in exchange for room, board, and unlimited classes in hatha yoga, chanting and Sanskrit. There's also a pool.
 ''This is my New York getaway,'' said Erin Laubenheimer, a Brooklyn resident, while washing dishes in Ananda's kitchen. Ms. Laubenheimer, 27, who was laid off from her job in the fashion industry, says the reduced rate she receives in exchange for three hours a day of service makes her short visits affordable. ''It's a great place to get a new start or to heal,'' she said.
 But Ananda is not a spa. Like the rooms at the Himalayan Institute, the rooms at Ananda are clean but spare -- it's a dormitory, not Canyon Ranch -- and work-study guests usually share a room with several other people for a fee in a range of $40 for a weekend day to $425 for a month. 
 Ms. Oneha says that the ashram's monthlong immersion program is intended for deep spiritual study and contemplation, not hiding out from the world. ''If you're applying because you can't deal with life, that's not a good motivation,'' she said.
 For this reason, Ms. Oneha doesn't recommend it for those seeking a cheap refuge. She points out that even those who take full-time jobs at the ashram -- and thus can stay there free -- quickly realize that karma yoga won't pay their car insurance or credit-card debt. Savings are essential.
 Committing to an unpaid life baking bread and planting trees, however idyllic it might sound in the abstract, can also raise identity issues. 
 Alisa Phillips, 41, has worked as a yoga therapist, documentary filmmaker and belly dancer, among other things. She is now Ananda's dining room coordinator. ''When I came for the weekend and was doing a lot of dishes, I felt like I was making a righteous contribution,'' she said. ''When I'm living here and it's my job, it's like, 'Who am I now that I've become a dishwasher?' ''
 This is a sentiment Mr. Odnoha understands, but for now he feels content. As he prepares a mixture of dates and buckwheat for the next morning's breakfast, he says he feels satisfied that his work, however indirectly, is helping the Himalayan Institute's mission of providing humanitarian aid to poor communities in Africa and India. 
 ''At Intel, I was helping the owner get a new yacht,'' he said. ''Here. I'm part of something that actually makes a difference.''

HEADLINE: Retailer Knockoffs Abound in India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Retailers are flocking to India, thanks to an economy that is still growing and a young population eager to gobble up new brand names. 
 But some Western brands -- once they conquer the regulatory hurdles to getting into the market here -- may get a sinking sense of familiarity. For instance, Timberland, the maker of hiking boots and other outdoor gear, identifiable by its tree logo and chunky, durable shoes, will find Woodland, which sells similar shoes and clothing, and has a tree logo. 
 Pinkberry, the Los Angeles-based frozen yogurt chain, will encounter Cocoberry, a frozen yogurt retailer with a look-alike logo and a similar array of candy and fresh fruit toppings. 
 And The Financial Times, Pearson's newspaper published with a pink tint since 1893, is locked in a legal battle with Bennett, Coleman & Company, owners of India's largest English-language newspaper: a pink-tinted supplement it calls The Financial Times, which it registered in India in 1984. 
 Pearson's Financial Times is eager to publish in India, but Bennett Coleman is challenging that right in court. Indeed, in recent months, a subsidiary of Bennett Coleman registered similar names with India's newspaper registry, including FT Asia and Worldwide Financial Times.
 Like Bennett Coleman, Woodland -- the Timberland look-alike -- is no mom-and-pop operation. It has 230 stores nationwide and 50 more on the way, and it is a staple of urban shopping malls. That could cramp Timberland's planned expansion in India, potentially confusing would-be customers and costing Timberland sales.
 The United States has long tussled over intellectual property rights with China, where counterfeiters crank out knockoffs of designer bags and iPhones (and manufacturers have even made entire vehicles that look just like foreign cars). But as brands look to India as one of the few opportunities for growth in an anemic global market, foreign companies and governments alike are protesting the country's lack of intellectual property protections, too.
 As Gary Locke, the commerce secretary, told a group of Indian executives visiting Washington this month, ''U.S. businesses need assurances that when they come to India, they'll be operating in a secure and reliable environment for intellectual property.'' 
 India will be the best market in the world for retail sales growth this year, A. T. Kearney said in a report released in June. India's ''growing, educated and aspirational middle class is demanding a better retail environment and more global brands and styles,'' the consulting group said.
 Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Tesco are opening wholesale stores that will sell to restaurants and owners of small shops. Dozens of foreign brands that have not already entered the Indian market are searching for domestic joint venture partners, which they need before opening a store here. 
 When questioned about the inspiration for Woodland, Harkirat Singh, managing director and the third generation to run the family shoe company, said the assumption should not be made that ''just because the name sounds similar,'' Woodland is copying Timberland. There is a ''similarity,'' he acknowledged, ''but our line is quite different from theirs.'' 
 Mr. Singh said he thought Timberland's entry into India could help, not hurt, his business. Foreign brands ''bring more awareness about quality footwear'' to India, he said. Then Indian consumers ''buy our product because it is more value for money.'' 
 Timberland's spokeswoman, Robin Giampa, said that Woodland's ''imitation of several of the valuable and well-recognized Timberland brands is a concern.'' The company is addressing Woodland's ''brand piracy'' through the appropriate legal processes in India, she said. 
 Whether that will be successful is unclear. ''Our courts have recognized that you can't have an isolated approach to trademark law,'' said Gayatri Roy, a lawyer with Luthra & Luthra in New Delhi, meaning judges have often ruled that brands that are well known around the world cannot be copied by someone else in India, even if the companies with those brands do not do business in India. In such cases, Indian courts have decided in favor of Whirlpool, Dunhill and Volvo, among others. 
 In the case of Timberland and Woodland, though, it may be difficult for Timberland to prove that it should be protected, Ms. Roy said. After all, Woodland has been in business since 1992, she said, so they have created their own identity. 
 When asked whether Pinkberry frozen yogurt was his inspiration, Cocoberry's chief executive, G. S. Bhalla, said he wanted to create a brand ''associated with nature, health and social responsibility.'' 
 (The company said Mr. Bhalla's 7-year-old daughter was the inspiration for combining the words coco, for cocoa, and berry, for the fresh fruit that tops the yogurt.)
 ''Our product, recipe, store design, menu and philosophy are unique and very different from any other brand in the world,'' Mr. Bhalla said. ''We plan to expand at a steady and controlled pace in India,'' he said. Pinkberry had no comment. 
 Citigroup has been active in India, as Citibank, for decades, and the country's urban areas are dotted with bank branches with the blue-striped sign. But that did not stop Yes Bank, a retail banking chain that rolled out branches throughout India in recent years, from using a very similar sign. 
 Some imitators are so loosely based on the original that they may not be considered a threat -- like the 6Ten convenience stores. With their yellow and blue signs and piles of loose grains for sale rather than Slurpees, they are unlikely to be seen as competition to 7-Eleven. 
 And sometimes, the imitation is less about the brand than about what it represents. Across India, a number of scooter and motorcycle drivers sport the familiar Marlboro cigarette logo of a red and white chevron on their helmets. On closer inspection, those logos say ''Marlborne'' or ''Melbourne.'' 
 The helmets, made by several manufacturers, are ''basically replicas of the helmets worn by Michael Schumacher during his racing days at Ferrari,'' explained Rahim Premji, a partner with Allibhai Premji Tyrewalla, a bike dealership. Mr. Schumacher, a Formula One driver, was sponsored by Marlboro. 
 Helmet manufacturers were forced to replace the Marlboro name after the authorities said that tobacco advertising was not allowed in India, Mr. Premji said. Marlboro, not surprisingly, has not complained about the free advertising.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Faces Suit Over Cost of Universal Care

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Katie Zezima contributed reporting

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
A hospital that serves thousands of indigent Massachusetts residents sued the state on Wednesday, charging that its costly universal health care law is forcing the hospital to cover too much of the expense of caring for the poor. 
 The hospital, Boston Medical Center, faces a $38 million deficit for the fiscal year ending in September, its first loss in five years. The suit says the hospital will lose more than $100 million next year because the state has lowered Medicaid reimbursement rates and stopped paying Boston Medical ''reasonable costs'' for treating other poor patients.
 ''We filed this suit more in sorrow than in anger,'' said Elaine Ullian, the hospital's chief executive. ''We believe in health care reform to the bottom of our toes, but it was never, ever supposed to be financed on the backs of the poor, and that's what has happened in Massachusetts.'' 
 The central charge in the suit is that the state has siphoned money away from Boston Medical to help pay the considerable cost of insuring all but a small percentage of residents. Three years after the law's passage, Massachusetts has the country's lowest percentage of uninsured residents: 2.6 percent, compared with a national average of 15 percent. 
 Low-income residents, who have benefited most from expanded access to health care, receive state-subsidized insurance, one of the most expensive aspects of the state plan. But rapidly rising costs and the battered economy have caused more problems than the state and supporters of the 2006 law -- including Boston Medical -- anticipated.
 According to the suit, Massachusetts is now reimbursing Boston Medical only 64 cents for every dollar it spends treating the poor. About 10 percent of the hospital's patients are uninsured -- down from about 20 percent before the law's passage in 2006. But many more are on Medicaid or Commonwealth Care, the state-subsidized insurance program for low-income residents.
 One of the state's reimbursement rates to Boston Medical, dropped from $12, 476 in 2008 to $9,323 by 2009, the suit says. 
 Wendy E. Parmet, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law, said the suit was ''a step in a wider minuet'' as state lawmakers, health care providers and other stakeholders try to figure out how to make the new law work in the long term.
 ''I think it's going to be a very hard lawsuit for them to prevail on,'' Professor Parmet said of the hospital. ''I think they're trying to bring another weapon into what is essentially, in many ways, a political and economic battle going on in the state about how to pay for health care, and making sure their voice gets heard.'' 
 The suit comes as Congress looks to Massachusetts as a potential model for overhauling the nation's health care system. Even before the suit, the state's fiscal crisis had cast doubts on the law's sustainability.
 To help close a growing deficit, the Democratic-controlled Legislature eliminated coverage for some 30,000 legal immigrants in the new state budget. Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, is seeking to restore about half of the $130 million cut, but lawmakers have expressed reluctance, saying that doing so would require cuts to other important programs.
 State officials expressed surprise at the lawsuit, saying that Boston Medical received $1.5 billion in state funds in the past year and should not be seeking more in the midst of a fiscal crisis.
 ''At a time when everyone funded and served by state government is being asked to do more with less, B.M.C. has been treated no differently,'' said Dr. JudyAnn Bigby, the state secretary of health and human services, in a prepared statement. ''We are confident that the administration's actions in this area comply with all applicable law and will be upheld.''
 State officials have suggested that Boston Medical could reduce costs by operating more efficiently. The state has also pointed out that the hospital has reserves of about $190 million, but Tom Traylor, the hospital's vice president of federal and state programs, said the reserves could only sustain the hospital for about a year. 
 ''The magnitude of the loss here can't be solved on the program-cutting or expense-cutting side,'' Mr. Traylor said. Professor Parmet said the hospital's dissatisfaction with the new law should be a warning to Congress that ''insurance alone doesn't solve the problems'' of the health care system. In fact, she said, it might exacerbate the financial problems of safety-net hospitals in the short term.

HEADLINE: Intel's Earnings Help Drive a Rally

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Stocks shot higher on Wednesday after investors had a night to digest a stronger-than-expected financial report from Intel.
 Intel, the world's largest chip maker, said consumer demand for computers -- especially from Asia -- led to $8 billion in sales in the second quarter, and the company predicted an even stronger third quarter. Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, described the company's second-quarter growth as the best since 1988. 
 The buoyant mood in the stock market spread beyond technology companies on Wednesday as investors latched onto hopes that consumer spending might be recovering.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 256.72 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at 8,616.21. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 26.84 points, or 3 percent, to 932.68. And the technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index gained 63.17 points, or 3.5 percent, to 1,862.90. 
 Bond prices, meanwhile, fell sharply as investors moved into increasingly attractive stock positions. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note declined 1 2/32, to 96 2/32, and the yield rose to 3.60 percent from 3.47 percent late Tuesday.
 Coming on the heels of the huge profit reported at Goldman Sachs, the Intel announcement sent a strong signal to investors, who had greeted the week of heavyweight earnings with caution after a month of market losses and ambiguous economic indicators.
 Shares of Intel rose 7.3 percent, while its rival Advanced Micro Devices gained 8.7 percent on the positive signs for computer demand. Among other technology companies, Alcatel-Lucent rose 13.4 percent.
 ''In Goldman Sachs and Intel, you've got the 600-pound gorillas in the room,'' said Tim Smalls, head of United States stock trading at Execution in Greenwich, Conn. 
 Strong performances from the sterling names during difficult circumstances will not necessarily reassure investors, who for weeks have been questioning whether the overall economy is improving, Mr. Smalls said. ''We have to watch to see if there is this trickle-down effect,'' he said. ''If the financials coming up this week and next can show some positive earnings growth and put a positive spin on it, I think that will lessen some of the fears.''
 The stock market mostly shrugged off a report from the Labor Department that showed the Consumer Price Index rising 0.7 percent in June as a result of higher gasoline prices. Oil prices have been trending downward, and economists expect that consumer prices this month will not be affected nearly as much by energy costs.
 Oil prices rose Wednesday after falling sharply earlier in the month. Crude oil for August delivery rose $2.02, to settle at $61.54 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but that price was still more than $10 below the levels reached last month. Analysts said businesses had shed fuel inventories to the point that demand was expected to pick up again, and a report on Wednesday showed a bigger-than-expected drop in inventories.
 Market sentiment was similarly upbeat in Europe and Asia.
 In Britain, the FTSE 100 index gained 2.6 percent, while Germany's DAX index rose 3.1 percent. The CAC-40 in France picked up 2.9 percent.
 The Japanese Nikkei 225 stock average and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index both showed gains.

HEADLINE: Physical Culture: Hanging Out in Comfort

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
HAMMOCKS are a common sight in Latin America and Southeast Asia, but their popularity seems to be spreading beyond the tropics. Light, portable hammocks made of parachute nylon are increasingly being toted along on vacations and strung up at campsites, the beach or just about anywhere with adequately spaced trees or posts. 
 ''It's mostly in the last five to seven years that there've been a lot of them on the market,'' said Dov Frazer, the founder and president of Hammock Bliss, which sells portable hammocks designed for sleeping. He said that despite the economy, sales of his hammocks, which compress to about the size of a grapefruit, were up significantly last year -- by as much as 50 percent for some retailers.
 Their appeal is almost universal. ''Sleeping in a hammock is womblike, comfortable and practical,'' Mr. Frazer said. ''And even if you don't sleep in it, you just set it up and it's great to hang out in.'' 
 Banjo Weymouth, a mountaineering instructor, recently tried five travel hammocks at Mount Tabor Park in Portland, Ore. He found the products similar in construction. ''The science is pretty much the same: two points of tension attached to a piece of nylon,'' he said. But he did take note of their different suspension systems and evaluate how easy each one was to string up, especially for someone who might be less adept with straps and knots than he is.

Mr. Weymouth understood why this hammock, above, was favored by backpackers, who use it as an ultralight alternative to a tent: it comes with mosquito netting, a rain fly and an easy bottom entry with a Velcro closure. ''It's a pretty ingenious design,'' he said, adding that ''it could be awesome if you're trying to go super fast and light.'' But the set-up was slightly complicated, with ''a diagram and directions that were challenging to follow.''
EAGLES NEST OUTFITTERS DOUBLENEST HAMMOCK: $64.95, eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com. Mr. Weymouth admired the carabiners that clip this hammock, left, to its straps, making it ''seem the most, sort of, outdoorsy.'' With the closed carabiners, he said ''it felt safer and a little more well thought out and technical than some of the others.'' He tried it with the company's SlapStrap hanging straps, pieces of nylon webbing with pre-sewn loops for the carabiners to clip into, and found the system to be ''very simple.''
GRAND TRUNK PARACHUTE NYLON DOUBLE HAMMOCK: $59.99, thetravelhammock.com. ''This had by far the simplest set-up,'' Mr. Weymouth said, noting that the cords are meant to be hitched around trees and then hooked to the hammock. ''You just wrap it around the tree, cinch and hook, and it doesn't require any knots, which is great.'' Because the hammock, left, was a double size, he said, ''it tended to burrito me a little bit,'' but he could ''see it being comfy with two people.''
HAMMOCK BLISS TRIPLE HAMMOCK: $74.95, hammockbliss.com. The tree straps on the Hammock Bliss were significantly wider than on others, Mr. Weymouth said, ''which is a nice feature if you use a leave-no-trace ethic, because you don't damage the tree.'' The set-up was relatively simple for this ''comfortable, spacious'' hammock, he said, adding that the requirement to tie a square knot came with clear instructions.
 BYER OF MAINE PARACHUTE TRAVELLER HAMMOCK: $19.95, backcountry.com. ''This one was the least comfortable, probably because it was the smallest,'' Mr. Weymouth said of the Byer hammock, which weighs only 11 ounces. But, he said, ''it was easy to set up and felt really solid,'' with ''little aluminum adjustment slides that require no know-how and no knots.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY LISA BAUSO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Continuing a Conversation on Social Security

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
The rules covering Social Security are so numerous and so complicated that it isn't easy to figure out the optimal time to take benefits. As we recently wrote, this decision is different for each person and depends on a variety of factors: your health, your savings, when you stop working, whether you are married or single, and more.
 After receiving a flood of comments and queries from readers, we decided to continue the conversation about Social Security online. Many readers had similar questions, including how going back to work might affect your Social Security check. The market collapse led many people to delay retirement, while some people who had already retired went back to working part time. Several readers also questioned the strength of the Social Security system and wondered how that should factor into their decision-making. Some said they had already made up their minds, deciding that it was best to start collecting the money as soon as possible.
 So below, we've tried to answer some of the most popular queries. We also included some helpful tips from readers about little-known rules: 
 INVESTING EARLY BENEFITS
 Q.What if I begin to draw Social Security at 62 and invest the money at a moderate interest rate? Will I always be ahead of those who wait to draw benefits at 66 or 70? What would that interest rate be?
 -- Rick Edelen
 A. Sure, you might come out ahead. Or you might not, as the market crash and subsequent volatility has reminded us. 
 Anthony Webb, a research economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, ran the numbers for us. His conclusion: taking Social Security early (at 62) and investing your checks (until full retirement age, now 66, or later) is not worth the risk you need to shoulder to come out ahead.
 Consider someone who is set to receive $1,000 a month at full retirement age, or $750 a month at age 62. If he takes the $750 ($9,000 a year) and invests it for four years and earns an inflation-adjusted return of 7 percent, (excluding taxes and investment fees), he would have $41,458 by age 66. If he then draws down that money at the rate of $250 a month, it will last another 40 years, well past age 100, Mr. Webb says. (Remember, you'll add that amount to the $750 you're already receiving for a total payment of $1,000, which you would have collected if you waited until 66) .
 But if the money earns 3 percent, it will only last until age 80. If the money earns nothing -- better than most people done over the last decade -- the money will run out by age 77, he said. ''Given that a man who has made it to age 62 has a 57 percent chance of living to 80, and a 20 percent chance of living to 90, there is a very real risk that he will outlive his money,'' Mr. Webb said.
 INSOLVENCY
 Q.What about the elephant in the room? Social Security is insolvent as currently structured. Either benefits will have to be reduced, taxes will have to be raised, or perhaps benefits will be means-tested. Ignoring these issues is a trip down fantasy lane. 
 -- David Rapaport, Scarsdale, N.Y.
 Q.I read your article in Saturday's New York Times on when to collect Social Security. It was very interesting. However, one thing you didn't cover in your article was the possibility of Social Security running out of money. Because of this, my husband is considering collecting Social Security at 62, earlier than we had previously thought. Can you tell me what your thoughts are on this?
 -- Francine Rosen
 A. Experts say that if you've made it to 62 and the rules haven't changed, they're not likely to change for your generation. And if you don't take benefits at 62, you're unlikely to be penalized if you wait until 70. ''I think they would sooner default on government debt than cut Social Security benefits of the elderly,'' said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University who also created ESPlanner, financial planning software. ''There are about 48 million of these folks and they tend to vote,'' he said, referring to people over 60.
 Michael J. Astrue, the Social Security commissioner, has said benefits for today's retirees are safe. But unless something is done to reform the system, the trust funds will begin to lose money in 2016 and run out by 2037, though Social Security tax income would be enough to pay about 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2083, said John Shallman, a Social Security spokesman.
 Several financial experts still say that delaying benefits is the best form of insurance you can buy (think of the money you're not receiving as payment) to ensure you'll have a more substantial cushion later in life. ''We are still looking at this as the best longevity insurance available, regardless of whether one of the future fixes is an overall benefits reduction,'' said Lesley Brey, a financial planner in Honolulu, ''because it will be applied whether you take it early or take it later.''
 But if not collecting Social Security right now is keeping you up at night, well, then, maybe you should reconsider. ''If you sleep better,'' Ms. Brey says, ''then that's a planning goal, too.''
 None of this bodes well for younger generations, who will probably end up paying more in Social Security taxes and receive less in benefits. Many younger people don't think they'll get anything at all. ''It's more likely that they would reduce the benefits for younger people and go after the next generation some more, which is pretty awful,'' said Professor Kotlikoff. ''But it's the way Congress works all the time.''
 WORKING WHILE COLLECTING
 Q.Does working while you're receiving Social Security reduce your benefits?
 A. There is a lot of confusion about this issue. If you haven't yet reached your full retirement age, earning money above a certain threshold will reduce your benefits. But your checks will increase once you hit full retirement age to account for the time your benefits were withheld. (Remember, your full retirement age is different from the day you stop working for good. For people born from 1943 to 1954, the full retirement age is 66, and it creeps up for younger people.) 
 Not surprisingly, this provision angers many retirees because many people are under the impression that they are being taxed for going back to work. That's not really the case. You do receive a smaller check, but you basically earn credit during the period you did work, much as if you decided to delay taking benefits. 
 So here's how it works: In 2009, individuals who collect Social Security before their full retirement age will have their benefits reduced by $1 for every $2 earned above $14,160 (wages only; investment earnings don't apply). In the year you will reach full retirement age, your benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 earned above $37,680. But the month you hit your full retirement age, you can earn as much as you want without any loss of benefits, said Linda Lauria, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. 
 Say you started benefits at age 62, but then decide to go back to work after a year. Once you turn 66, your benefits will be recalculated: the system will see that you initially planned on taking benefits four years early. But since you worked for three of those years, your check will be permanently higher because you really took benefits only one year early. 
 If you do go back to work -- and you end up having one of your best earnings years -- you may be able to get an even higher benefit based on those earnings (it's automatically calculated).
 For more information on how this all works, visit the Social Security Administration's Web site (preferably after caffeination).
 FREEZING BENEFITS
 Q.If you have already starting collecting Social Security, can you freeze your benefits at any point?
 A. Some people can. If you are over full retirement age but not yet 70, you can voluntarily suspend Social Security to earn delayed retirement credits, where you basically earn extra credit (and a higher check later) for each month you don't collect benefits. For people born in 1943 and later, you can earn up to 8 percent more a year for each year between your full retirement age and age 70, according to the Social Security Administration. People under full retirement age do not have this option.
 Do you wish you never started collecting benefits? There's also the option of paying it all back and restarting the clock. But this gets complicated. You will probably have to pay back more than what you actually received each month, since Medicare premiums and income taxes may have been deducted. Some planners discourage married people from pursuing this strategy -- which amounts to a free loan from Social Security -- because if the higher-earning spouse dies early, the surviving spouse doesn't have the option to pay the money back in exchange for higher benefits. (There's also the possibility that this option could go away in the future, experts said). 
 KNOWING THE RULES
 Q.In your article on Saturday, you refer to ''file and suspend'' for the higher earner in a married couple to bump up the lower earner spouse to the spouse benefit. I called Social Security, and they say this is wrong. The higher earner must be collecting (continuously) for the spouse to get the spouse benefit (as long as the higher earner is still alive). 
 -- Phil Bessler, Berea, Ohio
 A. You're not the first person to be told that this can't be done. Some of the people who work in Social Security offices are unaware of some of the more complex filing strategies that are completely and 100 percent legal. (Honestly, I can't blame them -- I'm not sure that any one person can be well versed in the thousands of byzantine rules that govern Social Security.)
 These strategies include paying your benefits back and restarting the clock at a later date, or filing and suspending your benefits so that your spouse can claim benefits while you wait to collect higher benefits later, Also, married individuals who claim a spousal benefit at full retirement age can switch to their own benefits at a later date (again, by waiting, their benefits continue to accrue to a higher amount). 
 So what's a retiree to do? ''If you are doing anything other than plain-vanilla filing, we highly recommend walking into your Social Security office, and ask to talk with the technical expert,'' said Lesley J. Brey, a financial planner who also teaches members of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors about the ins and outs of Social Security. 
 DIVORCE
 Q.I didn't see in all the discussion of spousal benefits the impact of divorce. It is my understanding that if a couple has been married 10 years or more, the first (usually) wife will receive (the former husband's) Social Security benefits. I wish that you had said something about this in the article, given the high divorce rate these days, and the fact that so many people remarry, and then live to a ripe old age. 
 -- Anita Robertson, Blackstone, Mass.
 A. That's right. If you are divorced but were married for at least 10 years, you can collect retirement benefits on your former spouse's record -- as long as you're at least 62 and your former spouse is entitled to or receiving benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. But if you remarry, you generally can't collect benefits unless your second marriage ends (death, divorce and annulments all count). 
 If your former spouse dies, you can still receive survivor's benefits (as long as you were married for a decade or more). This won't affect any benefits paid to other survivors -- as long as you're 60 or older -- so you won't have to worry about angering a new spouse. But things can get sticky if you have a child. If you're the surviving divorced parent who has the former spouse's child (under age 16 or disabled) in your care, your benefits will affect the benefits of others on the spouse's record. 
 Thinking of remarriage? It may pay to wait, because survivor benefits are affected. If you remarry after age 60 (50 if you're disabled), you can still collect on your former spouse's record. Once you are 62, you can get benefits on your new spouse's record if they are higher. (Remarriage doesn't affect any benefits being paid to your children), according to the Social Security Administration.
 BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN
 Q.There is one other element regarding collecting Social Security that came as a great surprise to me. My daughter is a teenager, still in high school, and I discovered that if I started taking Social Security at age 62, she would get a substantial check every month, too! And her check is based on what I would have gotten at full retirement age. The checks continue until she graduates or turns 19, if still in school. With so many ''older dads'' like myself, this little known benefit probably affects more people than in the past. And for us, it certainly changes the dollar equation as to when to start receiving benefits.
 -- Allan, Santa Cruz, Calif.
 A. Great point, Allan. Some children are entitled to benefits as long they meet certain conditions. The parent must be disabled or retired and entitled to Social Security benefits, or the parent must have died after working long enough to qualify for Social Security benefits. The child must be unmarried, under the age of 18 (or under 19 if a full-time student in grade 12 or under). Children 18 or older and disabled are also entitled to benefits (as long as the disability began before age 22). You can find more details on the Social Security Web site. 
 SAME-SEX COUPLES
 Q. Your article made it sound as if there are only two groups of people: married and single. In fact, there are others: married couples whose marriage is ignored by the federal government and those who are not allowed to get married at all. Perhaps you could write about the potentially devastating economic effect that lack of federal recognition can have on same-sex couples?
 -- Robyn Ochs
 A. Same-sex married couples are definitely at a disadvantage. They have even more issues to wrestle with since they are viewed as perfect strangers in the eyes of the federal government. The same goes for couples who have had civil union ceremonies or are legal domestic partners.
 That means they aren't entitled to spousal benefits, which has many implications. For instance, if the lower-earning spouse stays home to raise the children, he can claim benefits only on his own earning record, if he has one. He won't be able to claim his partner's higher benefits as a spousal benefit. Nor can he collect survivor or disability benefits.
 Other than saving more, which is always a good idea but typically hard to do, couples can purchase a term life insurance policy. ''If the couple has time to save and can afford it, my own preference is to manage the lifetime mortality risk through cheap term and beef up the savings,'' said Peter Berkery, author of two books on financial planning for same-sex couples. ''There's every chance that, by the time a long-term couple hits retirement, the Social Security survivor benefit may be 'gravy.' ''
 But if you need your partner's Social Security benefits for living expenses, Debra Neiman, a financial planner in Arlington, Mass., recommends purchasing life insurance to replace the income you stand to lose if your partner dies. So you would essentially figure out how much you need per year and multiply that by the number of years you want that protection (this is hard, though, since nobody knows precisely how long they'll need protection).
 So if you expect you'll need to replace $12,000 a year for 20 years, you would buy a term policy worth about $240,000. ''This neglects inflation and is a simple illustration,'' Ms. Neiman said. And ''each couple needs to take their medical history and family longevity into account in order to come to the right decision.''
 Of course, you need to run the numbers to see if this makes financial sense for you. Term insurance is significantly more expensive later in life. For example, a $250,000 policy with a 25-year term would cost a 62-year-old woman about $1,870 a year, while a man would pay about $2,740 annually, according to AccuQuote. (These quotes are for healthy nonsmokers.) A $500,000 policy with a 25-year term would cost about $3,400 a year for a 62-year-old woman and $5,045 for a man.

HEADLINE: Card Fees Pit Retailers Against Banks

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
The most profitable item at Patricia Orzano's 7-Eleven store on Long Island is coffee. Slurpees are a distant second.
 But as more customers use plastic to pay for even small purchases like these, she has watched a growing share of her revenue vanish in a stream of credit and debit card fees that retailers say raise the price of goods and sharply lift the cost of doing business.
 Merchants across the nation, from powerhouses like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, to gas stations, mom-and-pop restaurants and 7-Eleven, have spent years unsuccessfully fighting the biggest of these costs, known as an interchange fee, which generates an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion in income annually for banks that issue credit cards.
 But after Congress passed a law last month to protect consumers from excessive fees and interest on credit cards, merchants are mounting a fresh offensive. 
 This time, they believe the momentum in Washington has turned in their favor. Legislation is winding its way through Congress, a government audit has been ordered and petitions are surfacing in hundreds of convenience stores, including Ms. Orzano's 7-Eleven, encouraging customers to voice their opposition to the fees. ''Congress sort of already illustrated the willingness to take on the credit card companies and the big banks,'' said Keith Jones, a lobbyist for 7-Eleven. ''We just feel like the job is half done.''
 And while large and small banks often clash on political agendas, they have formed a united front, joined by payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, to prepare for a furious battle on Capitol Hill. With profit from credit cards likely to diminish because of the new laws, they are determined not to absorb another major hit.
 ''It's a big deal to them, and they would be fully engaged in it,'' said Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president for card policy at the American Bankers Association. 
 Every time a consumer uses plastic, about 2 percent to 3 percent of the charge goes to banks and payment networks, which price the fee differently in different countries. Of that, the interchange fee is paid to the cardholder's bank, and at roughly 1.8 percent of each purchase in the United States, according to June report by J.P. Morgan, it is the largest and most controversial of these costs.
 But retailers may have a tough time convincing Congress that consumers would benefit if the effective interchange rate, which has increased slightly in recent years, is dialed back. Many other countries, including Israel and Australia, have required banks that issue cards to reduce the fee. Yet there is little evidence that the savings were passed along.
 In Australia, where regulators required banks to cut the interchange rate for Visa and MasterCard purchases to 0.5 percent from 0.95 percent, the banks offset their loss by reducing rewards programs and raising annual fees, according to a 2008 report by the Government Accountability Office.
 A similar outcome could happen here, banks and card companies say. In response to 7-Eleven's petition drive, MasterCard said the convenience store chain was really asking its customers ''to claim that they want to pay more for their payment cards so 7-Eleven can increase its profits.'' 
 Bill Sheedy, Visa's president for North America, added: ''We really don't think the legislation is going to move forward.''
 Banks say they incur substantial risk when offering credit cards, and must make enough of a return to continue to extend credit. Reducing interchange fees would cut profit at both the largest and smallest financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions, Mr. Clayton said. 
 Of $100 charged to a Visa card, the merchant's bank receives about $2.25, according to a hypothetical example used by J.P. Morgan in a June report. The bank forwards about $1.80 -- the interchange fee -- to the cardholder's bank. Both banks pay a fee to Visa, 10 cents apiece. The merchant's bank then pays another nickel to a third-party processor and keeps the remaining 30 cents.
 While the fee for each purchase is small, combined credit and debit card payments at merchants have almost tripled over the last decade, to more than 58 billion swipes last year from about 20.7 billion in 1999, according to data compiled by the Nilson Report, a journal on the payment industry. 
 Merchants say that makes their aggregate expense from the fees enormous -- and there is no leverage to ratchet it down. ''You've got to accept the card and pay whatever price the credit card companies want to charge, and by the way, they won't talk to us about it,'' said Mr. Jones, the lobbyist for 7-Eleven. 
 At Target, for example, interchange fees represent the second-largest store-level expense, behind payroll. The costs are similarly eye-popping at Home Depot, where officials say they top the price of health care insurance for employees. ''The amount of money we're spending on interchange would put 10 associates in each of our stores,'' Dwaine Kimmet, vice president of financial services for Home Depot, said at a recent conference on credit card fees. 
 Even some government agencies have not been able to negotiate lower fees. According to a recent G.A.O. report, federal agencies paid out more than $200 million in interchange fees in 2007, the most recent year for which data was available. 
 Some retailers simply refuse to accept certain credit cards. Costco, the nation's largest membership warehouse chain, negotiated a lower interchange rate with American Express and does not take Visa and MasterCard in its stores. 
 And last month, United Airlines began to force a small number of travel agencies to absorb credit card fees of 2 percent to 3 percent for ticket bookings, a trend that agents fear may distort ticket economics if other large carriers follow suit. United is not passing the fee on to consumers who book directly with the carrier. 
 Merchants say the cost may have been justified when credit card transactions were largely done with paper, making processing far more cumbersome. But with bigger volumes and new efficiencies from technology, they argue, interchange fees are simply a cash cow for card companies that wind up lifting the costs of all goods. The credit card industry says retailers' costs have surged simply because consumers are using plastic for purchases they would never have dreamed of a decade ago, like a cup of coffee or a Slurpee.
 Of course, the surge in transaction volume has been a boon for credit card companies: Visa's stock price is around $60, and MasterCard's is around $165. While they are down from highs hit just before the financial crisis, they are still well above the share price of card-issuing banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. 
 Still, while legislation on interchange fees would not have stood a chance a few years ago when the economy was buoyant and banks were not under the political spotlight, the winds on Capitol Hill have shifted as public anger at banks -- and credit card companies -- has grown. 
 ''The target is still painted bright red on the forehead of every credit card issuer,'' said Robert Hammer, a credit-card industry consultant. ''It is a brutal, brutal year.''
 At a 7-Eleven in a blue-collar neighborhood in St. Louis, the owner, Mike Foster, is hoping the petition in his store will help convince Congress to approve curbs on interchange fees. He said he can make adjustments to curb other expenses in his store, but he cannot do anything to change interchange fees, which cost as much as much as $1,600 a month.
 ''It keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger,'' he said. ''And I got zero control over it.''

HEADLINE: Sotomayor on the Issues

 BODY:
Following are some of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's statements in her confirmation hearings this week on major legal issues that are likely to confront her if she is confirmed for the Supreme Court:
 DEATH PENALTY 
 ''The issue for me with respect to the death penalty is that the Supreme Court, since Gregg, has determined that the death penalty is constitutional under certain situations. I have rejected challenges to the federal law and its application in the one case I handled as a District Court judge, but it's a reflection of what my views are on the law.''
 GUNS 
 ''The Supreme Court did hold that there is in the Second Amendment an individual right to bear arms. And that is its holding, and that is the court's decision. I fully accept that.''
 ABORTION
 ''The court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the core holding of Roe. That is the precedent of the court and settled in terms of the holding of the court.'' A constitutional requirement for a health exception to abortion restrictions ''has been a part of the court's jurisprudence and a part of its precedents. Those precedents must be given deference in any situation that arises before the court.''
 FOREIGN LAW
 ''American law does not permit the use of foreign law or international law to interpret the Constitution. That's a given, and my speech explained that, as you noted, explicitly. There is no debate on that question. There's no issue about that question. ... The question of use of foreign law, then, is different than considering the ideas that it may, on an academic level, provide.''
 PROPERTY RIGHTS
 The Kelo v. New London case, in which the Supreme Court decided that the government can take property for private development rather than a traditional public use like schools and roads ''is now a precedent of the court. I must follow it. I am bound by a circuit -- a Supreme Court decision, as a Second Circuit judge. As a Supreme Court judge, I must give it the deference that the doctrine of stare decisis would suggest. The question of the reach of Kelo has to be examined in the context of each situation. And the court did in Kelo note that there was a role for the courts to play in ensuring that takings by a state did in fact intend to serve the public -- a public purpose and public use.''
 EXECUTIVE POWER
 ''In all of the situations, once you've looked at what Congress has done or not done, you then are directed to look at what the president's powers may be under the Constitution minus whatever powers Congress has in that area. So the whole exercise is really, in terms of Congress and the executive, an exercise of the two working together. And in fact, that's the basic structure of our system of government. That's why the Congress makes the laws; the president can veto them, but he can't make them.''
 POWER OF CONGRESS TO REGULATE
 In United States v. Lopez, ''and in some of its subsequent cases, the court was examining, as I mentioned, a wide variety of factors. They included whether the activity that the government was attempting to regulate was economic or non-economic; whether it was an area in which states traditionally regulated; whether the statute at issue had an interstate commerce provision as an element of the crime; and then considered whether there was a substantial effect on commerce. It looked at the Congressional findings on that last element, the court did, and determined that there weren't enough in the confluence of factors that it was looking at to find that that particular statute was within Congress's powers. That's the basic approach it has used to other statutes it has looked at.''
 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
 ''The question of whether affirmative action is necessary in our society or not and what form it should take is always first a legislative determination in terms of legislative or government employer determination, in terms of what issue it is addressing and what remedy it is looking to structure. The Constitution promotes and requires the equal protection of law of all citizens in its 14th Amendment. To ensure that protection, there are situations in which race in some form must be considered. The courts have recognized that. Equality requires effort, and so there are some situations in which some form of race has been recognized by the court. It is firmly my hope, as it was expressed by Justice O'Connor in her decision involving the University of Michigan Law School admissions criteria, that in 25 years race in our society won't be needed to be considered in any situation. That's the hope.''

HEADLINE: CIT's Future in Doubt After Aid Request Is Denied

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and ERIC DASH; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting

 BODY:
The survival of one of the nation's largest commercial lenders, the CIT Group, was thrown into doubt late Wednesday after federal officials rebuffed pleas to rescue the struggling company a second time. 
 Unless a buyer emerges for CIT -- a prospect that seems unlikely -- the century-old lender could founder, even after it received a $2.33 billion taxpayer-financed bailout in December. 
 The plight of CIT, which provides loans to about a million small and midsize companies, particularly in the sagging retail sector, poses a crucial test of the Obama administration's attempts to stabilize the nation's financial industry. 
 The company's failure would draw a stark dividing line through the new financial landscape. On one side would be banks that the government deems too big to fail. On the other would be the smaller institutions regarded as too troubled to save. CIT's collapse appeared to have stemmed in part from a disagreement among regulators over whether the government should provide aid.
 While CIT would be the largest American bank to fail since Lehman Brothers collapsed last fall, the company is relatively small, and few analysts say its failure would threaten the broader financial system. Nonetheless, given CIT's historical role in financing smaller businesses, President Obama was briefed on its status Wednesday morning. 
 ''Even though it was a large company, it was 'small enough to fail,' '' said David Hendler, a research analyst at CreditSights. He said the Treasury Department's message was clear: firms not vital to the inner workings of the financial system ''will probably be shut out'' of the government's rescue efforts.
 ''We have a comprehensive and aggressive strategy to restore stability to the financial system,'' the Treasury said in a statement. ''Even during periods of financial stress, we believe that there is a very high threshold for exceptional government assistance to individual companies.''
 For weeks, CIT faced the looming threat that its auditors would send out a ''going concern'' opinion casting doubts about its sources of funding. Executives had held out hope that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would grant it some relief by letting it access its debt guarantee program. But F.D.I.C. officials believed CIT's problems were too severe and turned it down. 
 Pressure began building again for officials to reconsider their stance after news of CIT's dire condition seeped out in the last week. Some of CIT's customers began drawing on their credit lines, putting even more pressure on the troubled company in what amounted to a bank run. 
 CIT executives held a series of long meetings with federal officials in the last few days. None of the federal officials believed it posed a threat to the financial system, according to people who had been briefed on the situation and spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Still, there was intense debate over whether CIT should be saved, they said. 
 On one hand, CIT had been granted an emergency bank charter and the bailout funds late last year. Some Treasury officials, in particular, feared the political fallout of losing that taxpayer money. 
 On the other hand, CIT's troubles stemmed from venturing into risky corporate and consumer lending and heavy reliance on fickle investors for funds. If CIT's business model was not viable, F.D.I.C. officials worried about the additional cost to its banking industry-supported fund. 
 As recently as last weekend, administration officials began drawing up plans for a new rescue effort, according to those people briefed on the situation. One option was to find a way for the F.D.I.C. to grant CIT access to its debt guarantee program, but the F.D.I.C. refused to budge. Another option was to allow CIT to move $10 billion worth of assets into its bank, financing them with expensive brokered deposits. But the F.D.I.C. would go along only if CIT would raise a significant amount of capital -- a nearly impossible task. 
 Going into a board meeting on Wednesday afternoon, the company's management expected to reach a deal, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. But federal officials failed to reach agreement on a plan, and a government official informed CIT that there would be no second rescue, this person said.
 Shortly afterward, CIT issued a terse statement saying there was ''no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term.'' It added that its board and management were continuing to evaluate the firm's options.
 While the company received inquiries from several investment firms, CIT's management does not expect to reach a deal, the person with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Hendler projected that CIT might require at least $6 billion of additional capital, an amount difficult to raise in this environment.
 What is unclear is how big the ripples from a CIT bankruptcy would be. ''I'm not saying there aren't going to be individual borrowers that aren't going to be affected, but I don't think there's going to be a systemic issue,'' Kathleen Shanley, a debt analyst at Gimme Credit, said. Many of CIT's customers who simply borrowed money from the company would be largely unaffected.
 Others warned of grave dangers to businesses, including thousands of retailers. ''That cannot be allowed to happen at a time when retailers are already struggling to survive the national recession,'' wrote Tracy Mullin, the chief executive of the National Retail Federation, an industry group.

HEADLINE: California's Budget Crisis and the Parks

 BODY:
Nearly every day, there is another reminder of just how deep California's $26 billion deficit cuts into the operations of the state. It ripples through schools, cities, highway departments, state agencies -- everything that makes California function. 
 None of the cuts are welcome, and some do less for the budgetary bottom line than they seem to. One example is Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposal to close 220 state parks in order to save an estimated $213 million over nearly two years -- or about $6 per Californian. 
 There are no easy trade-offs in this crisis. But it is worth pointing out that state parks -- about 80 percent of which would close under the governor's plan -- provide low-cost recreation at a time when low-cost recreation is at a premium. Closing them means no water, no electricity, no public access and -- because rangers would be laid off -- no policing of what would become vacant lands. 
 State parks exist not only to offer recreation but also to protect natural resources. That protection would essentially vanish. It's also worth considering the additional cost, in a better economic climate, of reopening the parks after nearly two years with no maintenance.
 Six of the parks were created under a program that gave federal land to the state on the condition that they remain open for park and recreational use. If the state proceeds as planned, there is a good chance that these parks -- including Angel Island and Point Mugu -- would revert to federal ownership. The National Park Service has also proposed something like joint operating custody of these parks until the crisis ends. Either way, these six parks would face a better fate than the state parks that Mr. Schwarzenegger suggests closing. 
 Democratic legislators have been resisting Mr. Schwarzenegger's plan. But it is going to take more than that to keep these parks open. It will take a broad public effort -- including private fund-raising and possibly new fees and taxes. The payoff is keeping the state's natural patrimony intact and available to everyone.

HEADLINE: Rio Tinto Gave Bribes To Many, China Says

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Chen Yang contributed research.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China stepped up its campaign against the Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto on Wednesday, saying the company had bribed virtually every one of China's big steel makers.
 The sweeping allegation, published on the front page of China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, further inflamed a case that has rocked the country's steel industry, strained relations between China and Australia and worried multinational companies doing business here. 
 The case began more than a week ago, when Chinese authorities detained four Rio Tinto employees, including an Australian national, on suspicion of espionage, stealing state secrets and harming the nation's economic interests and security. 
 On Wednesday, high-level officials of both the Australian and United States governments expressed concern. Gary Locke, the United States secretary of commerce, who is visiting Beijing this week, told CNN that he would raise the case directly with top Chinese leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. 
 In its report, China Daily, which regularly publishes the government's official version of events, said Rio Tinto employees bribed executives from 16 Chinese steel companies, all members of the China Iron and Steel Association, to get access to confidential industry data. The paper attributed the allegation to an unidentified ''industry insider'' and did not identify the 16 companies.
 A Chinese government-controlled Web site said last week that Rio Tinto employees had bribed Chinese steel executives to gain access to government documents that could have given Rio Tinto an edge in its annual iron ore negotiations with China's state-owned steel mills.
 But Wednesday's report is the first time a government publication has alleged that many of the country's biggest steel companies may be involved.
 Rio Tinto has expressed shock at the allegations and said that the company has strict ethics policies that forbid bribery. On Wednesday, a company spokesman declined further comment.
 Several Australian officials have criticized the detention of the Rio Tinto employees and suggested that Beijing is retaliating against Rio Tinto for calling off a $19.5 billion deal last month that would have given a Chinese state-owned company called Chinalco a large stake in the mining giant.
 On Wednesday, the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, warned China to tread carefully in handling the case, suggesting that it could affect international public opinion and foreign investment in China.
 ''A range of foreign governments and corporations will be watching this case with interest and will be watching it very closely,'' Mr. Rudd told reporters on Wednesday, according to Reuters. ''And they will be drawing their own conclusions as to how it is conducted.''
 Mr. Locke, in a CNN interview, said that American companies operating in China were concerned about transparency and fairness in the Rio Tinto case.
 Yao Jian, a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry, responded to concerns on Wednesday, saying the Rio Tinto case would not affect China's investment environment. The government has said it is an isolated case of espionage that seriously harmed the country's economic security and interests.
 Despite the China Daily report, several large Chinese steel companies, including Baosteel, denied on Wednesday that they were under investigation in the Rio Tinto case.
 ''Baosteel has no executive cooperating with the government investigation or being investigated,'' said Meng Haibiao, a company spokesman.
 Jinan Steel, another big steel producer, called the China Daily report ''fake news,'' insisting that no executive at the company was under investigation.
 But at Laiwu Iron and Steel, a spokesman who gave his name only as Mr. Liu, said a company shipping executive was cooperating with the Rio Tinto investigation.
 In the past week, China has questioned or detained at least 10 steel executives, including shipping agents, traders and members of the China Iron and Steel Association, according to the state-run news media and interviews with industry officials.
 An executive at Shougang Steel, a big steel maker, was detained in the case last week.
 Although Beijing says the Rio Tinto case involves state secrets, that has not stopped state-run newspapers from printing details about it. Many of the articles have also described rampant corruption in the trading of iron ore.
 More than a dozen industry officials, steel analysts and traders interviewed this week also said that China's iron ore trade was plagued by corruption.
 Experts blame China's two-tiered system for purchasing iron ore for the corruption. While big steel mills are allowed to negotiate long-term fixed price contracts, most small and medium-size steel mills are supposed to buy from the spot market, the more volatile open market.
 The system, analysts say, has created huge arbitrage opportunities, allowing big steel mills with fixed contracts to buy far more supplies than they need and then profitably sell excess supplies to smaller mills on the black market.
 ''There's a huge underground arbitrage market in China,'' said Ren Qiang, general manager at the Zibo Antai Import and Export Company, which deals in the iron ore trade.
 Small mills have long complained about what they see as an unfair system. The practice violates industry regulations, as well as the fixed contract agreements signed with Rio Tinto and other mining companies, analysts say.
 The government has repeatedly warned against this type of speculative trading, most recently in a regulation released in February.
 But regulators rarely enforced the rules in 2007 and early 2008, when iron ore prices were skyrocketing, experts say.
 Analysts say the two-tier system may have even created friction between big ore producing companies, like Rio Tinto, and the government-controlled China Iron and Steel Association, which represents large steel mills in annual fixed contract negotiations.
 By locking in low fixed contract prices, analysts say, association members could trade or sell iron ore on the black market.
 But in recent years, the world's big iron ore producers, like Rio Tinto, have battled with the association over pricing. 
 The two sides failed to reach an agreement last month on prices for this year's contracts. One of the lead negotiators for Rio Tinto was Stern Hu, an Australian national who was one of the four Rio Tinto employees detained on July 5.

HEADLINE: A Panel Is Named to Examine Causes of the Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats announced on Wednesday that Phil Angelides, a former California treasurer, would lead a commission to examine the causes of the financial crisis.
 The vice chairman of the panel, which has 10 members, will be Bill Thomas, the former Republican representative from California who led the Ways and Means Committee, who was selected by Republican leaders. 
 Other Democratic-appointed members of the committee include Brooksley Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Bill Clinton; Bob Graham, a former Democratic senator from Florida; Heather Murren, a retired managing director at Merrill Lynch; Byron Georgiou, a Las Vegas businessman; and John W. Thompson, chairman of Symantec. 
 The other members of the committee appointed by Republicans are Keith Hennessey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush; Peter J. Wallison, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute; and Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, a former top adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain.
 The commission was created by Congress to investigate the roots of the crisis. Lawmakers gave the commission a broad mandate, as well as subpoena power, to look at issues like the role of exotic financial instruments and credit rating agencies, compensation, and the failure of regulators to manage risky lending at banks.
 Lawmakers who created the commission said it was modeled on the commission that had examined the intelligence and law enforcement lapses leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 They also said they hoped the Angelides commission would play a role similar to the one played by the Pecora commission in the 1930s. The work of that commission, named for Ferdinand Pecora, the investigative counsel for a Senate committee during the Great Depression, contributed to the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and provisions in the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment and commercial banks.
 The commission's deliberations over the coming months could influence efforts by lawmakers to overhaul the financial regulatory system. Senior White House officials and some lawmakers have said they hoped legislation would be completed by the end of this year, although many lawmakers expect it is likely to slide into 2010, particularly because many of the same senators working on the regulatory measures are also heavily involved in trying to create health care legislation.
 The commission is supposed to issue a final report at the end of next year.
 Mr. Angelides was elected to serve as treasurer of California from 1999 until 2007. He advocated greater investment in socially and environmentally conscious businesses and was an unsuccessful candidate for California governor in 2006. Mr. Angelides was selected to the panel by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. Mr. Thomas left Congress in 2007 after 28 years in the House that culminated in his selection as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in 2001.

HEADLINE: For Clinton, '09 Campaign Is for Her Turf

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped back to center stage here on Wednesday to present an ambitious blueprint for America's role in the world, the State Department billed it as a major foreign policy address.
 But with its muscular tone and sweeping scope, it was also an effort to recapture the limelight after a period in which Mrs. Clinton has nursed both a broken elbow and the perception that the State Department has lost influence to an assertive White House.
 Declaring that ''no nation can meet the world's challenges alone,'' Mrs. Clinton said the United States was pursuing multifront diplomacy with a host of countries and other players, even adversaries like Iran. She condemned Tehran for cracking down on postelection protests, saying its actions were ''deplorable and unacceptable.'' 
 With a few exceptions -- during the presidential primary campaign, she had derided the idea of engaging Iran -- the speech sounded like one Mrs. Clinton might have given as a candidate, when she sought to make her foreign policy credentials a trump card over the rival who is now her boss. 
 She even marshaled a cheering section of special envoys and other senior American diplomats in the first few rows at the Council on Foreign Relations. Faced with a White House that has tended to centralize control over policy, Mrs. Clinton is defending her prerogatives as an influential, but loyal, member of the president's team. 
 In recent weeks, the administration's top Iran policy maker was reassigned from the State Department to the White House's National Security Council; Mrs. Clinton's candidate to lead the United States Agency for International Development has been tangled up in a vetting process; and she has failed to get her choices into some plum ambassadorships, notably Japan, which went to a fund-raiser for President Obama. 
 Also, the White House recently scuttled Mrs. Clinton's effort to bring Sidney Blumenthal, a journalist and confidant of both her and former President Bill Clinton, into the State Department. 
 The injury to Mrs. Clinton's elbow -- she fractured it in a fall last month, and it is being held together with pins and wire -- has compounded the challenge. Her recuperation from surgery sharply curtailed her schedule, forcing her to cancel two overseas trips, including one to Russia with Mr. Obama. 
 Though she departs Thursday for India and Thailand, she is in constant pain and faces grueling physical therapy five times a day, according to people close to her. Among the exercises: repetitively squeezing a gelatinous ball. 
 Still, her aides and people at the White House dismiss suggestions that Mrs. Clinton has been shunted to the sidelines. Her relationship with Mr. Obama is strong, they say, and she remains an influential voice in all key debates. 
 The recent personnel issues are part of the pull and tug of any administration in its early days, they argue, and say little about Mrs. Clinton's broader role.
 ''Secretary Clinton is a key member of a very strong team,'' said Denis R. McDonough, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ''The president values her inputs, her team's inputs.''
 Mrs. Clinton is said by her aides to brush off the scuttlebutt about her low profile. They note that she kept her head down early in her Senate career, too. 
 She professes to be amused, if baffled, by a recent column on the blog Daily Beast in which Tina Brown wrote, ''It's time for Barack Obama to let Hillary Clinton take off her burqa.''
 Other foreign affairs experts say the doubts about Mrs. Clinton's role reflect an unrealistic view of the job of secretary of state, particularly in an era when the White House usually drives foreign policy. 
 ''There's a reflex assumption on the part of a lot of people that the secretary of state is going to be out there, on every conceivable issue,'' said Strobe Talbott, a deputy secretary of state under President Clinton. 
 ''But to do that on every conceivable issue is way too much, particularly when we have so many issues,'' said Mr. Talbott, who is now president of the Brookings Institution and once wrote about sidelined secretaries of state, in the Nixon and Carter administrations, for Time magazine.
 Mrs. Clinton has told colleagues about a recent phone conversation with Henry A. Kissinger, a secretary of state who was not sidelined, in which he told her he could not recall a time when there appeared to be less friction between the State Department and the White House. Mr. Kissinger confirmed the account.
 At the same time, however, the White House has exercised a tight grip on critical foreign policy issues, particularly Iran. 
 A few weeks ago, a senior administration official said, Mr. Obama telephoned Mrs. Clinton to inform her he was moving the State Department's top Iran adviser, Dennis B. Ross, to a job in the White House.
 Mr. Ross will offer advice on a range of issues, from the Middle East to Afghanistan. That, some officials said, could cause him to rub up against George J. Mitchell, the special envoy for the Middle East, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who report to both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.
 A senior State Department official said Mrs. Clinton had supported Mr. Ross's move because she and Mr. Obama agreed that the National Security Council needed more ''strategic heft.'' 
 Mr. Obama, officials said, was frustrated by his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, when he met with King Abdullah and failed to extract any meaningful gestures toward Israel to revive the peace process, though other officials denied that had prompted Mr. Ross's reassignment. 
 The White House has also asserted its privilege in naming ambassadors, passing over Mrs. Clinton's preferred candidate for Japan -- Joseph S. Nye Jr., a Harvard expert on foreign policy -- in favor of John V. Roos, a Silicon Valley lawyer who is close to Mr. Obama. Aides to Mrs. Clinton said she accepted such decisions with equanimity. But she has been vocal in her frustration about the way White House vetting requirements have delayed the nomination of a new director of the Agency for International Development. 
 On Wednesday, she said, ''It's hard to justify not having our full government in place six months after we started.''
 Still, Mrs. Clinton was careful not to allow any daylight to fall between her and Mr. Obama. She mentioned him eight times in her 34-minute speech and faithfully restated his strategy of diplomatic engagement. ''We have the right strategy, the right priorities, the right policies,'' Mrs. Clinton said, then adding, ''the right president.''

HEADLINE: A Texas-Size Stadium

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex. 

 BODY:
Jerry Jones, tour guide, was showing off.
 Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, gestured as he drove his Lincoln Town Car around his billion-dollar stadium with the sloping glass exterior that reflects the colors of the sky, his team and his eyes. 
 He pointed out the views of the field and the gargantuan, 72-by-160-foot dual video screens fans will discover as they approach the gates. He explained how the retractable glass end zone doors were designed to slide away and -- in mere minutes -- allow in the Texas air.
 Lost in the excitement of the show and tell, Jones trampled a couple of traffic cones and nearly flattened two fans walking to the $15-per-person stadium tour. He didn't seem to notice.
 ''I could have built this for $850 million,'' he said. ''And it would have been a fabulous place to play football. But this was such an opportunity for the 'wow factor.' '' 
 He wants his stadium to shout media and scream that the future of watching football is in his building. The video screens, nestled between the 20-yard lines, tower above the field and will carry the Cowboys' own game feed from eight live cameras.
 ''That's why I spent the money,'' Jones, 66, said. ''It has a chance to be one of the most visible buildings in this country.'' 
 At three million square feet, the stadium designed by Bryan Trubey of Dallas-based HKS Architects is three times as large as the Cowboys' old home, Texas Stadium, in nearby Irving, and twice the size of the new Yankee Stadium. With a price tag of $1.12 billion, it is the N.F.L.'s priciest building -- but will be eclipsed next year by the $1.6 billion Jets-Giants stadium.
 Cowboys Stadium benefited from lower labor and material costs compared with those in the New York area.
 For their first regular-season game at the stadium, on Sept. 20 against the Giants, Jones expects a crowd of 100,000, among them thousands who will pay $29 to stand on platforms and staircases above the end zones.
 ''It's a great view there,'' he said. Actual seats start at $59 a ticket and top off at $340 a game.
 The Cowboys, the most valuable team in sports last year at $1.6 billion, according to Forbes, are opening their stadium during a severe recession, as the Yankees and the Mets did in April. The downturn has kept Jones from selling naming rights, but with his stadium debt whittled from $350 million to $200 million, he said he did not need the cash.
 He said repeatedly during a lengthy interview that he was sensitive to his fans' economic woes -- although he has not cut prices. He said he was also sensitive to criticism that Arlington had better ways to spend its $325 million contribution from tax increases than to guarantee that Jones, a rich oilman, could get richer with more revenue from the new stadium.
 ''The mayor sold out and the council went right along,'' said James Runzheimer, a local lawyer who opposed the tax increase passed in November 2004 during better economic days. ''We don't provide basic infrastructure, yet we subsidize a team.''
 Jones says Cowboys Stadium will be its own stimulus package that will help ''the country and this world'' dig out of the recession. Meanwhile, most studies show little economic impact from new stadiums.
 Jones's pursuit of a new Cowboys home with Dallas (which spurned him) and Irving continued the tradition of team owners romancing cities in search of the best deal.
 ''As far back as 15 years ago,'' he said, ''I'd go to the floor of the Texas Legislature and I'd say: 'You're not creating a subsidy to build a stadium, you're priming the pump for people intoxicated with being involved in sports. Use them to prime the pump with private dollars, because invariably, they'll spend more than you'd ever imagine.' ''
 Arlington also bought in by using its power of eminent domain to clear the land of residential and commercial property.
 ''The landowners came out really well on eminent domain,'' Jones said.
 But only after some hired lawyers to get more, he was reminded.
 ''That's correct,'' he said.
 Mayor Robert Cluck added, ''The public's mind has changed from, 'We probably shouldn't have done that,' to now we hardly hear negative words.''
 But Glenn Sodd, who represented property owners in legal challenges to the city's offers for their land, said the condemnation issue still resonates. ''It's a misuse of the Texas Constitution and the U.S. Constitution,'' he said. ''To say we in this community need this stadium is a gross mischaracterization. We might desire it. We might wish to have it. But no one's condemning land to build grocery stores.''
 But he said: ''I don't blame Jones. He's in business to make money.''
 Jones said he expected team revenue to rise at least 50 percent this season, but declined to be more specific. The franchise will also profit from renting out the stadium for other events -- including concerts, religious conferences, next year's N.B.A. All-Star Game and the 2014 N.C.A.A. Final Four.
 He said he has sold 290 of his 315 luxury suites for $100,000 to $500,000 each but only about two-thirds of his 15,000 club seats, which license for $16,000 to $150,000 apiece. That is largely how the debt was reduced. (The licenses do not include the cost of tickets.)
 Sitting in a luxury box at the 50-yard line, he asked for a sales update from Chad Estis, the team's vice president for sales and marketing. ''How many licenses are we sellin'?''
 ''O.K., O.K.,'' he said into a cellphone. ''A total of 165.'' He listened. ''So that was for the week. Add that up, you've got 12 weeks, 12 weeks times 165, I don't know if you expect a spike as we get down to selling into the season.''
 What he is selling is a long tradition of winning, Hall of Fame alumni, a championship aura and a chance to lease a piece of greatness.
 Although the unsold club seats are in prime spots, Jones said he would tolerate the sight of scattered empty seats without hiring seat-fillers. But he vows there will be no splotches of unfilled seats similar to those infesting baseball stadiums this year. 
 He is his own lead salesman and a sugary one at that. As he walked through the plush Owner's Club, he approached a couple considering a suite.
 ''Hello, Sherri,'' he said, drawing out the first syllable of her name. ''Well, hello, Mike.'' The Maucelis, of Dallas, praised the design of the stadium.
 ''But having been in your house,'' Sherri Mauceli said, ''I'm not surprised.''
 Jones said, ''If you're going to do it, get it right.'' He talked about the marble floors picked out by his wife, Gene, and the stadium's contemporary art works -- like the one by Olafur Eliasson titled ''Fat Superstar'' that cast a colorful, geometric pattern nearby.
 Although Jones can wax on about how art connects to tackling, he was here to seal the deal. ''It's more than a seat where you just watch a game,'' he told the couple. ''It's the opportunity to have a piece of the past and all that will take place in the next 30 years of its future.''

HEADLINE: City Jobless Rate Reaches 9.5 Percent, Matching National Figure

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Throughout the recession, New York City has appeared to be holding up better than the rest of the country. But by one important measure -- the official unemployment rate -- that is no longer true.
 In June, the city's unemployment rate jumped to 9.5 percent, matching the national rate and suggesting that the city's economy is still weakening a year and a half after the national recession began. The rate of joblessness in the city had not been as high in almost 12 years. 
 In May, it was 8.9 percent, significantly lower than the national rate of 9.4 percent for that month. 
 More than 380,000 people in the city were unable to find work last month, an increase of about 170,000 from a year before, according to data released by the State Department of Labor on Thursday. The last time so many city residents were unemployed was in the early 1990s, in the wake of the long, deep recession after the 1987 stock market crash, said James Brown, a Labor Department economist.
 The city's unemployment rate was higher in 1997 than it is now, he said, but the overall job market was stronger then. Mr. Brown said that mounting job losses in financial services and other professional fields ''suggest that the city's economy will remain weak for the immediate future.''
 He said hiring was weak in June in construction and retailing, but it continued to rebound in leisure and hospitality businesses, in part because those have been attracting tourists by discounting heavily.
 Statewide, 854,000 people were unemployed in June, the highest number in the state since the department began keeping records 33 years ago. The state has now lost 235,900 jobs in the private sector since August, more than half of the 400,000 jobs that were added during the expansion that preceded this recession, said M. Patricia Smith, the state's labor commissioner.
 The state's unemployment rate remained below the national rate, but jumped to 8.7 percent in June from 8.2 percent in May. The Labor Department adjusts the rates for seasonal fluctuations.
 As usual, the recession is taking its greatest toll on less educated workers who were earning lower wages, Ms. Smith said at a news conference in Manhattan, where she and other officials announced $12.7 million in grants to train low-income workers for jobs in energy-saving construction techniques and health care.
 ''Nearly half of all unemployed New Yorkers were earning less than $23,000,'' Ms. Smith said.
 One trainee, Derek Wyatt, a single father from Harlem, exemplifies how tenuous the grip on a better-paying job can be. Mr. Wyatt, 31, said he had been earning high wages selling cars at a Dodge dealership in Brooklyn until it closed last fall. He has spent this year learning how to weatherize buildings through a state-funded Career Pathways program. Now, while waiting for his first construction job, he is making $10 an hour as a customer service representative at the Chelsea Piers recreational complex in Manhattan, he said.
 ''You have to just cut back on your lifestyle,'' Mr. Wyatt said.
 Rising unemployment is continuing to put a strain on the state's unemployment insurance trust fund, which Ms. Smith described as ''broke.'' She said the state expected to borrow about $3 billion from the federal government this year to pay unemployment benefits, which have repeatedly been extended as the recession has worn on. 
 The rise in New York's unemployment rate in June prompted an additional extension of seven weeks of benefits for the long-term unemployed. Standard benefits last for 26 weeks, but New Yorkers can now collect for as long as 79 weeks. 
 While the number of new claims for unemployment benefits has been falling nationally in recent weeks, it has risen sharply in New York in each of the last two weeks. More people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in New York last week than in any other state except California, according to data released on Thursday by the federal Department of Labor.

ART
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.comart. 
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090716 
 ASIA SOCIETY: YANG FUDONG: 'SEVEN INTELLECTUALS IN A BAMBOO FOREST,' through Sept. 13. Presented in its five-hour entirety for the first time in a United States museum, Mr. Yang's hypnotic, five-part black-and-white movie, ''Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest,'' tracks the dreamlike meanderings of a group of fashion-model-pretty young people, from a breathtaking mountain summit to a busy city where the disjunctive imagery becomes increasingly surrealistic and comical. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)20090716
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'LIVING AND DREAMING,' through Sept. 13. This annual exhibition presents works by young artists who have completed a preparatory program for careers as professionals. Most look as if they could use a few years more of seasoning, but a handful look like artists to keep an eye on. The highlights include Eva Davidova's surreal videos; Meredith Drum's enigmatic, low-budget sci-fi film; Nathan Bennett's walk-in room resembling a set for a Stanley Kubrick space odyssey; and Jeffrey Hargrave's mock-racist caricatures. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania , (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090716
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIGHT OF THE SUFIS: THE MYSTICAL ARTS OF ISLAM,' through Sept. 6. ''What's in your head -- throw it away! What's in your hand -- give it up! Whatever happens -- don't turn away from it.'' That's how a 10th-century Persian spiritual master defined the Islamic devotional practice known as Sufism. Countless other definitions have been proposed since, almost as many as for Islam itself. And variety -- paintings, ceramics, mosque lamps, books -- is what you find in this tiny, exquisite show in the Brooklyn Museum's newly reinstalled Islamic galleries. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090716
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost-images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090716
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090716
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE MBE,' through Sept. 20. This is an important show for Mr. Shonibare, a British-Nigerian artist who emerged in the late 1990s and was made a member of the Order of the British Empire in 2005. His sculptural tableaus, which revolve around Victorian-era costumes made from 20th-century fabrics associated with Africa, are riotously colorful; their themes of frivolity and excess feel current. But with few exceptions, Mr. Shonibare serves his post-colonialism straight up. The show is rescued by smart integration with the permanent collection: a kind of scavenger hunt through the museum's American period rooms, where Mr. Shonibare's figures of children at play inhabit historical settings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090716
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT,' through Sept. 7. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers, as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is, furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights, metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20090716
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'PORTRAITS, PASTELS, PRINTS: WHISTLER IN THE FRICK COLLECTION,' through Aug. 23. This summer's refurbishment of the Frick's East Gallery, where four full-length portraits by James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) normally hang, has occasioned a small celebration of Whistler's art. The four portraits have been moved into the Oval Room, where they are joined by a seascape; etchings and pastels of Venice are on view in the Cabinet Room. Both displays reinforce a suspicion about Whistler: that despite his oft-professed regard for the abstract qualities of music -- all those ''symphonies,'' ''arrangements'' and ''nocturnes'' -- he had a rare talent for conveying specific places and personalities. 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)20090716
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SWEENEY DECADE: ACQUISITIONS OF THE 1959 INAUGURAL,' through Sept. 2. What did they get, and when did they get it? The perennial yardstick of a museum's sensitivity to new art is quite useful in this show. All 24 paintings and sculptures date from the 1950s and were acquired by the Guggenheim within a year or so of their making, and many were part of the first exhibition in Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral building. They constitute a mixture of the good, the bad and the innocuous, as well as European, Asian and American. But they also attest to the vision of James Johnson Sweeney, the Guggenheim's second director, who steered the museum away from its founding obsession with ''non-objective painting'' and into the broad, challenging terrain of art after 1950. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20090716
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Sixth Avenue at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090716
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090716
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AFGHANISTAN: HIDDEN TREASURES FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, KABUL,' through Sept. 20. The 200 pre-Islamic objects in this important and moving show date from the Bronze Age to the first century A.D. They dropped from sight during the country's recent turmoil, which was deadly for both people and artwork alike. Courageous curators were their salvation; the rediscovery of the pieces was a moment of national thanksgiving. Consisting of vessels, sculpture, architectural ornaments, jewelry and furniture decoration made of bronze, stone, glass, ceramic, ivory, gold and gemstone, they attest to an astounding cosmopolitanism and diverse cultural heritage. Once, many trade routes led through Afghanistan, and proof of its former centrality is both dazzling and heartening. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANCIS BACON: A CENTENARY RETROSPECTIVE,' through Aug. 16. This 66-work survey starts with the stagy existentialism of Bacon's early work (the semihuman fiends, screaming popes, flanks of beef) and proceeds to the effulgent colors, insistent rhythms and true anguish of his grand triptychs and portraits. It suggests that his greatest achievement was his ability to paint convincingly men having sex and sometimes making love. As his hero Picasso had done for men and women, Bacon turned sexual passion into a pictorial event, using paint on canvas with finesse and no small sense of drama, while operating under cover of modernism. For once, the male gaze turned emphatically selfward. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,' through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PEN AND PARCHMENT: DRAWING IN THE MIDDLE AGES,' through Aug 23. This quietly ravishing exhibition ventures where few shows have gone before, with 50 rarely seen works. They prove medieval drawing to be vital, diverse and essential to the medium's Renaissance blossoming. They reveal the medium untangling from manuscript illumination and Christianity in general -- although not without first reveling in some astounding Psalters, gospels, epistles and a saint's life or two. It re-embraces antiquity and provides a framework for speculative (read, secular) thought. The show ends with the visionary drawings of Opicinus de Canistris, a 13th-century Italian cleric who diagrammed his own notion of the relationship between the earthly and spiritual church. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,' through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090716
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090716
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAGES OF GOLD: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 13. This quietly compelling show assembles ''orphan'' leaves (illuminated pages separated from medieval manuscripts and sold, individually, to collectors). Organized geographically, the show allows a comparison of illumination styles in England, Italy, Spain and other countries and regions. It also highlights the figures who created and participated in the market for single leaves. They include an Italian abbot, an English art historian and a mysterious artist known as the Spanish Forger. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20090716
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'GORD PETERAN: FURNITURE MEETS ITS MAKER,' through Aug. 16. This Canadian furniture maker who is widely admired in craft creates what he calls ''furnitural'' sculpture. He is a consummate technician, and his play with elements of furniture is often amusing and sometimes conceptually provocative. ''Table Made of Wood'' (1999) wittily makes its title literal. It is a side table made by gluing together hundreds of wood scraps, adding up to what is as much a Cubist representation as a functional table. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090716
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20090716
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. ( Smith)20090716
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'AERNOUT MIK,' through July 27. Something is happening in this Dutch artist's videos, but you don't know what it is. Displayed on single flat screens or as multiple projections on custom-built walls in various locations at the museum, they seem to document chaotic, emotionally charged, newsworthy situations involving scores of people. As you watch, you keep hoping to discover what exactly is the cause of the commotion, but no clarification arrives. They are by turns mesmerizing, tantalizing and frustrating.

 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090716
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090716
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090716
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090716
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,' through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090716
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM,' through Sept. 6. This pair of exhibitions leans heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090716
 Galleries: Uptown
 BLANCHE LAZZELL: 'WHITE-LINE COLOR WOODCUTS,' through Aug. 14. This show is a wonderful introduction to one of the unsung geniuses of early American modernism, Blanche Lazzell (1878-1956), an artist who perfected the relatively new technique of white-line woodcut prints into a truly, if modestly, visionary art. The elimination of black lines between the woodcut shapes created an inherent luminosity that Lazzell exploited with her superb sense of color and Cubist-flavored composition. A denizen of Cape Cod, she depicted harbor scenes, landscapes and village rooftops and backyards in images that replace the expected sentimentality with fervent joy. The light has been switched off. Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street , (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Smith)20090716
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: FURTHER EVIDENCE (PART 1: PAINTING),' through July 31. Despite including artists like Hans Hofmann, Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell, this exhibition delves into the further reaches of America's most renowned art movement. Its high points include a monstrous collage by Alfred Leslie and excellent works by James Brookes, Alfonso Ossorio and Milton Resnick. But the standout is Beauford Delaney's ''Composition 16'' from 1954-56, a shimmering field of dark, green-tinged yellow that crosses Monet with Pollock and is a must-have for any museum that wants to expand its definition of Abstract Expressionism beyond the white and the male. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street , (212) 247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com. (Smith)20090716
 TIM HAWKINSON, through next Friday. Great expectations are aroused by the prospect of a Tim Hawkinson show. At his best, this mercurial Los Angeles sculptor can be astoundingly inventive. This is a relatively modest and spotty exhibition, however. Works included range from almost beautiful to hideous. A life-size motorcycle made entirely of eight different kinds of dark feathers is lovely and poetic. A bronze sculpture of a nude adolescent boy and his dog is drop-dead ugly. Pace Wildenstein, 32 East 57th Street , (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com. (Johnson)20090716
 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT,' through Sept. 25. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field Painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue , (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)20090716
 JACK YOUNGERMAN: 'TRIADS/QUADRADS,' through July 26. Mr. Youngerman's new paintings have an exhilarating punch. In bright Playskool colors and with a direct, slightly brushy touch, he has been creating centered, hard-edged abstractions on star-, diamond-, three-leaf-clover- and oval-shaped plywood panels. They have a numinous vibe, like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street , (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com. (Johnson)20090716
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'PROJECT SPACE & ROOFTOP: PAULA HAYES,' through Aug. 15. The best works in this show, which spreads from gallery space to terrace, are hand-blown clear-glass terrariums inhabited by either plants or crystals; rubbery planters of several kinds; and some eco-conscious landscaping devices. All blur the lines dividing sculpture, gardening and design into an art of purposeful, playful beauty and serenity. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20090716
 'YOUR GOLD TEETH II,' through Aug. 15. This exceptional show -- titled after a song by Steely Dan -- ignores the distinctions between art and craft, old and new, commercial and fine. The many works are arranged in unusually tight clusters without labels; formal and visual affinities are established before you quite know what you're looking at. Craft-world greats like Peter Voulkos, Ed Rossbach, Marvin Lipofsky, George Ohr and Edward Moulthrop (you can look them up) rub shoulders with fine-art practitioners like Barkley L. Hendricks, Sergej Jensen, Alexandra Bircken, Alighiero E. Boetti and Cady Noland. All kinds of visual prejudices are shaken up, if not startled out of existence. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20090716
 Galleries: SoHo
 RUBEN OCHOA: 'COLLAPSED,' through July 24. The Los Angeles artist Ruben Ochoa has taken his city as his theme, suggesting how its freeway systems reinforce its class divisions by carving up social space. For his first New York show Mr. Ochoa presents the whole scheme in a state of spectacular collapse, in a single monumental sculpture that looks like an immense upended highway divider half-buried in dirt, with a surprise hidden underneath. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street , (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Cotter)20090716
 Galleries: Other
 ANTONIA DIAS LEITE: 'ANTONIA'S LINE,' through July 25. This young Brazilian artist and recent gradate of the School of Visual Arts makes her New York debut with ''Mildred's Farewell,'' a short, mesmerizing video about her mother's death. Its ghostlike forms drift convincingly among semi-abstract expanses of shadows, water, plants and reflections; cloudlike piles of various fibers; and fragmentary glimpses of faces and bodies, including a pair of seemingly bloody feet walking on broken glass. Experimental films from several decades are recalled, but with help from its subtle, ambient soundtrack (also by Ms. Leite), this work finds legs to call its own. Luxe Gallery, 53 Stanton Street, at Eldridge Street, Lower East Side , (212) 582-4425, luxegallery.net. (Smith)20090716
 Public Art
 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES,' through the summer. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific works organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question. (212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith)20090716
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston , (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Johnson)20090716
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. , (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090716
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the extraordinarily sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington , (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090716
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. , (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090716
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'PAINTINGS FROM THE REIGN OF VICTORIA: THE ROYAL HOLLOWAY COLLECTION, LONDON,' through July 26. Though often sappy, moralistic and formally unadventurous, the best British painting of the late 19th century still delivers a rich mix of visual imagination, narrative intrigue and social commentary. Drawn from a collection created in the early 1880s for students at the Royal Holloway College in England, at the time for women only, this exhibition presents pictures that can make you wish painting today were as tuned in to the real world. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven , (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba. (Johnson)20090716
 Last Chance
 JOHN WOOD: 'ON THE EDGE OF CLEAR MEANING'; closes on Saturday. In the 1950s Mr. Wood began to make unique objects with combinations of drawing, collage, printmaking and early forms of photography (cyanotype, photogram, cliche-verre). This retrospective at the Grey Art Gallery (with additional work at the International Center of Photography) explores his long career as an artist and a teacher at Alfred University. Organized by Mr. Wood's former student Nathan Lyons, it includes more than 210 photographs, artist's books and works that fall under the catchall heading of mixed media, many of them as topical as they are technical. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Rosenberg)20090716
 UNICA ZURN: 'DARK SPRING'; closes on Thursday. A fiction writer and poet, Zurn (1916-1970) suffered a series of mental breakdowns during the last decade of her life, and it was during that time that she produced most of the playfully improvised, sometimes hallucinatory nightmarish drawings in this fascinating show. Wandering, loopy lines enfold intricate patterns of dots, petals and serpentine stripes punctuated by eyes, faces, birds, fish, snakes and flowers. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo , (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson)20090716

HEADLINE: Shares Rise for a 4th Day As Earnings Stay Strong

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
After dallying for much of the session, the stock market closed higher for a fourth consecutive day on Thursday as investors were encouraged again by strong profits on Wall Street. 
 Looking beyond concerns about a possible collapse of the commercial lender CIT Group, investors focused on JPMorgan Chase's robust earnings. JPMorgan reported second-quarter profits of $2.7 billion, just two days after Goldman Sachs surprised analysts with lofty earnings for the period. 
 By contrast, the outlook for CIT appeared bleak and its shares lost three-quarters of their value, or $1.23, to close at 41 cents. On Wednesday, the government rejected the lender's plea for aid, fueling speculation that the company would file for bankruptcy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 95.61 points, or 1.1 percent, to end at 8,711.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.06 points, or 0.9 percent, to 940.74, while the Nasdaq composite index picked up 22.13 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,885.03. 
 ''The earnings keep coming in better than expected,'' said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research. But Mr. Bianco warned that the reports coming up might not keep the pace. ''Earnings periods always come out this way. The good ones rush to get their reports out there and then the next week is all doom and gloom.''
 While households and small businesses struggle, a gulf is widening even between the top investment banks like Goldman Sachs and the retail lenders that carry heavy exposures to commercial loans. Both Bank of America and Citigroup, two of the nation's largest retail lenders, are likely to report losses on Friday in their sagging credit-card businesses as American workers struggle to keep on top of payments. 
 Separately, the government released a report on Thursday that showed a drop in initial claims for state unemployment benefits, providing a hint that the recession might be easing. 
 But interpretations of that decline were mixed. New jobless claims dropped by 47,000, to 522,000, the lowest level since January, after economists had predicted new claims of 575,000. 
 Labor Department officials, however, said the timing of automobile industry layoffs and seasonal adjustments may have clouded the numbers.
 ''The big drop is not necessarily a reflection of what is going on in the economy,'' a department official told The Associated Press.
 Before Thursday, the Dow index had rallied nearly 6 percent this week as better-than-expected earnings raised hopes of an economic rebound. In addition to upbeat news from Goldman Sachs, a strong report from the chip maker Intel helped drive the Dow 3.1 percent higher on Wednesday. 
 Google and I.B.M. both reported higher earnings after the market closed on Thursday. Before the announcements, Google shares rose $4.43, to $442.60, while I.B.M. rose $3.42, to $110.64. 
 Bond prices rose Thursday, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 3.57 percent, from 3.60 percent late Wednesday.
 Stock prices also gained in Europe and Asia. In Europe, the British FTSE 100 index gained 15.38 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,361.84, while Germany's DAX rose 28.75 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,957.19. The CAC-40 in France picked up 28.41 points, or 0.9 percent, to 3,199.68. 
 Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average gained 74.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,344.16 points and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 103.21, or 0.6 percent, at 18,361.87 points.

HEADLINE: On Speedboats, Legal Again, Albania's Illicit Sex Trade Flares

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: VLORE, Albania 

 BODY:
It was only after her trafficker sealed her mouth with electrical tape, drugged her and threatened to kill her family that the childlike woman, now 27, says she realized that the man she had planned to marry had seduced her with a terrible lie. 
 Her journey at age 18 from an Albanian village to a London brothel, where she said she spent five years working as a prostitute, began with a gold engagement ring, the promise of a better life abroad and -- like many before her -- a speedboat trip to Italy under the cover of night.
 So many women, men and children had been trafficked abroad to work as prostitutes, forced laborers or beggars that the Albanian government three years ago barred all Albanian citizens from using speedboats, the favored transportation used by traffickers to get people out of the country.
 This drastic measure, coupled with stricter border controls and revenge killings of traffickers by victims' families, had a significant effect, reducing trafficking by more than half and all but ending Albania's role as a major transit point for people trafficked to Western Europe from eastern and southern parts of the Continent, say experts who follow trafficking. 
 But the ban prompted loud protests from fishermen and people in the tourism industry, and in May it was reversed. Law enforcement and human rights officials are concerned that as a result, human trafficking may explode anew -- at an especially difficult time. 
 The financial crisis, many experts said, could increase human trafficking around the world. A United States State Department report in June warned of the potential risk, saying that the crisis is causing ''a shrinking demand for labor and a growing supply of workers willing to take ever greater risks for economic opportunities.'' 
 In the case of Albania, a poor, southern Balkan country that joined NATO in April and seeks to join the European Union, the government's ability to fight trafficking is viewed as a critical test. 
 For victims like the woman from the small village, ensnared by the false promises of her trafficker, that fight is a matter of survival.
 ''I was in love with him, I dreamed of living my life with him, but it was all a big lie,'' she said in a recent interview at a shelter for trafficking victims. ''I wanted to run away, but in the eyes of the law, I was a prostitute with fake documents. Where was I to go?'' 
 She said the man who abducted her had gained her trust over months, then locked her in a room and took her passport and cellphone. She said he beat her and cut her with a penknife, a warning of what he would do if she tried to escape. She said she was forced to be a prostitute in London and in Antwerp, Belgium. To cover their tracks, the man's family had called her parents and said that the couple had moved to neighboring Kosovo.
 The woman would not provide her name for fear of retribution from the trafficker, making it impossible to corroborate her story with the police report she said she had filed against the man. But the coordinator and director of the shelter where she is staying have reviewed the details of her case and vouched for her credibility.
 At the height of the trafficking, experts estimate, thousands of women, men and children were taken to nearby Greece and Italy and elsewhere for sexual exploitation or forced labor. 
 The United Nations estimates that 12.3 million people globally are employed in sexual servitude or forced labor. Many are lured by fake engagements, real marriages or false job offers. In some cases, victims have been sold by their families. Others go voluntarily. 
 Even with the speedboat ban last year, the State Department said in its June report that in 2008, Albania did not comply with ''the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking,'' although it made ''significant efforts to do so.'' The report said corruption remained pervasive. 
 In June 2007, the Ministry of Interior arrested 12 police officers accused of human trafficking in three cases, including six officers with direct responsibility for anti-trafficking enforcement.
 Albanian law enforcement officials say that help from other countries in getting evidence to convict traffickers is often lacking. Iva Zajmi, the anti-trafficking coordinator at the Ministry of Interior, stressed that as a result of legal or tolerated prostitution in countries like Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, many trafficked women were not identified as victims in those countries. 
 ''The legalization of prostitution has created a wall behind which traffickers can hide and repress victims,'' she said. 
 Trafficking took root in Albania in 1991, in the aftermath of the fall of Communism, and for nearly 10 years, traffickers worked with impunity in the absence of trafficking laws. The problem peaked in 1997 as a financial pyramid scheme shook Albania and pushed the country to the brink of civil war. 
 ''Albanians were selling their sisters for money,'' said Ilir Yzeiri, an Albanian writer who made a documentary on human trafficking. 
 In 2004, the government created courts to try trafficking cases and passed tough trafficking laws, including prison sentences of up to 15 years for traffickers. 
 But human rights experts say prosecutions are too rare, partly because many victims are afraid to testify. Last year, 22 trafficking cases were prosecuted, according to the State Department report, fewer than half the number prosecuted in 2007. 
 Brikena Puka, the executive director of Vatra, an outreach group that has helped trafficking victims, said prosecutions were scarce partly because many victims were being tried for prostitution. In some cases, women are jailed after having been deported from other countries.
 ''Trafficked women are being victimized twice,'' she said. ''First by the traffickers, then by the Albanian justice system.'' 
 Even if they want to press charges, trafficked women who were interviewed say it is extremely difficult to escape from their captors, who are part of an organized international network. 
 The trafficking victim who shared her tale recalled that her trafficker had contacts in each city they visited. She said the trafficker also employed a forger, who provided fake documents.
 She thought she would finally be freed when her trafficker was arrested in London in 2006 and deported to Albania. Instead, she said, his brothers and their wives, who were in London, put her back to work in the sex trade. She said at times she would make more than 1,000 euros daily, about $1,400, but was never allowed to keep it. 
 Within weeks, she said, she called the British police, who soon afterward deported her to Albania, where she filed a complaint with Albanian police accusing the trafficker of abuse. 
 She said that when she finally told her family, they rejected her. Within weeks, she said, she was again abducted by her trafficker, who had been released. He threatened to kill her if she did not retract her statement to the police, she said, so she told the police she had ''lied because of jealousy.'' 
 The coordinator of the shelter where she is staying said the woman's original statement of her story was so detailed -- and she showed so many signs of physical and psychological abuse -- that the police rejected her retraction. She was referred to the shelter, which encouraged her to file formal charges against the trafficker. She did, and the man was jailed for one month before being released a second time, said the coordinator, who requested anonymity because of security concerns. 
 The former prostitute no longer faces the daily terror of her trafficker, but she is forced to live under constant police surveillance in the maximum security shelter, which she has not left in three years. She spends her time watching television and is learning to be a hairdresser at the shelter's makeshift salon. 
 ''You expect your own country to protect its citizens,'' she said. ''You expect the laws not to make a victim into a criminal. Outside Albania, I was on my own, but here I am in my own country, and I am still being abused.''

HEADLINE: Security and Economic Revival Raise Hopes in the West Bank

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: NABLUS, West Bank 

 BODY:
The first movie theater to operate in this Palestinian city in two decades opened its doors in late June. Palestinian policemen standing beneath new traffic lights are checking cars for seat belt violations. One-month-old parking meters are filling with the coins of shoppers. Music stores are blasting love songs into the street, and no nationalist or Islamist scold is forcing them to stop. 
 ''You don't appreciate the value of law and order until you lose it,'' Rashid al-Sakhel, the owner of a carpet store, said as he stood in his doorway surveying the small wonder of bustling streets on a sunny morning. ''For the past eight years, a 10-year-old boy could order a strike and we would all close. Now nobody can threaten us.'' 
 For the first time since the second Palestinian uprising broke out in late 2000, leading to terrorist bombings and fierce Israeli countermeasures, a sense of personal security and economic potential is spreading across the West Bank as the Palestinian Authority's security forces enter their second year of consolidating order. 
 The International Monetary Fund is about to issue its first upbeat report in years for the West Bank, forecasting a 7 percent growth rate for 2009. Car sales in 2008 were double those of 2007. Construction on the first new Palestinian town in decades, for 40,000, will begin early next year north of Ramallah. In Jenin, a seven-story store called Herbawi Home Furnishings has opened, containing the latest espresso machines. Two weeks ago, the Israeli military shut its obtrusive nine-year-old checkpoint at the entrance to this city, part of a series of reductions in security measures. 
 Whether all this can last and lead to the consolidation of political power for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah, as the Obama administration hopes, remains unclear. But a recent opinion poll in the West Bank and Gaza by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, a Palestinian news agency, found that Fatah was seen as far more trustworthy than Hamas -- 35 percent versus 19 percent -- a significant shift from the organization's poll in January, when Hamas appeared to be at least as trustworthy. 
 ''Two years ago I couldn't have even gone to Nablus,'' said Tony Blair, the former British prime minister who serves as international envoy to the Palestinians, after a smooth visit this week. ''Security is greatly improved, and the economy is doing much better. Now we need to move to the next stage: politics.'' 
 The aim of American and European policy is to stitch Palestinian politics back together by strengthening the Palestinian Authority under the presidency of Mahmoud Abbas, which favors a two-state solution with Israel, while weakening the Islamists of Hamas, who rule in Gaza. Fatah says it will hold its first general congress in 20 years in early August to build on its successes, but it remains unclear if the meeting will take place.
 The Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it shares the goal of helping Mr. Abbas, which is why it is seeking to improve West Bank economic conditions as a platform for moving to a political discussion. The Palestinians worry that the political discussion will never arrive and say the Israelis are doing far too little to ease the occupation. Still, they point with pride to the many changes in the West Bank. 
 Meanwhile, the Israeli-led economic siege of Gaza continues, letting in only humanitarian goods. That sets the desired contrast between the territories into sharp relief but causes enormous suffering and anger. 
 Asked to explain why the West Bank's fortunes were shifting, a top Israeli general began his narrative with a chart showing 410 Israelis killed by Palestinians in 2002, and 4 in 2008. 
 ''We destroyed the terrorist groups through three things -- intelligence, the barrier and freedom of action by our men,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with military rules. ''We sent our troops into every marketplace and every house, staying tightly focused on getting the bad guys.''
 But he added that the 2006 legislative electoral victory by Hamas, followed by its violent takeover of Gaza in 2007, led Mr. Abbas to fight Hamas. Palestinian troops have been training in Jordan under American sponsorship. 
 There are now several thousand men trained in that way, and their skills, along with those of the European-trained police force here, have made a huge difference. 
 An important element in making the Palestinian force effective, American and Israeli officials say, was taking young Palestinian men out of the ancestral grips of their villages and tribal clans and training them abroad, turning them into soldiers loyal to units and commanders. 
 The Israeli general said that in the past year and a half, Israeli and Palestinian forces had shot at each other only twice, and in each case there was a meeting to restore trust.
 Speaking of the seriousness of the Palestinians, he added, ''Twice in recent months we have been amazed.'' The first time was during Israel's military invasion of Gaza when Palestinian police officers kept the West Bank calm during protests. The second was in June when the security forces clashed twice with Hamas men in the city of Qalqilya, fighting to the death. 
 The Israelis have pulled their forces to the outskirts of four cities, greatly reduced the number of permanent checkpoints and promised to help industry develop. They say the Palestinians now need courts, prisons and trained judges. 
 Mr. Blair agreed but said there was much more Israel should do, like ending the growth of settlements and taking away dirt mounds and other barriers. In addition, he said, Israel should allow greater Palestinian development in the 60 percent of the West Bank it fully controls. 
 Palestinian business leaders are incensed at the Israeli limitations. Paltel, which operates the only Palestinian cellphone company, says Israel will not permit it to place its towers on the land it controls. That forces Palestinian customers to pay roaming charges for many calls, and allows Israeli cellphone companies to offer lower rates. 
 For more than a year, Israel has promised to free a second frequency so that a competitor to Paltel can provide cellphone service, but it has not yet done so. This leaves the Palestinians skeptical. 
 ''I fail to see any indications that Israel wants to help the Palestinian economy,'' Abdel-Malik al-Jaber, vice chairman of Paltel, said. 
 Still, his company has invested millions in the past year in call centers and customer service because of the increased security and disposable income. 
 As Nader Elawy, manager of Cinema City, the new movie theater here, put it: ''We now have law and order. You can really feel the change.''

HEADLINE: The Joy Of Sachs

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The American economy remains in dire straits, with one worker in six unemployed or underemployed. Yet Goldman Sachs just reported record quarterly profits -- and it's preparing to hand out huge bonuses, comparable to what it was paying before the crisis. What does this contrast tell us? 
 First, it tells us that Goldman is very good at what it does. Unfortunately, what it does is bad for America. 
 Second, it shows that Wall Street's bad habits -- above all, the system of compensation that helped cause the financial crisis -- have not gone away.
 Third, it shows that by rescuing the financial system without reforming it, Washington has done nothing to protect us from a new crisis, and, in fact, has made another crisis more likely.
 Let's start by talking about how Goldman makes money. 
 Over the past generation -- ever since the banking deregulation of the Reagan years -- the U.S. economy has been ''financialized.'' The business of moving money around, of slicing, dicing and repackaging financial claims, has soared in importance compared with the actual production of useful stuff. The sector officially labeled ''securities, commodity contracts and investments'' has grown especially fast, from only 0.3 percent of G.D.P. in the late 1970s to 1.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2007. 
 Such growth would be fine if financialization really delivered on its promises -- if financial firms made money by directing capital to its most productive uses, by developing innovative ways to spread and reduce risk. But can anyone, at this point, make those claims with a straight face? Financial firms, we now know, directed vast quantities of capital into the construction of unsellable houses and empty shopping malls. They increased risk rather than reducing it, and concentrated risk rather than spreading it. In effect, the industry was selling dangerous patent medicine to gullible consumers.
 Goldman's role in the financialization of America was similar to that of other players, except for one thing: Goldman didn't believe its own hype. Other banks invested heavily in the same toxic waste they were selling to the public at large. Goldman, famously, made a lot of money selling securities backed by subprime mortgages -- then made a lot more money by selling mortgage-backed securities short, just before their value crashed. All of this was perfectly legal, but the net effect was that Goldman made profits by playing the rest of us for suckers.
 And Wall Streeters have every incentive to keep playing that kind of game. 
 The huge bonuses Goldman will soon hand out show that financial-industry highfliers are still operating under a system of heads they win, tails other people lose. If you're a banker, and you generate big short-term profits, you get lavishly rewarded -- and you don't have to give the money back if and when those profits turn out to have been a mirage. You have every reason, then, to steer investors into taking risks they don't understand.
 And the events of the past year have skewed those incentives even more, by putting taxpayers as well as investors on the hook if things go wrong.
 I won't try to parse the competing claims about how much direct benefit Goldman received from recent financial bailouts, especially the government's assumption of A.I.G.'s liabilities. What's clear is that Wall Street in general, Goldman very much included, benefited hugely from the government's provision of a financial backstop -- an assurance that it will rescue major financial players whenever things go wrong.
 You can argue that such rescues are necessary if we're to avoid a replay of the Great Depression. In fact, I agree. But the result is that the financial system's liabilities are now backed by an implicit government guarantee. 
 Now the last time there was a comparable expansion of the financial safety net, the creation of federal deposit insurance in the 1930s, it was accompanied by much tighter regulation, to ensure that banks didn't abuse their privileges. This time, new regulations are still in the drawing-board stage -- and the finance lobby is already fighting against even the most basic protections for consumers.
 If these lobbying efforts succeed, we'll have set the stage for an even bigger financial disaster a few years down the road. The next crisis could look something like the savings-and-loan mess of the 1980s, in which deregulated banks gambled with, or in some cases stole, taxpayers' money -- except that it would involve the financial industry as a whole.
 The bottom line is that Goldman's blowout quarter is good news for Goldman and the people who work there. It's good news for financial superstars in general, whose paychecks are rapidly climbing back to precrisis levels. But it's bad news for almost everyone else.

HEADLINE: An Alarm From 2055: Act Now to Save the Earth

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In ''The Age of Stupid,'' a frightening jeremiad about the effects of climate change, the craggy-faced British actor Pete Postlethwaite plays the Archivist, a finger-pointing, futuristic voice of doom in 2055. Peering into a retrospective crystal ball that shows scenes from the early 21st century, he scolds the human race for having committed suicide.
 The curator of the Global Archive, a storage site of human knowledge in what is now a melted Arctic, the Archivist presses a rewind button on a touch screen to show documentary scenes related to climate change that were shot when there was still time for humanity to save itself. At the end of ''The Age of Stupid,'' which uses crude animation that depicts London underwater, Sydney burning and Las Vegas buried in sand, the Archive is sent into space. 
 A much sterner and more alarming polemic than ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' ''The Age of Stupid,'' directed by Franny Armstrong, will be taken by some as an emergency wake-up call to do everything possible to avert impending catastrophe. In the film Mark Lynas, the British environmental activist and author of ''Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet,'' warns of a tipping point around 2015 if the world doesn't immediately act to reduce carbon emissions. Once global temperatures warm more than two degrees, he says, all will be lost.
 Others may find the challenges to humanity posed by the documentary so daunting that ''The Age of Stupid'' (the Archivist's sarcastic nickname for our time) may convince viewers that, practically speaking, it is already too late to act. Cynics may assume that the ethic of consumerism is too deeply instilled in us to be changed, as is the faith in capitalism, which depends on continuous growth. If so, we might as well put the coming horrors out of our minds and live for the moment, while hoping for a miracle. 
 The personal stories among which the film hopscotches examine specific situations. Two involve big oil. We meet a retired paleontologist, who worked for Shell Oil, discovering new resources off the coast of New Orleans, but who also helped rescue more than 100 people after Hurricane Katrina. This was a disaster that the Archivist, looking back, says was only the first of many similar meteorological catastrophes related to climate change. 
 A young woman who dreams of becoming a doctor lives in an impoverished Nigerian village where Shell operates a drilling operation. She fishes in the oil-polluted waters to raise money for her education. She laments the paradox of ''the resource curse,'' in which oil wealth contributes to a country's poverty by putting riches in the hands of a greedy, corrupt few who neglect the education and health of a country while contaminating the environment.
 An octogenarian mountaineer in the French Alps observes how the melting of glaciers has necessitated the construction of longer ladders for climbers to reach them. Another vignette revolves around Iraqi children who hate the United States and blame the American lust for oil for the war. 
 The two stories that best exemplify the difficulties faced by environmentalists have to do with a fledgling Indian airline and a proposed wind farm in the English countryside. Jeh Wadia, an entrepreneur in Mumbai who is starting a low-cost airline, believes he is doing good by helping the economy in India. But as Piers Guy, a wind-farm developer in England who carefully measures his carbon footprint, says, air travel is a major contributor to global warming. Mr. Guy's campaign to build turbines that would produce wind energy in Bedfordshire is vehemently opposed by residents because it will spoil their views and lower their property values. 
 A thread of needling gallows humor runs through ''The Age of Stupid.'' Near the end of the film the Archivist wonders: ''Why didn't we save ourselves? Was the answer that we weren't sure we were worth saving?'' He may have a point.
 THE AGE OF STUPID
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Franny Armstrong; music by Chris Brierley; produced by Lizzie Gillett; released by Spanner Films and Passion Pictures. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes. This film is not rated. 
 WITH: Pete Postlethwaite (the Archivist).

HEADLINE: When Dogs Fly

 BODY:
The only objection we have to Pet Airways, the new airline devoted just to pets, is the fact that we can't book space on it ourselves. 
 Think of it: separate compartments -- dog crates, that is -- with plenty of room to stretch out, flight attendants, a pet lounge, escort from check-in to the plane and preboarding walks. We wouldn't recommend it for business travelers. The trip from New York to Los Angeles -- $250 one way -- does take about 24 hours. But that includes dinner, play time and a sleepover in Chicago. No security hassles, no in-flight movies, just the luxury of one's doggie dreams in one's private cabin. 
 Yes, Pet Airways is yet another stage in the humanizing of our pets, a process that has resulted in, among other things, Rachael Ray pet food and animal health care and lifestyles beyond the means of most of the humans on this planet. 
 We worry, too, that as the transportation needs of pets increase -- quite separately from our own -- it will mean, of course, a new load of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On the other hand, would business and diplomacy be handled so much worse if we sent our dogs as proxies to negotiate on our behalf?
 The immediate overbooked success of Pet Airways suggests a growing intolerance for the sometimes haphazard care of pets on the national airlines. If Pet Airways succeeds, there may be an economic lesson as well for the foundering human airlines. If we had less stress at the airport and dinner on board, we, too, would feel a lot happier about flying.

HEADLINE: 2 GIANTS EMERGE FROM THE RUINS ON WALL STREET

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Eric Dash and David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A new order is emerging on Wall Street after the worst crisis since the Great Depression -- one in which just a couple of victors are starting to tower over the handful of financial titans that used to dominate the industry. 
 On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase became the latest big bank to announce stellar second-quarter earnings. Its $2.7 billion profit, after record gains for Goldman Sachs, underscores how the government's effort to halt a collapse has also set the stage for a narrowing concentration of financial power. 
 ''One theme here is that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan really have emerged as the winners, as the last of the survivors,'' said Robert Reich, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who was secretary of labor in the Clinton administration.
 Both banks now stand astride post-bailout Wall Street, having benefited from billions of dollars in taxpayer support and cheap government financing to climb over banks that continue to struggle. They are capitalizing on the turmoil in financial markets and their rivals' weakness to pull in billions in trading profits. 
 For the most part, the worst of the financial crisis seems to be over. Yet other large banks, including Citigroup and Bank of America, are still struggling to return to health. Both are expected to report a more profitable quarter on Friday, but a spate of management changes and looming losses from credit cards and commercial real estate have thwarted a stronger recovery. 
 And then there are the legions of regional and small banks that are falling in greater numbers across the country. While many have racked up large losses, they stand to bleed more red ink if the recession wears on. Fifty-three have failed this year, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is girding for scores to follow.
 Uncertainties over the economy mean that Goldman and JPMorgan may be enjoying a fragile dominance, industry experts said. JPMorgan reported big declines in its consumer business on Thursday, and it has set aside more than $30 billion to cover future losses from surging credit card charge-offs and mortgage and home equity losses. 
 ''Nobody is through this until unemployment turns around,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, a Credit Suisse banking analyst.
 And if regulation being considered in Washington is passed, banks would face new limits on the amount of their own capital they may trade. That could limit the profits that banks like Goldman and JPMorgan make from their trading businesses, and level the playing field, experts say.
 Other former Wall Street stars like Morgan Stanley, which was hurt more by the crisis and has avoided taking big risks in the new era, may also rebound and begin to take on old rivals.
 But for now, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are surging. ''The stronger players are positioned to take advantage of the crisis and they will dominate clearly in the near term,'' said James Reichbach, the head of Deloitte's United States financial practice. 
 JPMorgan's renewed strength, like Goldman's, comes as it vaults ahead of longtime rivals, especially in investment banking, including bond and equity trading, and underwriting debt to help companies issue shares and bonds. Traders took advantage of big market swings and less competition to post big gains in fixed-income and equities. 
 Michael J. Cavanagh, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, said its profit and fees from this business were ''a record for us in a quarter and a record for anybody at any firm in any quarter.'' The bank, he added, was ''so very proud of those results.''
 It has also profited from the demise of weaker banks to enlarge its market share in mortgages and retail banking. On Tuesday, as the CIT Group, a lender to many small businesses, negotiated with the government to avoid collapse, JPMorgan signaled that it was watching.
 ''It would be an opportunity for us in these states if CIT was unable to continue lending to borrowers,'' Tom Kelly, a spokesman at Chase, was quoted by Dow Jones Newswires as saying.
 And revenue from the retail bank Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan acquired last fall, is starting to help earnings. Morgan is also profiting from its government-assisted purchase of Bear Stearns last year. JPMorgan is now No. 1 globally in equity and debt capital markets, according to Dealogic.
 Amid the surge, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, has cemented his status as one of America's most powerful and outspoken bankers. He has vocally distanced himself from the government's financial support, calling the $25 billion in taxpayer money the bank received in December a ''scarlet letter'' and pushing with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others to repay the money swiftly. Those three banks repaid the money last month. 
 Yet JPMorgan's transformation into one of the industry's strongest players is underpinned by the shelter it received from the government: The bank used the money as a cushion until it was able to raise new capital. ''There is no doubt all of us benefited from the government help -- all of us,'' said a senior executive at another Wall Street bank. 
 A spokesman for JPMorgan said the bank accepted aid at the request of the government but would not comment beyond that.
 Few banks have undergone such a turnaround. Only a few years ago, JPMorgan was struggling after years of poor management and a failure to digest a series of big acquisitions. But under Mr. Dimon, it cut costs and strengthened its balance sheet. 
 The payoff began last year. With the industry teetering on the verge of collapse, JPMorgan snapped up Bear Stearns in March 2008 and Washington Mutual last fall in two government-assisted transactions. Clients say that its growing dominance has given it more leverage to charge for lending and other services. 
 After aggressively lobbying to repay its taxpayer money, Mr. Dimon has also been driving a hard bargain over the repurchase of warrants the government received from the bank last autumn in exchange for taxpayer support. JPMorgan is now planning to let the Treasury Department auction off the warrants to private investors after the two sides failed to agree on a price.
 Mr. Dimon is also gearing up for a series of battles in Washington. One is over tighter regulations for derivatives, a business where the bank generates lucrative fees as one of the industry's largest players. 
 Another is the creation of a new consumer protection agency, which could threaten the profitability of the bank's mortgage and credit card businesses if it introduces tougher regulations.
 JPMorgan's stock has risen 20 percent since early March. It closed Thursday at $35.76.

HEADLINE: Mental Health Problems Plague Returning Veterans

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
A new study has found that more than one-third of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who enrolled in the veterans health system after 2001 received a diagnosis of a mental health problem, most often post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. 
 The study by researchers at the San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of California, San Francisco, also found that the number of veterans found to have mental health problems rose steadily the longer they were out of the service. 
 The study, released Thursday, was based on the department health records of 289,328 veterans involved in the two wars who used the veterans health system for the first time from April 1, 2002, to April 1, 2008. 
 The researchers found that 37 percent of those people received mental health diagnoses. Of those, the diagnosis for 22 percent was post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, for 17 percent it was depression and for 7 percent it was alcohol abuse. One-third of the people with mental health diagnoses had three or more problems, the study found.
 The increase in diagnoses accelerated after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the researchers found. Among the group of veterans who enrolled in veterans health services during the first three months of 2004, 14.6 percent received mental health diagnoses after one year. But after four years, the number had nearly doubled, to 27.5 percent. 
 The study's principal author, Dr. Karen H. Seal, attributed the rising number of diagnoses to several factors: repeat deployments; the perilous and confusing nature of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, where there are no defined front lines; growing public awareness of PTSD; unsteady public support for the wars; and reduced troop morale.
 Dr. Seal said the study also underscored that it can take years for PTSD to develop. ''The longer we can work with a veteran in the system, the more likely there will be more diagnoses over time,'' said Dr. Seal, who is co-director of the mental health clinic for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at the San Francisco veterans medical center. 
 The new report joins a growing body of research showing that the prolonged conflicts, where many troops experience long and repeat deployments, are taking an accumulating psychological toll. 
 A telephone survey by the RAND Corporation last year of 1,965 people who had been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan found that 14 percent screened positive for PTSD and 14 percent for major depression. Those rates are considerably higher than for the general public.
 ''The study provides more insight as to just how stressed our force and families are after years of war and multiple deployments,'' said Rene A. Campos, deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. ''Our troops and families need more time at home -- more dwell time, fewer and less frequent deployments.'' 
 The study was posted Thursday on the Web site of The American Journal of Public Health.
 Dr. Seal cautioned that, unlike the RAND study, the results from her research could not be extrapolated to the roughly 1.6 million veterans who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan because about 60 percent of them were not receiving health care through the veterans system. 
 But she noted that the number of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans receiving care through the veterans system was at a historic high, 40 percent, potentially making the study's results more universal. 
 The study also found that veterans older than 40 with the National Guard or the Reserves were more likely to develop PTSD and substance abuse disorders than those under 25. A possible reason, Dr. Seal said, is that older reservists go to war from established civilian lives, with families and full-time jobs, making combat trauma potentially more difficult to absorb. 
 ''It's the disparity between their lives at home, which they are settled in, and suddenly, without much training, being dropped into this situation,'' she said. 
 In contrast, the study found that among active-duty troops, veterans under 25 were more likely to develop PTSD and substance abuse problems than those over 40, possibly because those younger troops were more likely to have been involved in front-line combat, Dr. Seal said.

HEADLINE: Nevada Sees an Opening In California's Troubles

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Like buzzards circling a dying animal, Nevada business leaders gleefully mocked the California budget crisis on Thursday and crowed about the opportunities it offered their state to poach companies from its ailing neighbor. 
 The president of the nonprofit Nevada Development Authority, A. Somer Hollingsworth, donned a tinfoil hat for part of a speech in which he told local business executives and politicians that California's excessive government had led to its near-bankruptcy.
 ''Nobody's really working there -- everybody's a recipient of some kind of state program,'' said Mr. Hollingsworth, whose organization's mission is recruiting companies to the Las Vegas area and whose talk was entitled, ''California Has Lost Its Mind and Las Vegas Is Providing Psychoanalysis.'' 
 After reciting Nevada's favorable attributes -- no personal or corporate income tax, lower sales taxes than in California -- he asked, ''Why would you not move?''
 California faces a $26.3 billion budget shortfall for which lawmakers have no solution, so the state has been forced to issue more than 91,000 i.o.u.'s worth more than $350 million to its employees in lieu of paychecks. Banks there have said they will not honor them after Friday.
 Mr. Hollingsworth made fun of several fees and taxes proposed by California lawmakers, like a $50-an-ounce tariff for recreational marijuana. ''Whatever happened to a nickel bag, huh?'' he said to laughter.
 One member of the audience, Jason McMillin, who recently moved his lighting business to Las Vegas from Utah, rejected the idea that it was unseemly for a state to openly take advantage of another's misfortune.
 ''It's irresponsibility on the California side that got them here,'' Mr. McMillin said.
 The president of the California Chamber of Commerce, Allan Zaremberg, shrugged off the speech, calling Mr. Hollingsworth's tinfoil hat a gimmick and insisting that his organization was fighting to avert higher business taxes specifically to avoid losing employers.
 ''I sense they're being so aggressive because their economy is struggling, too,'' Mr. Zaremberg said. ''I would match our higher education system against their higher education system any day. Also, our quality of life.''
 Indeed, Nevada has had its share of economic and budgetary woes. The state has the nation's highest home foreclosure rate, and the Legislature this year approved nearly $1 billion in new taxes and cut services to close a $2.5 billion budget gap.
 Still, the state and California have had a long history of tit-for-tat efforts to steal businesses from each other. Four years ago, after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger staged a press event on the Las Vegas Strip to urge Nevada companies to move west, the Nevada Development Authority bought a billboard at Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles that warned companies their businesses would ''be terminated'' under the leadership of Mr. Schwarzenegger.
 ''What's happening, they're doing to themselves,'' Mr. Hollingsworth said in an interview after the speech. ''The companies are going to leave, I want to make sure that I get my fair share.''

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Are Lowest Since January

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of American workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell sharply last week to the lowest level since January, the government said on Thursday, but the data was distorted by an unusual pattern of automotive industry layoffs that amplified the drop. 
 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 47,000, to a lower-than-expected seasonally adjusted 522,000 in the week ended July 11, the Labor Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast claims to be unchanged at 565,000 last week.
 A Labor Department official said that far fewer layoffs than anticipated, based on past experience in the automotive sector and elsewhere in manufacturing, accounted for both the large drop in seasonally adjusted claims and the very steep decline in so-called continued claims.
 This was the second week in a row that seasonal factors had affected the data and the official said this would continue for one or two more weeks before this influence faded.
 ''The big drop is not necessarily a reflection of what is going on in the economy,'' he said.
 Stock futures rose after the report while Treasuries trimmed gains, and analysts said that despite the distortions, the claims data were encouraging.
 ''There is really improvement here, even though it's exaggerated by seasonal issues,'' said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
 Continued claims of people still on jobless aid after an initial week of benefits fell to 6.273 million in the week ending July 4, the latest for which data is available.
 It was the lowest reading since April and the largest one-week decline on record. Analysts had forecast continued claims would decline to 6.85 million.
 The ''seasonal factors'' the department uses to adjust the data to provide a better sense of the underlying trends had expected a large increase in both initial and continued claims. Actual claims rose by much less, possibly because workers had already been laid off in the battered automotive sector. When seasonally adjusted, this generated a large fall.
 In another important gauge of labor market health, the four-week moving average for new claims fell to 584,500, from 607,000, the lowest since January. This measure is closely watched because it is supposed to iron out weekly volatility, and has now fallen for three consecutive weeks.

HEADLINE: Cities Peel Back Pavement To Expose Watery Havens

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN; Jean Chung contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
For half a century, a dark tunnel of crumbling concrete encased more than three miles of a placid stream bisecting this bustling city. 
 The waterway had been a centerpiece of Seoul since a king of the Choson Dynasty selected the new capital 600 years ago, enticed by the graceful meandering of the stream and its 23 tributaries. But in the industrial era after the Korean War, the stream, by then a rank open sewer, was entombed by pavement and forgotten beneath a lacework of elevated expressways as the city's population swelled toward 10 million. 
 Today, after a $384 million recovery project, the stream, called Cheonggyecheon, is liberated from its dank sheath and burbles between reedy banks. Picnickers cool their bare feet in its filtered water, and carp swim in its tranquil pools. 
 The restoration of the Cheonggyecheon is part of an expanding environmental effort in cities around the world to ''daylight'' rivers and streams by peeling back pavement that was built to bolster commerce and serve automobile traffic decades ago. 
 In New York State, a long-stalled revival effort for Yonkers's ailing downtown core that could break ground this fall includes a plan to re-expose 1,900 feet of the Saw Mill River, which currently runs through a giant flume that was laid beneath city streets in the 1920s. 
 Cities from Singapore to San Antonio have been resuscitating rivers and turning storm drains into streams. In Los Angeles, residents' groups and some elected officials are looking anew at buried or concrete-lined creeks as assets instead of inconveniences, inspired partly by Seoul's example. 
 By building green corridors around the exposed waters, cities hope to attract affluent and educated workers and residents who appreciate the feel of a natural environment in an urban setting. 
 Environmentalists point out other benefits. Open watercourses handle flooding rains better than buried sewers do, a big consideration as global warming leads to heavier downpours. The streams also tend to cool areas overheated by sun-baked asphalt and to nourish greenery that lures wildlife as well as pedestrians.
 Some political opponents have derided Seoul's remade stream as a costly folly, given that nearly all of the water flowing between its banks on a typical day is pumped there artificially from the Han River through seven miles of pipe.
 But four years after the stream was uncovered, city officials say, the environmental benefits can now be quantified. Data show that the ecosystem along the Cheonggyecheon (pronounced chung-gye-chun) has been greatly enriched, with the number of fish species increasing to 25 from 4. Bird species have multiplied to 36 from 6, and insect species to 192 from 15. 
 The recovery project, which removed three miles of elevated highway as well, also substantially cut air pollution from cars along the corridor and reduced air temperatures. Small-particle air pollution along the corridor dropped to 48 micrograms per cubic meter from 74, and summer temperatures are now often five degrees cooler than those of nearby areas, according to data cited by city officials. 
 And even with the loss of some vehicle lanes, traffic speeds have picked up because of related transportation changes like expanded bus service, restrictions on cars and higher parking fees. 
 ''We've basically gone from a car-oriented city to a human-oriented city,'' said Lee In-keun, Seoul's assistant mayor for infrastructure, who has been invited to places as distant as Los Angeles to describe the project to other urban planners. 
 Some 90,000 pedestrians visit the stream banks on an average day.
 What is more, a new analysis by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that replacing a highway in Seoul with a walkable greenway caused nearby homes to sell at a premium after years of going for bargain prices by comparison with outlying properties.
 Efforts to recover urban waterways are nonetheless fraught with challenges, like convincing local business owners wedded to existing streetscapes that economic benefits can come from a green makeover. 
 Yet today the visitors to the Cheonggyecheon's banks include merchants from some of the thousands of nearby shops who were among the project's biggest opponents early on.
 On a recent evening, picnickers along the waterway included Yeon Yeong-san, 63, who runs a sporting apparel shop with his wife, Lee Geum-hwa, 56, in the adjacent Pyeonghwa Market.
 Mr. Yeon said his family moved to downtown Seoul in the late 1940s, and he has been running the business for four decades. He said parking was now harder for his customers. But ''because of less traffic, we have better air and nature,'' he said.
 He and his wife walk along the stream every day, he added. ''We did not think about exercising here when the stream was buried underground,'' Mr. Yeon said. 
 The project has yielded political dividends for Lee Myung-bak, a former leader of construction companies at the giant Hyundai Corporation. He was elected Seoul's mayor in 2002 largely around his push to remove old roads -- some of which he had helped build -- and to revive the stream. Today he is South Korea's president.
 Even strong critics of the president tend to laud his approach to the Cheonggyecheon revival, which involved hundreds of meetings with businesses and residents over two years. 
 A recent newspaper column that criticized the president over a botched police raid on squatters ended with the words ''Please come back, Cheonggyecheon Lee Myung-bak!'' -- a reference to the nickname he earned during the campaign to revive the stream.
 The role of Seoul's environmental renewal in Mr. Lee's political ascent is not lost on Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers, a city of 200,000 where entrenched poverty had slowed a revival project. Once the river restoration was added to the plan, he said, he found new support for redevelopment.
 Yonkers has gained $34 million from New York State and enthusiastic support from environmental groups for the river restoration, which is part of a proposed $1.5 billion development that includes a minor-league ballpark. The river portion is expected to cost $42 million over all.
 A longtime supporter was George E. Pataki, who helped line up state money in his last year as governor, Mayor Amicone said. ''Every time he'd visit, he'd say, 'You've got to open up that river,' '' he added.
 Part of the plan would expose an arc of the river and line it with paths and restaurant patios that would wrap around a shopping complex and the ballpark. Another open stretch would become a ''wetland park'' on what is now a parking lot. 
 Mr. Amicone, who has a background as a civil engineer, said the example of Seoul's success had helped build support in Yonkers. In an interview, he recalled the enthusiasm with which Mr. Lee, then Seoul's mayor, toured Yonkers in 2006 and discussed the cities' parallel river projects with him.
 ''Whether it's a city of millions or 200,000, the concept is identical,'' Mr. Amicone said. ''These are no longer sewers, but aesthetically pleasing assets that enhance development.''

HEADLINE: Retailers Say Losing CIT Would Crimp Supply Chain

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
For the nation's already struggling retailing industry, the collapse of CIT would send yet another wave of pain through the supply chain, wiping out suppliers' capital, depleting retailers' credit and leaving the racks and shelves of the nation's stores sparsely stocked -- just in time for Christmas. 
 CIT serves the retailing industry as a lender but, more significant, as something called a factor, a type of financial intermediary. When small and midsize suppliers ship goods to retailers, they are not paid right away. Yet they need cash to continue producing merchandise. Factors provide the suppliers money until the retailers pay, which can take 30 to 90 days. Factors also guarantee suppliers that they will get paid, even if a retailer to whom they shipped goes bankrupt. 
 CIT is the factor for about 2,000 manufacturers and suppliers whose goods are sold at about 300,000 retailers across the country. 
 ''When you take someone like CIT, who's very astute at assessing these kinds of risks, and you take them out of the equation, the suppliers don't have operating capital,'' said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Retail Federation.
 That means suppliers cannot produce or deliver goods to the nation's stores, leaving them without merchandise. ''Obviously that puts a major crimp in the retail supply chain,'' Mr. Duncan said. 
 With CIT ailing, suppliers are panicked and pressed for options. 
 ''We are fielding a tremendous number of calls on this,'' said Douglas Hand of the law firm Hand, Baldachin & Amburgey, some of whose clients use CIT as their factor. 
 About 70 percent of CIT's retailing clients do less than $50 million in sales. ''They do not have alternative sources of capital,'' Jonathan Lucas, chief sales officer and executive vice president of CIT Trade Finance, said in a recent CIT podcast. ''We provide that source of capital.''
 Suppliers can try and find another factor, though that is not necessarily easy. 
 ''There aren't enough other people in this market to absorb what CIT does,'' said Gary Wassner, president of Hilldun, a factoring company. ''They have 60 percent of the market. There's nobody large enough to assume the credit risk.''
 CIT and GMAC are among the nation's biggest factors, and retailing professionals say GMAC has tighter lending restraints in place. Suppliers who used CIT could try to get short-term financing from a bank instead, but the credit market remains tight and getting approved is not likely to be an expeditious process.
 Another option for suppliers is to ask retailers to pay cash on delivery, or to draw down their own credit lines to pay for merchandise. That, as one might imagine, is not popular with retailers. For one thing, many retailers do not have cash or credit to spare in the current economy. And those that do have earmarked their loans for their own projects, be it store renovations or technology upgrades.
 Even if a retailer agreed to draw down a credit line for a supplier, the retailer would most likely order far less merchandise. ''You're going to see a diminution of the merchandise in the second half of the year,'' Mr. Duncan said. 
 Industry professionals said that could not happen at a worse time. 
 ''Right now our industry is preparing for the fall and winter season,'' said Kevin M. Burke, president and chief executive of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. ''A lot of these orders are going to come to a grinding halt if there is no capital.'' 
 He said 60 percent of the apparel and footwear industry -- ''all the names you'd recognize when you go through Macy's'' -- used CIT.
 The loss of CIT would be, as Mr. Burke put it, a ''double whammy'' to stores. Suppliers have already cut the amount of merchandise they are making to better align inventory with lower consumer demand. 
 If they lose their sole source of capital, he said, what little merchandise retailers ordered in the first place might never arrive. 
 Retailers are reluctant to speak publicly about CIT because they do not want to rattle investors. On Thursday, Dillard's issued a statement saying that CIT was no longer a participant in its $1.2 billion credit facility.
 Industry analysts tend to agree that retailers that use CIT as a lender are not the primary concern. ''Certainly retailers will find alternative sources of credit,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for the NPD Group, a retailing consultancy. 
 The same cannot be said of suppliers. 
 ''Our members are saying that if something doesn't change,'' Mr. Burke said, ''we don't know what we're going to do.''

HEADLINE: Concerns On Rio Tinto Are 'Noise,' China Says

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China dismissed Australian officials' expressions of concern over the detentions of four employees of the mining giant Rio Tinto as ''noise'' on Thursday, in one of the government's few public comments on the case. 
 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and other Australian officials have repeatedly pressed Beijing to be fair and transparent in dealing with the four employees, one of whom is an Australian citizen. On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, called the comments ''noise'' and said, ''This is an interference in China's judicial sovereignty. It cannot change the facts and the investigation.''
 On July 5, China detained the four in Shanghai on suspicion of stealing government secrets and seriously harming China's economic interests and security. Accusations against them include paying bribes to Chinese steel executives in exchange for confidential government data that may have given Rio Tinto an edge in iron ore price negotiations with Chinese steel officials. No formal charges have been lodged, and most of the details have been published in China's state-controlled media. On Wednesday, China Daily reported that Rio Tinto had bribed virtually every one of China's big steel makers. 
 Rio Tinto has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing in the case and said the company strictly forbade bribery.
 Some legal experts and Australian officials have criticized China for treating what could be seen as a commercial fraud case as a matter of national security under its vague state secrets law. China's state-owned companies make up a significant portion of its economy, and the case has raised fears among multinational corporations doing business here that information they have access to could make them vulnerable to similar prosecution.
 Australia's Foreign Affairs minister, Stephen Smith, confirmed during an interview with Sky News on Thursday that Stern Hu, the Australian citizen being held in Shanghai, has been accused of offering bribes during negotiations this year over iron ore prices. 
 On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal and the Australian Financial Review, citing anonymous sources, said Rio Tinto had already asked some foreign staff members working here to leave China. Nick Cobban, a spokesman for Rio Tinto in London, said Thursday that the company would not comment but that it was still operating in China.
 The United States commerce secretary, Gary Locke, who is visiting China this week, said that he had asked that the Rio Tinto workers be treated fairly at meetings in Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday, and that he had made it clear that American businesses were also concerned about legal protections.
 Some analysts have suggested that Beijing was using the case to punish Rio Tinto for deciding last month to scrap a planned $19.5 billion investment by a state-controlled Chinese company.
 Rio Tinto was also among a group of iron ore miners that recently failed to come to an agreement with Chinese steel mills in annual iron ore negotiations. The two sides battled fiercely over price reductions.
 Beijing officials insist that the legal process will run its course and that the case is not intended to discourage foreign investment; they are simply upholding the law and punishing illegal behavior, they say.

HEADLINE: Obama Headlines Rally To Strengthen Governor

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: HOLMDEL, N.J. 

 BODY:
President Obama urged New Jersey voters on Thursday to look past the state's pummeled economy and give Gov. Jon S. Corzine a second term anyway, saying the governor ''didn't run for this office on the promise that change would be easy, and he hasn't avoided doing what's hard.''
 Rallying Democrats here in his first on-the-ground foray into a competitive race since his own election, Mr. Obama said New Jersey was paying heavily for losses on Wall Street, and, like the president, Mr. Corzine had ''been tested by the worst recession in half a century.'' 
 But he called Mr. Corzine a crucial ally who had helped develop the national economic recovery plan, saving countless jobs, while working wonders on education and health insurance and still cutting the size of state government.
 ''And I can promise you this, that more help is on the way in the weeks and months to come,'' Mr. Obama told a sweltering but roaring crowd of thousands at an outdoor amphitheater near the Garden State Parkway. ''I am absolutely confident that we will weather this particular economic storm.''
 Mr. Corzine, who trails in the polls behind the Republican challenger, Christopher J. Christie, warned against a return to Republican leadership and ''a governing philosophy that says, 'Anything goes.' ''
 He gleefully cheered Mr. Obama on, after assuring supporters, ''Now, with a partner in the White House, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.''
 Democrats said they hoped that the president's visit would solidify Mr. Corzine's standing among party loyalists at a time when he is showing weakness even among core constituencies like blacks and urban residents.
 Mr. Obama's visit may not produce an immediate effect, they said, but could cement the governor's association with a popular president -- and make it easier to associate Mr. Christie with former President George W. Bush.
 Democrats also hope that Mr. Obama's testimony about Mr. Corzine's effectiveness and stature on the economy will help the governor argue that New Jersey's troubles are national, not local, and that he is part of the solution, not the problem.
 In a turnabout, Mr. Corzine's high-finance background now seems a liability: Polls show that it doesn't help with voters, and Republicans have tried to tag him with populist anger over bailouts and bonuses on Wall Street.
 Mr. Christie, for his part, has countered Democratic efforts to link him to Mr. Bush by trying to associate himself with Mr. Obama and some of his policies. He also posted two Web videos before the president's arrival. One showed voters declaring that they had voted for Mr. Obama but are now supporting Mr. Christie.
 Another showed Mr. Christie saying that he welcomed Mr. Obama's visit to New Jersey. ''We need help, Mr. President, because our state and its people are hurting,'' he says.
 ''Your campaign gave people great hope that change would come to America,'' Mr. Christie adds. ''But you know, your election didn't end the people's hunger for change here in New Jersey.''
 In the meantime, Mr. Christie suggests that the president crank up some Bruce Springsteen and sample the saltwater taffy along the Jersey Shore before returning to Washington.

HEADLINE: California Infighting Over Schools Stalls Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
With a deal to close a $26 billion budget gap tantalizingly close -- and the state's fiscal situation continuing to erode -- California lawmakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger found themselves ensnared in a fight over education financing Thursday that prevented an agreement. 
 The state must allocate roughly 40 percent of its general fund to public elementary and high schools as well as community colleges, a requirement imposed by voters with the passage of Proposition 98 in 1988. But over the last two fiscal years, spending on schools has been cut to about $50 billion from roughly $60 billion, and was facing a cut of $2.3 billion more in this budget round. 
 Democrats, who control the Legislature, want to make sure that any education money cut from this year's budget is restored when the economy rebounds. State officials said that Democrats had asked for a law to be passed that would guarantee the restoration of education spending, but that the Schwarzenegger administration rejected the idea.
 Nonetheless, the governor still sounded optimistic that a deal would be reached soon.
 ''You know, negotiations stall and sometimes new things come up and one has to reassess, and then you continue on again,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said. ''There's a will there in this building for both parties to get this done.''
 The governor had earlier proposed that Proposition 98 be suspended for the duration of the fiscal crisis, an idea that prompted a stinging television advertising campaign by the state teachers' union in response.
 ''We believe if you're going to share the pain, then share it,'' said David A. Sanchez, president of the California Teachers Association. ''We have already taken billions of dollars in cuts.'' 
 Three rating agencies have lowered California's credit rating to just above junk level, and the state is paying its vendors with i.o.u.'s.
 On Thursday, Bill Lockyer, the state treasurer, issued a statement warning of dire consequences if the budget crisis was not resolved.
 ''I call on the governor and Legislature to focus exclusively on what it takes to bring this year's budget back in balance, honestly and immediately,'' Mr. Lockyer said. ''I urge them to narrow, not expand, the list of their disputes, to quit adding or resurrecting endless ideological debating points, and to stop using budget negotiations to score points with political allies or against partisan opponents. I ask them to stop devoting energy to any issue that does not directly relate to closing this year's budget gap without adding to out-year liabilities.''
 Lawmakers passed a budget in February, but the legislation, which covered 17 months' worth of spending, was dependent on the passage of ballot propositions that failed in May, resulting in an expanding budget gap.

HEADLINE: House Committee Approves Health Care Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation early Friday to overhaul the health care system and expand insurance coverage after a marathon session in which Democrats easily turned back Republican efforts to amend the bill.
 The 23-to-18 vote came just hours after the director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas W. Elmendorf, shook up the political landscape by suggesting that none of the major health care bills would significantly slow the growth of health spending. 
 On Wednesday, the Senate health committee approved legislation generally similar to the House bill. Two other House panels, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Education and Labor Committee, are working on the legislation. 
 Democrats said the actions in the Senate and in the Ways and Means Committee created momentum for passage of the legislation, President Obama's top domestic priority. But in both committees, the votes generally followed party lines, indicating the lack of consensus on how to finance coverage for the uninsured. 
 In the Ways and Means vote, three Democrats -- Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota and John Tanner of Tennessee -- joined Republicans in voting against the bill.
 Before taking the final roll call, the Ways and Means panel endorsed central elements of Mr. Obama's blueprint for health care, including the creation of a new government health plan and a requirement for employers to provide insurance to their employees or contribute to its cost. The panel also voted to impose a surtax on families with incomes of more than $350,000 a year.
 Earlier on Thursday Mr. Elmendorf told Congress that the health legislation proposed so far would not curb the federal government's runaway spending on medical care and that lawmakers would need to take more forceful action to meet Mr. Obama's goal of controlling costs. 
 The testimony by Mr. Elmendorf before the Senate Budget Committee drew criticism from Democratic leaders, highlighting their rising frustration over the difficulty of paying for an overhaul. 
 Asked about the testimony by Mr. Elmendorf, a highly regarded economist, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, snapped derisively, ''Maybe what he should do is run for Congress.''
 Mr. Reid's barb and similar criticism earlier in the day from the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, amounted to the legislative equivalent of arguing balls and strikes in baseball. The budget office is supposed to be an impartial scorekeeper, and the White House has said that the health care legislation must be paid for in accordance with budget office rules. 
 Mr. Elmendorf's testimony also provided ammunition to Republican critics, who have said for weeks that the proposed legislation would raise costs and fail to cover all Americans. 
 ''Today's announcement by the independent C.B.O. confirms what Republicans have been saying all along,'' Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the chairman of the Republican conference, said in a statement. ''The health care proposal by Congressional Democrats amounts to a government takeover of our health care economy.''
 Mr. Elmendorf's testimony came on an extraordinarily busy day on health care issues. 
 At the White House, Mr. Obama cheered the news that the American Medical Association had announced its support for the House health care bill.
 Dr. Michael D. Maves, executive vice president of the association, told House leaders that the bill would expand coverage, impose stringent rules on insurers and block scheduled cuts in Medicare payments to doctors. 
 Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said: ''The historical significance of the A.M.A.'s support should not be underestimated. Quite honestly, it has been difficult to win the support of this organization going all the way back to the 1930s.''
 Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee, which has been trying to develop a bipartisan measure, broke off its negotiations for the weekend. Lawmakers said their staffs would continue working, and they urged patience from Mr. Obama. 
 And the House Ways and Means Committee endorsed two central elements of Mr. Obama's plan, voting to create the new government-run health plan that would compete with private insurers and to require employers to help finance insurance for their workers. 
 By a vote of 25 to 14, the committee rejected a Republican effort to strike the government health plan from comprehensive legislation that would offer insurance coverage to all Americans. 
 Ways and Means was one of three House committees to begin formal consideration of the legislation, which could reach the House floor for final approval this month. 
 The government-run health plan is among the components of the health care legislation that Mr. Elmendorf suggested did not have sufficient muscle to slow the federal spending on health care, which he called ''unsustainable.'' 
 The House bill and a similar measure approved Wednesday by the Senate health committee would broadly expand insurance coverage at a huge cost to the government. But Mr. Elmendorf, who said his office was still analyzing the proposals, said the legislation did not appear to offset those costs sufficiently. 
 ''In the legislation that has been reported, we do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount,'' Mr. Elmendorf said. ''And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs.'' 
 One step that would contribute in a large way to offsetting costs would be to tax some employer-provided health benefits, which are currently excluded from taxable income, Mr. Elmendorf said. 
 Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the budget committee, and Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, have advocated such a change but were forced to abandon it because of objections by Mr. Obama and other Democrats in Congress. 
 ''Basically, the president is not helping us,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''That's making it difficult.'' 
 The Finance Committee estimated that taxing some benefits over 10 years could raise $320 billion toward the roughly $1 trillion cost of the legislation. Mr. Baucus is now working on a menu of smaller proposals to fill that hole. 
 House Democratic leaders never supported taxing benefits, which could exact a heavy toll on union workers with generous health plans. Instead, the House Democrats proposed an income surtax on the highest wage earners that would yield about $550 billion over 10 years. 
 Lawmakers working on health care have expressed frustration with the budget office and with rules that make it difficult to document reductions in government health care spending. 
 The budget office, in its calculations, cannot take into account -- or ''score,'' to use Congressional budget lingo -- many of the savings that Democrats say will result from their legislation because those savings fall outside the direct control of federal law. 
 In the Ways and Means session, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who offered the amendment to kill the government plan, said it would have unfair advantages over private insurers.
 ''It is impossible for the private sector to compete fairly with government, with all its muscle and all its tools,'' Mr. Ryan said. He predicted that many employers who now provided health benefits would ''dump their employees into the public plan.''
 Under the bill, the government plan would initially pay health care providers at rates pegged to Medicare rates, which are on average lower than what private insurers pay. Some Democrats joined Republicans in objecting to this provision.
 Mr. Pomeroy said: ''I have a serious problem with the public plan in this bill because it's based on Medicare rates.'' 
 At the White House, Mr. Obama continued his outreach effort on the health care issue by meeting with two senators who could provide crucial swing votes, Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. Ms. Snowe said she had urged Mr. Obama to back off his demand that the legislation be completed before the August recess.

HEADLINE: Defense Chief Criticizes Bid to Add F-22s

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Christopher Drew contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Saying he ''didn't molt from a hawk into a dove on Jan. 20, 2009,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates sharply criticized Congress on Thursday for trying to push more F-22 fighter jets into the Pentagon budget than he and President Obama say the country needs. 
 ''If we can't get this right, what on earth can we get right?'' Mr. Gates said in an acerbic, sometimes withering speech to the Economic Club of Chicago. ''It is time to draw the line on doing defense business as usual.'' From his point of view, that means overbuying weapons for wars the nation is unlikely to fight. 
 Mr. Gates, a Republican who served as defense secretary during the last two years of the George W. Bush administration, is in a standoff with the Senate over the F-22, the world's most expensive combat plane. Mr. Gates wants to cap the number at 187, but last month the Senate Armed Services Committee approved an amendment to set aside $1.75 billion for seven more. 
 To the consternation of the Pentagon and the White House, liberal Democrats like Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts have said they support the additional planes, arguing that their production can help preserve jobs in districts across the country. 
 In response, Mr. Obama reiterated a threat on Monday to veto next year's military spending bill unless the extra planes are removed. Mr. Gates went to Chicago to reinforce the message.
 ''The president has drawn that line, and that line is with regard to a veto, and it's real,'' Mr. Gates told the club, an 82-year-old civic group that is a favored forum for presidents, presidential candidates and cabinet secretaries to deliver important messages. In this case, Mr. Gates and his aides asked club members late last month if he could speak to them. The White House, Mr. Gates told reporters, helped set up the event.
 A Senate vote on the amendment is expected in days. Mr. Gates told reporters on Thursday that it looked ''pretty close.''
 Although Mr. Gates focused much of his speech on the F-22 and other programs he wants to cut back or scrap, like a new presidential helicopter -- he said it would allow ''the president, among other things, to cook dinner while in flight under nuclear attack'' -- he also made his larger argument for changing the way the Pentagon does business. In the half-trillion-dollar Pentagon budget for 2010 that Mr. Gates proposed in April, billions are to be shifted from traditional weapons systems to new technology to fight insurgencies like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 But the F-22, designed for cold-war aerial combat, has become the poster plane for each side. Mr. Gates argued to the economic club that it was a ''niche, silver-bullet solution'' for only a few potential situations, specifically ''the defeat of a highly advanced enemy fighter fleet,'' and that the cheaper F-35, which is to start production in 2012, is a more versatile fighter. The F-22's supporters say it not only provides jobs but also ensures American dominance of the skies. 
 Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Republican from Georgia who has led the fight for the plane, said in an interview this week that the F-22's strongest support had come from veteran senators in both parties who want continued American air superiority. ''That is what resonates,'' he said.
 Mr. Chambliss said the concern about losing military jobs had also been important, particularly for senators who are ''on the fence.'' Lockheed Martin Corporation assembles the plane in Mr. Chambliss' home state, in Marietta, and uses suppliers in 44 states.
 Mr. Gates, in speaking to reporters, said with some exasperation that ''the more they buy of stuff we don't need, the less we have available for the stuff we do,'' adding: ''It's just as simple as that. It ain't a complicated problem.''
 In his speech, he said that in more than four decades in government, ''I have generally been known as a hawk on national security,'' and that ''I haven't changed.''
 Earlier in the day, in a visit to Fort Drum, N.Y., Mr. Gates said he was looking at a proposal by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, to increase temporarily the size of the Army by 30,000 more personnel than already planned, up to some 577,000.

HEADLINE: Limits Reinstated on Logging in Old-Growth Forests, Reversing Bush Policy

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
In a move to protect endangered species, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Thursday that his department had reversed a Bush administration decision to double the amount of logging allowed in and around old-growth forests in western Oregon.
 Veering between swipes at ''indefensible'' moves by the Bush administration and pledges to step up noncontroversial timber sales, Mr. Salazar said in a conference call with reporters that he was reinstating a compromise reached 15 years ago to limit logging with the goal of protecting watersheds, trout and salmon fisheries and endangered birds like the northern spotted owl.
 ''Today we are taking action to reform the Department of Interior and correct mistakes by correcting legal shortcuts the late administration made at the end of its tenure,'' Mr. Salazar said. 
 The Bush policy, challenged in the courts by environmentalists, would have allowed timber companies to cut up to 502 million board-feet of lumber annually from 2.6 million acres of forests in the region, or about double the amount allowed under the Northwest Forest Plan, which was adopted in 1994 under President Bill Clinton.
 In fighting the Bush plan, known as the Western Oregon Plan Revisions -- or to its detractors, ''Whopper'' -- environmentalists argued that the department's Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the forests, had failed to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service about the logging's impact on endangered and threatened species. 
 Environmentalists also took issue with a related decision that narrowed the extent of protected habitat for the spotted owl.
 The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult wildlife agencies about potential consequences of prospective actions.
 Kristen Boyles, a lawyer with the environmental group Earthjustice, praised the reversal of the Bush policy on Thursday. ''Whopper was not going to be the ticket for Oregon,'' she said. ''It would have been a sea of stumps, and not what we needed to see in working Oregon forests.'' 
 She added, ''This is a big step for the Obama administration to take.'' 
 Still, Mr. Salazar's decision to reverse that policy during a severe recession was fraught: at 12.1 percent, the unemployment rate in Oregon is among the highest in the country. In Douglas County, where the forestlands involved are located, the unemployment rate is 16.9 percent, in large part because of closings of sawmills and the loss of timber jobs.
 Tom Partin, president of the American Forest Resource Council, expressed frustration with the reversal. ''Oregon is facing double-digit unemployment,'' he said in a statement. Opening up logging under the Bush administration's plan ''would have given our timber-dependent communities a real boost.'' 
 But Mr. Salazar said the Obama administration hopes ''to move beyond the battles of the past'' while reviewing possible updates to the 15-year-old Northwest Forest Plan.
 In a question-and-answer post Thursday on its Web site, the Interior Department listed several timber sales it said it was preparing in Oregon that would create at least 200 jobs. 
 Tom Strickland, the Interior Department's assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks, said in the conference call that such timber sales, now on a fast track, would most likely focus on smaller-diameter trees.
 But Ann Forest Burns, a spokeswoman for the American Forest Resource Council, a timber-industry group, questioned that approach. ''Just thinning the second growth will not restore the health of these forests and will not be what these communities need,'' Ms. Burns said.
 Some economists, however, argue that the timber economy in Oregon suffers less from logging restrictions than from the housing downturn and new low-cost competition from logging companies overseas. 
 Despite the logging limits, spotted owl numbers have continued to decline since the Northwest Forest Plan was put in place in 1994. Dominick DellaSala, chief scientist for the nonprofit National Center for Conservation Science and Policy and an expert on the species, said competition from its more aggressive cousin, the barred owl, had hampered the spotted owl's recovery. 
 ''We need to continue to protect the old forest to let these two owl species settle out their differences,'' Dr. DellaSala said.

HEADLINE: Eastern Europe Is Uneasy Over U.S. Ties With Russia

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
The deep concern among America's Eastern European allies over improved relations between Russia and the United States spilled into the open on Thursday when 22 prominent figures, including Poland's Lech Walesa and the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel, published an open letter to the Obama administration begging not to be forgotten.
 In the letter, the leaders urged President Obama and his top policy makers to remember their interests as they negotiate with Russia and review plans for missile defense bases in Poland and the Czech Republic. Abandoning the missile defense plan or giving Russia too big a role in it could ''undermine the credibility of the United States across the whole region,'' the letter said. 
 The letter was published on the Web site of the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and was signed by former presidents, like Mr. Walesa and Mr. Havel, as well as other former heads of state, top diplomats and intellectuals from a broad range of countries, including Hungary, Bulgaria and Estonia.
 ''Our region is one part of the world that Americans have largely stopped worrying about,'' the letter said, even though ''all is not well either in our region or in the trans-Atlantic relationship.'' 
 While the letter covered a range of issues, including the dangers presented to the young democracies in the region by the economic crisis, Russia was clearly central to the worries expressed by the drafters.
 ''There is the fear among Central and Eastern Europeans that our interest in keeping the trans-Atlantic bond could be somehow sold out to the relationship with Russia,'' Alexandr Vondra, a former minister of foreign affairs for the Czech Republic, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
 Expressing concerns about the growing weakness of NATO, the leaders said that Mr. Obama's call at the recent NATO summit for ''credible defense plans for all Alliance members was welcome, but not sufficient to allay fears about the Alliance's defense readiness.''
 As geostrategic interests from Afghanistan to Iran to North Korea have demanded Russian logistical or diplomatic assistance, anxiety has risen among the states known collectively as New Europe. Russia's invasion of Georgia last August only intensified those fears, as much through the American response as through Russia's own actions.
 ''The Georgia war exposed that there is a limit to what the United States will or can do to respond to military conflict in the neighborhood,'' said Angela E. Stent, who served as the top Russia officer at the United States government's National Intelligence Council until 2006 and now directs Russian studies at Georgetown University.
 She added that the intentions of the administration toward its allies were not yet completely clear. ''Until now, we've heard a Russian policy but not a policy for Russia's neighborhood,'' Ms. Stent said.
 The economic crisis masked these tensions for a while, but the problems never really went away in these countries, where Russia is seen as ''a revisionist power pursuing a 19th-century agenda with 21st-century tactics and methods,'' according to the letter, and where any warming of relations between Washington and Moscow raises hackles. Mr. Obama's trip to Moscow last week did nothing to reassure nervous allies in Eastern Europe.
 ''We all understand that a deal must come with Russia, but we do not believe that a deal can be made at the expense of the security interests of the countries of our region or of Georgia and Ukraine,'' said Eugeniusz Smolar, senior fellow at the Center for International Relations, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Warsaw.
 There is also a sense among many analysts and politicians in the region that the new administration does not understand Russia's true nature -- that friendly words from the Russian leadership when Mr. Obama is in Moscow are just words, while events like the murder of a Russian human rights campaigner on Wednesday showed the true state of Russia's civil society.
 The former leaders also warned about threats within their own countries and across Europe, driven by the economic crisis, which had provided ''opportunities for the forces of nationalism, extremism, populism and anti-Semitism,'' according to the letter.
 ''Domestically these countries used to be led by idealistic leaders. That's still the case in some of these countries, but not all,'' said Kadri Liik, director of the International Center for Defense Studies in Tallinn, Estonia, who was among the drafters of the letter.

HEADLINE: In Push for Cancer Screening, Limited Benefits

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
''Don't forget to check your neck,'' says an advertising campaign encouraging people to visit doctors for exams to detect thyroid cancer. 
 In another cancer awareness effort, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, has more than 350 House co-sponsors for her bill to promote the early detection of breast cancer in young women, teaching them about screening methods like self-exams and genetic testing. 
 Meanwhile, the foundation of the American Urological Association has a prostate cancerawareness campaign starring Hall of Fame football players. ''Get screened,'' Len Dawson, a former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, says in a public service television spot. ''Don't let prostate cancer take you out of the game.''
 Nearly every body part susceptible to cancer now has an advocacy group, politician or athlete with a public awareness campaign to promote routine screening tests -- even though it is well established that many of these exams offer little benefit for the general public. 
 An upshot of the decades-long war on cancer is the popular belief that healthy people should regularly examine their bodies or undergo screening because early detection saves lives. But in fact, except for a few types of cancer, routine screening has not been proven to reduce the death toll from cancer for people without specific symptoms or risk factors -- like a breast lump or a family history of cancer -- and could even lead to harm, many experts on health say. 
 That is why the continued rollout of screening campaigns, and even the introduction of a Congressional bill, worries some health experts. And these experts say such efforts add to the large number of expensive and unnecessary treatments each year that help drive up the nation's health care bill. Rather than heed mass-market calls for screening, these experts urge people without symptoms or special risks to talk to their own doctors about what cancer tests, if any, might be appropriate for them.
 Blanket screenings do come with medical risks. A recent European study on prostate cancer screening indicated that saving one man's life from the disease would require screening about 1,400 men. But among those 1,400, 48 others would undergo treatments like surgery or radiation procedures that would not improve their health because the cancer was not life-threatening to begin with or because it was too far along. And those treatments could lead to complications including impotence, urinary incontinence and bowel problems. 
 Then there is the economic cost. There are no credible estimates for the amount that routine cancer screening contributes to the approximately $700 billion spent each year in this country on unneeded medical treatment of all types. But health policy experts say such screenings and the cascade of follow-up tests and treatments do play a role. 
 For example, Americans spend an estimated $4 billion annually on mammograms, according to Dr. David H. Newman, author of the book ''Hippocrates' Shadow: Secrets from the House of Medicine.'' Some of those tests cause false alarms that lead to unnecessary follow-up surgery on normal breasts, at a cost of $14 billion to $70 billion over a decade, according to Dr. Newman, the director of clinical research in the department of emergency medicine at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan.
 Check Your Neck?
 Cancer awareness campaigns can be a disservice to the public by making people overestimate their risk of dying from cancer, according to Dr. Steven Woloshin, a researcher at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. Thyroid cancer, for example, is a rare disease that kills an estimated 1,600 Americans a year. But the campaign called ''Check Your Neck'' makes it seem as if everyone should worry about the disease, Dr. Woloshin said. 
 ''Confidence kills. Thyroid cancer doesn't care how healthy you are,'' reads the text of one ad that has appeared in national magazines like People. The ads promote a quick physical exam, called palpation, in which doctors feel for unusual lumps in the thyroid, a small gland in the front of the neck. ''Ask your doctor to check your neck. It could save your life.''
 The campaign is part of an effort by the Light of Life Foundation, an advocacy group for thyroid cancer patients founded by Joan Shey, who was told she had the disease in 1995.
 A Manhattan advertising agency designed the ads as a pro bono project after one of its own employees was found to have the disease. Bernie Hogya, one of the creators behind the ''Got Milk'' ads, created the cancer awareness campaign. Full-page ads valued at $800,000 have run free in national magazines like Sports Illustrated. 
 Ms. Shey said the campaign was intended to save lives through the early detection of cancer.
 Dr. R. Michael Tuttle, an endocrinologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan who is on the foundation's board, said he hoped the campaign would remind busy family care doctors and gynecologists to check routinely for the disease. The campaign could also prompt people with symptoms like nodules or swollen lymph nodes in their necks to see their doctors, Dr. Tuttle said. 
 But there is no evidence that routine neck exams reduce the risk of dying from thyroid cancer, said Dr. Barnett S. Kramer, the associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health, which has a cancer Web site describing the potential benefits and risks of many cancer screening tests. Most thyroid cancers are so slow-growing and curable that early detection would not improve their prognosis, he said, while a rarer form of thyroid cancer is so aggressive that a surge in screening would be unlikely to have an impact on the death rate. 
 But routine screening, he said, does have the potential to do harm because neck exams can find tumors that would not otherwise have required treatment, potentially setting off a cascade of unnecessary events like ultrasounds, needle biopsies in the neck, operations to remove the thyroid and complications like damage to the vocal cords. Meanwhile, Dr. Kramer said, the exams can miss some life-threatening cancers that are not detectable by touch. 
 The ''Check Your Neck'' campaign is one of many that prompt Dr. Kramer to compare mass cancer screening to a lottery. ''In exchange for those few who win the lottery,'' he said, ''there are many, many others who have to pay the price in human costs.'' 
 Dr. Ned Calonge, the chairman of the United States Preventive Services Task Force said, ''There are five things that can happen as a result of screening tests, and four of them are bad.'' His group consists of independent medical experts that Congress has commissioned to make recommendations, based on medical evidence, about what preventive measures actually work.
 When Screenings Are Bad
 The one good result of screening, Dr. Calonge said, is identifying a life-threatening form of cancer that actually responds to timely intervention. 
 The possible bad outcomes, he said, are results that falsely indicate cancer and cause needless anxiety and unnecessary procedures that can lead to complications; that fail to diagnose an existing cancer, which could lull a patient into ignoring real symptoms as the cancer progresses; that detect slow-growing or stable cancers that are not life-threatening and would not otherwise have required treatment; and that detect aggressive life-threatening cancers whose outcome is not changed by early detection.
 Experts like Dr. Calonge say screening is useful only if, on balance, the deaths prevented by treating cancers outweigh the harm done by treatments that are not medically necessary. The problem is, most current screening tests are not sophisticated enough to determine which cancers might not require treatment -- or to predict which life-threatening cancers will respond to treatment. 
 He is among those suggesting that people consult their doctors about whether to be screened and not make decisions based on public awareness campaigns. And doctors, experts say, should make sure they understand the pros and cons of screening and be sure to tell patients about the possible risks.
 No one advocates that people eschew tests if they have symptoms or special risk factors. ''Once something bothers you or changes or is unusual, this is no longer routine screening,'' Dr. Calonge said. 
 But, for otherwise healthy people with no symptoms, he said, only a few routine tests have proven to significantly reduce cancer deaths among certain age groups. The task force recommends pap smears for cervical cancer beginning no later than age 21; regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer in women starting at age 40; and tests for colon cancer starting at age 50. And the task force notes that the evidence supporting the breast cancer screening is not as strong as for cervical and colon cancers. 
 Most other types of screening, meanwhile, have not been proved to reduce the death toll from cancer, said Dr. Kramer at the National Institutes of Health.
 ''You need a high bar of evidence to start advertising screening to healthy people, most of whom will not benefit,'' Dr. Kramer said.
 Indeed, the federal Centers for Disease Control makes it clear on its Web site: there is no medical proof yet that routine screening for lung, ovarian, prostate and skin cancer reduces deaths from those cancers.''
 Legislation in Congress that deals with breast cancer has become a flashpoint in the debate over cancer screening for the general public.
 The bill, introduced in the House in March, is called the Breast Cancer Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act of 2009, or the Early Act. It mandates an education and media campaign, aimed at women under 45 and their physicians, on the early detection of breast cancer. 
 A Teaching Campaign
 The bill would spend $45 million over five years to teach young women and their doctors to recognize breast abnormalities. It would promote lifestyle changes like eating habits to reduce the chances of getting the disease. It would focus special attention on members of certain racial or ethnic groups who are at higher risk for more aggressive cancers. It would also provide grants to groups supporting young women with breast cancer. 
 The bill's sponsor, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, was told she had breast cancer in 2007. Breast-cancer advocacy groups, like the Young Survival Coalition and Susan G. Komen for the Cure, said they hoped the bill would teach young women to notice changes in their bodies, talk to their doctors and seek second opinions when necessary.
 ''It is worth spending the federal government's money, because it will save lives,'' Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in an interview. 
 But critics say the House bill promotes techniques like breast self-exams that have not proved to find cancer at an earlier stage or to save lives. The concern is that the technique could cause younger women -- a group for whom breast cancer is a rare disease -- to find too many medically insignificant nodules that would lead doctors to perform unneeded biopsies, in which tissue is removed for testing. 
 Scarring from biopsies could make breast cancer harder to detect when the women are older and have a much higher risk of getting the disease, critics say. And such false alarms can also cause women to distrust the medical system and skip mammograms later in life when the tests have been proved to reduce the death toll, said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, an oncologist who is the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. 
 The breast self-exam is a formal procedure in which women are taught to examine their breast tissue monthly, inch by inch and layer by layer, in a grid pattern. But instead of such a thorough probing, which might detect minute irregularities of no medical significance, many cancer institutions now recommend a less formal process called ''breast self-awareness''. Its premise is that women should become familiar with their breasts and seek medical attention if they notice a change like a persistent lump or rash.
 Opposition to the Early Act surfaced soon after its introduction, in a specialist newsletter called the Cancer Letter.
 In it, some prominent public health and cancer experts attacked the bill's central tenet -- that lifestyle changes and early-detection methods had been proved to reduce breast cancer deaths in women in their 20s and 30s who have no special risks for the disease.
 Routine mammograms, for example, which have been shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer in older women, have not proved to reduce the toll in women in their 20s and 30s, said Dr. Susan M. Love, a breast cancer surgeon in Santa Monica, Calif. That is because breast tissue in younger women is typically too dense for routine mammograms to be effective. And this test can needlessly expose young women to radiation, Dr. Love said. 
 ''Once you have made women more 'aware' of their potential risk, you will have nothing to tell them to do!'' Dr. Love wrote in a letter to Ms. Wasserman Schultz asking her not to pursue the bill. 
 Dr. Love and other critics have also argued that a public health campaign could cause younger women to overestimate their chances of dying from breast cancer. Of the estimated 41,000 deaths a year in the United States from breast cancer, about 1 in 14 involve women younger than 45, according to the C.D.C. Only 1 in 33 breast cancer deaths -- about 1,200 a year -- occurs in women younger than 40. 
 Defending the Bill
 Ms. Wasserman Schultz says her bill is necessary because too many women do not pay attention to their breast health until they are 40 or older. ''Leaving young women in the dark, just because there is a group of experts who believe we don't know what to tell them, isn't right,'' she said. Ms. Wasserman Schultz said a panel of experts overseen by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would create the breast cancer campaign based on the latest medical science. She said the legislation did not endorse any particular methods of early detection. Yet it does call for a report to measure the campaign's impact -- including the percentage of young women who perform breast self-exams and the frequency of such exams.
 Ms. Wasserman Schultz's bill has been referred to committees in both the House and Senate. ''Ultimately,'' she said, ''Congress will decide.''
 But Dr. Brawley of the American Cancer Society said the Early Act reminded him of the 1960s, when the cancer society teamed up with the advice columnist Ann Landers for an awareness campaign to promote routine chest X-rays for the early detection of lung cancer. The test later proved to increase medical complications without reducing the cancer death toll, he said.
 ''It is a real problem,'' Dr. Brawley said of well-meaning members of Congress. ''They are doing things that might actually harm the people they want to help.''

HEADLINE: Obama Gives Fiery Address at N.A.A.C.P. 100th Anniversary Celebration

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
President Obama delivered a fiery sermon to black America on Thursday night, warning black parents that they must accept their own responsibilities by ''putting away the Xbox and putting our kids to bed at a reasonable hour,'' and telling black children that growing up poor is no reason to get bad grades.
 ''No one has written your destiny for you,'' he said, directing his remarks to ''all the other Barack Obamas out there'' who might one day grow up to be president. ''Your destiny is in your hands, and don't you forget that. That's what we have to teach all of our children! No excuses! No excuses!'' 
 Mr. Obama spoke for 45 minutes to an audience of several thousand people, most of them black, , clad in tuxedos and ball gowns, who had gathered in a ballroom of the Hilton New York to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's largest civil rights organization. 
 He was one part politician and one part black preacher as he spoke in lilting cadences, his voice quiet at times, thundering at others, in unusually personal terms. At one point, when his audience shouted back at him, repeating his words, he threw back his head and laughed, saying, ''I've got an amen corner back there.''
 Mr. Obama spoke directly about his own upbringing, crediting his mother (who was white) with setting him straight, and departing from his prepared text to talk about how his life might have turned out had she not. ''When I drive through Harlem and I drive through the South Side of Chicago and I see young men on the corners,'' he said, ''I say there but for the grace of God go I.''
 It was an unusual moment for a president who has sought to transcend race and has only reluctantly embraced his unique place in history. Six months into his presidency, Mr. Obama has seemed more comfortable embracing his identity as the first black American president overseas than at home, as was the case during his trip to Ghana last week, when he declared, ''I have the blood of Africa within me.''
 At home, though, Mr. Obama has largely avoided talking about himself in racial terms. As a candidate, he jumped into the issue of race relations when his campaign was threatened by the controversial remarks of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., and delivered a pointed speech to black fathers on Father's Day in 2008. 
 But the White House was low-key in preparations for the N.A.A.C.P. event. When a reporter tried to cast the speech as Mr. Obama's first to the black community, the press secretary, Robert Gibbs, demurred, saying, ''I think the first speech to black America and the first speech to white America, the first speech to America was the Inaugural Address.''
 But there was no mistaking Thursday night that Mr. Obama was speaking directly to black America. In part, it was a policy speech.
 Mr. Obama told his audience what it wanted to hear on housing, the criminal justice system, education, health care, and jobs -- all issues central to the N.A.A.C.P.'s agenda. 
 Even as he urged blacks to take responsibility for themselves, he spoke of the societal ills -- high unemployment, the housing and energy crisis -- that have created the conditions for black joblessness. And he said the legacy of the Jim Crow era is still felt, albeit in different ways today.
 ''Make no mistake, no mistake: the pain of discrimination is still felt in America,'' Mr. Obama said, by African-American women who are paid less for the same work as white men, by Latinos ''made to feel unwelcome,'' by Muslim Americans ''viewed with suspicion'' and by ''our gay brothers and sisters, still taunted, still attacked, still denied their rights.''
 Mr. Obama paid particular attention to education, declaring that more than 50 years after the Supreme Court's landmark segregation case, Brown v. Board of Education, ''the dream of a world-class education is still being deferred all across this country'' as African-American students lag behind white classmates in reading and math.
 The organization's president, Benjamin T. Jealous, said afterward that the address ''was the most forthright speech on the racial disparities still plaguing our nation'' Mr. Obama has given since moving into the White House. 
 But as much as a policy speech, it was a personal one. Details of the address were closely held, partly because Mr. Obama was still working on it through the afternoon. 
 Aides said he intended to make the case for personal responsibility -- a frequent theme of his presidency -- in the context of the civil rights movement and how it has shaped his own life. But he also wanted to send a message to black parents, and especially to black children.
 ''They might think they've got a pretty jump shot or a pretty good flow,'' Mr. Obama said, ''but our kids can't all aspire to be LeBron or Lil Wayne. I want them aspiring to be scientists and engineers, doctors and teachers, not just ballers and rappers. I want them aspiring to be a Supreme Court justice. I want them aspiring to be president of the United States of America.''

HEADLINE: Harry and Louise Return, With a New Message

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
HARRY and Louise have changed their minds about health care reform.
 The fictional suburban couple featured in a series of national television spots sponsored by the health insurance industry in 1993 and 1994 stoked fears that helped doom a government-created health plan promoted by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. 
 ''Having choices we don't like is no choice at all,'' the Louise character fretted to her husband in one spot set around a kitchen table stacked with medical bills. 
 Now, the same actors are back in a new campaign, this time to support a government overhaul of the medical system promoted by a Democratic president, Barack Obama. 
 The ad's sponsors -- a trade group representing drug makers and Families USA, a nonprofit group advocating affordable medical care -- reflect the strange bedfellows lining up behind the latest reform effort.
 ''A little more cooperation, a little less politics,'' Louise says to Harry in the new spot, scheduled to appear on cable and network stations this weekend, ''and we can get the job done this time.''
 The main issues -- accessible, affordable and portable medical coverage -- have not changed since the 1990s. But the reappearance of Harry and Louise as the avatars of health care reform dovetails with a new economic reality for consumers. 
 The early-middle-aged Harry and Louise in the 1990s ads were concerned about their own welfare and their own pocketbooks. They were white middle-class me-generation professionals scripted to raise red flags about the fear of losing private health insurance. Now, the mellowed AARP-eligible Harry and Louise of this campaign seem more charitable and outward-directed. They even invoke the plight of the uninsured.
 Which either means that Harry and Louise have changed, or that the actors who play them -- Harry Johnson and Louise Caire Clark -- are adept at emoting whatever political point of view they are paid to evoke. For their sponsors, the characters' seeming empathy is meant to reflect a climate in which mounting unemployment, combined with the high cost of health insurance for individuals and small businesses, has created a new urgency for change.
 ''We ought to work together to find a good and successful health care compromise,'' said Billy Tauzin, the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, a sponsor of the new spot. ''Middle-class people like Harry and Louise are not going to be living in a successful society if we don't do something about it.''
 The campaign could also garner good will from politicians for the group, which last month pledged $80 billion in savings to help further health reform.
 This is actually the fifth television campaign for Harry and Louise.
 The first tour placed the couple in familiar suburban scenes to raise pointed questions about the Clinton health care plan. At a time when the insurance industry felt excluded from the process, which was led by Hillary Rodham Clinton and an adviser, Ira C. Magaziner, Harry and Louise were meant to galvanize the kind of middle-class Americans who might be talking about health care reform as they sat in their kitchens looking at bills. More than a dozen different commercials ran in 1993 and 1994, at a cost of about $14 million. 
 ''Harry and Louise began a dialog with the American people in a sense,'' said Charles N. Kahn III, who oversaw the original campaign as the executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group that later merged with another group to become America's Health Insurance Plans. ''This was not done to beat health reform. It was done to get the attention of policy makers.''
 But many industry analysts viewed that series as attack ads that helped scuttle the Clinton version of health reform.
 Mr. Kahn reincarnated Harry and Louise in 2000 for a campaign to urge legislators to adopt an industry proposal to help people buy private insurance.
 Ben Goddard, a public affairs executive whose firm, Goddard Claussen, created all of the campaigns, used the couple a third time in ads to oppose a bill that would have curbed stem cell research. In 1997, Mr. Goddard married the actress Ms. Clark.
 But the real comeback for the couple occurred last year, when a group of nonprofit associations, including Families USA, sponsored ads before the presidential election in which the couple urged candidates of both parties to put health care at the top of their agendas.
 Now Families USA has teamed up with PhRMA for a $4 million campaign to be broadcast starting this weekend on channels like CNN, MSNBC, Fox, Comedy Central and on some network news and Sunday talk shows. 
 ''This is really a historic opportunity,'' said Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA. ''We have a better chance of getting health reform done than ever before.''
 For political news media analysts, however, Harry and Louise signify more than mere icons of health reform. The original ads represent the first successful political issue campaign to activate consumers en masse to put pressure on Washington. The ads ushered in the era of political issue advertising as a major component of lobbying, said Evan Tracey, the chief operating officer of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising.
 Since that time, ''there hasn't been a major piece of policy, federal or state, that hasn't had an issue advocacy campaign,'' said Mr. Tracey. ''That's what, in essence, Harry and Louise gave birth to.''
 Mr. Tracey said the new ads, endorsing change, were unlikely to have the same impact as the first, more negative campaign. With Congress seemingly determined to pass a health care package this year, the return of Harry and Louise as cheerleaders for reform may be aimed mainly at keeping the issue at the top of the news cycle. 
 Instead of framing the debate, in other words, Harry and Louise may now be symbols of going with the flow. ''What would health care reform be without them?'' Mr. Tracey said.

HEADLINE: Geithner Sees Evidence Of a Financial Recovery

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Thursday that financial markets were sending ''important signs of recovery,'' as he also sought to play down concerns about a new wave of bonuses on Wall Street. 
 The comments were in part a reaction to the quick resurgence in earnings at two of the largest United States investment banks this week. JPMorgan Chase announced a $2.7 billion second-quarter profit from stellar trading and investment banking results on Thursday, while Goldman Sachs announced a $3.4 billion quarterly profit on Monday.
 Goldman has earmarked $11.4 billion so far this year to compensate its workers, raising the prospect that high bonus incentives might prompt another period of excessive risk-taking.
 ''We are seeing some very important signs of recovery and repair in U.S. markets, which is essential for recovery,'' Mr. Geithner told an online forum moderated by the French financial publication Les Echos. ''The best signs of this are in the amount of new capital that has come into the U.S. financial system, the improvement in risk premia and credit spreads, and the beginnings of improvement in consumer and business confidence.''
 At the same time, he said, the Obama administration will ''work with the Congress to put in place comprehensive reform of the financial system.''
 ''Part of this will require changes to compensation practices to make them better aligned with risk,'' he said. ''We don't want to see a return to the pattern of practices that helped cause this crisis.''
 Mr. Geithner was speaking on the last leg of a trip that has also taken him to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and London. After meetings here with the French economy and finance minister, Christine Lagarde, and Prime Minister Francois Fillon, he appeared to play down perceived differences with Europeans over the approach to bolstering financial supervision.
 ''Our approaches are very similar,'' he said of the views of the two powers on regulating financial firms. ''We need a common, global solution to these global markets, not separate regional solutions.''
 Last week, as the Treasury secretary urged lawmakers to pass the administration's plan to regulate derivatives, he also said he was concerned that Europeans might seek to ''come up with a separate approach.''
 Mrs. Lagarde told reporters that Paris and Washington agreed on many principles on rules for banks' capital requirements, even though there were still ''some points of disagreement on the leverage effects and their limits as they are applied or will be applied.''
 More generally, Mr. Geithner described European efforts at economic stimulus as ''quite substantial so far.''
 ''There are severe challenges ahead in parts of Eastern Europe and other parts of the world,'' he said. ''The force of the global policy response, however, is helping to arrest the force of the global recession.''
 The Treasury secretary said it was too early to make a judgment about whether the U.S. economy would need further stimulus measures and made assurances that Washington would not repeat the ''classic mistake'' of withdrawing stimulus too soon.

HEADLINE: With Credit Markets Still Frozen, CIT Shops for Investors

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The grim news from Washington arrived Wednesday afternoon at the Fifth Avenue offices of Jeffrey M. Peek: His teetering empire, the 101-year-old CIT Group, would get no bailout this time.
 The decision by federal officials left Mr. Peek, a longtime Wall Street executive, struggling to save CIT. By late Thursday, he was running out of time and options. 
 Unless CIT can raise billions of dollars, the company -- a source of financing for hundreds of thousands of small and midsize businesses across the country -- could file for bankruptcy protection within days. 
 CIT was locked in negotiations with investors late Thursday, hoping to persuade them to provide the company with $2 billion to $3 billion. Any deal, however, would hinge on a special waiver from the Federal Reserve, and time was short. 
 As the talks dragged on, the financial markets rendered a brutal judgment. Shares of CIT plunged $1.23, to 41 cents. The price of its bonds sank to 26 cents on the dollar. Fitch, the credit ratings agency, warned that a ''default of some kind appears imminent or inevitable.''
 After coming to CIT's aid seven months ago, by rushing through its application to become a traditional bank holding company and providing a $2.33 billion bailout, federal officials apparently concluded that CIT was too troubled to save a second time.
 ''They finally said, 'We're not going to throw good money after bad,' '' said Bert Ely, a banking analyst.
 It may take some time before the fallout of a potential collapse becomes clear. It is unknown, for instance, how many small businesses that now rely on CIT might be unable to find alternative financing and could slide into bankruptcy themselves. It is also unknown how much -- if anything -- taxpayers will recoup from the $2.33 billion bailout.
 What is clear is that CIT's management, including Mr. Peek, miscalculated. CIT, analysts said, clearly believed it would get additional government support. As many banks rushed to raise capital this spring, CIT did not. Neither did it sell businesses to raise money.
 More critical, however, some analysts wondered why Mr. Peek had not tried to address CIT's Achilles' heel: It relies on money that it borrows in the capital markets to make loans to its customers. Once the credit markets froze over, the company was in peril. 
 ''They've been struggling and getting slowly strangled for two years,'' Mr. Ely said.
 It is a stunning turn of events for Mr. Peek, whose grand visions of building a financial empire are now in ruins. A longtime Wall Street executive who lost out on the top job years ago at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Peek saw CIT in late 2003 as his ticket to chief executive-land.
 An under-the-radar finance company that had its roots in the stable, but decidedly hum-drum business of providing loans and leases for heavy machinery, technology equipment and other staples of the manufacturing economy, CIT was a diamond in the rough in the eyes of Mr. Peek. With some polish, he believed it could sparkle.
 Throughout CIT's long history, however, the company had a habit of getting into trouble whenever it veered from its well-worn path.
 The company was battered in the mid-1990s by a trip into manufactured houses and boats. Later, after buying a technology leasing company at the height of the dot-com bubble, CIT sought refuge from its steep losses in the arms of Tyco International.
 When Tyco started getting squeezed by an emerging accounting scandal, it quickly spun off CIT, getting about half of what it had paid just a year earlier.
 Shortly afterward, Mr. Peek entered the picture.
 A friendly executive with Midwestern roots but refined Manhattan tastes, Mr. Peek had spent decades on Wall Street and was gazing at the corner suite.
 Mr. Peek denied that he had lofty ambitions to turn CIT into the type of bank that would have competed with the likes of Merrill Lynch. But he did pursue multiple acquisitions, including a costly deal for a student-lending company, and aggressively pushed CIT's existing home-lending activities near the peak of the frothy housing market.
 Seeking a brighter spotlight, Mr. Peek moved CIT's headquarters from Livingston, N.J., to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where CIT's new building featured a lobby adorned with dark stone floors and moody purple lighting.
 Mr. Peek also pumped up CIT's giving to various New York City nonprofit organizations and cultural centers.
 Mr. Peek and his wife, Liz, a business commentator, were longtime fixtures on the social circuit, holding fashionable soirees at their Upper East Side apartment.
 As the subprime mortgage market began to collapse, however, in 2007, so did Mr. Peek's strategy. Starting in the second quarter of that year, CIT's losses began mounting and it quickly became more difficult and more expensive for it to borrow in the markets.
 And while Mr. Peek's critics say he was depending too much on federal regulators to save the company again, others say he had little choice.
 ''That was their one and only option. They needed to have outside support and the only game in town right now is the government,'' said David Havens, a credit analyst at Hexagon Securities.

HEADLINE: Budget Office Questions Controls on Costs in Current Health Care Legislation

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Thursday that the health care legislation proposed so far would not curb the federal government's runaway spending on medical care, and that lawmakers would need to take more forceful action to meet President Obama's goal of controlling costs. 
 The testimony by the director, Douglas W. Elmendorf, before the Senate Budget Committee drew criticism from Democratic leaders, highlighting their rising frustration over the difficulty of paying for an overhaul. 
 Asked about the testimony by Mr. Elmendorf, a highly regarded economist, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, snapped derisively, ''Maybe what he should do is run for Congress.''
 Mr. Reid's barb and similar criticism earlier in the day from the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, amounted to the legislative equivalent of arguing balls and strikes in baseball. The budget office is supposed to be an impartial scorekeeper, and the White House has said that the health care legislation must be paid for in accordance with budget office rules. 
 Mr. Elmendorf's testimony also provided ammunition to Republican critics, who have said for weeks that the proposed legislation would raise costs and fail to cover all Americans. 
 ''Today's announcement by the independent C.B.O. confirms what Republicans have been saying all along,'' Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the chairman of the Republican conference, said in a statement. ''The health care proposal by Congressional Democrats amounts to a government takeover of our health care economy.''
 Mr. Elmendorf's testimony came on an extraordinarily busy day on health care issues. 
 At the White House, Mr. Obama cheered the news that the American Medical Association had announced its support for the House health care bill.
 Dr. Michael D. Maves, executive vice president of the association, told House leaders that the bill would expand coverage, impose stringent rules on insurers and block scheduled cuts in Medicare payments to doctors. 
 Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said: ''The historical significance of the A.M.A.'s support should not be underestimated. Quite honestly, it has been difficult to win the support of this organization going all the way back to the 1930s.''
 Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee, which has been trying to develop a bipartisan measure, broke off its negotiations for the weekend. Lawmakers said their staffs would continue working, and they urged patience from Mr. Obama. 
 And the House Ways and Means Committee endorsed two central elements of Mr. Obama's plan, voting to create the new government-run health plan that would compete with private insurers and to require employers to help finance insurance for their workers. 
 By a vote of 25 to 14, the committee rejected a Republican effort to strike the government health plan from comprehensive legislation that would offer insurance coverage to all Americans. 
 Ways and Means was one of three House committees to begin formal consideration of the legislation, which could reach the House floor for final approval this month. 
 The government-run health plan is among the components of the health care legislation that Mr. Elmendorf suggested did not have sufficient muscle to slow the federal spending on health care, which he called ''unsustainable.'' 
 The House bill and a similar measure approved Wednesday by the Senate health committee would broadly expand insurance coverage at a huge cost to the government. But Mr. Elmendorf, who said his office was still analyzing the proposals, said the legislation did not appear to offset those costs sufficiently. 
 ''In the legislation that has been reported, we do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount,'' Mr. Elmendorf said. ''And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs.'' 
 One step that would contribute in a large way to offsetting costs would be to tax some employer-provided health benefits, which are currently excluded from taxable income, Mr. Elmendorf said. 
 Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the budget committee, and Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, have advocated such a change but were forced to abandon it because of objections by Mr. Obama and other Democrats in Congress. 
 ''Basically, the president is not helping us,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''That's making it difficult.'' 
 The Finance Committee estimated that taxing some benefits over 10 years could raise $320 billion toward the roughly $1 trillion cost of the legislation. Mr. Baucus is now working on a menu of smaller proposals to fill that hole. 
 House Democratic leaders never supported taxing benefits, which could exact a heavy toll on union workers with generous health plans. Instead, the House Democrats proposed an income surtax on the highest wage earners that would yield about $550 billion over 10 years. 
 Lawmakers working on health care have expressed frustration with the budget office and with rules that make it difficult to document reductions in government health care spending. 
 The budget office, in its calculations, cannot take into account -- or ''score,'' to use Congressional budget lingo -- many of the savings that Democrats say will result from their legislation because those savings fall outside the direct control of federal law. 
 In the Ways and Means session, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, who offered the amendment to kill the government plan, said it would have unfair advantages over private insurers.
 ''It is impossible for the private sector to compete fairly with government, with all its muscle and all its tools,'' Mr. Ryan said. He predicted that many employers who now provided health benefits would ''dump their employees into the public plan.''
 Under the bill, the government plan would initially pay health care providers at rates pegged to Medicare rates, which are on average lower than what private insurers pay. Some Democrats joined Republicans in objecting to this provision.
 Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, said: ''I have a serious problem with the public plan in this bill because it's based on Medicare rates.'' 
 At the White House, Mr. Obama continued his outreach effort on the health care issue by meeting with two senators who could provide crucial swing votes, Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. Ms. Snowe said she had urged Mr. Obama to back off his demand that the legislation be completed before the August recess.

HEADLINE: For Corzine, a New Fund-Raising Reality

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Of all the gloomy economic indicators since the Wall Street collapse, perhaps the most startling one seen by New Jersey residents is this: Gov. Jon S. Corzine with his hand out.
 Mr. Corzine, 62, famously spent $60 million of his own money on a record-shattering Senate race in 2000, then $43 million more laying siege to Trenton four years ago. 
 But now, after a costly divorce and a steep decline in his net worth, Mr. Corzine, the onetime chief executive of Goldman Sachs, is in the unfamiliar position of seeking donations to help foot the bill for his campaign.
 It is not the easiest sell. 
 Mr. Corzine is trying to raise upward of $15 million from donors, according to people involved, which he hopes to match with no more than $25 million of his own. 
 He is calling wealthy donors personally to ask for money, holding receptions and staging larger events, like a performance by Jon Bon Jovi last month. 
 On Thursday, President Obama joined him at a $5,000- to $10,000-a-plate luncheon expected to raise more than $1 million. 
 In approaching donors, Mr. Corzine is a bit apologetic and a bit ill at ease, according to those who have observed him. He gets right to the point, though he does so politely. 
 ''He kind of has a Midwestern, aw-shucks approach: 'Sorry to be asking you for this, but it's important, for New Jersey and the country,' '' said Zenon Christodoulou, a member of the governor's campaign finance committee. 
 Bernard L. Schwartz, the retired chairman of Loral Space & Communications, said a somewhat downcast Mr. Corzine visited him in Manhattan recently to ask for money. The governor offered a clear-eyed assessment of his chances against Christopher J. Christie, a former federal prosecutor and the Republican nominee, telling Mr. Schwartz the race would be costly and he could not guarantee a victory as a return on Mr. Schwartz's investment.
 ''He said it was going to be a tough race,'' said Mr. Schwartz, a major Democratic donor. ''He was not happy about it.''
 Mr. Schwartz wrote a $25,000 check. 
 Mr. Corzine has accepted contributions before, but has never hunted them so aggressively. In 2005 , he raised less than $2 million from a few thousand donors in a token effort to show popular support; the remaining $43 million was his own, generated by cashing in his last Goldman shares. 
 Mr. Corzine declined a request for an interview about his fund-raising and personal finances. But since his entry into politics, he has experienced a precipitous drop in his net worth: to perhaps $150 million today from an estimated $400 million after he was forced out as chief executive and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs in 1999. 
 ''He doesn't specifically say it, but his finance team says it: 'Jon's not going to be putting in the same amount of money this year. It's going to be difficult for him to. You've got to help out the party,' '' said a Democratic operative who had been approached by Corzine fund-raisers. Having used up more than $100 million on his two previous races and having turned over half his assets to his ex-wife in their 2003 divorce, Mr. Corzine sustained big losses in the stock market's dive last year, advisers and friends say. Paying the full freight of another campaign, in after-tax dollars, would mean parting with a much bigger slice of his net worth, let alone his liquid assets.
 ''It used to be a hiccup for him,'' said Jennifer A. Steen, a political scientist who has studied self-financed political candidates. ''But if you're only worth $100 million, then it actually is a chunk of change.''
 For Mr. Corzine's financial team, the task is proving a heavy lift. He trails in the polls, and around half of New Jersey voters have a negative view of him. 
 The economy has squeezed fund-raising of all kinds. And his own pay-to-play reforms limit those doing business with the state from giving more than $300.
 (Mr. Christie is said to be having his own fund-raising problems, but he is participating in the state's public financing system, so he needs to raise only $3.6 million to receive matching funds; his spending will be capped at less than $11 million.)
 Several people trying to raise money for Mr. Corzine described resistance from prospective contributors who asked why the governor did not just reach into his wallet again.
 ''We always talk about it and joke about it, how it's like selling sand to the Saudis,'' said Mr. Christodoulou. ''But when people say, 'I'm having trouble paying my bills; what does he need my money for?' I just tell them, 'It's not fair to tell him to foot the bill himself.' ''
 Coming up with tens of millions of dollars in cash could prove harder for Mr. Corzine now than in 2000 and 2005, when he merely had to sell Goldman stock. With his Goldman shares gone, it is unclear how liquid he is: His latest yearly disclosure showed only that his cash on hand was ''greater than $500,000'' and that he had earned $10,000 to $50,000 in dividends and interest on checking and money-market accounts. Much more of his money appears to be spread among real estate investments, private equity funds and hedge funds, the records indicate.
 But those sectors were all hammered last year, and Mr. Corzine did not emerge unscathed. One of the private equity funds he invested most heavily in, TPG-Axon Partners, reportedly lost a third of its value in 2008. In all, Mr. Corzine disclosed that his adjusted gross income for the year was a $2.76 million loss.
 Still, while Mr. Corzine has made it clear that there is a limit to how much he can spend this year, those who know him well say his determination to win may overcome his desire to exercise restraint.
 Mr. Corzine's campaign attributes its fund-raising push not to need but to strategy, saying it is borrowing a page from the Obama campaign, building a network of support by recruiting more donors, including small-dollar contributors. As of the most recent state filings, Mr. Corzine had contributed $3.25 million to his campaign and raised $1.36 million from others, but fund-raising and expenses have ratcheted up considerably since. 
 Pressing for smaller donations, meanwhile, can create some unwelcome visuals, as it did last month, when Mr. Corzine drew screaming rock 'n' roll fans from as far as Hartford to a fund-raiser in Newark headlined by Mr. Bon Jovi.
 Some had come for the music, not the politics. Among them was Judy Grabler, a homemaker from Edison, N.J., who called Mr. Corzine ''out of touch'' and said she opposed much of what he had done as governor.
 Sitting in a $300 seat, Ms. Grabler said she was appalled when the singer disappeared after only three numbers. ''I kept thinking he would be back after the speeches,'' she said of Mr. Bon Jovi. But he did not return.
 Nor did hundreds of Corzine donors who had filed out just before the governor took the stage.

HEADLINE: Paulson Counters His Critics

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
What began Thursday as a Congressional hearing into the takeover of a single Wall Street firm quickly grew into a public interrogation of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, about his role in heading last year's rescue plan for the financial industry. 
 In a series of heated exchanges, several lawmakers accused Mr. Paulson of misleading Congress about how he had planned to use the $700 billion authorized under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Days after telling Congress last autumn that he intended to use the money to buy impaired mortgage assets, Mr. Paulson instead injected $250 billion directly into several large banks. 
 Representative Michael R. Turner, an Ohio Republican who voted against the relief legislation, called that move the ''largest theft in history.'' 
 ''I realized you were asking me to give taxpayer money to bail out these people who I believed were systematically defrauding my community,'' Mr. Turner said during a contentious hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Thursday.
 It was the first time since stepping down in January that Mr. Paulson had been able to address publicly the many decisions he made as Treasury secretary. 
 Mr. Paulson, a staunch critic of government intervention into the financial markets, defended his decision as necessary to prevent the financial system from collapsing. ''As the situation began to crumble all around the world, we needed to change gears,'' he said, adding that Congress had given him the flexibility to modify how the relief money was used.
 Mr. Paulson told the committee he was working for the benefit of all taxpayers and not just his former colleagues on Wall Street.
 ''The tragedy is that they didn't create the problem,'' Mr. Paulson said of the American people. ''It was the big banks that created the problem.'' But the taxpayers ''would be the ones that would pay the greatest penalty if there was a collapse.''
 But that explanation did not seem to sway the committee, which also questioned Mr. Paulson's ties to the investment bank Goldman Sachs. He came under sharp criticism for allowing Lehman Brothers to fail while bailing out American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and assisting on a deal to take over Bear Stearns.
 In the case of Lehman, Mr. Paulson said he could not find a buyer for the troubled institution in time to prevent it from collapsing and did not yet have access to the relief money. 
 The hearing was called to discuss the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the giant brokerage firm, by Bank of America during the height of the financial crisis. 
 On the Merrill deal, the committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Edolphus Towns of New York, called the transaction ''a marriage of convenience'' in which Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, ''got what he wanted and the Treasury and Fed got what they wanted,'' he said, referring to the Federal Reserve.
 ''Ken Lewis appears to have manipulated this unaccountable system to his benefit,'' Mr. Towns said. The congressman appeared to drop his earlier assertion that the government had inappropriately forced Bank of America to go through with the deal, even after discovering billions of dollars more in losses at Merrill.
 A number of lawmakers suggested that Mr. Lewis had threatened the government by suggesting Bank of America would abandon the Merrill deal unless it received more federal aid.
 Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, said Mr. Paulson had ignored warnings that top Bank of America officials committed a ''potentially illegal act'' by not sharing information about the extent of losses to shareholders prior to the Dec. 5 vote to approve the merger. 
 Mr. Paulson repeatedly defended himself during the hearing.
 Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, asserted, ''In many respects, I feel that the taxpayers bought Merrill Lynch for Bank of America.'' 
 Mr. Paulson's reply: ''What the taxpayer got was an averted calamity.''

HEADLINE: Trade Center Developer and Port Authority at Odds Again

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey rejected the use of more public money to guarantee financing for two private office towers at the World Trade Center on Friday. 
 In a letter to the developer of the site, Larry A. Silverstein, the agency criticized him for being willing to put just $75 million of equity into the two towers, which together will cost $4.2 billion.
 ''You demand that the public take on the risk that you and the private sector will not take,'' the agency wrote. ''It is unrealistic of Silverstein Properties to demand this extraordinary level of public subsidy, and it is not going to happen.''
 Mr. Silverstein, who is to build three towers at the site, rejected the Port Authority's most recent offer on the development, which included a condition that he raise $625 million from investors or lenders for the project.
 In a letter released by the Port Authority, he said its new offer was worse than earlier ones. It ''confiscates'' Tower 3, he said.
 The future of Tower 3 has been unclear as the Port Authority and Mr. Silverstein have fought for months over his request that it backstop his loans for Towers 2 and 4.
 Mr. Silverstein says the repeated delays in readying the 16-acre site for three office towers means that he has to find private financing just as the recession has banks leery of real estate loans and demand for Manhattan offices is low.
 The delays harm the city's economy, costing it construction jobs and discouraging companies from moving to Lower Manhattan.
 Although Mr. Silverstein is supposed to finish the first tower in the next few years, a long legal war would be likely if the agency tried to enforce that deadline. The latest exchange shows how badly the rebuilding has stalled after years of delays due to court fights with insurers and clashes over security and designs.

HEADLINE: Making Home A Safer Place, Affordably

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
Stay put or sell? 
 That's the question many older people ponder as they move into their 70s and beyond. 
 Most older people settle on staying put, according to a recent survey by the Home Safety Council, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing home-related injuries. (From the source of the survey, you can see where this column is heading, right?) 
 Staying put makes economic sense. It is not only more comfortable to live out your life in your own home, it's much more affordable. 
 The average annual fee at an assisted-living facility -- a place where older people live independently but also receive a host of services like medication monitoring and meals -- is $34,000. And in the nation's most expensive metropolitan areas, including New York, the costs may be closer to $70,000.
 But while home might be cozier and cheaper than a residential center, it's not always safer. Every year in this country about 7,000 elderly people die in home-related accidents, and millions are seriously injured. Falls are the leading cause of injuries, but the elderly are also at risk for being burned by the stove, scalded by hot water or drowning in the tub.
 The home ''environment can be a great support to independent living,'' says Jon Pynoos, professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. ''Or it can be a health care hazard.''
 After Maryann Connelly's mother fell and hurt herself two years ago, Ms. Connelly considered moving her to an assisted-living facility.
 But the mother, Catherine Fisher, who is in her 80s and has lived on her own for 18 years, had a two-word response -- ''No way!'' -- even though her rheumatoid arthritis made it difficult to walk up and down stairs and get in and out of chairs. 
 So Ms. Connelly and her siblings hired an occupational therapist to modify Ms. Fisher's two-story townhouse in Newton, N.J., to make it safer and easier for her to navigate. The therapist added, among other things, an electric stair lift and grab bars throughout the house. The total cost, for the therapist's fee, equipment and installation, was $4,500.
 As Ms. Connelly learned, an entire service industry is slowly taking shape around the goal of letting people age in place. If you want to make your own home or an older relative or friend's home a safer, more supportive place to live, here are basic guidelines to the most efficient and cost-effective approaches. 
 TAKING STOCK Learn where the potential hazards lie and how you can reduce them. For starters, go to the Home Safety Council's site, MySafeHome.net, and take the house tour, which points out possible dangers room by room. Many of the changes the site suggests are simple and inexpensive, like removing area rugs and installing brighter bulbs in hallways. 
 AARP also has an interactive home safety checklist created with the National Association of Homebuilders.
 A PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT If you have multiple medical issues, say arthritis and poor vision, ask your doctor for a referral to an occupational therapist -- an O.T., as they're known -- who specializes in home modifications. The O.T. can analyze your potential challenges and your home's shortcomings to come up with a plan that a contractor or handyman can easily follow. 
 ''An O.T. is your best source for doing the right thing,'' said Professor Pynoos, who is also the co-director of the Fall Prevention Center of Excellence, a state-supported organization in California. Gregg Frank, the O.T. who helped Ms. Connelly's mother, ''was able to analyze my mother's needs in a way we never would have been able to,'' Ms. Connelly said. 
 Mr. Frank raised the height of Ms. Fisher's chairs to make getting in and out them easier, for example, and installed threshold ramps and railings at the front door to make it safer for her to leave and enter the house on her own. 
 An O.T. can also supply you with an invoice that lists the medical necessity of each improvement -- a document that you might need to get reimbursed, say, from a long-term care insurer. 
 LONG-TERM CARE COVERAGE If you were far-sighted enough to have such a policy, call your insurance agent and ask whether home modifications are covered under your plan and what documentation you need to be reimbursed. A policy will not pay for upgrades if you are still healthy. 
 In general, regular health insurance does not cover physical upgrades to the home, though it often will pay for an occupational therapist to come in and do an assessment
 TAPPING HOME EQUITY If you want to make substantial changes to your home, but don't have the cash to pay for them, consider taking out a home equity loan. For information on ways you can tap into your home equity, go to LongTermCare.gov, a site run by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 While a home equity loan is your best option, if a bank won't give you such a loan, another possibility is a reverse mortgage. Available to people over 62, a reverse mortgage lets you convert the equity in your home into cash. But the fees can be substantial, so be sure to speak with a financial planner before taking out this type of mortgage. 
 WHEN MONEY IS SCARCE Contact your local department of aging and inquire about home modification loans and services available to seniors. Use the federal government's elder care locator -- www.eldercare.gov -- to find your local office, or call 800-677-1116. 
 Some government agencies make low-interest loans to those with low or moderate incomes. In addition, get in touch with Rebuilding Together (www.rebuildingtogether.org, or 1-800-473-4229), a national nonprofit organization that helps people with low incomes improve their homes. The organization's Safe at Home program was created specifically to help older people do just that: stay safe at home.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 22, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Patient Money column on Saturday, about ways to make a home safer for elderly people, misstated the financial backing of the Fall Prevention Center of Excellence. It is an organization supported by the Archstone Foundation, a nonprofit group in Long Beach, Calif., focused on issues related to aging. It is not supported by the state.

HEADLINE: Thinner Blue Line Curbs Crime As Police Dept. Adapts to Cuts

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
At a recent meeting at police headquarters in New York, debate erupted among the gathered commissioners, commanders and chiefs about the urgent question of the deployment of officers in a Bronx precinct.
 The borough commander made his case for keeping intact the 52nd Precinct's cadre of specialized officers, suggesting that removing them now would allow the most violent crimes -- shootings and robberies -- to surge back in the Fordham section of the borough. The bosses disagreed. Their analysis called for shifting the officers to a precinct that had seen some of its own troubling developments.
 The participants mounted arguments, calling on history and fresh data both. Maps of crime trends -- first for the entire borough, then down to the streets surrounding St. James Park -- were flashed on a wall. In the end, the 52nd Precinct would keep its special contingent of officers, but the question of how long they would remain was kept open.
 There are tensions, though, many of them imperceptible to the public, in a force hurtling toward its lowest head count in memory: The New York City Police Department is set to shrink to 34,304 officers within a year, which is 16 percent fewer than the department's high of 41,000 nearly a decade ago. 
 Cash for police work is dwindling at City Hall and in Washington. Civilian members of the force are facing layoffs. Station houses are not ideally staffed. More than 1,000 officers remain assigned to counterterrorism duties. At 1 Police Plaza, every transfer and promotion now requires the approval of Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. At the Police Academy, the flow of new recruits has slowed to a trickle. 
 Yet despite these challenges, crime is down in New York -- more significantly than in several other big cities around the nation. Murders, which hit 200 at the midyear point, are heading toward a new low. (The peak was more than 2,200 in 1990.)
 That accomplishment has impressed many observers.
 ''The stress that his department is under right now is enormous,'' Peter Vallone Jr., the chairman of the City Council's public safety committee, said of Mr. Kelly. Mr. Vallone said it was, then, remarkable that the police had been able to maintain, and even improve upon, critical aspects of crime fighting in recent years.
 Given the reduction in the force's size, and the intensity of its efforts to combat everything from global threats to outbreaks of car thefts, the Police Department might well be at something of a crossroads. So far, though, there have been no obvious outward signs of problems.
 That said, not even the department's most senior officials deny that they have had to adjust and improvise as they have faced shrinking numbers of officers and civilian personnel. One measure of that has been the department's increased reliance on a tactic known as predictive policing, trying to use crime statistics and other information to forecast where crime may pop up next.
 ''It puts pressure on the need to be as precise as you can be, because you want to make the very best use of the limited resources you have,'' said Michael J. Farrell, a deputy commissioner.
 After the meeting at Police Headquarters in June, Mr. Farrell and two other commanders -- Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department, and Phil T. Pulaski, another deputy commissioner -- continued the exchange of viewpoints over the use of the specialized officers.
 The debate eventually was settled by Mr. Kelly, in a compromise verdict. The specialized officers in the 52nd Precinct would not stay for the six months they had been assigned; they would remain for 28 additional days before the matter was taken up again.
 ''If we had 1,200 recruits graduating, instead of 250, we might be able to staff both zones,'' said Mr. Farrell. ''Never mind the ideal. You have to deal with the real.''
 Mr. Kelly's consideration of staffing issues goes beyond graduation day at the police academy. Every day, he reviews charts that map crime and quality-of-life conditions, ranging from graffiti to murder. He looks at electronic screens that show daily staffing levels in all 76 precincts and in the subway and housing commands. Those levels have stabilized recently, as attrition has slowed in part because of the economic downturn.
 By using these tools -- what Mr. Kelly calls ''dashboards'' -- he makes decisions about how, when and where to deploy officers.
 If reductions in head count create shortfalls that jeopardize operations in a certain precinct, Mr. Kelly draws officers from another area. Mr. Kelly has compared his ethos to that of a 19th-century military strategist, Carl von Clausewitz, who advised massing forces at certain important points, instead of deploying scarce personnel thinly along an entire enemy line.
 But the city's ranks are stretching thinner with each month.
 Last month, the department canceled the planned hiring of 125 traffic enforcement agents. It is facing the loss of 395 police administrative aides -- clerical workers who push the paperwork that makes the department run. If $20 million in alternate savings cannot be found within 90 days, and the jobs are lost, many of those responsibilities would have to be assumed by uniformed officers.
 In the struggles over less federal money flowing from Washington, Mr. Kelly, has personally been lobbying members of Congress.
 Recently, a federal budget bill eliminated $40 million in anticipated grants for a program called Securing the Cities, which would create links with law enforcement agencies within a 50-mile radius around the city, and would outfit officers with radiation detectors to spot a nuclear or radiological threat long before it reaches its intended target.
 Mr. Kelly called two members of Congress -- Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, and Yvette D. Clarke, a Democrat from Brooklyn -- to push for the restoration of the federal money. But he believed he needed more support, aides said. So on June 23, as he sipped a diet soda in a conference room, waiting to inform one of his commanders of a pending promotion, he squeezed in a quick but intense phone call with George A. Dalley, an aide to Representative Charles B. Rangel, who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
 Two days later, news came that the grant was restored in the House of Representatives, though the issue was still unresolved in the Senate.
 Away from the department's nerve center, field commanders are under increasing pressure to be more creative.
 For instance, to handle the rush of students who flood mass transit systems on weekday afternoons, Chief James P. Hall, the head of the department's Transit Bureau, is continually refining plans to put officers on subway platforms and along the corridors between subway stations at those times. He has also found ways to use New York City Transit safety regulations to zero in on and arrest robbery suspects on trains. As a result, subway crime has kept dropping (to 5 crimes a day, on average, from 10 a day in 2002) and the department can still afford to assign more Transit Bureau officers to counterterrorism duties, like securing vulnerable tunnels and ventilation systems.
 Seven years ago, when Mr. Kelly came aboard for his second stint as commissioner, things were similarly difficult. The economy was ravaged in the fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks; the police head count was beginning its decline; and some pundits predicted that the departure of Rudolph W. Giuliani as mayor would usher in a return of the ''bad old days'' of crime. The starting salary for rookie officers then dropped to $25,100 for the first six months on the job -- a figure that helped decimate the department's recruiting efforts.
 But crime kept dropping; the salary problem seemed to pass; and a series of terrorism plots were foiled.
 ''I think that there is a danger of a beleaguered force,'' said Dennis C. Smith, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, who has studied and written about the police for decades.
 But of the department's current predicament, he added: ''I don't think snapping is in the cards.''

HEADLINE: Citigroup Reports Profit, Aided by Asset Sale

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Citigroup, a banking giant scrambling to survive the financial crisis, reported a $4.3 billion second-quarter profit thanks to gains on its Smith Barney deal, though its primary banking businesses continue to suffer from rising credit losses. 
 The bank, propped up with $45 billion of taxpayer money since markets imploded last fall, recorded a $6.7 billion gain from merging Smith Barney into a brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley. Under accounting rules, Citi gets to mark up its entire stake in the venture, of which Morgan owns 51 percent.
 The gain boosted net income to $4.28 billion, or 49 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $2.50 billion, or 55 cents a share.
 Quarterly revenue rose 71 percent to $30.0 billion, with the rise due almost entirely to the Smith Barney gain as well as net write-ups.
 Credit costs increased to $12.4 billion, including an addition of $3.9 billion to loan loss reserves. That brings the total allowance for loan losses to 5.6 percent of total loans.
 Shares of Citigroup are down 94 percent since peaking in May 2007 and have fallen by half this year, but they have tripled since financial services stocks began rallying in March. They were up 2 percent in premarket trade.
 The bank is expected to soon complete a swap that will convert the United States government's investment into a 34 percent equity stake in Citigroup.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Passes 10% in 15 States

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Unemployment topped 10 percent in 15 states and the District of Columbia last month, according to federal data released Friday. The rate in Michigan surpassed 15 percent, the first time any state hit that mark since 1984. 
 The Federal Reserve this week projected that the national unemployment rate, currently at a 26-year high of 9.5 percent, would pass 10 percent by the end of the year. Most Fed policy makers said it could take ''five or six years'' for the economy and the labor market to get back on a path of long-term health. 
 To get there, consumers must return to a regular spending groove and housing prices need to start rising again.
 Home to the nation's struggling automakers, Michigan has been clobbered by lost factory jobs. Its jobless rate of 15.2 percent in June was the highest in the country.
 The Labor Department said it was the first time in 25 years that any state had suffered an unemployment rate of at least 15 percent. In 1984, it was West Virginia.
 The other 14 states where unemployment topped 10 percent in June were Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee.
 The states with the lowest unemployment rates in June were: North Dakota at 4.2 percent, Nebraska at 5 percent and South Dakota at 5.1 percent.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Earnings Fall 47%, Led by Finance Unit

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
General Electric reported a steep fall in second-quarter earnings on Friday, weighed down by the continuing struggles of its big finance business, falling orders for industrial equipment and declining advertising spending at its NBC television network and local stations.
 Yet analysts said that the giant multinational's results showed a steady performance at a time of worldwide recession. They said G.E. was doing a good job of cutting costs and seemed to be progressing in paring the size and risks of its finance arm. 
 G.E., which has industrial businesses spanning energy, aviation and health care, reported earnings per share of 26 cents, down from 54 cents in the quarter a year earlier. The 26 cents was slightly more than analysts' consensus estimate of 23 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.
 The company's net income fell 47 percent, to $2.9 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago.
 Given its global reach across product lines as diverse as gas turbines, power plants and aircraft engines, G.E. provides a concentrated glimpse of the health of capital spending in the industrial economy as a whole.
 On that score, the G.E. report showed continued weakness. The company's revenue fell 17 percent, to $39.08 billion. After adjusting for a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales, sales were down 12 percent from the previous year. G.E.'s quarterly revenue was about $3 billion less than the Wall Street forecast.
 Capital equipment orders for G.E. fell sharply, especially transportation machinery like locomotives and health care equipment like medical-imaging machines. In a conference call with analysts, company executives said they expected industrial equipment orders to be off about 25 percent for the year.
 ''That's a pretty significant decline, but it's not unexpected in this economy,'' said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 Still, analysts said, the fall in industrial orders disappointed investors, sending G.E.'s shares down 6.05 percent, to $11.65.
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said his management team was focused on cutting costs, operational improvements and repairing the finance unit, while still investing in businesses likely to prosper when the economy recovers. ''We're as well positioned as you can be in this environment,'' Mr. Immelt said.
 Analysts say two main concerns cloud the outlook for G.E. Its industrial side is a collection of capital-equipment businesses, and many customers will delay large purchases until genuine signs of economic recovery surface, they say.
 The worry about the finance unit, analysts say, is the possibility that G.E. may not yet have seen the worst of losses and that it may have to set aside more money to cover them. But for a quarter at least, the trends looked encouraging.
 The finance business was the biggest drag on G.E.'s results. Its operating profits fell 80 percent, to $590 million, down from $2.9 billion a year ago. And revenue in the finance unit, which includes home mortgages in Britain and private-label credit cards in the United States, declined 29 percent, to less than $12.8 billion, from nearly $18 billion.
 G.E. has moved to strengthen the finance business. It said leverage, or the ratio of borrowings to equity, is down to 5.6 to 1, compared with 7 to 1 a year ago. And borrowing in the short-term commercial paper market is down to $50 billion, from $72 billion a year ago.
 A new uncertainty about G.E.'s finance business was raised last month with the Treasury Department's initial plans to overhaul the financial system. One recommendation, aimed at companies with large financial and nonfinancial businesses, would require G.E. to shed its big finance unit.
 G.E. executives said the company would fight the proposal. ''We are really committed to GE Capital,'' Mr. Immelt said. 
 The company's television network and movie studio unit, NBC Universal, also hurt the quarterly results, with earnings off 41 percent because of charge-offs and falling television advertising. 
 The impact of economic stimulus programs has not yet been evident, Mr. Immelt said. ''We'll see benefit from the global stimulus in the second half of the year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Questioning of Judge Sotomayor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Groundwork for Next Time'' (news analysis, front page, July 16) and ''Sotomayor Fends off Republican Queries on Guns and Abortion'' (news article, July 16):
 Your articles reaffirm the absolutism that increasingly pervades the Republican Party in the last decade. Watching and listening to the Republican senators question Judge Sonia Sotomayor showed that the party's leading lights are a group of misogynists and exclusionary white Christian men. 
 The use of the term ''meltdown'' was highhanded and offensive. These senators' consistent antagonism toward every trait of Judge Sotomayor that does not conform to their absolutist right-wing values, on issues like gun control and abortion rights, is most arrogant.
 That this is also the antiscience party is additional evidence of its race to the bottom.
 Sri-Ram Aiyer Chevy Chase, Md., July 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In response to a question about abortion rights, Judge Sonia Sotomayor testified that she ''was asked no questions by anyone, including the president, about my views on any specific legal issue.'' It's distressing that the administration did not probe the candidate's views on the most troubling legal controversy of the last 35 years. Without asking pointed questions, how can a pro-choice president satisfy himself and his constituents that he isn't nominating a candidate with regressive views on this touchstone issue?
 If, on the other hand, the president really has inside information that Judge Sotomayor is a full supporter of a woman's right to choose, then that information should be disclosed to the world and the Senate. Citizens on both sides of this controversy have the right to know whom we're getting.
 Gregory Schwed New York, July 16, 2009
 The writer is a lawyer.
 To the Editor:
 There is sadness in Judge Sonia Sotomayor's aggressive denial of subjectiveness in the interpretation of the law. The law, in the final analysis, is a human construct whose application bears significant consequences on the experiences and lives it seeks to regulate.
 It is ancient wisdom that justice devoid of immeasurable and subjective values, like mercy and compassion, indeed empathy, becomes brittle and ultimately transformed into a tool of injustice, if not tyranny.
 Joseph Chuman Hackensack, N.J., July 16, 2009
 The writer is a professor of human rights at Columbia University.
 To the Editor:
 If you examine the life of a person who is readily identified as being bigoted or prejudiced, you generally find not one or two instances of bias, but rather a pattern of words and actions that bear out application of those labels, more or less consistent over time.
 One speech or one judicial court opinion does not constitute a pattern of behavior. Trying to use isolated instances to pin those labels on Judge Sonia Sotomayor, even without considering the contexts of her words and actions, does not support a conclusion of deeply held bias. It reflects only on the narrow political motives of her accusers.
 Dave Mercer Oak Park, Ill., July 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The confirmation hearings of Sonia Sotomayor reveal serious flaws in the way Congress is serving the American people. Some members of the committee, like Senator Jeff Sessions, are by and large posing and showing off to their constituencies, zeroing in on a few words in a motivational speech by Judge Sotomayor.
 If we were not at a crucial moment for the Republic, in the midst of debates about health care reform, foreign wars and the economy, the poseur senators might have elicited a few light laughs from the public. Alas, it is rather tragic that the dozen-plus white men on the committee are indeed not any wiser than a single Latina woman.
 Marco Avellaneda New York, July 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As a recently retired New Hampshire lawyer, I know that many judges are quite lacking. I only wish I could have tried more cases before a judge as competent, principled, thorough and self-examining as Judge Sonia Sotomayor. The hearings have shown us the future and -- thankfully -- it is not this Republican band of grumpy old men.
 H. Neil Berkson New York, July 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 There is a delicious irony in Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings, in which a candidate who would never have been nominated by a Republican president is being attacked by fiercely partisan Republicans and defended by fiercely partisan Democrats -- all of them solemnly intoning the mantra that politics has no place in the judicial process.

HEADLINE: Profits at Two Banks Mask Signs of More Trouble Ahead

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Gerry Shih contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The problems at the nation's big banks have caused trouble for many ordinary Americans. But increasingly, it is the problems of ordinary Americans that are causing trouble for the big banks. 
 Bank of America and Citigroup, giants that have come to symbolize the ills plaguing the banking industry, announced on Friday that they had set aside billions of additional dollars to cope with looming losses on everything from credit cards to home equity loans.
 While both banks said they were again turning handsome profits, the cheery headline figures masked a sober reality: the results were driven by one-time gains -- bonanzas without which both banks would have lost billions. 
 At the heart of the banks' troubles are hard-pressed consumers. The question, analysts said, was whether the banks have braced themselves enough for the next wave of bad debts as people slog through a long, dreary recession. 
 Like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, two banks that stunned Wall Street this week with robust earnings reports, Bank of America and Citigroup got big lifts from their trading operations. Bank of America reported a $3.2 billion profit for the second quarter. Citigroup said it earned a $4.3 billion profit. 
 But the pain being felt by ordinary Americans hurt these giants even more. Both set aside billions of dollars to cover potential losses on consumer loans and warned that, given the tough economy, the road ahead could be rocky.
 Both banks said they were in better financial health than they were a year ago, when each was brought to its knees by the storm that swept through the markets. Neither has repaid the nearly $100 billion in government money they received, while rivals like JPMorgan and Goldman have.
 Yet with the economy still shaky -- losses on consumer debt like mortgages and credit cards continue to rise -- the biggest concern remains whether either bank has built up enough of a financial cushion to withstand further pain.
 Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, conceded in a conference call with analysts Friday that the second half of the year would be tougher than the first. 
 Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, echoed that view. 
 ''Our credit card and mortgage losses are elevated because of where we are in the cycle,'' Mr. Pandit said in a conference call.
 Commercial real estate has also been a bugbear for many banks, including Bank of America, as businesses trim their employee rolls and retailers close franchises. The firm reported 3.34 percent in net losses in the sector, more than 60 percent of its second-quarter real estate losses. (Citigroup officials argued that their bank had less exposure.)
 Still, officials at Bank of America and Citigroup said they were preparing for a rougher second half of the year. Citigroup added nearly $4 billion to its reserves against future loan losses. Bank of America did not add more capital, but said it was adequately protected with a $13.4 billion provision.
 Some analysts questioned whether that would be enough.
 ''They haven't been as forthright in recognizing how bad their problems are and that's really hurting them now,'' Michael Williams, an analyst at Gradient Research, said of Citigroup. Shares in Bank of America fell more than 2 percent in Friday trading, to $12.89. Shares in Citigroup dipped less than 1 percent, closing at $3.02.
 About a dozen financial institutions have repaid the government rescue funds they received in the heat of the financial crisis, but analysts expect Citigroup and Bank of America to remain sheltered for some time to come. Citigroup is close to finishing the conversion of preferred shares to common stock, a move that will bolster its capital ratios but leave the government with a 34 percent stake in the bank. With that government presence comes an array of restrictions that could leave the two firms hobbled compared with healthier competitors, including limits on pay that may impede the hiring of new talent.
 Mr. Pandit brushed off concerns about the effect of tighter government oversight over Citigroup. ''Our interests are completely aligned with those of the regulators as well as the government,'' he said. ''We just keep executing the way we have. Nobody wants anything other than that.''
 The two firms benefited greatly from asset sales. Citigroup is selling off its prized Smith Barney asset-management arm to a joint venture with Morgan Stanley, reaping an $11.1 billion pretax gain in the process. Bank of America earned $5.3 billion in pretax gains by selling a portion of its stake in China Construction Bank, a major Chinese lender.
 Citigroup plans to continue selling or winding down what it considers noncore assets, having split itself internally into two divisions.
 Still, both banks are deeply entrenched in traditional services like consumer and commercial lending, and as unemployment and wage numbers continue to worsen and households fall behind on bills, loan and credit card losses are piling up. Small corporations are increasingly defaulting on loans as the business environment remains stagnant -- as evidenced by the turmoil at the commercial lender CIT. The outlook is murkiest at Citigroup, long considered to be in the worst shape along the major banks. 
 Yet Mr. Pandit said cautiously that the rate of losses in mortgages and credit cards might be slowing.
 ''Based on everything we see, it seems as though the rate of growth in these consumer losses may be moderating, which of course also has implications for future additions to reserves,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Tightens Mexico Border, Smugglers Are Taking to the Sea

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
They move north in rickety fishing boats, often overloaded and barely seaworthy, slipping through the darkness and hidden from the watchful radar of American patrols.
 Along beaches north of here, the migrants from Mexico and beyond scramble ashore, in groups of a dozen or two, and dash past stunned beachgoers, sometimes even leaving behind their boats, known as pangas. Drug smugglers, too, take this sea route, including one last month found paddling a surfboard north with a duffel bag full of marijuana on it.
 As the land border with Mexico tightens with new fencing and technology, the authorities are seeing a sharp spike in the number of people and drugs being moved into the United States by sea off the San Diego coast. 
 Law enforcement authorities in the United States said the shift demonstrated the resolve of smugglers to exploit the vastness of the sea, the difficulty in monitoring it, and the desperation of migrants willing to risk crossing it. 
 ''It's like spillover from a dam,'' said Cmdr. Guy Pearce, who oversees the antismuggling effort for the Coast Guard in San Diego.
 For generations, people have tried to swim, surf and ride boats, sometimes carrying contraband, into the United States from south of the border.
 But Commander Pearce and other officials in the Department of Homeland Security say those sporadic efforts have accelerated to unprecedented levels recently -- a doubling in the number of illegal immigrants -- more than 300 in the last two years -- caught on boats or beaches and a sevenfold increase in maritime drug seizures, principally several thousand pounds of marijuana.
 The authorities have taken note that the increase coincides with the near completion of new, more fortified border fencing along a 14-mile stretch from the ocean inland.
 New smuggling rings have also emerged, operating out of beach towns south of the border and islands off the Mexican coast, convincing migrants that the passage is safe and the ocean too wide open for maritime law enforcement to catch them.
 A recent patrol with the Coast Guard showed they may have a point.
 All night and into the morning, the Coast Guard cutter Petrel dashed across the seas looking for suspect boats. A tip that a suspect boat was due to pass miles off the coast around 1 a.m. sent the cutter, nearly all of its lights off to avoid detection, searching by the faint glow of a half moon. The boat was not found.
 Later, just after 4 a.m., a radar sweep picked up two boats moving quickly south, prompting the crew to cut off the classical music wafting from overhead speakers on a bridge lighted only by navigation monitors.
 As the roaring engines sent the cutter crashing over swells for more than 20 minutes after the boats were first noticed, the crew could see the boats speeding without their lights on.
 A boarding team mobilized with body armor and rifles and raced in a small craft from the cutter to check out the boats. Just early-morning fishing, said the people on the boats, who insisted they did not realize their lights were off. With no evidence of contraband, they were let go.
 But Chief Petty Officer Gary Auslam, in charge on this watch, had his doubts as he watched the boats quickly motor on. Gunrunners bringing weapons from the United States move swiftly.
 ''Boy, they got out of here pretty quick, didn't they?'' Chief Auslam said, gazing out the bridge.
 It falls mainly to the Coast Guard and the Customs and Border Protection division of the Department of Homeland Security to patrol the seas with a mix of cutters, aircraft and a few small high-speed boats.
 The authorities arrested 136 illegal immigrants sneaking in by sea in the fiscal year that ended Oct. 30, double the 66 marine arrests in 2007. Since October, more than 100 illegal immigrants have been arrested, bringing the marine arrests of illegal immigrants in the past couple of years to unprecedented levels, said Michael Carney, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in San Diego who oversees a task force on marine smuggling.
 The seizure of drugs, principally marijuana, has similarly skyrocketed. In the fiscal year that ended in October, the authorities seized 6,300 pounds of marijuana in the coastal waters north of the border, a sevenfold increase from the 906 pounds confiscated in 2007. This fiscal year, 6,100 pounds have been found.
 ''This is somewhat of an alarming trend,'' Mr. Carney said. ''It has opened our eyes. There is still a lot we need to learn about how these organizations operate.''
 The Department of Homeland Security is responding to this surge with orders for more boats and equipment.
 Generally, the flow of migrants north has slowed as the economy here has withered and the United States has bolstered patrols and fencing. But people still make the journey and the desire for drugs keeps smugglers busy.
 Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana, Mexico, who has studied smuggling, said he doubted the fence was causing the spike. Instead, Mr. Clark Alfaro said, ''a new generation'' of smugglers have simply had success ferrying people over the seas and are encouraging migrants to go their way. The charge is more than $4,000, roughly double what a smuggling guide would charge to lead somebody over land, he said. Marijuana smugglers, likewise, have gotten wise to the sea route.
 ''It's always,'' Mr. Clark Alfaro said, ''a fight between technology and the ingenuity of smugglers.''
 Coast Guard officials said they knew of no boats that had sunk but they worry about that prospect. In March they seized a 25-foot boat with 22 people aboard.
 The biggest adversary at times, though, is the darkness.
 Petty Officer First Class Pablo Mendoza picked up night-vision binoculars and scanned the horizon. When it was suggested that the equipment might offer an advantage, Petty Officer Mendoza replied, ''Yeah, the problem is they have these, too.''
 Crew members said they did not believe the guard or Customs and Border Protection had enough fast boats to get to suspected smuggling boats in time, though the agencies, as well as the Navy and civilian law enforcement, are making an effort to coordinate their patrols.
 In the end, said Petty Officer First Class Jason Tessier, another supervisor on the Petrel, ''it is a matter of being in the right place at the right time.''

HEADLINE: T.V.A. Increases Hazard Ratings on Coal Ash Sites

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The Tennessee Valley Authority has raised the hazard ratings on several of its coal ash disposal sites to ''high,'' two weeks after environmentalists complained that the Environmental Protection Agency had allowed the utility to rate its own facilities. 
 The complaints came last month when the E.P.A. released a list of 44 ''high hazard'' coal ash dumps, defined as sites where a dam failure would put human life at risk. 
 The environmental agency compiled the list after the failure of a dam at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant last December sent more than a billion gallons of toxic coal ash over the landscape west of Knoxville and into a system of rivers.
 But despite that spill, none of the T.V.A.'s 12 coal ash dump sites made the ''high hazard'' list. The environmental agency relied on self-reporting by utilities to compile the list, and the T.V.A. rated all its sites, including Kingston, ''low hazard.'' 
 Those ratings, which use classifications developed by the National Dam Safety Program, were done before the Kingston spill, said John Kammeyer, vice president for coal combustion products, projects and engineering for the authority. They took into account only the amount of water in the facilities, not the ash itself, Mr. Kammeyer said. 
 On Thursday, the utility sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency saying that ''in the interest of taking a conservative, self-critical approach,'' it had reclassified four of its sites, Bull Run and Cumberland in Tennessee and Colbert and Widows Creek in Alabama, as ''high hazard.'' Most of the others were reclassified as ''significant'' hazards, which means that dam failure would most likely result in economic loss and environmental damage.
 The ranking system is not intended to measure the likelihood of failure, but the potential damage if failure occurs. The authority has hired Stantec, an engineering firm, to inspect all of the disposal sites, and has said that while many need repairs, none are in imminent danger of failure. 
 ''We are doing and have done a lot of work at these sites, millions of dollars of work, with the intent of becoming the industry leader,'' Mr. Kammeyer said.
 The E.P.A. list identifies disposal sites in 10 states, including 12 in North Carolina, 9 in Arizona and 7 in Kentucky.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Sees Seeds Of Recovery In Slump

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
When the construction cranes have halted, business has slipped into a coma and growth has slowed to the speed of Interstate 75 at rush hour, what is a Chamber of Commerce to do?
 In Atlanta, the answer is tinged with optimism: develop a strategy for the end of the recession.
 For the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, the region's future lies not so much in broad buzzword sectors like bioscience or technology, but in bite-size niches within those categories. Atlanta could become a center for pet pharmacology, digitized medical records and video games -- or so says a study released Friday for the chamber's New Economy Task Force. 
 ''There is no such thing as a technology industry,'' said Alan Colberg, a managing director at Bain & Company consultants and the author of the study. ''You have to say, 'We're going to build wireless telecom.' Successful cities have gone to a focused area. The industries are more fragmented than they've ever been.''
 Such a plan, of course, is predicated on the notion that the recession will end. But it also involves the somewhat instructive effort of trying to predict what the economy will look like in recovery, and how cities will compete more for less growth.
 ''It's going to be this move from bad economy to next economy,'' said Mick Fleming, the president of American Chamber of Commerce Executives. ''You can pick your industry, whether it's retail or banking or computers -- it's all going to be different.''
 Other cities are also adjusting their economic development strategies. ''Our focus is now on entrepreneurship and innovation as opposed to industry attraction in the old-line sectors,'' said Jeff Kaczmarek, president of the Economic Development Corporation of Kansas City, Mo. ''In times of economic distress, it's small business and entrepreneurs who lead the way out of these recessionary periods.'' 
 St. Louis is also trying to identify specific subsectors, using its expertise in plant science, for instance, to develop better renewable fuel. Or, as Richard C. D. Fleming, president of the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association, put it, ''Looking at climate change through the lens of an economic development opportunity.''
 The Atlanta study has chamber executives here using words like ''granular,'' referring not to agricultural products but to small niches within large industries, and ''organic,'' referring not to farm produce but to industries that are already established and might be helped along without the expensive bells and whistles of traditional recruiting. The study recommends that the Chamber of Commerce adjust the incentive structure for its project managers to reward such nurturing.
 Such suggestions reflect the new, downsized yet more competitive outlook for economic development officials around the country as they grapple with slow growth -- not to be confused with slow food, or slow jams, though Atlanta has those, too. (Neither the restaurant nor the music industry is singled out in the report.)
 The study began with a review of all the industries listed by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, eliminating government, nonprofits, some mature industries and low-growth sectors like packaged consumer goods and broadcast media. (Presumably it also eliminated the print media, but the PowerPoint presentation did not mention that, perhaps because it was given in advance to newspaper reporters.)
 What remained was winnowed into four large categories: technology, supply chain and logistics, bioscience and business services. But, with a nod to granularity, the study identified subsectors like high-growth wholesale, vaccine manufacturing, livestock engineering and areas where federal priorities and money might provide a boost, like health care software.
 Some industries like entertainment -- where Atlanta, with its record producers and ''Real Housewives,'' has natural advantages -- did not make the cut because they do not represent enough jobs, Mr. Colberg said. Others, like renewable or sustainable energy, were eliminated because other cities and states have already invested heavily in those clusters. 
 Though the Atlanta area has continued to grow, per capita income growth, at 2.6 percent annually, has lagged well behind that of cities like Dallas, with 3.8 percent yearly growth, and San Francisco, with 5.1 percent. So the chamber also wanted to focus on industries that would create high-paying jobs. 
 The study also showed that Georgia spent far less on economic development than states like North Carolina. But that does not deter Sam A. Williams, the president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
 ''We don't need to be just sitting here contemplating a crisis,'' Mr. Williams said. ''This thing is going to give rise to opportunities.''

HEADLINE: The Pre-election Blues in Japan

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
IT is hard to imagine a less auspicious economic environment for a government to seek re-election in than the one Japan now faces, but after a series of local election rebuffs, Japan's prime minister was forced this week to schedule a vote that few people think his Liberal Democratic Party can win. 
 Taro Aso, who took over the government only last September, has seen the economy deteriorate significantly on his watch. There are a few signs that the worst may be past, but none that Japan is in a strong position. Yet he must try to persuade voters that he can bring recovery to one of the countries hardest hit by the global recession.
 As the accompanying charts show, Japan's economy declined by 8.4 percent, after adjustment for inflation, from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009. That is the worst annual decline for Japan during the long period since its bubble burst in 1990, and it is the worst showing over the same period for any of the major industrial nations in the Group of 7.
 The United States, whose financial crisis is largely blamed for the downturn, has nonetheless suffered less than most other major countries, with real gross domestic product falling 2.3 percent over the same period.
 One reason that Japan and Germany have done the worst among the Group of 7 is that theirs were the most export-oriented economies and thus the most vulnerable when the United States, as the major import-oriented economy, began to buy less. 
 For Japan, where a large trade surplus has long been taken almost for granted, it has come as a sharp shock to see it vanish. Through May, the most recent data available, the country had a 12-month trade deficit in goods of 821 billion yen (about $9 billion). That is not a large amount for Japan, but until this year there had been surpluses every year since 1981.
 Over those 12 months, total exports were down by 21 percent, but auto industry exports -- the pride of Japanese industry -- were off by nearly a third. 
 The trade figures are actually looking up a little bit. Although the 12-month figures show a trade deficit, there were small surpluses in each month from February through May. It now appears that American imports fell far more than actual demand declined during the chaotic days of late 2008, and that even though demand has shown little sign of recovery, the need to restock inventory has provided some benefit to exporters.
 On a longer term basis, there are complaints in Japan that the government has done little to deal with demographic problems that confront most industrialized countries, but that are most severe in Japan. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that 22.8 percent of Japanese are over the age of 65, and forecasts that figure will grow to more than 29 percent by the end of this decade.
 Moreover, of the countries in the Group of 7, Japan is the only one in which the population is expected to decline this year, although others may join it within a few years. 
 It is far from clear what the Democratic Party of Japan, the main opposition party that now controls Japan's upper house of parliament, would do to overcome the problems the country faces. But if the polls are correct, it will get the chance to deal with them.

HEADLINE: Web News Start-Up Has Its Eye on Texas

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The longtime editor of Texas Monthly magazine will team with an Austin venture capitalist to form a nonprofit news Web site devoted to government and politics in the Lone Star State.
 With a large bankroll, a staff at the outset of about eight journalists and the cachet of Evan Smith, the Texas Monthly editor, the new venture, called the Texas Tribune, hopes to be an immediate force on the state's political landscape, much as Politico was two years ago in national politics. 
 Many local news organizations have cut back on statehouse coverage, and the creators of the Texas Tribune plan to post news on their own site and supply it to newspapers around the state. 
 ''This is not about horse-race politics, primarily,'' Mr. Smith, who will have the title of chief executive, said. ''It's going to be a lot of deep-dive policy stuff. We have the lowest voting turnout in the country. We have a number of major issues that get no attention or insufficient attention by the people we elect.''
 The chairman of Texas Tribune is John Thornton, general partner of Austin Ventures, a venture capital firm. Mr. Thornton said he had given $1 million to the project and raised $1.2 million more. He plans to raise a total of $4 million from individuals and foundations by the time the site begins operating, possibly in November. Other nonprofit local news sites in places like San Diego, St. Louis and Chicago started with significantly less money behind them.
 ''We want to have at least two years' runway, even if there's no additional revenue, and preferably three,'' he said.
 An active supporter of Texas Democrats, Mr. Thornton, 44, who is based in Austin, said he was giving up partisan politics for the sake of the Texas Tribune. He said the new venture had quietly approached reporters and editors about joining, and with many journalists unemployed and others worried that their employers would keep shrinking, ''talent ain't the issue.''
 In the last two years, news organizations that publish solely or primarily online, most of them nonprofits, have become an important force in American journalism, growing rapidly while the traditional news media shrink. In addition to the local sites, there are bigger operations with a broader scope, like Politico, which is a commercial venture, and ProPublica, a nonprofit devoted to investigative journalism.
 Texas newspapers and people who follow the state's politics will have to take Texas Tribune seriously, said Rich Oppel, who retired last year as the top editor of The Austin American-Statesman. ''I think this is significant,'' he said. ''Evan Smith has been an excellent editor of Texas Monthly, which may be the best regional magazine in the country. He's drawn talent.''
 The timing plays into what promises to be a fertile period in the state's politics. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison may challenge Gov. Rick Perry in the Republican primary next year, in what political analysts predict would be the hottest race the state has seen in years.
 When he makes the transition in mid-August, Mr. Smith, 43, will leave behind a magazine with a much heftier reputation than its regional focus and 300,000 circulation would suggest.
 In 20 of the last 29 years, Texas Monthly has been a finalist for the prestigious National Magazine Award for general excellence in its circulation class, competing against nationally known publications like The Atlantic, New York, W and Harper's. It won that award in 1990, 1992, 2003 and again this year.
 Texas Monthly combines in-depth articles on serious topics, lifestyle reporting and a strong sense of place; this is a magazine that can treat barbecue and football as seriously as tort reform and capital punishment. 
 Its owner, Emmis Communications of Indianapolis, does not report results for individual publications. Executives say Texas Monthly remains profitable, but in the first half of this year, it had 27 percent fewer pages of advertising than in the same period last year.
 Mr. Smith has worked for the magazine for 17 years, serving as editor for eight years. Last year, he became president and took the new title of editor in chief.
 ''I've been here a very long time,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I told the staff two and a half years ago that I was beginning to think about what comes next. I love these guys, I love this magazine, but I'm ready to do something else.''

HEADLINE: The Governor's Best Man

BYLINE: By ED KOCH. 
Ed Koch was the mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989.

 BODY:
FACED with a State Senate paralyzed by a leadership dispute, Gov. David Paterson of New York last week made a bold move to end the deadlock. His appointment of Richard Ravitch to fill the vacant position of lieutenant governor succeeded almost immediately. By the next day, the Senate was back to work on critical legislation. 
 Mr. Paterson could not have picked a better person for the job, and I should know. Mr. Ravitch and I have been competitors in the past -- he challenged me in 1989 in the Democratic primary for mayor. I trashed him. But it didn't matter. We both lost to David Dinkins. Mr. Ravitch is knowledgeable about the economy and has the experience to help navigate the state through fiscal crisis. 
 While Republicans are challenging the appointment in court, it has a sound legal basis. Contrary to the claims of Mr. Paterson's political foes, the foundation for the governor's authority to make the appointment is grounded in the State Constitution. Now don't go to sleep on me.
 While the Constitution does not explicitly grant the governor the authority to appoint his lieutenant, Article XIII, Section 3, authorizes the Legislature to pass laws to address the filling of vacancies in state offices. Part of one of those laws, Article 3, Section 43, of the Public Officers Law, is clear: ''If a vacancy shall occur, otherwise than by expiration of term, with no provision of law for filling the same, if the office be elective, the governor shall appoint a person to execute the duties thereof until the vacancy shall be filled by an election.''
 A different part of that law, Section 41, provides for filling a vacancy in the offices of comptroller or attorney general through a joint resolution of the Legislature. This makes sense. Holders of both positions need to act independently of the governor, so he should not appoint anyone to them. And another part, Section 42, deals with vacancies to be filled by special election -- including United States Senate and House seats -- but explicitly excludes the lieutenant governor. 
 Clearly, Section 43 was intentionally written in broad language to address positions not specifically detailed in Sections 41 and 42, and hence it grants the governor the authority to appoint his lieutenant. 
 Those who say there is no precedent here like to cite the governorships of Thomas Dewey, Malcolm Wilson and Mario Cuomo (all men served, at times, without a lieutenant governor). But that ignores the full history. The state had two special elections for lieutenant governor in the 1800s, for example. Then, in 1943, when Governor Dewey's first lieutenant governor, Thomas Wallace, died several months after inauguration, the attorney general at the time opposed a special election, contending that the Constitution precluded anyone from filling the office. 
 The courts, however, rejected this argument, citing the Public Officers Law, and the special election took place. That decision supports Mr. Paterson's position that nothing in the Constitution bars operation of the Public Officers Law. 
 After that decision, the Legislature amended Section 42 of the Public Officers Law -- the part dealing with special elections -- specifically to exclude the lieutenant governor. Since there can be no special election, appointment is the available method to fill the post. The fact that previous governors never used that power to appoint a deputy does not invalidate the practice.
 Those who disagree base their case on Article IV, Section 6 of the Constitution. But that covers only the temporary performance of duties: ''In case of vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor alone ... the temporary president of the Senate shall perform all the duties of lieutenant governor during such vacancy.'' 
 This is irrelevant to filling vacancies because simply ''performing the duties'' of the lieutenant governor does not make the Senate president the actual lieutenant governor, and the word ''vacancy'' here implies that such a situation (i.e., no lieutenant governor) would come to an end. 
 Governor Paterson has duly provided that end. As the court battle continues, remember this: When the legal basis on an issue like this is sound, and the person chosen to fill the role is of such unquestioned caliber, the question of whether to move forward becomes common sense. Appointing Richard Ravitch was the best decision Governor Paterson has made since taking office.

HEADLINE: Summers Says Stimulus Plan on Track Despite Job Losses

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's top economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, acknowledged in a speech on Friday that unemployment and job losses were higher than the administration projected and would rise further this year even as the economy showed signs of recovery. 
 ''This is obviously a major area of concern,'' he said. But Mr. Summers, defending the president's $787 billion stimulus package of last February against recent criticism from Republicans and some analysts, said rising job losses were ''not a basis for concluding that the recovery act is falling short of its goals.''
 The White House adviser said the two-year stimulus plan of tax cuts and new spending was timed to peak during 2010, with 70 percent of its benefits to be distributed to local governments, businesses and families in the first 18 months. ''We are on track to meet that timeline,'' he said.
 Mr. Summers, in what the White House billed as ''a progress report'' on rescuing the economy, pointed out that other independent forecasters also underestimated job losses. He said no one knew for sure why employers had shed so many workers in this downturn. But he suggested several factors: greater productivity that allowed firms to do the same work with fewer workers, bigger financial pressures on companies, and employers' expectations of a prolonged recession.
 In his speech, before an overflow audience at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Mr. Summers said high levels of consumer and business debt were going to ''act as a drag on spending and growth for some time to come.'' That, he added, meant that the government must cushion the adjustment process by providing support, but for no longer than necessary.
 In an attempt to offer perspective, Mr. Summers said, ''It's easy to forget how far we have traveled'' in six months, when there was talk of a second Great Depression. ''We were at the brink of catastrophe at the beginning of the year but we have walked some substantial distance back from the abyss.''
 To a questioner who spoke of global fears among investors in China and elsewhere about the ballooning United States debt, Mr. Summers countered that the ''greatest risk'' to long-term growth ''would be sustained contraction'' in this country. ''Rescuing the economy has to be the first priority,'' he added.
 Speaking a day after Congressional budget analysts reported that health care legislation moving in the House would add to rising government costs, not control them, Mr. Summers reiterated the administration's contention that overhauling the health care system as Mr. Obama proposes would rein in health care spending, which is by far the biggest factor in projections of unsustainable future budget deficits.
 Responding to a comment from David Walker, the former head of the Government Accountability Office, that ''You can't cut by expanding coverage'' to the nearly 50 million uninsured, Mr. Summers said, ''We've rejected that view.''

HEADLINE: Treasury's Humor Is Lost on Senator

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Treasury Department was trying to bring a little levity to the workplace, but Senator Byron L. Dorgan did not find it funny. 
 The department's Bureau of Public Debt scrapped plans on Friday to hire a consultant to teach managers a class on using humor in the office after Mr. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, objected.
 In a posting on the Web site of Federal Business Opportunities, the bureau sought proposals for a contractor to give two courses, each three hours long, on humor in the workplace.
 On Friday, the agency issued a statement apologizing.
 ''A recent procurement request for information seeking a training consultant to aid managers has been canceled,'' the agency said.
 The bureau's statement said the request ''did not represent an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars, and we regret the early steps taken on this effort.''
 In an e-mail statement titled ''Not a Laughing Matter,'' Mr. Dorgan said, ''Of all the agencies, the Bureau of Public Debt should know that there is very little that is funny about today's economic conditions.''

HEADLINE: India, Hosting Clinton, Fears Pressure From U.S. to Mend Ties With Pakistan

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived here on Friday, determined to put the United States' relations with India on a broader footing, even as Indian commentators voiced fears that the Obama administration was preoccupied these days with Pakistan and Afghanistan.
 Mrs. Clinton's three-day visit, the first by a senior American official since President Obama took office, will include meetings with business leaders, educators and prominent women -- the kinds of personal encounters that she has made a hallmark of her early days as the nation's chief diplomat. 
 With her elbow on the mend from a fracture last month, Mrs. Clinton is hitting the road after a hiatus during which some in Washington remarked on her low profile. She seems eager to step out in India, where her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has long been popular.
 But she will also have to answer concerns that Mr. Obama's intense focus on the insurgency in Pakistan, as well as the war in Afghanistan, will get in the way of the American-Indian relationship. India is sensitive about being put under pressure by the United States to ease tensions with Pakistan.
 In a column published Friday in The Times of India, Mrs. Clinton wrote that she looked forward to discussing climate change, economic development and nuclear nonproliferation. And, she added, ''We should encourage Pakistan as that nation confronts the challenge of violent extremism.'' 
 Her fleeting reference to Pakistan drew the most attention: the newspaper made it the headline for the column.
 Commentators here warned Washington not to try to pressure India into a deal with Pakistan over Kashmir -- something the United States favors because it may persuade the Pakistani Army to shift troops from the country's eastern border with India to the west, where the army could better fight Taliban insurgents.
 ''India is not in that class of nations, nor is it an age in which Washington can bend nations in that manner,'' said an editorial Friday in the financial newspaper Mint. The paper welcomed Mrs. Clinton with a photo and headline, ''Cold Wind from Washington.''
 India and Pakistan agreed this week to resume negotiations over Kashmir and other issues, though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India insisted afterward that his government still demanded that Pakistan bring to justice those who planned the Mumbai attacks in November. India had halted those talks after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai killed 166 people.
 ''I really see events trending in a very positive direction between India and Pakistan, in part because of the shared sacrifice, commitment and understanding that now exists about the threat,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with an Indian broadcaster, CNN-IBN.
 The bloodshed from the attacks in November will loom large in Mrs. Clinton's visit: she is staying at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, one of the two hotels that were taken over for nearly three days by terrorists. She will take part in a ceremony commemorating the victims of those attacks.
 During Mrs. Clinton's visit, India is expected to announce two sites for American-supplied nuclear reactors, according to American officials. India pledged to award contracts for the reactors to American companies, in return for a landmark civilian nuclear trade agreement between the countries.
 The visit may also produce an agreement that would allow the United States to monitor the ''end use'' of military equipment sold to India, to ensure that it is not diverted to other purposes or sold to other countries. That could open the door to the sale of 126 fighter jets to India.
 With Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mrs. Clinton traveling to many countries before India, there has been some talk here about why this visit has taken so long.
 ''There's a very simple answer to that,'' said Robert O. Blake, the assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs. The United States wanted to wait until India's elections were completed, in mid-May. The re-election of Mr. Singh's Congress Party ''really opened the way for a new and invigorated partnership,'' Mr. Blake said.

PERSON: Walter Cronkite 

HEADLINE: Walter Cronkite, 92, Dies; Trusted Voice of TV News

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
 Walter Cronkite, who pioneered and then mastered the role of television news anchorman with such plain-spoken grace that he was called the most trusted man in America, died Friday at his home in New York. He was 92.
The cause was complications of dementia, said Chip Cronkite, his son. 
 From 1962 to 1981, Mr. Cronkite was a nightly presence in American homes and always a reassuring one, guiding viewers through national triumphs and tragedies alike, from moonwalks to war, in an era when network news was central to many people's lives.
 He became something of a national institution, with an unflappable delivery, a distinctively avuncular voice and a daily benediction: ''And that's the way it is.'' He was Uncle Walter to many: respected, liked and listened to. With his trimmed mustache and calm manner, he even bore a resemblance to another trusted American fixture, another Walter -- Walt Disney. 
 Along with Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC, Mr. Cronkite was among the first celebrity anchormen. In 1995, 14 years after he retired from the ''CBS Evening News,'' a TV Guide poll ranked him No. 1 in seven of eight categories for measuring television journalists. (He professed incomprehension that Maria Shriver beat him out in the eighth category, attractiveness.) He was so widely known that in Sweden anchormen were once called Cronkiters.
 Yet he was a reluctant star. He was genuinely perplexed when people rushed to see him rather than the politicians he was covering, and even more astonished by the repeated suggestions that he run for office himself. He saw himself as an old-fashioned newsman -- his title was managing editor of the ''CBS Evening News'' -- and so did his audience.
 ''The viewers could more readily picture Walter Cronkite jumping into a car to cover a 10-alarm fire than they could visualize him doing cerebral commentary on a great summit meeting in Geneva,'' David Halberstam wrote in ''The Powers That Be,'' his 1979 book about the news media.
 As anchorman and reporter, Mr. Cronkite described wars, natural disasters, nuclear explosions, social upheavals and space flights, from Alan Shepard's 15-minute ride to lunar landings. On July 20, 1969, when the Eagle touched down on the moon, Mr. Cronkite exclaimed, ''Oh, boy!''
 On the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Cronkite briefly lost his composure in announcing that the president had been pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Taking off his black-framed glasses and blinking back tears, he registered the emotions of millions.
 It was an uncharacteristically personal note from a newsman who was uncomfortable expressing opinion. 
 ''I am a news presenter, a news broadcaster, an anchorman, a managing editor -- not a commentator or analyst,'' he said in an interview with The Christian Science Monitor in 1973. ''I feel no compulsion to be a pundit.'' 
 But when he did pronounce judgment, the impact was large.
 In 1968, he visited Vietnam and returned to do a rare special program on the war. He called the conflict a stalemate and advocated a negotiated peace. President Lyndon B. Johnson watched the broadcast, Mr. Cronkite wrote in his 1996 memoir, ''A Reporter's Life,'' quoting a description of the scene by Bill Moyers, then a Johnson aide.
 ''The president flipped off the set,'' Mr. Moyers recalled, ''and said, 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.' ''
 Mr. Cronkite sometimes pushed beyond the usual two-minute limit to news items. On Oct. 27, 1972, his 14-minute report on Watergate, followed by an eight-minute segment four days later, ''put the Watergate story clearly and substantially before millions of Americans'' for the first time, the broadcast historian Marvin Barrett wrote in ''Moments of Truth?'' (1975).
 In 1977, his separate interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel were instrumental in Sadat's visiting Jerusalem. The countries later signed a peace treaty.
 ''From his earliest days,'' Mr. Halberstam wrote, ''he was one of the hungriest reporters around, wildly competitive, no one was going to beat Walter Cronkite on a story, and as he grew older and more successful, the marvel of it was that he never changed, the wild fires still burned.'' 
 Walter Leland Cronkite Jr. was born on Nov. 4, 1916, in St. Joseph, Mo., the son of Walter Leland Cronkite Sr., a dentist, and the former Helen Lena Fritsche. His ancestors had settled in New Amsterdam, the Dutch colony that became New York. As a boy, Walter peddled magazines door to door and hawked newspapers. As a teenager, after the family had moved to Houston, he got a job with The Houston Post as a copy boy and cub reporter. At the same time, he had a paper route delivering The Post to his neighbors.
 ''As far as I know, there were no other journalists delivering the morning paper with their own compositions inside,'' he wrote in his autobiography.
 When he was 16, Mr. Cronkite went with friends to Chicago for the 1933 World's Fair. He volunteered to help demonstrate an experimental version of television.
 ''I could honestly say to all of my colleagues, 'I was in television long before you were,' '' he said in an interview with CBS News in 1996.
 Mr. Cronkite attended the University of Texas for two years, studying political science, economics and journalism, working on the school newspaper and picking up journalism jobs with The Houston Press and other newspapers. He also auditioned to be an announcer at an Austin radio station but was turned down. He left college in 1935 without graduating to take a job as a reporter with The Press. 
 While visiting Kansas City, Mo., he was hired by the radio station KCMO to read news and broadcast football games under the name Walter Wilcox. (Radio stations at the time wanted to ''own'' announcers' names so that popular ones could not be taken elsewhere.)
 He was not at the games but received cryptic summaries of each play by telegraph. These provided fodder for vivid descriptions of the action. He added details of what local men in the stands were wearing, which he learned by calling their wives. He found out in advance what music the band would be playing so he could describe halftime festivities.
 At KCMO, Mr. Cronkite met an advertising writer named Mary Elizabeth Maxwell. The two read a commercial together. One of Mr. Cronkite's lines was, ''You look like an angel.'' They were married for 64 years until her death in 2005.
 In addition to his son, Walter Leland III, known as Chip, Mr. Cronkite is survived by his daughters, Nancy Elizabeth and Mary Kathleen; and four grandsons. 
 In his last years, Joanna Simon, a former opera singer and sister of Carly Simon, was his frequent companion.
 The family said it was planning a private service at St. Bartholomew's Church in New York.
 After being fired from KCMO in a dispute over journalism practices he considered shabby, Mr. Cronkite in 1939 landed a job at the United Press news agency, now United Press International. He reported from Houston, Dallas, El Paso and Kansas City. 
 The stint ended when he returned to radio and then took a job with Braniff International Airways in Kansas City, selling tickets and doing public relations.
 Returning to United Press after a few months, he became one of the first reporters accredited to American forces with the outbreak of World War II. He gained fame as a war correspondent, crash-landing a glider in Belgium, accompanying the first Allied troops into North Africa, reporting on the Normandy invasion and covering major battles, including the Battle of the Bulge, in 1944.
 In 1943, Edward R. Murrow asked Mr. Cronkite to join his wartime broadcast team in CBS's Moscow bureau. In ''The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism'' (1996), Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson wrote that Murrow was astounded when Mr. Cronkite rejected his $125-a-week job offer and decided to stay with United Press for $92 a week.
 That year Mr. Cronkite was one of eight journalists selected for an Army Air Forces program that took them on a bombing mission to Germany aboard B-17 Flying Fortresses. Mr. Cronkite manned a machine gun until he was ''up to my hips in spent .50-caliber shells,'' he wrote in his memoir.
 After covering the Nuremberg war-crimes trials and then reporting from Moscow from 1946 to 1948, he again left print journalism to become the Washington correspondent for a dozen Midwestern radio stations. In 1950, Murrow successfully recruited him for CBS.
 Mr. Cronkite was assigned to develop the news department of a new CBS station in Washington. Within a year he was appearing on nationally broadcast public affairs programs like ''Man of the Week,'' ''It's News to Me'' and ''Pick the Winner.'' 
 In February 1953 he narrated the first installment of his long-running series ''You Are There,'' which recreated historic events like the Battle of the Alamo or the Hindenburg disaster and reported them as if they were breaking news. Sidney Lumet, soon to become a well-known filmmaker, directed the series.
 ''What sort of day was it?'' Mr. Cronkite said at the end of each episode. ''A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times. And you were there.''
 In 1954, when CBS challenged NBC's popular morning program ''Today'' with the short-lived ''Morning Show,'' it tapped Mr. Cronkite to be the host. Early on he riled the sponsor, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, by grammatically correcting its well-known advertising slogan, declaring, ''Winston tastes good as a cigarette should.''
 When not interviewing guests, he mulled over the news with a witty and erudite puppet lion, Charlemagne. Occasionally he ventured outside the studio -- using a tugboat, for example, to meet luxury liners so he could interview celebrities before they landed.
 In 1952, the first presidential year in which television outshined radio, Mr. Cronkite was chosen to lead the coverage of the Democratic and Republican national conventions. By Mr. Cronkite's account, it was then that the term ''anchor'' was first used -- by Sig Mickelson, the first director of television news for CBS, who had likened the chief announcer's job to an anchor that holds a boat in place. Paul Levitan, another CBS executive, and Don Hewitt, then a young producer, have also been credited with the phrase.
 The 1952 conventions made Mr. Cronkite a star. Mr. Mickelson, he recalled, told him: ''You're famous now. And you're going to want a lot more money. You'd better get an agent.''
 Mr. Cronkite went on to anchor every national political convention and election night until 1980, with the exception of 1964. That year he was replaced at the Democratic convention in Atlantic City by Roger Mudd and Robert Trout in an effort to challenge NBC's Huntley and Brinkley team, which had won the ratings battle at the Republican convention in San Francisco that summer.
 In 1961, Mr. Cronkite replaced Murrow as CBS's senior correspondent, and on April 16, 1962, he began anchoring the evening news, succeeding Douglas Edwards, whose ratings had been low. As managing editor, Mr. Cronkite also helped shape the nightly report. 
 The evening broadcast had been a 15-minute program, but on Sept. 2, 1963, CBS doubled the length to a half-hour, over the objections of its affiliates. Mr. Cronkite interviewed President Kennedy on the first longer broadcast, renamed the ''CBS Evening News With Walter Cronkite.'' He also broadcast from a real newsroom and not, as Edwards had done, from a studio set.
 At the time the broadcast was lengthened, Mr. Cronkite inaugurated his famous sign-off, ''And that's the way it is.'' The original idea, he later wrote, had been to end each broadcast with a quirky news item, after which he would recite the line with humor, sadness or irony.
 Richard S. Salant, the president of CBS News, hated the line from the beginning -- it ate up a precious four seconds a night -- and the offbeat items were never done.
 ''I began to think Dick was right, but I was too stubborn to drop it,'' Mr. Cronkite wrote. 
 Starting with Herbert Hoover, Mr. Cronkite knew every president, not always pleasantly. A top aide to President Richard M. Nixon, Charles Colson, harangued the network's chairman, William S. Paley, after Mr. Cronkite's 14-minute Watergate broadcast. The next segment was shortened.
 In 1960, during the Wisconsin primary, Mr. Cronkite asked Kennedy, then a senator, about his Roman Catholic religion. As Mr. Cronkite recalled in his memoir, Kennedy called Frank Stanton, CBS's president, to complain that questions about the subject had earlier been ruled out of bounds. He then reminded Mr. Stanton that if he were elected he would be appointing members of the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Stanton ''courageously stood up to the threat,'' Mr. Cronkite wrote.
 By contrast, Mr. Cronkite's relations with President Dwight D. Eisenhower were so cordial that President Kennedy incorrectly assumed Mr. Cronkite, a political independent, was a Republican.
 Mr. Cronkite also enjoyed the company of President Ronald Reagan, with whom he exchanged often off-color jokes. And he whimsically competed with his friend Johnny Carson to see who could take the most vacation time without getting fired. 
 Mr. Cronkite raced sports cars but switched to sailing so he could spend more time with his family. He liked old-time pubs and friendly restaurants; there was even one in Midtown Manhattan where his regular chair was marked with his initials. 
 In an interview with The New York Times in 2002, Mr. Cronkite scrunched his eyes and lowered his voice into a theatrical sob when asked if he regretted missing out on the huge salaries subsequent anchors had received.
 ''Yes,'' he said, adding, ''I frequently call myself the Mickey Mantle of network news.''
 Mr. Cronkite retired in 1981 at 64. He had repeatedly promised to do so, but few had either believed him or chosen to hear. CBS was eager to replace him with Dan Rather, who was flirting with ABC, but both Mr. Cronkite and the network said he had not been pushed.
 After his retirement he continued to be seen on CBS as the host of ''Walter Cronkite's Universe,'' a science series that began in 1980 and ran until 1982. The network also named him a special correspondent; the position turned out to be largely honorary, though news reports said it paid $1 million a year. But after he spent 10 years on the board of CBS, where he chafed at the cuts that the network's chairman, Laurence A. Tisch, had made in a once-generous news budget, more and more of his broadcast work appeared on CNN, National Public Radio and elsewhere, not CBS. 
 By the time Mr. Rather was leaving the ''CBS Evening News'' in 2005, Mr. Cronkite had abandoned mincing words. He criticized his successor as ''playing the role of newsman'' rather than being one. Mr. Rather should have been replaced years earlier, he said.
 When Katie Couric took over the job in September 2006, Mr. Cronkite introduced her on the air and praised her in interviews.
 His long ''retirement'' was not leisurely. When Senator John Glenn went back into space on the shuttle Discovery in 1998, 36 years after his astronaut days, Mr. Cronkite did anencore in covering the event for CNN. He made some 60 documentaries. And among many other things, he was the voice of Benjamin Franklin on the PBS cartoon series ''Liberty's Kids,'' covered a British general election for a British network and for many years served as host of the annual Kennedy Center Honors.
 He had already won Emmy Awards, a Peabody and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (in 1981), and he continued to pile up accolades. Arizona State University named its journalism school after him.
 In July 2006, PBS broadcast a 90-minute ''American Masters'' special on Mr. Cronkite's career. Mr. Lumet, the filmmaker, appeared and said, ''He seemed to me incorruptible in a profession that was easily corrupted.''
 On his 90th birthday, Mr. Cronkite told The Daily News, ''I would like to think I'm still quite capable of covering a story.''
 But he knew he had to stop sometime, he allowed in his autobiography. He promised at the time to continue to follow news developments ''from a perch yet to be determined.''
 ''I just hope that wherever that is, folks will still stop me, as they do today, and ask, 'Didn't you used to be Walter Cronkite?' '' 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 6, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Saturday about Walter Cronkite misidentified the country in which he crash-landed a glider as a United Press correspondent in World War II. It was the Netherlands, not Belgium.
Because of an editing error, an obituary Saturday about the CBS newsman Walter Cronkite misspelled the name of the church in Manhattan where his family plans to hold a private funeral service. It is St. Bartholomew's, not Bartholemew's.
An obituary on July 18 about Walter Cronkite, using information from his autobiography, ''A Reporter's Life,'' misstated the origin of the term ''anchor.'' While Mr. Cronkite was referred to as the anchor of CBS news coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, that was not the first time that ''anchor'' and ''anchorman'' were used. Both terms had been applied to broadcasters in other contexts before the conventions. The obituary also included an erroneous anecdote from the autobiography about the extent of his fame. He was said to be so widely known that newscasters in Sweden were once called ''Cronkiters,'' but that term is not known to linguists in that country.

HEADLINE: Secretary Clinton Goes to India

 BODY:
The Bush administration and Congress rewrote American and international rules to allow India -- a longtime nuclear scofflaw -- to buy fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear program. It was supposed to be the start of a beautiful new friendship. So we are eager to see what happens when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visits India over the next few days. 
 The two democracies can do a lot to deepen their relationship, including negotiating an investment treaty. India is expected to use the visit to announce plans to construct as many as 10 new nuclear power plants that will be open to bidding by American companies. 
 But it is time for India to take more responsibility internationally. It needs to do more to revive the world trade talks it helped torpedo last year and -- as a major contributor to global warming -- to join the developed countries in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. And it needs to do a lot more to constrain its arms race with Pakistan and global proliferation. 
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his party have a strong mandate after the May elections. And the country has weathered the global recession better than most. That means that it has no excuses not to do more. 
 The primary focus must be Pakistan. We are encouraged that India and Pakistan have resumed their dialogue, interrupted after last fall's attacks in Mumbai by Pakistani-based extremists. New Delhi exercised welcome restraint when it did not retaliate. But tensions remain high. Mrs. Clinton needs to assure India that Washington will keep pressing Pakistan to prosecute suspects linked to the Mumbai attacks and to shut down the Lashkar-e-Taiba group of extremists once and for all.
 India also needs to help allay Pakistan's fears. If resolving tensions over Kashmir -- their biggest flashpoint -- is not possible while Pakistan is battling the Taliban, then talks on water and environmental issues may be an interim way to seek common ground.
 One of our many concerns about the nuclear deal was that it would make it easier for India to expand its arsenal -- and drive Pakistan to produce more of its own weapons. With access to global fuel markets, India can use its limited domestic uranium stocks for weapons. President Obama and Secretary Clinton both endorsed the deal. Now they have a responsibility to do what President George W. Bush never did: push India to stop producing more weapons fuel rather than waiting for a multinational treaty to be negotiated. That would make it easier to press Pakistan to do the same. Both India and Pakistan claim that they want only a ''minimal credible'' nuclear deterrent -- but who knows what that means?
 President Obama's efforts to revive arms control talks with Russia and his commitment to seek ratification of the test ban treaty mean that Mrs. Clinton arrives with bolstered credibility. She should urge India to consider opening regional arms talks with Pakistan and China and drop its opposition to the test ban treaty. 
 During the negotiations on the nuclear deal, the Bush administration managed to persuade New Delhi to grudgingly support United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran's nuclear programs. India now needs to do more.
 The world's wealthy nations have given Iran until late September to accept restraints on its nuclear program or face consequences. We hope this time India's arm will not have to be twisted and -- if needed -- it will use its trade clout to curb Iran's ambitions. 
 India wants to be seen as a major world power. For that to happen, it will have to drop its pretensions to nonalignment and stake out strong and constructive positions. President Obama and Mrs. Clinton say they consider India a vital partner in building a stable world. Now they have to encourage India to behave like one.

HEADLINE: Democrats Grow Wary as Health Bill Advances

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Three of the five Congressional committees working on legislation to reinvent the nation's health care system delivered bills this week along the lines proposed by President Obama. But instead of celebrating their success, many Democrats were apprehensive, nervous and defensive.
 Even as Democratic leaders and the White House insisted that the nation was closer than ever to landmark changes in the health care system, they faced basic questions about whether some of their proposals might do more harm than good. 
 And while senior Democrats vowed to press ahead to meet Mr. Obama's deadline of having both chambers pass bills before the summer recess, some in their ranks, nervous about the prospect of raising taxes or proceeding without any Republican support, were pleading to slow down.
 Democrats had three reasons for concern. The director of the Congressional Budget Office warned Thursday that the legislative proposals so far would not slow the growth of health spending, a crucial goal for Mr. Obama as he also tries to extend insurance to more than 45 million Americans who lack it.
 Second, even with House committees working in marathon sessions this week, it was clear that Democrats could not meet their goal of passing bills before the summer recess without barreling over the concerns of Republicans and ending any hope that such a major issue could be addressed in a bipartisan manner. 
 Third, a growing minority of Democrats have begun to express reservations about the size, scope and cost of the legislation, the expanded role of the federal government and the need for a raft of new taxes to pay for it all. The comments suggest that party leaders may not yet have the votes to pass the legislation. 
 Mr. Obama tried Friday to shift the political narrative away from the grim forecasts of the Congressional Budget Office. He said he and Congress had made ''unprecedented progress'' on health care, with even the American Medical Association endorsing the House bill this week. 
 He acknowledged a treacherous path ahead, saying, ''The last few miles of any race are the hardest to run,'' but insisted, ''Now is not the time to slow down.'' And he vowed: ''We are going to get this done. We will reform health care. It will happen this year. I'm absolutely convinced of that.''
 On Capitol Hill, the picture is more complex. Representative Jared Polis, a freshman Democrat from Colorado who voted against the bill approved Friday in the Education and Labor Committee, said he worried that the new taxes ''could cost jobs in a recession.'' 
 To help finance coverage of the uninsured, the House bill would impose a surtax on high-income people and a payroll tax -- as much as 8 percent of wages -- on employers who do not provide health insurance to workers.
 Mr. Polis said these taxes, combined with the scheduled increase in tax rates resulting from the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts, would have a perverse effect. ''Some successful family-owned businesses would be taxed at higher rates than multinational corporations,'' he said. 
 In a letter to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Polis and 20 other freshman Democrats said they were ''extremely concerned that the proposed method of paying for health care reform will negatively impact small businesses, the backbone of the American economy.''
 And in the latest sign of lawmakers' chafing at Mr. Obama's ambitious timetable, a bipartisan group of six senators, including two members of the Finance Committee, sent a letter to Senate leaders pleading with them to allow more time.
 ''While we are committed to providing relief for American families as quickly as possible,'' they wrote, ''we believe taking additional time to achieve a bipartisan result is critical for legislation that affects 17 percent of our economy and every individual in the United States.''
 The group included three senators, Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska; and Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, Republicans of Maine, who met with Mr. Obama at the White House this week and urged him not to rush the bill. 
 ''The legislative process right now is going in the wrong direction,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent, who also signed the letter. ''I think it's extremely doable to get this done before the end of the year. But just to try to get it passed in the Senate before we leave for the August recess seems just about impossible. It's just too big a bill.''
 The House education committee approved the bill, 26 to 22, on Friday morning, after an all-night session. Three Democrats crossed party lines and voted no.
 The vote came eight hours after the House Ways and Means Committee approved a nearly identical bill, 23 to 18, with 3 Democrats voting no. On Wednesday, the Senate health committee approved a generally similar bill on a party-line vote, 13 to 10. 
 The House and Senate bills would require insurers to take all applicants and vastly expand coverage, with federal subsidies for millions of people. 
 But the director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas W. Elmendorf, testified on Thursday that doing so would come at a steep cost and that the proposals would not curb the rise in health spending by the federal government, which he called ''unsustainable.'' 
 A budget office analysis released Friday said the House bill would ''result in a net increase in the federal budget deficit of $239 billion'' over 10 years, partly because of an increase in Medicare spending to avert sharp cuts in payments to doctors. 
 House Democrats who voted no cited various concerns.
 ''We are not doing enough to reform the health care delivery system, to change the incentives so reimbursement will be based on the value, rather than the volume, of services,'' Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin said.
 Others worry that a government-run health plan, to be created under the House bill, would underpay doctors and hospitals by using Medicare reimbursement rates. ''I have a serious problem with the public plan in this bill because it's based on Medicare rates,'' Representative Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota said. ''North Dakota is underpaid by Medicare.''
 Mr. Obama said he was confident that Congress and the White House would reach a deal on how to pay for the bill, and lower health care spending over the long term -- an optimistic view that not all lawmakers share. But on one of Mr. Obama's points, there was no dispute: ''We're going to be putting in a lot more hours,'' the president said. ''There are going to be a lot more sleepless nights.''

HEADLINE: Trade and Climate

 BODY:
When leaders of the world's richest nations and the big developing countries agreed at the Group of 8 summit this month to restart global trade negotiations, they sent a powerful signal about the need for concerted action to deal with the world's economic emergency. 
 It was disturbing, however, that they could not agree on a common strategy for reducing the greenhouse emissions causing global warming. Trade and climate policy have become increasingly entangled. A failure to agree on how to address global warming could undermine half a century of opening world trade. 
 The House of Representatives proved the point last month when it passed a climate bill that would impose trade penalties on countries that do not accept limits on carbon emissions. Last year, the European Commission approved the idea of an ''equalization'' levy on imports from countries that have not agreed to cut emissions.
 President Obama rightly opposed the penalties in the House bill. Unilateral sanctions are unlikely to work and more than likely to provoke a dangerous protectionist tit-for-tat trade war. Yet if the world's biggest emitters of CO2 -- including the United States, China and India -- fail to reach an agreement at a meeting in Copenhagen in December, the temptation for countries that accept limits on emissions to impose unilateral sanctions on countries that do not could well become irresistible.
 The main reason trade and climate change are linked is that the damage inflicted by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is not mainly local or regional. If big emitters do not cut back, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to rise dangerously no matter what the rest of the world does.
 Moreover, without a worldwide agreement on emissions, strict limits in signatory countries would very likely lead to a fall in energy prices in countries that did not agree to cuts -- encouraging even more energy consumption in those places and undermining the goal of stopping climate change.
 Congress is concerned that domestic limits on carbon emissions would put American companies at a competitive disadvantage with rivals in countries with no such caps. But that is not the only problem. In the absence of a system of import duties related to carbon, industries with high emissions might relocate to nonsignatory countries to save money. Or they might fail, unable to compete with dirtier and cheaper foreign rivals.
 There are precedents for using trade measures for environmental goals. The Montreal Agreement to curb the use of ozone-depleting gases included trade controls on such substances. And the World Trade Organization has suggested that levying taxes at the border on the carbon content of imports would be acceptable if they are devised properly -- in the same sort of way as some consumption taxes are levied on imports, ensuring equal treatment with domestic products.
 Such tariffs must be part of an international agreement on climate change. Unilateral penalties against fast-growing polluters like China and India would be seen as illegitimate and could easily backfire, scuttling chances of an agreement on climate issues. Congress must refrain from putting sanctions in its climate bill. 
 An international accord that includes trade-related enforcement measures must also include commitments on emission reductions all around, as well as financial aid for poorer countries, like India and China, to meet the caps without sacrificing economic growth. 
 Further, any deal must set clear guidelines on how to identify and quantify transgressions and establish appropriate countermeasures. It also must not open a backdoor for protectionism. Without such a deal, trade is going to have problems. Failing to conclude the current negotiations will be the least of them.

HEADLINE: Fighting Eyesores Before They Start

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
DURING the housing boom, new construction seemed to sprout up on every corner. 
 But when the economy took a dive last fall, many projects lost financing, which brought construction to an abrupt halt. 
 This has left empty lots and bare foundations throughout New York City, visible symptoms of the financial crisis. 
 The New York City Department of Buildings, which created a task force to tackle the problem of stalled construction sites in February, counted 362 languishing in the five boroughs as of July 8 -- 57 in Manhattan, 138 in Brooklyn, 131 in Queens, 21 in the Bronx and 15 in Staten Island. 
 There are particularly high concentrations in areas like Williamsburg, Brooklyn. But idle building lots do not discriminate by ZIP code or property value. If not properly attended to, they can raise serious quality-of-life issues for neighbors, ranging from crime to vermin. 
 The City Council now has a plan that would allow developers to hang onto their permits in exchange for keeping their sites safe and secure -- fencing in holes in the ground, locking up half-built buildings and making sure nothing will fall on passers-by in a stiff wind. 
 Dawn Hannay of Cabrini Boulevard in Hudson Heights in Manhattan lives down the block from a neglected construction site, a vacant lot full of weeds five feet high and surrounded by a haggard wire fence. 
 ''I do wish they'd do something more productive with it,'' Ms. Hannay said. ''In some weather there's standing water, and people throw trash over the fence, so it gets unsightly. And I hate that fence that takes up half the sidewalk!'' 
 She worries about mosquitoes breeding in stagnant puddles.
 In addition to issues of hygiene and aesthetics, bare foundations -- or worse, the frames of unfinished buildings -- can become a drag on property values. 
 ''It's the same idea as a suburban house with a boarded-up house next door,'' said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''The problem is when you have a large-scale deteriorating of property in an area or neighborhood or street. That's where you're more likely to see an impact on property values.''
 Unfortunately, there is not much neighbors can do about these sites. One can call in complaints to the 311 hot line or contact members of the New York City Council, but the city government has a limited arsenal to train on this problem.
 ''Most of these folks are not not working because they're goof-offs; it's because they've lost their financing,'' said Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker. ''We don't have much of a stick, so we had to create carrots that were attractive and fair.'' 
 To that end, there is a bill pending before the City Council that would give extensions on building permits to developers who adhere to certain standards of safety and upkeep at stalled sites. The plan would also help the city to get a handle on the true scope of the problem by encouraging developers to come forward when they run into hurdles. 
 ''The first goal is to maintain public safety through this period,'' said Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor for operations. ''The second is to remove bureaucratic delays where permits expire and you still have to wait, even if you have financing together.''
 Under normal circumstances, building permits expire after 12 months of inactivity. The new legislation, expected to be taken up by the council this fall, would provide developers with two-year permits that could be renewed regardless of construction activity, giving them up to four years to get their financing in order. 
 For some, the specter of having construction sites sit empty for long periods of time may evoke unnerving images of New York's abundant vacant lots in the 1970s. But for a project without financing, options beyond maintenance are limited. 
 Under the proposal before the council, participating developers would submit a safety plan to the Department of Buildings. If it were approved, they would be required to monitor their own sites regularly and city inspectors would check in on them periodically.
 If a developer did not uphold his or her end of the bargain, he or she would risk the loss of the permit as well as fines of up to $25,000.
 Many developers have responded favorably to this plan. Izak Senbahar's Alexico Group is developing a luxury condominium project at 56 Leonard Street, designed by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. According to Mr. Senbahar, they completed the foundation six months ago, but could not secure the financing to continue. He says that he intends to participate in the city's program. 
 ''The plan works,'' Mr. Senbahar said in an e-mail message, ''as it provides the city with the safety measure and affords us developers the time to get our financing lined up.''
 In addition to buying and saving time, projects that qualified for permit extensions would not be bound by changes in the building code that came about while they were stalled. Many such changes went into effect recently, including more requirements for interconnected smoke detectors and automated sprinkler systems. 
 Redesigning plans in the middle of construction can be a costly proposition. The opportunity to avoid this expense offers developers a clear incentive to participate. 
 ''We want to allow him to pick up where he left off, without the city slowing him down, and allow him to maintain his current design,'' said Robert D. LiMandri, the buildings commissioner. ''Everyone wins when a building is completed.''

HEADLINE: Western Club For the Rich Is Bought At a Bargain

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BILLINGS, Mont. 

 BODY:
The Yellowstone Club, a private resort for the rich, is in new hands after a $115 million deal that the new owner hopes will close the door on its much publicized descent into bankruptcy.
 Eight months ago, the club was on the verge of liquidation, a victim of its prior owners' excesses and the broader economic downturn that choked off the flow of money fueling the club's rise.
 CrossHarbor Capital Partners of Boston bought the 13,600-acre ski resort about 50 miles south of Bozeman on Friday at what was considered a bargain-basement price. 
 CrossHarbor's managing partner, Samuel T. Byrne, a Yellowstone member, had offered to buy the club last year for $470 million and had invested more than $200 million in club real estate over the last several years.
 The resort was nearly pulled apart last year during the bitter divorce of its founders, Edra and Tim Blixseth. Later came revelations that the pair had drained tens of millions of dollars from the resort, adding to its debt of more than $400 million.
 The collapse was extraordinary for an enterprise that counts Bill Gates and the hotel magnate Barry Sternlicht as members.
 Those who are allowed to join must buy real estate with prices that can top $10 million and pay a $300,000 deposit. The privacy that members thought their money was buying was shattered when the club's rolls were made public as part of its bankruptcy case.
 With the Blixseths now out of the picture, and fighting each other over the remains of a personal fortune once estimated at $1.3 billion, members are looking to Mr. Byrne to take the club out of the headlines.
 ''There's going to be a massive sigh of relief, a collective sigh of relief,'' said William J. Curtis, a club member and the chief executive of CurtCo Media, which publishes The Robb Report, a magazine that caters to the wealthy.
 Only about 300 of the club's more than 800 available memberships have been filled since it opened in 2000. Just three properties changed hands during its months in bankruptcy.
 Mr. Curtis said the deal Friday would shake up the market for the club's property, but he cautioned that the resort's problems had not yet ended. .
 Mr. Byrne said that in addition to the purchase price, more than $150 million had been pledged for improvements at the resort. That is likely to include the club's 120,000-square-foot centerpiece, Warren Miller Lodge, which was left unfinished. Mr. Byrne also said he persuaded a large group of members to put money behind his plans to recapitalize the resort. He declined to offer specifics.
 The club will continue to be managed by the Discovery Land Company, brought in last year when Ms. Blixseth took over the operation.
 Mr. Blixseth tried to scuttle the deal between his ex-wife and Mr. Byrne until the day the sale became final. He has said they colluded to drive the resort into a financial hole so Mr. Byrne could buy it at a low price. Those assertions were repeatedly rejected by Judge Ralph B. Kirscher of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Butte, and on Thursday he denied Mr. Blixseth's latest bid to block the deal. In his opinion, Judge Kirscher said the parties in the sale had acted in good faith. 
 Judge Kirscher said the case, which involved more than 100 lawyers and resulted in several other lawsuits still being resolved, ''was of a magnitude never seen before in this court.''

HEADLINE: River Views Beyond the Concrete Ocean

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
ELEVEN years after General Motors shuttered its 99-acre assembly plant here, some residents are still feeling the pain -- not only from high property taxes but also from blighted views and empty storefronts along Beekman Avenue, the main thoroughfare leading down to the Hudson River.
 Physically, all that remains at the end of the once-bustling retail stretch is a fenced-in area with metal spikes at regular intervals, and weeds growing between slabs of concrete. The workers are long gone, as are most of the taverns and restaurants they frequented.
 At the height of its productivity, G.M. contributed almost $1.5 million a year in taxes to Sleepy Hollow, a 2.3-square-mile village in Westchester County 26 miles north of Manhattan; two years ago, the automaker's payment amounted to only $125,000.
 In December, the village's main hope for bolstering its tax rolls anew was dashed when, in the face of a weak economy and some residents' opposition, a developer withdrew a proposal for a mixed-use project on the site. 
 ''It affects the village's morale to have a vacant lot of that size right on the Hudson,'' said Anthony Giaccio, the village's administrator. ''When the development plans fell through, it was a big disappointment for many of us.''
 Yet not for everyone. Villagers like Kathy Yeager, a writer, and her husband, Richard Plano, an actuary, who own a four-bedroom English cottage in Philipse Manor, one of the most picturesque and expensive sections of Sleepy Hollow, would prefer to let trees grow up on the site -- the lost tax income notwithstanding.
 The couple bought their home near the river 22 years ago and reared their two sons there and, she said, ''it's been like living in a wonderful summer house all year round.'' She fears development would spoil that ambience.
 Others, like Gorete and George Crowe, who reside in what is known as ''the inner village,'' a densely populated section of lower-priced single- and multifamily homes near the downtown, are coming from a different perspective. Redevelopment of the G.M. site with new residences, retail space and a conference center, said Ms. Crowe, a nurse, would reduce property owners' taxes and infuse the village's retail area with energy by attracting new businesses. 
 Ms. Crowe, a community activist recently appointed to the zoning board, described Sleepy Hollow as a village of ''two camps.'' ''There are the village people like us,'' she said, ''and then there are the manor people.''
 Now that General Motors has transferred the sprawling tract, along with other assets, to a government-backed company, there will very likely be new development plans for the site, said Dan Flores, a spokesman for G.M. 
 But like the previous plan, it will have to pass muster with Sleepy Hollow's 10,200 residents.
 In a village of such contrasting opinions, reaching a consensus may not be easy.
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 The residential neighborhoods of Sleepy Hollow, which is just north of Tarrytown, lie east and west of North Broadway, also known as Route 9, and north and south of Beekman Avenue, which winds downhill from North Broadway to the river.
 ''But few people say they live in Sleepy Hollow, like for example someone would say, 'I live in Ardsley,' '' Mr. Giaccio said. ''Here people say, 'I live in Philipse Manor,' or 'I live in Webber Park or Briggsville.' ''
 Webber Park, a neighborhood of two- and three-family homes, and Briggsville, a mostly single-family-home area, are both on the east side of North Broadway. Philipse Manor and Sleepy Hollow Manor are north of Beekman, with stately Victorians and colonials along winding roads and cul-de-sacs, and spectacular views of the Hudson.
 The inner village covers a number of crowded side streets crisscrossing Beekman. Mario Belanich, 76, one of the few former G.M. workers still living in Sleepy Hollow, has lived there with his wife, Edna, in a four-bedroom wood-frame house that they have owned since 1954. Mr. Belanich, who was eligible for retirement when G.M. closed, says he and his wife feel increasingly alone in the area. It has turned over in the last decade, as workers not ready to retire were relocated by the automaker.
 He said there used to be a lot of socializing with his neighbors, most of whom were European immigrants. But in the last decade, the houses nearby have changed hands, and the language on the street is now Spanish, which Mr. and Mrs. Belanich do not speak. 
 Also, many of the two-family houses now have illegal apartments. Mr. Giaccio, the administrator, says the village recently hired an assistant building inspector to crack down on zoning violations in the area. 
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 The median price of a single-family house at the end of June was $692,500, down from $826,000 in 2008 but up from $667,500 in 2004, said Andrea Martone, an agent for Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty in Tarrytown. The prices of the 23 houses for sale at the end of June ranged from $269,000 to $2.295 million.
 The average length of time on the market has decreased slightly since last year, Ms. Martone said. From Jan. 1 to the end of June 2008, it was 190 days; for that period this year it was 174 days. 
 In Sleepy Hollow Manor, a new three-story colonial with five bedrooms, six bathrooms and a powder room is on the market for $2 million, with views from almost every room of the river and the Palisades on the other side. By contrast, a two-bedroom one-bath house in Webber Park on the east side of North Broadway is listed at $315,000.
 In the inner village, just west of North Broadway, a two-bedroom two-bath house is for sale at $395,000.
 The median for condominiums at the end of June was $849,000, with a two-bedroom one-bath listed at $290,000, and a three-bedroom four-bath at $1.195 million. In 2007, Ichabod's Landing, a condo complex on the Hudson, was completed and sold out quickly; units went for $800,000 to $2 million. 
 WHAT TO DO
 For residents like Thomas and Nobuko Walek, who moved to a four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath Tudor in Philipse Manor from Manhattan eight years ago when their son, Andrew, was an infant, the area is rich with opportunities for recreation. On weekends Mr. Walek, who owns a public relations firm in Manhattan, often takes his son fishing for bass and sunfish on Tarrytown Lakes, or bike-riding at the 18-acre Kingsland Point, a county park. 
 Kayakers have several spots on the Hudson, including Kingsland Point Park and the private Philipse Manor Beach Club.
 In all, Sleepy Hollow has more than 57 acres of parkland. The village is also home to a number of historic landmarks on the national register, including the Tarrytown Lighthouse; the Manor House at Philipsburg Manor; the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow; Kykuit, the mansion that John D. Rockefeller and his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., built in 1913; and the Philipse Manor train station, restored in the mid-1990s.
 THE SCHOOLS
 Three years ago, in anticipation of a redone G.M. site and an influx of students, taxpayers in the Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns, which serves Sleepy Hollow (formerly North Tarrytown), voted to spend $66 million to add 110,000 square feet at Sleepy Hollow Middle School and High School. 
 But because the developer, the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J., withdrew its proposal for the G.M. site, the school district has had to increase the burden on property owners in both municipalities to cover its annual $62.5 million budget. ''The loss of G.M. has been felt in the district as a whole,'' said Howard W. Smith, the superintendent of schools. 
 District enrollment is 1,219 for four elementaryschools, 544 at the middle school and 907 at the high school. The ethnic makeup of the student body reflects that in the village, with about 48 percent white non-Hispanic and 45 percent Hispanic, Dr. Smith said. 
 SAT averages last year were 490 in reading, 493 in math and 487 in writing, versus 514, 492 and 494 statewide.
 THE COMMUTE
 Rush-hour travel time to Grand Central Terminal from the Metro-North Railroad's Philipse Manor station is about 40 minutes. Mr. Walek says he can walk out his front door at 7:34 a.m. and arrive at his office on Madison Avenue by 8:30. A monthly commutation ticket bought online costs $238.14.
 THE HISTORY
 In the early to mid-18th century, the hamlet north of Tarrytown became the setting of Washington Irving's story ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.'' The name Tarry Town, according to Irving, was coined by local women ''from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days.'' The hamlet, incorporated in 1874, changed its name to Sleepy Hollow in 1997 in honor of the story.

 The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City
 By Greg Grandin
 Illustrated. 416 pp. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $27.50
 The Amazon has always proved fertile soil for extravagant utopian fantasy. Victorian explorers, American industrialists, ideologues and missionaries all projected their dreams and ideas onto this terra incognita, this untamed wilderness of exotic possibility.
 For Europe and North America, the vastness of South America was a focus for romance, discovery and potential profit, and also a canvas on which to paint a new world according to individual belief. Elisabeth Nietzsche, the sister of the philosopher, plunged into the jungles of Paraguay in 1886 intent on creating her own vegetarian Aryan republic, spurred on by the anti-Semitic effusions of Richard Wagner. Theodore Roosevelt predicted the great river system could be harnessed to create ''populous manufacturing communities.'' Nelson Rockefeller thought the 4,000 miles of the Amazon might be cut into canals.
 The British explorer Col. Percy Fawcett plunged into the jungle in 1925, convinced he would find an ancient city that had once flourished there, and was never seen again. Scores of would-be rescuers followed his trail and vanished too. The Amazon had a way of swallowing up dreams. 
 Elisabeth Nietzsche left her flyblown, half-starved New Germany to rot, and scurried home to distort her brother's philosophical legacy. Roosevelt returned from his Amazon expedition of 1914 declaring the jungle to be ''sinister and evil,'' a place inimical to man. Alongside the myth of the Amazon's boundless opportunities grew another: the jungle as impenetrable nature, immune to modernity, a world savage and primeval where each successive conquistador arrives puffed with pride, and is conquered.
 With ''Fordlandia,'' Greg Grandin, a professor of history at New York University, tells a haunting story that falls squarely into this tradition: Henry Ford's failed endeavor to export Main Street America to the jungles of Brazil. Fordlandia was a commercial enterprise, intended to extract raw material for the production of motor cars, but it was framed as a civilizing mission, an attempt to build the ideal American society within the Amazon. As described in this fascinating account, it was also the reflection of one man's personality -- arrogant, brilliant and very odd. 
 In 1927, Ford, the richest man in the world, needed rubber to make tires, hoses and other parts for his cars. Rubber does not grow in Michigan, and European producers enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the rubber trade because of their Asian colonies. So, typically, the car magnate decided to grow his own.
 The site chosen for Ford's new rubber plantation was an area of some 2.5 million acres on the banks of the Tapajos River, a tributary of the Amazon about 600 miles from the Atlantic. It took Ford's agents approximately 18 hours to reach the place by riverboat from the nearest town. 
 Ford's vision was a replica Midwestern town, with modern plumbing, hospitals, schools, sidewalks, tennis courts and even a golf course. There would be no drink or other forms of immorality, but gardening for all and chaste dances every week. 
 Fordlandia would not just make car production more efficient. By applying the principles of rational organization to turn out goods at an ever faster pace, Ford would also be improving the lives of those who worked in the new town, bringing health and wealth to American managers and Brazilian laborers alike. In Grandin's words, this outpost of modern capitalism was to be ''an example of his particular American dream, of how Ford-style capitalism -- high wages, humane benefits and moral improvement -- could bring prosperity to a benighted land.'' 
 That blueprint may have worked in Ford's River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Mich. It most emphatically did not work in the jungle. Instead of a miniature but improved North American city, what Ford created was a broiling, pestilential hellhole of disease, vice and violence, closer to Dodge City than peaceable Dearborn.
 The American overseers found it hard to retain employees, who tended to wander off after earning enough to satisfy their immediate wants. Those who stayed died in large numbers, from viper bites, malaria, yellow fever and numerous other tropical afflictions.
 Prohibition was supposed to be rigorously upheld, but after a day spent hacking at the encircling jungle, the workers headed to the bars and bordellos that sprang up around the site. Knife fights erupted; venereal disease was rife. Along with prohibition, Ford's other rules were also resented, particularly the imposed diet of brown rice, whole-wheat bread and tinned peaches. When a new cafeteria was introduced in place of waiter service, the men rioted, destroying the mess hall and wrecking every vehicle on the property.
 Meanwhile, some of the Americans brought in to run the project went mad. One man hurled himself from a boat into a nest of crocodiles. The wife of one official recalled the flying bugs with ''claws just like lobsters.'' 
 Grandin paints a Conradian portrait of Einar Oxholm, the Norwegian ship's captain appointed manager of Fordlandia. We see him sipping rum (in defiance of company policy) as the fledgling community disintegrated. Oxholm was honest, but otherwise entirely unsuited to his task, knowing nothing whatever about cultivating rubber or managing men on land. He would finally return to the United States, leaving behind the graves of four of his children.
 Indeed, Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'' resonates through every page of this book, as the white men struggle and succumb to the jungle. In 1929, two Ford employees, Johansen, a Scot, and Tolksdorf, a German, headed upriver with orders to collect rubber seeds. Instead, they went on an alcoholic bender, marooned their cook on a deserted island and ended up in the tiny town of Barra. There Johansen, the self-proclaimed ''rubber seed king of the upper rivers,'' bought some perfume from a trading post and was seen chasing goats, cows and chickens, attempting to anoint the animals with perfume and shouting: ''Mr. Ford has lots of money; you might as well smell good too.'' A drunken man spraying perfume into the jungle is an oddly fitting image for the entire enterprise.
 The great carmaker himself witnessed none of this. He never set foot in the town that bore his name, yet his powerful, contradictory personality influenced every aspect of the project. The story of Fordlandia is a biography of Ford in relief, the man who championed small-town America but did more to destroy it than any other, the pioneer who aimed to lift workers from drudgery but pioneered a method of soul-destroying mass production that rendered them mere cogs.
 Ford was obsessed, among other things, by Thomas Edison, soybeans, antiques and order. He hated unions, cows, Wall Street, Franklin Roosevelt and Jews. He also, fatally, despised experts. Ford's Amazon team had plenty of able men, but as Grandin observes, ''what it didn't have was a horticulturalist, agronomist, botanist, microbiologist, entomologist or any other person who might know something about jungle rubber and its enemies'' -- the lace bugs and leaf blight that laid siege to the rubber trees, the swarms of caterpillars that left areas of the plantation ''as bare as bean poles.'' 
 Given the obstacles, it is astonishing how much the creators of Fordlandia did achieve. During its brief heyday, Fordlandia boasted red fire hydrants on neat streets, running water, a sawmill, a water tower and weekly square dancing. But the intransigence of the jungle, changes in the world economy and war ensured its ignominious demise. The Ford Motor Company invested $20 million in Fordlandia. In 1945 it was sold to the Brazilian government for $244,200.

HEADLINE: Modest Italian Fare In a Relaxed Setting

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE LYNESS

 BODY:
A BIT of good fortune ensuing from this gloomy economy is the willingness of restaurants, eager to encourage traffic, to offer affordable prix fixe menus. 
 When Terry Noyes, the chef and owner of Restaurant Bocca in East Haven, opened his place on Main Street about four years ago, he ran an early-evening, three-course prix fixe -- salad or soup, entree and dessert -- for less than $20. 
 It was so successful, Mr. Noyes said, that customers would call from the road at 7:25 p.m., begging him to extend the 7:30 deadline. So three months ago he took heed and revamped the menu so each entree comes with an appetizer and dessert (there is also a small list of supplemental a la carte appetizers. The happy result is that you can eat well, if not brilliantly, at Bocca for about the cost of dinner at a local diner. 
 Mr. Noyes is an engaging and energetic man whom you are likely to see bounding around the dining room in shorts. A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, he previously owned Armory Square Cafe in Milford, Conn., and Nantucket Tapas, in Nantucket, Mass.; Bocca, which means ''mouth'' in Italian, has replaced Ristorante Faustini, an Italian eatery that had occupied the space for nearly 20 years.
 Good value, thrift and resourcefulness are the bywords here, giving the place a relaxed, unassuming feel. Mr. Noyes renovated before opening, and every square inch of the space is used. For this summer, he knocked out the large window behind the bar (he calls it the Boathouse Bar in honor of its nautical decor) and set up a counter and stools along what is now its outside wall for additional al fresco dining. He recently added breakfast three mornings a week, serving under the name the Hungry Duck (the same location, but Mr. Noyes thought the name would appeal more to a breakfast crowd). 
 The ingredients are modest, as are the tableware and the decor. Paper table mats and disposable napkins substitute for linens, and every now and then a plastic dish sneaks in among the china. When asked about his very good multigrain bread (served warm, with olives and a roasted head of garlic), Mr. Noyes enthusiastically told how he got a deal on it from Bread and Chocolate Bakery and Cafe in Hamden. 
 The food is serviceable, sometimes much better. The rigatoni Bolognese ($17.95) falls into the latter category; the al dente pasta is covered with a nicely balanced, meaty tomato sauce and a scoop of ricotta cheese. 
 Another good bet is the Tuscan chicken (also $17.95), a well-browned, moist-fleshed half-bird, accompanied by zucchini wedges, roasted tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Capers and a little spice in the sauce wake things up. 
 A special of penne with lobster and vodka sauce ($19.95) does not skimp on lobster, and the portobello mushroom and spinach ravioli, a housemade special that uses wonton skins instead of pasta, is pleasant if a bit bland. 
 Prix fixe appetizer selections -- Caesar salad, Bocca salad with balsamic dressing, or soup -- are fine, and entrees are so ample that there is no real need to order another starter a la carte. That said, the crisp Italian egg rolls, stuffed with sausage and spinach and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese on a bed of tomato sauce ($5.95), should not be missed. Deep-fried, spicy calamari ($9.95) and zucchini fingers dredged in flour and cornmeal ($4.95) are tasty too.
 For dessert, the cheesecake was cool and creamy, but the carrot layer cake and brownie were dry. 
 A just balance of quality and value in a restaurant is challenging, particularly with prices on the rise. Mr. Noyes does a great job of offering quality food in a comfortable, friendly ambience at prices we have not seen in a while.

HEADLINE: The Gift Economist

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
As the editor of Wired magazine and a champion of the online life, you have just written a controversial book, ''Free: The Future of a Radical Price,'' that suggests that companies can profit by giving away digital services and products. It's paradoxical. By giving away products to lots of people, you can make money. Free is the greatest marketing tool there is. It allows you to expose the biggest audience to what you do, and then the question is: Who's going to pay? Google is the poster child of free. It's one of the most profitable companies in America, but it doesn't show up on your credit-card statement.
 Several critics have already pointed out flaws in your argument, citing YouTube as an example of a mass sensation that is losing enormous sums of money. YouTube is owned by Google and today loses money. But Google has achieved something extraordinary, which is a network-television-size audience. The problem with YouTube is not that it costs too much to deliver that video but that we have not found a way to migrate television advertising as quickly as the television audience has migrated. 
 Why not just sell subscriptions, as in the HBO model, which proves that people are willing to pay for quality? The original concept of the information superhighway from the early '90s was going to be exactly that. We're now 15 years past that, and the marketplace has spoken. The marketplace wants free. Consumers want free, and if you decide to set up a subscription service, then your competitor will make a free one. 
 I wonder if all this is rooted in yuppie entitlement. What's disturbing is that no one wants to pay for anything anymore, which is why we're in the midst of an economic meltdown. You do see a generation going online expecting things to be free, from their Facebook pages to their music downloads to their video games. I don't think that's driven by entitlement but by an innate understanding of the digital market. 
 You were recently accused of plagiarizing numerous passages of your book from Wikipedia, and I am wondering if you see plagiarism as an extension of your freebie thesis. I wish I could explain all my actions as being intellectually consistent, but this one is just plain old sloppiness. There are questions about whether one should cite Wikipedia, and I'm one of those who think you should. 
 Frankly, if you want to be a public intellectual, you shouldn't be using Wikipedia to research a book of ideas in the first place. The level of scholarship and analysis on Wikipedia is improving by the day, and we neglect it at our peril. 
 Where are you from? I was born in London and grew up in Washington, D.C. I failed out of the University of Maryland, and then spent my 20s playing in punk-rock bands. I went back to school at George Washington and got a degree in physics. 
 What did your parents do? Are they still around? They are. They are both former journalists. My mother's family was in radical politics, and her great-grandfather Jo Labadie was one of the founders of the American anarchist movement. My mother's biography of him was called ''All-American Anarchist.''
 In that context, your book seems like an assault or at least a trivialization of your family's past, glorifying free enterprise in the place of political freedom. Or an implicit affirmation. I'm a libertarian, small ''l,'' please. Free people, free markets.
 I hear you live in Berkeley with your wife and five young children. When we got married, I told my wife I wanted cats. She said she wanted six children. And we compromised on five children and no cats. 
 Maybe you had five children so you could get more stuff for free. It doesn't really work that way. You don't get a volume discount on children. But I should probably be smarter about using my labor force.

HEADLINE: Steak, Seafood and Wine, Evoking the Plenty of Yore

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
NOBODY will ever accuse Don Luisi of lying low, of keeping his head down in hopes of waiting out the current economic unpleasantness. When I ran into Mr. Luisi while admiring the graceful stone veranda outside his two-year-old restaurant, Doc's, he instantly offered to give me a tour of his wine-cellar dining room, still under construction. (He had no idea, he later told me on the phone, that I was reviewing the restaurant.)
 It is an impressive space, befitting the ambition that radiates from every corner of this 10,000-square-foot restaurant. When it is completed, it will make a splendid setting for the legions of bottles on an outstandingly diverse wine list. Upstairs, diners will continue to tuck into brawny, satisfying platters of steaks, chops and seafood in understated men's-club-style furnishings densely planted with cherry wood and leather. 
 If it all sounds out of sync, a throwback to a go-go era (so long ago; what, 2007?) when diners with thick portfolios could routinely drop $45 on veal porterhouse, consider a couple of things.
 First, Mr. Luisi, 53, is deeply serious about food. A developer by trade and a passionate amateur cook, he has long surrounded himself with prominent chefs. He says he acquired the nickname Doc from one of them -- as in ''Give that problem to Doc; he can fix it.'' 
 For help with his namesake restaurant, he recruited two of the biggest culinary names in the state: Craig Shelton, the chef and owner of the late, extraordinary Ryland Inn, as consulting chef; and Yasir Chaudhry, Mr. Shelton's former sommelier, as general manager and overseer of the wine list. While the menu lists a ''Grandpa Shelton's New England clam chowder,'' Mr. Shelton says he is more of a business consultant; the kitchen is run by the young and highly competent chef de cuisine, Wade New.
 Second, it is possible to put together a terrific meal here without venturing into porterhouse country. (Our highest-priced entrees were two fine wood-grilled steaks, New York strip at $28 and Brazilian skirt at $22.) The wine list has a section labeled ''20 for $20,'' from which we ordered a 2006 cabernet sauvignon from Avalon Winery in the Napa Valley; it was unpretentious and uncomplicated, cherry-scented and faintly smoky. 
 The menu offers a ''Wall Street blues special'' for $16.95 -- on each of our two visits, a generous slab of prime rib -- and an assortment of personal pizzas ($8 or so, depending on toppings), along with the obligatory burger ($8 plus toppings at $1 each). The pizza was nothing much, and the prime rib was oddly dry (though the accompanying popover was fabulously crunchy and fragrant with nutmeg). But there is still another low-cost option: ''first tastings,'' at $7 to $12, that showcase the kitchen's prowess and can easily form the basis for a light meal.
 We ordered these liberally. A dozen meaty Portuguese clams came in a soulful broth intense with wine and chorizo. ''Spoons,'' or half scallops over truffled mashed potatoes, were served on a whimsical platform of bent spoons. 
 A fuller scallop experience came in the form of two blackened jumbo specimens, pearly, tender and sizzlingly spiced. And bacon was a revelation: two thick slabs, each nine inches long, redolent of applewood smoke and a perfect match for the garlicky, peppery chimichurri sauce served on the side.
 Along with soup or a salad, a glass or two of bargain wine and a shared dessert like the gloriously rich, cinnamon-infused apple crisp, a full meal with tax and tip can come in well under the price of that veal porterhouse. Not a bad way to spend a Saturday evening -- especially if the weather is fine and you can score a table on the veranda, edged by a rock garden with a whispering waterfall. Close your eyes and it will feel like that blissful, innocent summer of 2007.

HEADLINE: Battling the Decay of Foreclosures

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
THE homes on either side of the decrepit structure at 716 Narragansett Avenue in East Patchogue, N.Y., are delineated by orderly chain-link fences. Their lawns are shorn, their flower beds painstakingly mulched. A parakeet twitters beneath twin sun umbrellas on the rear deck at one home, No. 722. With curtains fluttering in the windows and shiny S.U.V.'s hunkered in the driveways, the two residences are a model of working-class suburbia in repose. 
 But the decaying '60s colonial-style house sandwiched between those two prim residences is a dead zone, one of a hundred vacant houses in the Long Island town that are widely believed to have caught the subprime mortgage contagion. Its front yard is a tangle of weeds and buckled concrete walkways, its backyard an illegal dumping ground for opportunistic contractors. In one of the broken second-floor bedroom windows, a child's Scooby-Doo sheet, an incongruous remnant of happier times, is substituting as a window shade. No one would want to call this place home; no one does. 
 ''It's no good,'' said Yanira Amaya, the frazzled neighbor at tidy No. 722, about living next door to an abandoned eyesore. Hers is not an isolated problem. Travel a few streets east to Meade Avenue in North Bellport, and the desolation is magnified. In the space of a city block, four tiny ranch-style houses sit boarded up and vacant, all presumably victims of foreclosure or its frequent harbinger, the negligence of an owner or investor. 
 Foreclosure is an individual and family loss, and a host of groups are addressing that aspect of the problem. But in many Long Island towns, as well as other locations like Orange, N.J., New Haven, Yonkers and Bedford-Stuyvesant in New York City, homeowners and local groups are also battling the wider effect of foreclosures -- the disarray and devaluation of their neighborhoods.
 ''Vacant houses are a menace to neighborhood stability,'' said Patrick Morrissy, the executive director of Hands Inc., a nonprofit housing group in Orange. This spring, for $5.4 million, the group acquired the defaulted mortgages on 47 vacant houses in the greater Newark area, the opening act of a new neighborhood initiative. 
 Mr. Morrissy said a house-to-house survey he conducted in January 2008 revealed ''the first uptick in vacant houses in 14 years'' in Orange. 
 ''I would say it's hurricane season for foreclosures and 150 Katrinas are pounding urban neighborhoods across the country,'' he said. ''It's forcing us to reinvent the way we do community development.''
 Noting that 654 homes in New Jersey were repossessed in February, Mr. Morrissy added, ''We have to grow the scale of our commitment -- rescue troubled properties, organize citizens as neighborhood guardians, get new homeowners into the picture -- or this thing is going to devour us and our neighborhoods.'' 
 On Long Island, John Rogers, chairman of the Greater Bellport Coalition and a lifelong Bellport resident, has surveyed derelict homes and grown similarly concerned. 
 ''I knew the Town of Brookhaven was preparing to pay $1 million for improvements at Robert Rowley Park, our four-acre community park, which is a great thing,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''But it suddenly struck me that when I stood at the park entrance and looked at the surrounding houses, half of them were boarded up.''
 Mr. Rogers's informal survey found 100 vacant houses in various stages of dilapidation, with 70 boarded up. ''A lot of times the town comes in and does it,'' he said. ''Boarding them up is kind of a last step.'' 
 Marianne Garvin, president of the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, one of the 240 agencies eligible for $120 million in national foreclosure intervention money through a Congressionally sponsored program, has committed to refurbishing 45 vacant properties. Several were on Mr. Rogers's list of offenders. 
 Ms. Garvin's group also plans to use its share of $2 billion in federal and state Neighborhood Stabilization Program money -- $27 million is designated for Long Island -- to buy and fix up 14 residential properties in at-risk neighborhoods in Freeport, Islip, Babylon and Brookhaven. Moreover, 72 foreclosed properties have been transferred by Suffolk County for refurbishment to a handful of nonprofits, and Ms. Garvin's is among them. 
 ''We're trying to keep people in their homes via foreclosure prevention and counseling, but you can't save everybody,'' said Ms. Garvin, whose agency's foreclosure counselors assisted 50 clients in 2007, 438 in 2008 and 300 new clients in the first five months of this year. Buying orphaned properties and fixing them for sale (in the foreclosure-ravaged village of Freeport in Nassau County) or for affordable rental (in Suffolk, where rental stock is scarce) is a novel and, she said, necessary strategy. 
 ''The foreclosure trend is very complex, but the good news is that local government and community organizations are starting to attack it in all of its complexity,'' Ms. Garvin said. 
 A few restorations are already completed. In May, Mr. Morrissy's group finished refurbishing a two-family house on New Street in Orange. The house had a tenant in an unheated apartment upstairs and a deteriorated vacant apartment downstairs; now, the house has been repaired, the tenant upstairs has heat (and a lease), and the downstairs apartment is ready to rent.
 On Long Island, the Community Development Corporation is buying and fixing up 15 bank-owned homes in Freeport. The house on Narragansett Avenue and two in nearby North Bellport are its first three Suffolk projects. The mission, Ms. Garvin said, is to ''stabilize neighborhoods in clusters'' -- before the troubled properties drag down the value of adjacent homes.
 The homes in peril are many -- about 69.5 million houses nationally, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group based in Durham, N.C. To stop this domino effect early, residents in East Patchogue, Orange and New Haven are acting as community watchdogs, looking for any signs of decline on their streets on a door-to-door level. 
 ''If we don't step in now and address the problem, we could end up with entire streets that look like the house on Narragansett Avenue,'' said Geoff Stone, the director of the Bellport, Hagerman, East Patchogue Alliance, another housing advocacy group. 
 Ms. Amaya's habit of averting her eyes from the squalor at 716 Narragansett Avenue will soon end. In May, the Community Development Corporation received the title to No. 716, and members of the Greater Bellport Coalition have removed the litter in the front yard as part of a townwide cleanup effort. Soon, the house will undergo a $175,000 makeover and be ready to rent at $1,200 a month.
 When Ms. Amaya learned that, perhaps in time for the upcoming school year, there might be a habitable home next door instead of a festering junkyard, she smiled.

HEADLINE: City of Steel (and Other Stuff) to Get Its Turn on the World Economic Stage

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
This can be a quirky city. It has no discernable street grid in many of its 89 neighborhoods. The trademark cuisine is sandwiches with French fries as an ingredient. And the natives speak with a distinct accent and vocabulary, known as Pittsburghese, that is neither Midwest nor East Coast.
 The quirkiness can mask some insecurity. Residents are all too aware that the city continues to shrink -- down to about 310,000 people this year from its peak in 1950, which makes it just the 60th largest city in the country, according to the Census Bureau -- and that it still has the same budgetary problems that led it to be placed under state financial control in 2003. 
 So it is not surprising that many residents are still piqued by the laughter from White House reporters last month when President Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, announced that the leaders of 20 of the world's biggest industrial and emerging economies -- the Group of 20 -- would hold a meeting here in September.
 ''If the people in Washington were snickering, it's because they don't understand Pittsburgh and probably haven't been here,'' said Paul Hennigan, a lifelong resident and the president of Point Park University, one of the many colleges that have helped revitalize the city. ''If you don't know Pittsburgh, you would snicker about an old Rust Belt industrial city down on its luck, not the beautiful, cutting-edge place it is.''
 It is not as if Pittsburghers do not understand why people might be surprised; after all, many of the prior G-20 summit meetings were in national capitals like Beijing, Berlin and London.
 ''I could understand how they could take that attitude and laugh, because nothing like this has ever been here,'' said Leonard Tolbert, 55, who teaches tai chi and, like a dozen residents interviewed downtown recently, knew about the White House chuckling. ''And Pittsburgh is not a London or New York.''
 But as this city prepares, or ''redds up'' in Pittsburghese, for the onslaught of about 1,100 delegates and 2,000 journalists, the general sense is that after overcoming so much in the last three decades, including the loss of most of its steel industry, it deserves some respect, particularly this year when it has had so much to cheer about.
 ''I mean, why not Pittsburgh?'' said Sheree Thompson, 49, a school counselor who was working her summer job selling Italian ice from a cart downtown. ''Didn't we show people how great we were through the Super Bowl win -- which was our sixth, by the way -- and the Stanley Cup win, which was our third?'' 
 Moreover, as Mr. Gibbs told the bewildered White House reporters: ''I think it's an area that has seen its share of economic woes in the past, but because of foresight and investment is now renewed, giving birth to renewed industries that are creating the jobs of the future.''
 It is the city's story of transformation that apparently caught Mr. Obama's eye during his visits here on the campaign trail -- getting a tour with Dan Rooney, then the Steelers president and now the ambassador to Ireland -- and continues to be the story that civic leaders want to tell. 
 While Pittsburgh is still routinely referred to as Steel City -- home to the United States Steel Corporation, the United Steelworkers union and the Steelers football team, after all -- local leaders would rather hear it referred to as the City of Colleges, or the City of Bridges, or even ''Roboburgh,'' as The Wall Street Journal called it in 1999 because of its place in the development of robotics.
 ''There's no doubt our city faces an image problem,'' Mayor Luke Ravenstahlsaid, ''and that's why this summit is so important to us.''
 The reason people do not know about the transformation, said Jeffrey A. Romoff, president and chief executive of UPMC, the region's dominant health care provider and largest employer with 50,000 employees, is that the hospitals, universities, banks and green businesses that have revitalized the city have done so ''without flash.''
 ''We just get it done,'' Mr. Romoff said.
 Mr. Romoff, who frequently compares the role that UPMC now plays in the city to that of the steel industry of old, says without any sentimentality, ''This is tomorrow's city.''
 Though the city has shrunk in size, the metropolitan area, with 2.4 million people, is still the 22nd largest in the country, and the city, county and region are losing population at a slower pace than before, thanks to the health of the education-and-medical-based economy, said Dan Onorato, chief executive of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. 
 ''Anybody who laughs shows their ignorance,'' Mr. Onorato said of the White House reporters. ''Let them have their two seconds of snickering. We're going to have our three months in the spotlight.''

HEADLINE: China's Wide Reach In Africa

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
AMONG Westerners, the economic partnership between China and Africa is often overlooked. But in ''China Safari: On the Trail of Beijing's Expansion in Africa'' (Nation Books, $27.50), Serge Michel and Michel Beuret examine the roots of this relationship -- and argue that China is engaged in a conquest of Africa that will have worldwide economic implications. 
 As French journalists, Mr. Michel and Mr. Beuret bring an acute awareness of their own country's colonial history to the China-Africa story. Mr. Michel, a former West Africa correspondent for Le Monde, has also reported from Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Beuret, the foreign editor of the Swiss magazine L'Hebdo, has written extensively on human trafficking in China and Europe. 
 ''China Safari'' is a fascinating, provocative work of firsthand reporting that illuminates an important global economic story. The book also features a 16-page insert of color photographs shot by Paolo Woods, who puts human faces on the book's sprawling story and highlights some of the stark juxtapositions of African laborers and their Chinese bosses.
 In 1976, under Mao Zedong, China completed the Tan-Zam railway, linking Zambia to the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. But, as the authors note, Chinese inroads into Africa really got a kick-start in 1995, when President Jiang Zemin made a speech urging Chinese business leaders to ''Go abroad! Become world players!'' 
 Chinese business interests in Africa have grown dramatically in recent years. The authors say that bilateral trade between the regions quintupled, to $55 billion, from 2000 to 2006, and that the figure is expected to reach $100 billion by 2010. Chinese business interests in Africa range from oil, lumber, refining, agriculture, mining, textiles and banking to the construction of dams, railroads, highways, bridges, airports and housing.
 The authors contend that China's ambitions in Africa are grandly geopolitical as well as economic. As Jacob Wood, a Shanghai-born housing developer based in Africa for more than 30 years, tells them: ''I'm going to be honest with you, China is using Africa to get where the United States is now, and surpass it.''
 According to one report cited by the authors, there are now about 750,000 Chinese living and working in Africa, in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Zambia, Sudan, Algeria, Congo, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Gabon, Guinea, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Egypt and Chad.
 So far, China's ventures in Africa have produced decidedly bittersweet results.
 On the one hand, the Chinese invest heavily in infrastructure projects and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in return for being granted oil, mining and other concessions by African nations. According to the authors, Chinese ''discretion and humility'' are a breath of fresh air against a backdrop of ''colonial arrogance'' by France, Britain and other nations. In addition, the authors say, ''Africa welcomes any competition that shakes up the Western, Lebanese and Indian business monopolies.''
 Many African leaders are enamored of the Chinese mix of authoritarianism and capitalism in business affairs, an emphasis on efficiency and a lack of preaching about human rights, the authors say. Moreover, when the Chinese talk, they back up their words with concrete actions. 
 ''The Chinese build things, the Europeans don't,'' declares Claude Alphonse N'Silou, the minister of construction and housing of the Congo Republic. 
 But there are increasing signs of trouble in the Sino-African economic paradise. The book says the Chinese have been criticized for selling arms to Sudan and Zimbabwe in the past, and for showing support for the Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe. The authors also cite a United Nations report that says that thousands of machetes used in the Rwandan genocide were imported from China. 
 And the everyday workplace is riven with accusations of mistreatment of African laborers by Chinese bosses, and accusations of virulent racism that seems to contradict the Chinese image of discretion and humility.
 An opposition leader in Zambia, meanwhile, complains that his country is allowing Zambia to become ''a province -- make that a district -- of China,'' adding, ''There's nothing any minister can do when confronted by China's amoral scheming.'' The authors also cite instances of Chinese companies recently abandoning infrastructure projects without public explanation.
 Since ''China Safari'' went to press, there have been reports that China may be backing out of deals in Guinea and Congo.
 ''CHINA SAFARI'' is hobbled by the fact that Mr. Michel and Mr. Beuret were often denied access to important business people and projects. As a result, the authors occasionally resort to rambling anecdotal narratives like one in which they trace the manufacture of plastic souvenir pyramids sold at Egyptian archeological sites to -- where else? -- China.
 Despite the recitations of socioeconomic and cultural disruptions and workplace abuses, the authors reach what may be an overly sanguine conclusion. They contend that ''China's arrival has been a boon for a continent adrift,'' adding that the Chinese have ''given Africa a real sense of worth, as much in the eyes of Africans themselves as in the eyes of foreigners.''
 Still, it is not hard to join the authors in predicting that this joining of Chinese and African interests will likely succeed to the chagrin of the rest of the business world.

HEADLINE: Windscapes

BYLINE: By ADAM GOODHEART. 
Adam Goodheart is the director of Washington College's C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience.

 BODY:
Infinite power from the wind is an American dream almost as old as the country itself, an idea that has entranced generations of scientists, artists and visionaries. In the early 19th century, when most labor was still done by human hands, an immigrant inventor named John Adolphus Etzler, pondering the windmills of his native Europe, sat down to scribble out some calculations. When he finished, he declared that wind power could be harnessed to liberate mankind from toil, providing as much energy as 40 trillion workers, or about 40,000 times earth's population at that time. Imagine the glorious -- and languorous -- future that awaited!
 All that Etzler's plan required was a grid of 200-foot windmills crisscrossing every continent and ocean of the globe, in hedgelike rows set a mile apart. The perfect place to begin was in the wide-open spaces of the United States. 
 Perhaps fortunately, Etzler's dream hasn't come to pass, at least not yet. But recently, wind turbines -- the modern equivalents of his miracle contraptions -- have become ever-more-familiar features of the American landscape. From upstate New York to the Iowa prairies to the mountain passes of California, they sprout like pale and slender flowers.
 Political leaders, too, cherish plans for a future liberated by the wind: President Obama speaks of doubling alternative energy by the end of his first term, while Mayor Michael Bloomberg conjures visions of a Manhattan whose skyscrapers bristle with turbines, like the windmills that once dominated the skyline of Dutch New Amsterdam. (Last year alone, according to industry figures, the nation's wind-power capacity increased by 50 percent, although the recession and lower oil and natural-gas prices have slowed growth significantly since then.)
 But will the spreading fields of giant pinwheels help safeguard the environment -- as their advocates maintain -- or mar it, aesthetically at least, for posterity? In many areas where wind farms are built or planned, neighbors rally against them, warning that America's majestic vistas are being spoiled by high-tech eyesores.
 Just a century ago, however, windmills by the hundreds of thousands dotted many of the same landscapes where their present-day descendants now loom. Nearly every farmyard had its own spindly device atop a steel tower, pumping water and powering lamps. Those windmills, in their time, stood for the settlers' proud dominion over nature, for their self-sufficiency and for the Yankee ingenuity that produced something from nothing, literally from thin air. Dozens of manufacturers competed for customers, hawking machines whose brand names formed a kind of American poetry: Buckeye, Climax, Daisy, Dandy, OK, Tip Top, Whizz.
 Artists enshrined them in the national landscape, connecting with a tradition that stretched back across centuries of European art. When Grant Wood painted a self-portrait, he put a farm windmill over his left shoulder. For the cultural critic Lewis Mumford, the invention of windmills, along with water power, represented nothing less than a revolution in the course of human events: ''A large intelligentsia could come into existence, and great works of art and scholarship and science and engineering could be created without recourse to slavery: a release of energy, a victory for the human spirit.''
 Looking at Mitch Epstein's photographs on these pages (from his book ''American Power,'' to be published by Steidl in September, which includes images originally shot for this magazine), I wonder whether the turbines of our own century may come to stand for newer forms of self-sufficiency, less individual than national. Rising from the land in shapes as gracile as Brancusi sculptures, they seem to inhabit a middle ground between technology and nature -- perfect emblems, perhaps, of a conflicted culture that cherishes its iPhones and organic gardens in equal measure. Maybe, too, they will still stand for the old American dream of snatching something from thin air: a future without sacrifice, and liberty as boundless as the sky.

BYLINE: By ELSA DIXLER

 BODY:
THE WIDOWS OF EASTWICK, by John Updike (Ballantine, $16.) This sequel to ''The Witches of Eastwick'' (1984) returns the earlier novel's three main characters to the Rhode Island seaside town where they practiced their magic as sexy divorcees some 30 years ago. Now close to 70 and widowed by their second husbands, they are haunted by mortality and use their waning powers to atone for past crimes. The yuppified town itself has also become a character, described with Updike's customary precision (''toned-up young mothers driving their overweight boys in overweight S.U.V.'s to hockey practice 20 miles away''). His ''sorcery is startlingly fresh,'' Sam Tanenhaus said in the Book Review. Updike died in January of this year, several months after ''Widows'' was published. 
 GRAND NEW PARTY: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream, by Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam (Anchor, $15.) Douthat, a columnist for The Times, and Salam, an Atlantic Monthly editor, believe the Republican Party can regain its footing by appealing to working Americans. Their specific proposals -- wage subsidies for low-income workers, means-testing for Social Security -- are unlikely to appeal to conservatives, our reviewer, Norman Ornstein, wrote. But, he added, Douthat and Salam ''make a strong case that a conservatism of reflexive tax cuts and sink-or-swim economics will never resonate'' with voters who are ''falling behind.'' 
 THE HOUSE ON FORTUNE STREET, by Margot Livesey (Harper Perennial, $13.99.) Two women friends in their 30s live in a house on Fortune Street -- one a tenant, the other the owner. Livesey, a careful and observant writer, probes their lives and those of their lovers and absent fathers, exploring what it means to be an unmarried woman. 
 DEAR AMERICAN AIRLINES, by Jonathan Miles (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) Stranded at O'Hare on the way to (and therefore missing) his estranged daughter's wedding, the protagonist of this fine first novel begins a letter to the air carrier, demanding a refund. It soon becomes, with many digressions, a rueful reflection on his entire life. (''Damn but I wanted a cigarette. A drink. Another chance. A soul scrubbed clean.'') 
 BOTTLEMANIA: Big Business, Local Springs, and the Battle Over America's Drinking Water, by Elizabeth Royte (Bloomsbury, $15.) ''What once seemed so simple and natural, a drink of water, is neither,'' Royte writes in this engaging investigation of the water wars. Describing the American fad for bottled water and the ensuing backlash (oh no, all those plastic bottles!), she focuses on the need for investment in our failing water infrastructure and the probable increase in water scarcity worldwide. 
 EVENING IS THE WHOLE DAY, by Preeta Samarasan (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) In this first novel, set in Malaysia in 1980, the secrets of the members of an Indian lawyer's family unfold into one another, illuminating both the characters and their complex postcolonial society. In the Book Review, Allegra Goodman praised Samarasan's ''ambitious spiraling plot, her richly embroidered prose, her sense of place and her psychological acuity.'' 
 THE POLITICAL MIND: A Cognitive Scientist's Guide to Your Brain and Its Politics, by George Lakoff (Penguin, $16.) Lakoff argues that science shows that reason is mostly unconscious, and he urges progressives to present voters with ''frames,'' as Republicans successfully did for years, instead of raw facts. ''Narratives are brain structures,'' he proposes. 
 THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC TO GIRLS, by Lavinia Greenlaw (Picador, $15.) Music drives this coming-of-age memoir by Greenlaw, a British novelist and poet. In smart, lovely prose, she begins with her mother's singing and moves through her allegiance to disco, punk and new wave, bringing her youth to life. 
 LAVINIA, by Ursula K. Le Guin (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $14.95.) Le Guin relearned Latin to write this novel, a spinoff of Virgil's ''Aeneid,'' set soon after the Trojan War. In the ''Aeneid,'' Lavinia, who becomes Aeneas' second wife, speaks only a few words; here, in fresh and simple prose, Le Guin gives her voice and creates her world. 
 INSOMNIAC, by Gayle Greene (University of California, $13.95.) About a third of Americans suffer from insomnia enough to complain about it, but scientists know very little about its causes or the efficacy of treatments. Greene, a lifelong insomniac, explores the experience of her fellow sufferers and the world of sleep research. ''I am really very tired of being told what it's like to live in my body by people who haven't a clue,'' she writes. 
 FAR AFIELD: A Sportswriting Odyssey,by S. L. Price (Harper Perennial, $13.99.) Price, a writer for Sports Illustrated, spent a year based in Europe. Here he reports engagingly about skiing in Austria, cricket in Pakistan, the Tour de France and the 2004 Summer Olympics. ''He hits it over the fence,'' our reviewer, Gordon Marino, said.

HEADLINE: On The Coast of Crazy

 BODY:
Mark Leibovich has some interesting things to say about the people seeking to become the next governor of California, but he either isn't really interested in solutions to serious problems or the prospective candidates had nothing much to say about what they would do to solve them. Perhaps this is the most interesting conclusion of all: California politics is about style, not substance. Having lived there for 38 years before emigrating to the Southeast, I am not at all surprised. 
 NORMAN RAVITCH Savannah, Ga.
 A native Californian, I've spent the past decade living in one state where politicians are staid and reliable (Iowa) and another where they're inept and corrupt (Nevada). Mark Liebovich's piece on California's 2010 governor's race made me homesick for the state where they're ambitious, obnoxious, creative and relentlessly memorable. Too bad the voters take it for granted. 
 AMBER WITHYCOMBE Henderson, Nev.
 How reassuring to me as a resident of California that I know at the end of the day our governor can go home from his well-equipped smoking tent to his Jacuzzi, lie back with a stogie and not feel depressed. Perhaps he should take a stop at reality on the way from his bear statue to his well-stocked conference room to see how the rest of his state is doing. With his proposed budget cuts, more and more of the state is living like Conan the Barbarian rather than the Governator.
 SHARON HOLDT San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
 Thank you for exposing the upcoming gubernatorial race in California for precisely what it is: a carnival show. Next year's race for governor in Sacramento is full of the resident carnival barkers we see too often in the Golden State. And your article was made even more poignant by the picture on the cover showing the lead carny, the San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. As a long-time resident of the City by the Bay, I can't wait until the current mayor leaves his post. He has been an unmitigated failure leading this city. I pity the state of California if by some bizarre circumstance Newsom were to become governor.
 For Californians, it is great to know that The New York Times feels about as cynical as we do about the 2010 California gubernatorial sitcom. Kudos to Mark Leibovich for writing a scathing and hilarious piece.
 STEPHEN M. SALVATORE San Francisco
 Gavin Newsom is part of a new generation of politicians who are taking leadership posts throughout the country. Just as President Obama represented change at the very top of this country, Newsom can represent the same thing in being elected governor of California.
 He is not burdened by the problems of the past, including the fiscal problems that California now finds itself in. He took a brave stand in calling for equality for gays and lesbians when it wasn't particularly popular to do so outside of San Francisco. He will make similar brave and innovative moves as governor of one of the largest economies in the world.
 STEVEN M. CLAYTON Ocean, N.J.
 Mark Leibovich's informative and engaging story about California attributed to Mayor Gavin Newsom a clever and apparently original characterization, describing his own city as ''47 square miles surrounded by reality.'' That characterization (as both the writer and the mayor might have known given their interest in matters political) was first applied not to San Francisco but to Madison, Wis.
 In 1978, the insurgent Republican candidate for governor of Wisconsin, Lee Sherman Dreyfus, campaigned across the state describing that capital city as ''30 square miles surrounded by reality'' (as reported in a column by Doug Moe in The Capital Times, a Madison newspaper, on Dec. 16, 1999). He governed the state realistically for four years -- from Madison -- which, incidentally, never was just 30 square miles and has grown to more than 75 square miles. Whether reality has invaded either city still remains an open question.
 BRADY WILLIAMSON Madison, Wis.
 I'm a transplant from New York who has lived in California for 13 years. I also happen to be a small-town politician and city councilman. I've long mourned the state of the Golden State, so I started reading ''On the Coast of Crazy'' with great anticipation. I was interested to see The New York Times's take on the problems facing California state government. I was disappointed. Instead of doing the heavy lifting of examining the issues that make this state essentially ungovernable, Leibovich and your editors took the easy way out. You focused merely on the personalities of those who want to be our next governor. That may have been fun for writer and editors and entertaining to the majority of your readers, but the article was little more than People-magazine-style journalism and hardly illuminating.
 ANDREW CARTER San Luis Obispo, Calif.
 The answer to ''who can possibly govern California?'' is no one. The Legislature in California, like New York's, faces gridlock because of a highly partisan Democratic majority and Republican minority. Creative gerrymandering has resulted in a 99 percent re-election rate. California has a short-term budget deficit of more than $40 billion and even larger long-term debt. Only Uncle Sam has larger short- and long-term debt.
 The solution should be implemented after the 2010 census: remove redistricting power from the governor, Senate and State Assembly leadership. Have the League of Women Voters or some other impartial group redraw district boundaries to prevent incumbents of both parties from stacking the deck in their favor.
 California needs to return to limited government accompanied by a minimal amount of confiscatory taxation to support only essential services along with pay-as-you-go budgeting; means testing for all government-assistance programs; balanced budgets; actual surpluses and down payments to reduce long-term debt.
 LARRY PENNER Great Neck, N.Y.
 The most striking aspect of the current crop of prospective candidates is that every one of them is from Northern California, yet the large majority of the state's population lives in Southern California. Both San Francisco and Sacramento are almost 400 miles from Los Angeles and nearly 500 miles from San Diego, which may help explain the evident disconnect between politics and reality in the Golden State, as well as the general disengaged nature of the body politic. This fiscal crisis will pass as every other one has passed, and the sky will not fall. At some point we will get a more responsible, centrist Legislature that addresses the long-term needs of California, with water and infrastructure at the top of the list. These are the same issues facing every other fast-growing part of the American West. California is not really so different; it's just first.

CHEAP
 The High Cost of Discount Culture
 By Ellen Ruppel Shell
 296 pp. The Penguin Press. $25.95
 Ellen Ruppel Shell has been studying the price, the value and the cost of things -- all sorts of things, bookcases and summer dresses and plastic wrap and key chains and tube socks and hammers. And shrimp, the subject of a brief, appalling tale that illustrates what she's up to in this important book. Until the 1970s or so, shrimp was a luxury for most Americans. Thanks to a huge boom in shrimp farming, especially in Thailand, supplies soared during the '80s, and prices started to fall. Now, Ruppel Shell reports in ''Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture,'' we eat shrimp as casually as we eat tuna fish -- more casually, in fact, since our consumption of shrimp actually outstrips our consumption of canned tuna. If you order shrimp at a midrange restaurant like Red Lobster, you get a hefty portion for about $16 -- and if you're there during the annual ''Endless Shrimp'' promotion, you can keep on ordering until you topple right over into the garlic butter. It's still only $16. 
 The downside? According to Ruppel Shell, a contributing editor for The Atlantic, it's all downside, and billions of rubbery shrimp are the least of it. For a while, there were some newly affluent shrimp-farmers along the coast of Thailand as traditional operations were transformed into gigantic factories with the help of international lenders and investors. Massive onslaughts of chemicals made the factories productive, but fish -- like cows and pigs and chickens -- do not flourish in the long run under such extreme, artificial conditions. They get sick, and their ponds become black holes of pollution and toxic waste. ''What followed was ruinous debt, environmental degradation, horrifying human rights abuses and violence that left millions destitute,'' Ruppel Shell writes. Moral: Despite what's jotted down on the restaurant check, there's no such thing as cheap shrimp.
 And as Ruppel Shell makes clear in a brisk, persuasive set of examples, a great many other price tags are deceptive as well. At the big discount stores, most discounts are applied to everyday necessities like toothpaste and lettuce. Brand-name clothing and appliances may be no bargain at all. ''Wal-Mart actually has higher than average prices on about one-third of the stock it carries,'' Ruppel Shell writes. ''On those items for which prices are lower, the average savings is 37 cents, with about one-third of items carrying a savings of no more than 2 cents. The lower food prices, however, do impress a number of economists, who argue that the discounts benefit everyone by forcing down food prices all over town. ''Even if you never shop at Wal-Mart, you are still better off with Wal-Mart nearby,'' the M.I.T. economist Jerry Hausman told Ruppel Shell, and he judged that effect to be ''the equivalent of 25 percent of food spending.'' Yet his study compared only the cost -- not the quality -- of largely generic items. ''How are consumers to know whether the lower price of chicken breasts at Wal-Mart'' signifies ''a good deal on a superior product or a bad deal on an inferior product?'' Ruppel Shell wonders. Plainly it would be awkward to advise a struggling homemaker that she really ought to be spending more on her daughter's new shoes, and Ruppel Shell doesn't go that far. But she does show that the impact of rock-bottom prices on a stringent family budget is to some extent illusory. ''Discounts don't compensate for the staggering and rising costs of essentials -- housing, education and health care,'' she emphasizes.
 Cheap chicken, cheap shirts, cheap sneakers -- they're all being paid for by somebody, even if it's not the person taking them home. More than a third of the working poor, Ruppel Shell notes, have jobs in retail, where the annual mean wage for a department store ''associate'' is $18,280. That's one reason we pay so little for those shirts and sneakers. We're also being subsidized by a distant labor force we never see, the Chinese and Mexicans and Vietnamese who work under well-documented Dickensian conditions. As Ruppel Shell acknowledges, sweatshops represent a step up from the miserable rural poverty these young men and women left behind. But the workers themselves have no leverage to demand higher wages or more humane treatment, since manufacturers can go almost anywhere in the world to find a more compliant work force. Of course, American companies claim to investigate and audit their overseas factories, but most abuses are never uncovered. The local bosses are very good at hiding offenses and falsifying documents. ''We lecture our kids on social responsibility and then buy them toys assembled by destitute child workers on some far-flung foreign shore,'' Ruppel Shell writes. ''Somehow the Age of Cheap has raised cognitive dissonance to a societal norm.'' 
 Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, told Ruppel Shell that raising the wages of a worker in Mexico by 30 percent would add only 1.2 percent to the price of a shirt -- that's 24 cents on a $20 shirt. Most companies won't hear of it. Cost-cutting is the only value they recognize, in part because profit margins are so narrow that companies can't afford to compete on any basis except ever-lower prices. An American dream once fueled by ideas and entrepreneurship has been reduced to laying off workers and reducing risk. ''When prices are kept too low, innovation is nearly impossible,'' the Harvard economist Robert Lawrence told Ruppel Shell. Apparently we're not even building better mousetraps anymore -- just cheaper ones.
 Ruppel Shell doesn't conclude with any grand ideas for reshaping the world's economy, though she praises Wegmans and Costco, arguing that they manage to thrive without doing a lot of damage. But she doesn't need to formulate grand ideas here. She's delivered something much more valuable: a first-rate job of reporting and analysis. Pay full price for this book, if you can stand to. It's worth it.

HEADLINE: Pared-Down Episcopal Church Is Looking to Grow Through 'Inclusivity'

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Episcopal Church is betting its future on the hope that there are more young people out there like Will Hay.
 Mr. Hay, 17, was one of the youngest voting delegates at the church's 10-day triennial convention, which ended Friday. He has stuck with his church, even when the priest and most of the parishioners in his conservative San Diego parish quit the Episcopal Church two years ago in protest of its liberal moves, particularly the approval in 2003 of an openly gay bishop, V. Gene Robinson. Mr. Hay has helped rebuild his parish, which was left with 48 people and has since drawn nearly 100 new members. 
 Mr. Hay is no left-wing ideologue, and in fact fears that some of the convention's landmark decisions last week may alienate even more conservatives. The church's convention voted not to stand in the way if another gay bishop were elected and to allow for the blessing of same-sex couples. 
 But Mr. Hay was not troubled by those things. And he believes that the church can grow by emphasizing ''inclusivity,'' the favorite buzzword of Episcopalians.
 ''I'm sure we will attract people who are saying maybe we are doing it right,'' Mr. Hay said as he came off the convention floor for lunch one day with his mother. ''For me it seems right because I was raised in a household where we were always taught to accept everyone, regardless of creed, color, gender or sexual identity.'' 
 Whether Episcopalians really can regenerate a church based on youth and ''inclusivity'' remains to be seen. 
 So far, they have paid a price for their actions. Four bishops, the majority of their dioceses and numerous parishes around the country jumped ship in the last few years to form a new, theologically conservative entity called the Anglican Church in North America. That group will not consecrate women, not to mention gay men and lesbians, as bishops. It has about 100,000 members, while the Episcopal Church has about two million. 
 But a church study shows that membership declined about 6 percent from 2003 to 2007.
 The Episcopal Church also saw its contributions decline, though church experts say it is hard to know how much of that drop is attributable to the economic downturn. The convention voted last week to cut the budget by $23 million over three years and eliminate about 30 out of 180 staff positions at church headquarters in New York and other locations. 
 To theological conservatives, these are signs of a church that will ultimately collapse because it has sold its soul to secular political causes. Two conservative bishops who have remained in the Episcopal Church appeared at a news briefing last week organized by a conservative Anglican group and mourned the direction their church has taken. 
 ''I am a lifelong Episcopalian, a lifelong Anglican,'' said Bishop William Love of Albany, who appeared on the verge of tears. ''It is breaking my heart to see the church destroy itself.
 ''Rather than being a blessing for the church, I believe ultimately it will be a curse on the church. Rather than bringing more people into the church, I believe it will drive more people away.'' 
 Bishop Peter Beckwith of Springfield, Ill., said, ''It's a disaster.'' 
 But when asked whether they would lead their dioceses out of the church, both bishops said probably not. Part of the reason was that they would be likely to face legal wrangling over properties, and part is simply their faithfulness to the church. 
 ''I have not sensed that this is the direction the Lord is calling us to,'' Bishop Love said. ''It all depends on what you focus on. My intent is to keep us focused on Jesus Christ and not on the storm.'' 
 It may be that all the motivated conservative bishops and parishes that considered homosexuality the deal breaker have already left, or have just grown tired of fighting. 
 Toward the end of the convention last week, 27 of the church's active and retired bishops signed a minority report putting their objections on record. Above all, they are concerned that the Episcopal Church has jeopardized its place in the Anglican Communion, the international network of churches that trace their roots to the Church of England. But the conservative bishops concluded in their minority report that they had not been made to feel like they did not belong, and signaled that they, too, did not intend to leave.
 ''We are grateful for those who have reached out to the minority, affirming our place in the church,'' they wrote. 
 Mr. Hay, the 17-year-old convention deputy, said he knew that other conservative Episcopal parishes in San Diego were ''on the fence,'' and he hoped they would not depart. 
 ''What it's about is keeping people at the table,'' he said, ''pushing more discussion.''

HEADLINE: A Jostling Match

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
IT is important to remember in this age of our discontent that not all Americans are suffering equally. One man's loss can be another's gain. 
 And nowhere is this more true than in luxury Manhattan real estate, where the recession has created billions of dollars in paper losses for many, and opportunities for a few intrepid buyers to capture trophy properties at a steep discount. 
 On the West Side, brokers say, a group of French investors was hoping to scoop up valuable town houses at fire-sale prices, and rent them out until the market took off for the stratosphere again. But this spring, they were outbid by an American hedge fund manager with money to spare.
 That bit of one-upmanship produced that rarest of all denouements in the current market, a sale above the final asking price -- though below asking prices that had been dreamed of earlier. Brokers say the winning bidder plans to jump on Madonna's broad-house bandwagon and create a 38-foot-wide mansion by combining two landmark town houses of brick and brownstone on West 70th Street. Madonna's new home, which is on East 81st Street, is chubbier; it's 57 feet wide.
 The century-old town houses at 130 and 132 West 70th, a tree-lined block between Columbus Avenue and Broadway, had been cut up into small apartments and marketed to buyers looking for investment income. 
 The house at 130 West 70th Street was bought about 15 years ago by Gerald Lieblich, the owner of the Russian Tea Room on West 57th Street. It was then renovated and rented out.
 It was put on the market in January by Vandenberg Real Estate, a firm that specializes in West Side town houses, for $5 million. ''Live in the triplex and receive high income from the six one-bedroom apartments above and enjoy this tree-lined block!'' the listing gushed.
 In March, as the economy worsened, the price was cut by 10 percent to $4.5 million, and a number of investors toured the building. In April, Dexter Guerrieri negotiated a sale to the hedge fund manager for $4.225 million. 
 The town house next door at No. 132 was owned by Dr. Louis Savas, a chiropractor who opened an office there after buying the building in 1973 for $84,000. It was divided into at least eight units. June Phillips, a Halstead broker, listed it for $5.5 million last September.
 The price was cut twice, finally arriving at $4 million, at which point the owner agreed to an offer from the French investors of around $3.5 million, Ms. Phillips said. 
 Then, on the day that an inspector hired by the French investors was going through the building, Mr. Guerrieri called, this time representing the buyer next door. Mr. Guerrieri took his client by for a visit. ''By the time we got to the roof, they handed me an offer,'' Ms. Phillips said. After a bit of negotiating the final price was set at $4.3 million, 7.5 percent above the asking price. The sale closed in early July and was filed last week. 
 Each deed was filed under a separate limited liability company, and the brokers would not disclose the identity of the buyer of the two town houses. The last market-rate tenants in the buildings are to move out by October.

HEADLINE: Before College, Costly Advice Just on Getting In

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The free fashion show at a Greenwich, Conn., boutique in June was billed as a crash course in dressing for a college admissions interview.
 Yet the proposed ''looks'' -- a young man in seersucker shorts, a young woman in a blue blazer over a low-cut blouse and short madras skirt -- appeared better suited for a nearby yacht club. After Jennifer Delahunty, dean of admissions at Kenyon College, was shown photos of those outfits, she rendered her review. 
 ''I burst out laughing,'' she said.
 Shannon Duff, the independent college counselor who organized the event, says she ordinarily charges families ''in the range of'' $15,000 for guidance about the application process, including matters far more weighty than just what to wear. 
 Ms. Duff is a practitioner in a rapidly growing, largely unregulated field seeking to serve families bewildered by the admissions gantlet at selective colleges. 
 No test or licensing is required to offer such services, and there is no way to evaluate the counselors' often extravagant claims of success or experience. And Ms. Duff's asking price, though higher than many, is eclipsed by those of competitors who may charge upwards of $40,000 -- more than a year's tuition at many colleges. 
 In the last three years, the number of independent admissions advisers (as opposed to school-based counselors) is estimated to have grown to nearly 5,000, from about 2,000, according to the Independent Educational Consultants Association, a membership group trying to promote basic standards of competency and ethics. While initially clustered on the East and West Coasts, counselors are making inroads across the country.
 The consultants association has made a particular target of counselors who boast of helping nearly all their clients gain admission to their top-choice colleges.
 ''When you say things like, 'We know the secrets of getting in,' it kind of implies that it's not the student's ability,'' said Mark H. Sklarow, executive director of the association, in Fairfax, Va. ''It suggests that there's some kind of underground code.''
 A reputable, experienced counselor might, for a few hundred dollars, help a student compile a list of prospective colleges, or brainstorm topics for an essay. But others demand tens of thousands of dollars to oversee the entire application process -- tutoring jittery applicants on what classes to take in high school or musical instruments to play, the better, their families are told, to impress the admissions dean.
 Never mind that admissions officers say that no outsider can truly predict how a particular applicant might fare. ''I guess there are snake oil salesman in every field,'' said Amy Gutmann, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, ''and they are preying on vulnerable and anxious people.''
 While the going national rate for such work is about $185 an hour, a counselor in Vermont and another in New York City are among those who charge some families more than $40,000. Their packages might begin when a child is in eighth grade.
 ''It's annoying when people complain about the money,'' the Vermont-based counselor, Michele Hernandez, said. ''I'm at the top of my field. Do people economize when they have a brain tumor and are looking for a neurosurgeon? If you want to go with someone cheaper, or chance it, don't hire me.''
 Dr. Hernandez, a former Dartmouth admissions officer, says she counsels as many as 25 students in each high school grade each year. She also offers four-day ''boot camps'' every August in a Boston hotel, charging 40 incoming high school seniors as much as $14,000 each. 
 Lee Stetson, who retired in 2007 after three decades as dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, now has a counseling practice near Philadelphia, where he charges as much as $15,000 for his junior-senior package. Unlike many competitors, Mr. Stetson says he cautions his small group of clients, maybe seven students a year, that he will not handicap their chances of admission to a particular college, nor button-hole former colleagues on their behalf. ''I'm hoping they see me more as someone who understands the process,'' he said, ''than someone who can influence the chances of acceptance.''
 While Mr. Stetson was one of the most influential admissions officers in the country, the extent of other counselors' experience may be more difficult for parents to divine. 
 On her business Web site, Collegiate Compass, Ms. Duff says she brings ''firsthand perspective to today's admissions landscape,'' borne of her earlier work ''as a reader'' in the Yale undergraduate admissions office. While outside readers help evaluate some candidates' files, they typically have no decision-making authority. 
 It is not uncommon for other counselors to exaggerate their backgrounds. Ivy Success, in Garden City, N.Y., which charges some clients nearly $30,000, says on its Web site that its counselors have ''years of experience as admissions officers to help you gain an edge in this competitive and uncertain process.''
 Victoria Hsiao, a partner in Ivy Success, said in an interview that she had worked as an admissions officer at Cornell for several years in ''the late 1990s.'' But Jason Locke, the director of undergraduate admissions at the university, said there was no record, or memory, of Ms. Hsiao doing such work. (Mr. Locke did confirm that she graduated from Cornell in 1996.)
 Asked about the discrepancy, Ms. Hsiao said she had mainly assisted the admissions office as an alumna who conducted interviews. She also said a partner, Robert Shaw, had been an admissions officer at the University of Pennsylvania. Asked about this in an e-mail message, Mr. Shaw said he had been only ''an assistant,'' from 1987 to 1988.
 ''Don't remember all the details,'' he said, adding, ''We really don't want to be a part of your article as we're not a service for the masses.''
 Admissions officers say that for many students, the advice of their high school counselors should suffice. Those applicants who might benefit from supplemental counseling -- like those at urban high schools with overworked counselors -- are often among the least able to afford such services.
 Regardless, colleges say parents should be wary of any counselor's claim of being able to lobby for a candidate's admission. While noting that there are ''genuinely rational and knowledgeable folks out there doing this work,'' Bruce Poch, the dean of admissions at Pomona College, adds, ''Some of the independents leave me looking for the nearest emergency shower.''
 Though none of the counselors said business was off in the struggling economy, some are making adjustments. Having initially presented the fashion show outfits as serious, Ms. Duff later said she had intended to ''create a lighthearted environment,'' the better to promote two new advisory DVDs she is offering, ''at a price that is accessible.'' (One for $45; two for $80.) 
 Katherine Cohen, the founder of IvyWise in New York City, has a team that charges from a few hundred dollars to more than $40,000. But she also has been emphasizing a spinoff called ApplyWise that for $299 helps students assemble their application in ways reminiscent of Turbo Tax. 
 Dr. Cohen, a former reader at Yale, is a member of the independent consultants association -- despite a claim on the IvyWise Web site that runs afoul of an association admonition. ''Congratulations,'' it blares, ''100 percent of IvyWise students were admitted to one of their top three choices in 2009!'' 
 Fewer than one of every five admissions consultants can claim to be an association member. Bill Dingledine, a longtime educational consultant in Greenville, S.C., is among those advocating even more stringent certification offered by the American Institute of Certified Educational Planners. It requires counselors to pass a three-hour written examination. 
 The concept has yet to catch on, at least in part because many counselors' practices are already booming. Asked how many counselors had sought, and won, that certification last year, Mr. Dingledine had a ready answer: about 20.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 19 about services that offer advice on getting into college provided incomplete context and attribution for a statement that a claim on the Web site of an advising group called IvyWise ''runs afoul'' of an admonition from an independent consultants association. In an interview conducted for the article, Mark H. Sklarow, the executive director of the association, said the group's members ''should not brag to potential clients about how many people they got in.'' Mr. Sklarow also said he would urge IvyWise to take down the claim, which stated that ''100 percent of IvyWise students were admitted to one of their top three choices in 2009.'' But the claim does not specifically violate any provision of the association's formal written principles.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S more a berth than a bed, but you won't get seasick if you sign on at the new Jane Hotel, at Jane and West Streets. 
 The original 1908 red brick structure was built as a lodging house for seamen, and its residents included some men rescued from the Titanic. Now, having been renovated by the developers Sean MacPherson and Eric Goode, it is one of New York's most unusual, and economical, lodgings. 
 Established in 1828, the American Seamen's Friend Society sought to bring civilizing influences to bear on the tens of thousands of sailors passing through the port of New York. 
 The society opened the chunky Georgian-style building, opposite the pier of the Cunard Line, in 1908. It had 156 rooms for seamen, and others for officers and engineers and cooks and stewards; ranking aboard ship transferred to shore. Charges were 25 cents a night for seamen and 50 cents for others.
 The officers had rooms similar to those in a hotel, but the rooms for sailors, about seven by seven feet, were strung out along two narrow corridors, like berths on a yacht.
 The architect, William Alciphron Boring, gave the building an octagonal corner tower, separate amusement rooms for each of the three groups, an auditorium for 400 and a chapel -- civilizing included Christianizing. 
 The society's 1911 annual report noted that the seamen found it refreshing to go to ''a bright, airy, comfortable place to sit without being annoyed by the fumes of liquor or soul-rasping profanity.''
 In 1912 survivors of the Titanic were sheltered there. More than 100 of them gathered one night for a memorial service at which they sang ''Nearer, My God, to Thee'' with ''a mighty, roaring chorus,'' according to The New York Times. The sailors were destitute, their pay having stopped the day the Titanic sank, and people left money and clothes for them at the building. 
 In 1931 the society joined with other organizations to build a more modern shelter at 20th Street and the Hudson River, and the 1908 building was converted to an annex. In 1933 space was tight, and The Times reported that 70 seamen were given cots in the auditorium. They did not keep things very shipshape, ignored commands to clean up, and hurled chairs and books at staff members and police officers who came to restore order. 
 In 1944 the Seamen's Friend Society sold the building to the Y.M.C.A., and by the 1950s it was the Jane West Hotel. The society closed in the 1980s. 
 Gradually, the Jane West hit hard times, and the tiny rooms evolved into long-term housing for the down and out, including drug addicts. 
 Mr. MacPherson is one of four partners who decided to make a virtue of its vices, reimagining the old sailor's retreat as the Jane Hotel and offering the podlike rooms at $99 per night. Mr. MacPherson and Mr. Goode also built the Bowery Hotel and renovated the portholed Maritime Hotel, at 16th and Ninth Avenue, built in the 1960s for sailors. 
 Their Bowery Hotel is a new building, but the bar nicely imitates a 1920s club or restaurant, with wood paneling and heavy curtains, although it is more homage than convincing reproduction. 
 But the bar in their Jane Hotel, created from the old auditorium and called the Jane Ballroom, appears to be a truly period room -- Victorian, perhaps -- adorned with acquisitions made over decades by a high-end pack rat. You drink your Stella Artois on a settee covered in a faded bargello fabric, next to the D.J.'s console, which mimics a Napoleonic-era Egyptian-revival daybed, under the gaze of stuffed pheasants and a bighorn sheep, with walls covered with paintings of an antique cast. Someone has probably coined a word for this type of decor: neo-accretion retro?
 The convincingly original room, with its paneled ceilings, old cornices, vintage columns and brass-studded leather doors, is completely invented. Mr. MacPherson says he wanted the public rooms to look as if ''one family has owned it a long time.''
 A 20-something man seated in the bar noted that the drinks menu also promoted the rooms upstairs, ''just in case it's a good date,'' he said. 
 Here, Messrs. Goode and MacPherson have pulled no punches -- a guest gets the same rooms that the seamen got, a bunk on one side, some storage on the other, and barely enough space to turn around. However, they are fitted out like yacht cabins, with polished wood, as well as flat-screen TVs, WiFi and iPod docking stations. The bath is where it always was: down the hall.
 Some of the old tenants remain, and their battered doors form a distinct contrast with the newer, fancier doors of the renovated rooms. German tourists looking for a bargain share the elevator with people who have been living there since actual sailors plied West Street. 
 At the Jane, the hip young bankers in the bar, the old-style and new-style tenants in the lobby, and the peculiar mix of artifacts and convincingly fake architecture, all combine to give it a distinct wash-ashore quality, as West Street evolves from shipping to hip.

HEADLINE: When, Oh When, Will HELP Be WANTED?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The nation's economists are cautiously crawling out of their bunkers. The guns of recession are quieter now, and in the relative calm, there is talk of recovery -- vague talk so far, particularly on the subject of hiring, lots of hiring. 
 Recessions have their milestones. There is the start, of course, in this case December 2007; the worst months, the winter and spring of this year; the gradual return to economic expansion, late this year maybe; and, finally, adding jobs.
 That last one is a tough call, because this recession in some very important ways is not only deeper than any we've had since the 1930s but is particularly hard on family income and savings. And without family income and savings, consumption -- and the jobs it produces -- are put off.
 Most Americans don't consider a recession really over until work is once again plentiful, and the unemployment rate -- which is now at 9.5 percent -- finally starts going down. Ask economists when that will occur this time and they hesitate. No sooner than next summer, nearly all of them say. And that's a guess, verging on wishful thinking. 
 ''It is going to take a while for manufacturing and construction to stop losing jobs, and it will take time for businesses to be confident enough to go out and hire,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, who says the necessary confidence won't return before next summer. 
 When it does, the hiring is likely to be spotty and cautious. Health care and education, for example, have added workers throughout the recession and as that steady hiring continues in post-recession America, the overall job numbers will finally begin to rise -- not from a surge in the hiring of health care workers and teachers, but because fewer and fewer jobs will be disappearing in other sectors.
 ''You are combining a very deep recession with what at this point looks like a sluggish recovery,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs. 
 Steep recessions -- and few in American history have been steeper than this one -- are usually followed by vigorous, steep recoveries that include job growth, particularly in manufacturing and retailing, as people make purchases they had put off. The result is a chain reaction in which stores reorder, factories hum and workers are hired. Satisfying pent-up demand, this process is called. 
 But this time is clearly different. The pent-up demand is not present -- not with 6.46 million jobs gone in just 18 months and hundreds of billions of dollars in wages extinguished. Credit is harder than ever to get for those who might want to spend again, and there are fewer and fewer spenders. People who do have jobs are saving (not spending) more of their incomes than they have in years, trying to replenish wealth lost in the stock market and in the declining value of their homes. 
 And, perhaps most important, millions of workers on short schedules will very likely get their hours back before their bosses hire new people.
 ''We are talking the equivalent of adding back four to five million jobs just by restoring hours lost in this recession,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy and Research. ''That process of adding back hours won't start before next June,'' he says, ''and I'm not confident it will begin even that soon.''
 So much for a surge in hiring or spending. If there is what seems like a job surge next April and May, that will be because the Census Bureau is hiring 1.2 million census takers in those months for the 2010 census. The work is part time, but it will bolster the national employment rolls -- only to be subtracted once the work is done in July.
 Coming out of steep recessions in the past, home building, like manufacturing, flourished and the hiring of construction workers surged. Nearly half a million construction jobs returned after the steep 1981-1982 recession. Not this time. Too many homes were built during the bubble years before 2008, and too many office buildings. The glut has to be worked off before there is much new construction, or hiring. 
 The recovery, then, given the circumstances, is likely to come not with job growth, but ''a diminution in job loss,'' as Mr. Hatzius put it. Like some other forecasters, he expects the economy to start growing by the end of the year. 
 Maybe that is already happening. But it is growth without jobs -- yet another jobless recovery, like the last two, this time on a giant scale. We came out of the 2001 recession into a recovery in which fewer than 60,000 jobs were lost each month, on average, not the hundreds of thousands a month very likely to disappear in the recovery to come.
 That is a political problem, of course, particularly if the nation is not yet adding jobs as the Congressional election approaches next year. Mr. Zandi estimates that the stimulus package is likely to generate 2.5 million jobs. The president's Council of Economic Advisers put the number at 3.5 million by the end of next year. Either way, that is not much of an offset for an economy that has already lost nearly two million jobs since the stimulus was enacted in February.
 Such numbers suggest that if the goal is a job surge coming out of the current recession, then another stimulus package is needed, and a big one, perhaps as much as $1 trillion packed into a single year of spending, some economists say. Consumer spending and business investment provided such a kick coming out of steep recessions in the past.
 In their absence this time, job growth will inevitably resume as the recession gradually ends, but at a trickle, not a torrent. Health care and education seem certain to lead the way, with isolated help from the oil industry, pipeline construction companies, utilities, computer design firms and the federal government.
 Mr. Zandi projects that once the employment rolls begin to grow again, in the second half of next year, nearly half the hiring will come from public schools, hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient care centers and physicians' offices. Not that the numbers will be so great -- on the order of 100,000 jobs a month, or less, for all these categories together. That increase is needed to care for aging baby boomers and a bulge in the population of young people.
 Hotels and restaurants are also likely to expand their staffs as people relax a bit. And retailers, too, are expected to add workers cautiously, after downsizing hugely during the recession.
 There might even be a surprise, adds Robert Barbera, chief economist for the Investment Technology Group. ''Some new and exciting area of job growth may emerge,'' he said, ''although I can't guess where that might be.''

HEADLINE: An Alfa in Chrysler Auditions

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy 

 BODY:
 ON a scenic rural stretch of autostrada between Milan and Turin, an Alfa Romeo MiTo in luscious Rosso Giulietta paint merged onto the expressway. It pulled alongside, paused, then sped away in a blatant invitation to race -- perhaps because I, too, was driving a red MiTo.
 Despite my vow not to send any more euros to the operators of Italy's speed cameras, I must confess that I managed to keep the other red MiTo in sight. 
 Over the kilometers, sometimes the driver would slow down, inviting me to pass. Then he would zoom ahead again. This leap-frogging continued until we reached a toll plaza outside Turin. He cheerily waved ''arrivederci'' and veered off at an exit.
 This guy was just the sort of driver this new Alfa is aimed at: an active, thrill-seeking, performance-minded 20-something.
 There are plenty of young Americans who meet those criteria as well, and they will have a shot at sowing their wild oats in a MiTo, too. Since the Fiat Group acquired a stake in Chrysler this year, it announced that the MiTo and the Fiat 500 would arrive in American showrooms in 2010.
 ''The MiTo is going to help us re-establish the Alfa brand in the United States,'' said Richard Gadeselli, vice president for communications of the Fiat Group, in a recent interview at the company's headquarters here.
 Though Alfa Romeo left the American market in 1995, the MiTo hatchback will not really be the first new Alfa to appear in the United States since then. The 8C Competizione and Spider have been available through select Ferrari and Maserati dealers since last year. Considering the stratospheric prices of the limited-edition, hand-built 8C, the MiTo will be the first new Alfa intended for general audiences. 
 Both the MiTo and the 500 will be sold at Chrysler -- not Ferrari -- dealerships, though they will still wear Alfa and Fiat badges. American-market prices have not been announced, but $20,000 or so seems likely for the MiTo and mid-teens for the 500.
 The autostrada connecting Milan and Turin was an appropriate venue for a test drive; the MiTo, which is pronounced me-TOE and sounds like an athlete's foot remedy, is in fact a melding of the names of those cities. Milan, where Alfa was founded in 1910, is the location of the Centro Stile design studio where the MiTo was conceived, and Turin -- Italy's Motor City -- is where it is built. 
 Mito is also the Italian word for myth or legend. 
 A public naming contest was held for the car in 2007, after it was introduced as a design study. ''Furioso'' was the winning name, but intervention by the marketing department resulted in MiTo instead. Catchy, huh?
 An Alfa Romeo in Giulietta red -- which sounds vaguely Shakespearean -- would seem to fit the dictionary definition of sports car. But while the MiTo is sporty, it is no sports car; Alfa calls it a three-door ''supermini.'' Interestingly, the MiTo -- whose footprint is similar to a VW New Beetle -- is built on the Gamma small-car platform developed by General Motors during its short-lived venture with Fiat (which G.M. paid $2 billion to exit). The Fiat Punto and Opel Corsa also use this versatile front-drive platform.
 Don't be fooled by photos that make the MiTo look sleek; up close, it's a jelly bean. The fish-eye headlights and arrowhead grille provide retro touches. The Mini Cooper is its likely target.
 The front buckets looked up-market and they were sporty, well contoured and inviting. Two people -- perhaps three in a pinch -- will fit in back. Controls were nicely laid out, although the optional navigation system is an odd, tiny-screen thing mounted on a pedestal atop the dash.
 The instrument panel had a textured faux-carbon-fiber pattern -- an appealing way to make economical materials look richer. The tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel could be easily adjusted. But the steering felt rubbery with a dead zone at high noon. The MiTo handles competently despite a basic beam-axle rear suspension and MacPherson struts in front. 
 There's an adjustable DNA switch -- it stands for Dynamic, Normal and All-Weather modes -- that recalibrates the engine, brakes, steering and suspension for each condition. Over all, the MiTo tracks with accuracy, though it is fairly unforgiving on rough pavement.
 My test car had a 6-speed manual transmission mated to a 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine, with 155 horsepower and the promise of 0-to-60 m.p.h. sprints in eight seconds. I averaged about 36 m.p.g. over 1,200 miles of varied driving. 
 Coming this fall will be Fiat's Multiair technology, which optimizes the engine's air-fuel mixture to increase horsepower and torque, improve mileage and reduce emissions. A 237-horsepower 1.8-liter engine is in the works, and it may be what Americans get. If so, 0-to-60 times for the 2,500-pound car could drop to five seconds flat.
 Performance like that may help pave the way for other Alfas. But, fellow Americans, shouldn't we get our own naming contest?
 Wherefore art thou, Furioso?

HEADLINE: The 30-Minute Interview: Jeffrey E. Levine

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Levine, 56, is the president of Levine Builders, which operates Douglaston Development and Clinton Management, among other partnerships and affiliates focused on residential developments. His current projects include The Edge, a mixed-use development in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
 Q. How would you describe the current market conditions?
 A. They're challenging. 
 But New York City was one of the last to enter the fold of the downturn -- we sustained values for many good reasons for a much longer period of time -- and I do believe that we will also be the first to come out. The barriers for creating residential units are what protect values, and nothing has changed that. New York City is a very tightly traded market. Even when we were experiencing the boom, we only built 25,000 to 30,000 new units in a city of eight million. 
 Q.Even so, what do you see as the biggest barrier to recovery?
 A. Financing -- the banks are not lending. But don't blame them at this juncture until we find out what the new paradigm is in terms of sales price, sales pace and rentals as well. We were involved in a number of projects where we had contracts subject to financing, where, in fact, we are not proceeding. We had been the designated developers for a very attractive piece of property on the campus of Fordham University; we chose to withdraw because it was prudent. 
 Q.Are you comfortable with your company's debt level?
 A. My debt level on the meter is quite full. I would be a fool not to be concerned about debt coming due, but I'm very fortunate. My debt is structured debt, and much of my debt is predicated on a very low spread over indexes that are historically at low points. There are ample reserves to carry our debt and take us far further into the future, giving us an opportunity for this market to recover. We as developers try never to go into a room that doesn't have an exit plan.
 Q.Phase I of the Edge will include two market-rate condo towers. How are sales going so far? 
 A. Sales have a very important demarcation here in New York: before Lehman failed and after Lehman failed. 
 We are over 20 percent sold -- that occurred in our first six to eight months of sales, which began in late spring of '08 -- and we continue to sell one or two units every week at our current price point. We have the largest single sale of a penthouse unit in Brooklyn's history, where a buyer combined two high Manhattan-viewing units for a total purchase price of $5.25 million.
 Q. And what's happening with Phase II of that development, which is supposed to include more condos as well as retail space?
 A. You tell me when the banks will be lending. Financing for Phase II may be a few years in the offing.
 Q. Are you offering any incentives or price reductions to spur occupancy? 
 A. We have not reduced prices at all. Obviously, if we have a willing partner who wants to buy a unit, we will work with them to facilitate their purchase -- whether that means we help with their closing costs or help them with their parking requirements.
 Q. Where are the opportunities right now?
 A. Because we are hands-on developers and contractors, our skill sets enable us to step into projects, and that might be completing construction. We are very anxious to help various lending institutions complete projects where they might have lost faith in the development team or the development team no longer wishes to continue. The distress that I'm seeing right now is all on the residential side -- residential condos that may not end up being condos. We may step in and convert those distressed, or broken, condos and convert them to rental properties, which are most preferable.
 Q. Can you be specific about any developments?
 A. There are certain projects, without getting into particulars. We were approached by a senior lender on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The developer does not have the funds to complete the job. 
 Q.And where will you be next year?
 A. I do believe that the economy is recovering and will be in a much better place a year from now. While the residential market has softened like so many sectors in the city, it seems to have stabilized. 
 You have to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel, because if you're a fatalist you can't go forward. In order to be a developer in the first place, you have to be a cockeyed optimist.

HEADLINE: Dismissing the Risks of a Deadly Habit

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY 

 BODY:
On his 15th birthday, Christopher Hill got his first cellphone. For his 16th, he was given a used red Ford Ranger pickup, a source of pride he washed every week. 
 Mr. Hill, a diligent student with a reputation for helping neighbors, also took pride in his clean driving record. ''Not a speeding ticket, not a fender bender, nothing,'' he said. 
 Until last Sept. 3. Mr. Hill, then 20, left the parking lot of a Goodwill store where he had spotted a dresser he thought might interest a neighbor. He dialed her to pass along news of the find. 
 Mr. Hill was so engrossed in the call that he ran a red light and didn't notice Linda Doyle's small sport utility vehicle until the last second. He hit her going 45 miles per hour. She was pronounced dead shortly after. 
 Later, a policeman asked Mr. Hill what color the light had been. ''I never saw it,'' he answered. 
 Extensive research shows the dangers of distracted driving. Studies say that drivers using phones are four times as likely to cause a crash as other drivers, and the likelihood that they will crash is equal to that of someone with a .08 percent blood alcohol level, the point at which drivers are generally considered intoxicated. Research also shows that hands-free devices do not eliminate the risks, and may worsen them by suggesting that the behavior is safe. 
 A 2003 Harvard study estimated that cellphone distractions caused 2,600 traffic deaths every year, and 330,000 accidents that result in moderate or severe injuries.
 Yet Americans have largely ignored that research. Instead, they increasingly use phones, navigation devices and even laptops to turn their cars into mobile offices, chat rooms and entertainment centers, making roads more dangerous. 
 A disconnect between perception and reality worsens the problem. New studies show that drivers overestimate their own ability to safely multitask, even as they worry about the dangers of others doing it. 
 Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.
 Police in almost half of all states make no attempt to gather data on the problem. They are not required to ask drivers who cause accidents whether they were distracted by a phone or other device. Even when officers do ask, some drivers are not forthcoming. 
 The federal government warns against talking on a cellphone while driving, but no state legislature has banned it. This year, state legislators introduced about 170 bills to address distracted driving, but passed fewer than 10. 
 Five states and the District of Columbia require drivers who talk on cellphones to use hands-free devices, but research shows that using headsets can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversation distracts drivers from focusing on the road. 
 Fourteen states have passed measures to ban texting while driving, and the New York State Assembly sent such a bill to the governor on Friday. 
 The states that rejected any efforts to limit distracted driving this year include Oklahoma. 
 ''I'm on the phone from when I leave the Capitol to when I get home, and that's a two-hour drive,'' said Tad Jones, the majority floor leader in the Oklahoma House, who helped block the legislation. ''A lot of people who travel are used to using the phone.''
 Scientists who study distracted driving say they understand the frustrations of colleagues who publicized the dangers of tobacco. Like cigarettes, they say, gadgets are considered cool but can be deadly. And the big device companies even offer warnings that remind them of labels on cigarette packs. 
 Verizon Wireless, for instance, posts instructions on its Web sites not to talk while driving -- with or without a headset. But neither Verizon nor any other cellphone company supports legislation that bans drivers from talking on the phone. And the wireless industry does not conduct research on the dangers, saying that is not its responsibility.
 Some researchers say that sufficient evidence exists to justify laws outlawing cellphone use for drivers -- and they suggest using technology to enforce them by disabling a driver's phone. ''Just outlawing the behavior cannot possibly go very far toward getting people not to do it,'' said Robert D. Foss, senior research scientist at the Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina. ''The behavior is too ingrained and compelling.''
 For his part, Mr. Hill rarely talks when he drives now. His mother gave him a hands-free headset two months after the accident. She thought it would create less distraction. He tried it once, and found his mind wandering into his phone call so much that ''I nearly missed a light,'' he said.
 He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, for the death of Ms. Doyle. Now, when he is a passenger in a car, it makes him nervous when the driver starts talking on the phone. But Mr. Hill, who is polite and deferential, said he doesn't want to badger drivers about the risks.
 ''I hope they don't have to go through what I did to realize it's a problem,'' he added.
 Dangerous Overconfidence
 Sgt. Matthew Downing, a tough-talking 11-year veteran on the Oklahoma City police force, drives a car with no lights on the roof. That way, drivers are less likely to notice him as he waits for speeders. 
 Increasingly, he sees erratic behavior -- swerving across lanes, running red lights -- that looks just like drunken driving. Instead, he sees drivers talking on their phones, or texting. ''A ton of people pass me literally unaware of their surroundings,'' he said. 
 Sergeant Downing, who often handles traffic fatalities, arrived at the scene of Mr. Hill's crash after paramedics had extracted Ms. Doyle, who was 61, from her car. He found Mr. Hill sitting on a fire truck, acting ''hysterical.'' 
 There was no mystery about the accident's cause; the roads were dry. ''He told me he was talking on the phone and didn't see the light,'' Sergeant Downing said. 
 ''He's a nice kid,'' he said of Mr. Hill. But he said he felt angry, both at Mr. Hill and at what he sees as an epidemic of multitasking on the road. ''Driving and talking are automatic,'' he said. 
 Over all, cellphone use has soared. From 1995 to 2008, the number of wireless subscribers in the United States increased eightfold, to 270 million, and minutes talked rose 58-fold.
 Last year, the federal agency dealing with road safety, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, published a study, based on researchers' observations of drivers, suggesting that at any time during daylight hours in 2007, 11 percent -- or 1.8 million drivers -- were using a cellphone. 
 And in a survey of 1,506 people last year by Nationwide Mutual Insurance, 81 percent of cellphone owners acknowledged that they talk on phones while driving, and 98 percent considered themselves safe drivers. But 45 percent said they had been hit or nearly hit by a driver talking on a phone. 
 ''When we ask people to identify the most dangerous distraction on the highway today, about half -- correctly -- identify cellphones,'' said Bill Windsor, associate vice president for safety at Nationwide. ''But they think others are dangerous, not themselves.''
 He and others who favor restrictions say drivers regularly make what amount to ill-informed analyses of cost-benefit tradeoffs, often deciding that the value of constant communication outweighs any risks. 
 Seven years ago, when cellphones and services like texting were less common, federal researchers estimated that drivers using cellphones caused about 1,000 fatalities and played a role in 240,000 crashes. (In 2007, drunken driving caused 13,000 fatalities.)
 By other measures, American roads are becoming safer. According to the highway safety agency, the number of driving fatalities has remained around 42,000 a year for most of the last decade, though it fell to 37,261 in 2008, when gas prices rose sharply and Americans drove less. 
 From 1997 to 2007, the number of reported accidents fell to 6 million a year from 6.7 million, according to the highway safety agency. ''There are more drivers, more talking drivers,'' said John Walls, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association. ''If it's so risky, then logically one would think there would be more accidents.'' 
 The association, a trade group, fought rules to ban phone use while driving until January, when it shifted to a neutral position on the issue. ''I wouldn't say, 'Talk on the phone more and have fewer accidents,' '' Mr. Walls added. ''I'm just saying, 'How does this square?' '' 
 Some scientists say this argument is flawed. ''We've spent billions on air bags, antilock brakes, better steering, safer cars and roads, but the number of fatalities has remained constant,'' said David Strayer, a psychology professor at the University of Utah and a leading researcher in the field of distracted driving. 
 ''Our return on investment for those billions is zero,'' he added. ''And that's because we're using devices in our cars.'' 
 Better data would help settle the debate. But 21 states do not include a box on accident forms for police to mark electronic devices as a cause. Those that now account for it started doing so only recently. Mr. Windsor of Nationwide Mutual said that such data, while valuable, would greatly underestimate the problem because it relies on driver confessions. Sometimes drivers say they just finished a call. Cellphone records are not much help because of the difficulty of establishing the precise time of an accident. 
 ''By the time you get to a crash, it's very, very difficult to determine whether someone was talking on the phone and whether the phone caused the crash,'' said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
 For Mr. Windsor and many scientists who study the issue, accident figures are not necessary to prove the risks. 
 ''The research is just so strong,'' Mr. Windsor said. 
 Risks of Multitasking
 In a windowless room at the University of Utah, Professor Strayer has spent a decade studying driver distraction. 
 On a recent afternoon, Anne McLaren, 19, who just finished her freshman year studying dental hygiene and who gets class credit for volunteer work, climbed behind the wheel of Mr. Strayer's $100,000 driving simulator. Her task was to closely follow a white car that often slowed abruptly. A voice on a speaker phone asked Ms. McLaren questions like, ''When you do a pull-up, do your palms face toward you?'' and ''Can you touch your elbow to your ear?'' 
 For the most part, she ably multitasked. But sometimes she took her hands from the wheel when trying to answer a question, like, ''True or false: A peanut butter jar opens clockwise.'' And she was so focused on her call that she seemed to miss surprises, like a body at the side of the road.
 Texting while driving was more difficult; she soon slammed into the virtual car in front of her. 
 Mr. Strayer's research, using a small camera to track his volunteers' eye movements, shows that texting drivers regularly focus on their screens for stretches of more than five seconds. 
 ''I should pay attention to the road,'' she said afterward. But sometimes it's hard to ignore the phone, she added, like when her parents want to reach her. ''My dad gets more mad if I don't have the phone than if I'm talking and driving.''
 Mr. Strayer's research, showing that multitasking drivers are four times as likely to crash as people who are focused on driving, matches the findings of two studies, in Canada and in Australia, of drivers on actual roads. 
 The highway safety administration estimates that drivers using a hand-held device are at 1.3 times greater risk of a crash or near crash, and at three times the risk when dialing, compared with others who are simply driving. The agency based its conclusions on research from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which placed cameras inside cars to monitor drivers for more than a year. The study found cellphones to be the most common cause of driver distraction. 
 Research also shows that drivers conversing with fellow passengers do not present the same danger, because adult riders help keep drivers alert and point out dangerous conditions and tend to talk less in heavy traffic or hazardous weather.
 Scientists note that there are limits to how much the brain can multitask. The brain has trouble assessing separate streams of information -- even if one is visual and the other aural, said Steve Yantis, professor of psychological and brain sciences at Johns Hopkins University. 
 Further, he said, when people talk on the phone, they are doing more than simply listening. The words conjure images in the mind's eye, including images of the person they are talking to. That typically doesn't interfere with driving. The problem starts when a car swerves unexpectedly or a pedestrian steps into traffic, he said, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.
 ''There is zero doubt that one's driving ability is impaired when one is trying to have a cellphone conversation -- whether hands-free or hand-held, it doesn't matter,'' said David E. Meyer, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. 
 In fact, some scientists argue that hands-free laws make driving riskier by effectively condoning the practice. As early as July 2003, researchers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reached that conclusion based on what they referred to, in a proposed draft of a cellphone policy for the agency, as ''a significant body of research worldwide.'' 
 The draft policy said: ''We are convinced that legislation forbidding the use of handheld cellphones while driving will not be effective since it will not address the problem. In fact, such legislation may erroneously imply that hands-free phones are safe to use while driving.'' 
 The agency's current advice is that people should not use cellphones while driving and that hands-free devices do not eliminate the risks of distracted driving.
 Scientists are grappling, too, with perhaps the broadest question hanging over the phenomenon of distracted driving: Why do people, knowing the risk, continue to talk while driving? The answer, they say, is partly the intense social pressures to stay in touch and always be available to friends and colleagues. And there also is the neurological response of multitaskers. They show signs of addiction -- to their gadgets. 
 John Ratey, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a specialist on the science of attention, explained that when people use digital devices, they get a quick burst of adrenaline, ''a dopamine squirt.'' Without it, people grow bored with simpler activities like driving. Mr. Ratey said the modern brain is being rewired to crave stimulation, a condition he calls acquired attention deficit disorder. 
 ''We need that constant pizzazz, the reward, the intensity,'' he said. He largely dismisses the argument that people need the time in the car to be productive. ''The justification for doing work is just that -- a justification to be engaged,'' he said. 
 In many legislatures, including Oklahoma's, the concerns of such scientists have made little impression. 
 Concerns About New Rules
 In February, five months after the accident that killed Ms. Doyle, Sue Tibbs was in Tulsa undergoing one of her regular seven-hour chemotherapy treatments for ovarian cancer.
 As an Oklahoma state representative, Ms. Tibbs was finishing a bill to require hands-free devices for drivers and to ban texting while driving. She had developed an interest in the issue last fall, after hearing about a growing number of crashes like the one involving Mr. Hill and Ms. Doyle, and after an Oklahoma state trooper told her he was increasingly concerned about multitasking behind the wheel. 
 As Ms. Tibbs sat in the cancer center, she overheard a conversation that sealed her resolve. A woman nearby talked of how her husband often became so engrossed in his cellphone calls he would miss the turn for the road to their home. The cellphone, Ms. Tibbs decided, isn't like other distractions. ''When you're eating, you're not concentrating like when you're on the cellphone,'' she said.
 On Feb. 19, the public safety committee voted 8 to 4 to send Ms. Tibbs's bill to the full legislature. She was thrilled. But on March 12, the last day her bill could be considered, the majority floor leader, Mr. Jones, hadn't brought up her bill. That night, she asked Mr. Jones, a fellow Republican, why. He explained that there was too much opposition, she said. Later, Ms. Tibbs said, he added another reason: she was fragile from cancer and he didn't want her to go through a long-shot battle for the bill. 
 Mr. Jones, in an interview, said he and his colleagues needed more evidence of the dangers before they considered restricting the freedom to talk while driving. ''We're concerned about going into the cellphone realm at this point,'' he said, adding that he was not lobbied by any companies that make money from the use of devices in cars.
 But he said he recognized from using his phone while driving that it could be dangerous, particularly when dialing. ''There's definitely a time when you're looking at your cellphone,'' said Mr. Jones, who uses a hands-free device. ''If you're going to do it, you have to be extremely cautious.''
 Like Oklahoma, many states have resisted legislating against multitasking behind the wheel because there is no long-term data on crashes caused by distracted driving, said Anne Teigen, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But she also acknowledged the shortcomings of any such studies. ''It mostly relies on self-reporting, and for insurance reasons people don't want to admit they were on the phone,'' she said.
 Others cite more fundamental reasons to block any such legislation. ''To me, the death of freedom is far worse than the risk of talking on the phone while driving,'' said Carl Wimmer, a state representative in Salt Lake City who successfully fought a bill this year to ban talking while driving. ''Why pick on cellphones?'' he asked, noting that distraction comes in many forms. ''You can't legislate against stupidity.''
 Some states have overcome opposition to pass restrictions. Joe Simitian, a state senator in California, managed to get his hands-free legislation, an effort he began in 2001, passed in 2006. He argued, based on data collected by the California Highway Patrol, that drivers using cellphones caused more fatalities than all the drivers distracted by eating, children, pets or personal hygiene.
 In each previous year, the bill was killed -- after lobbying by cellphone carriers, including Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile. Mr. Simitian said that in the first two years, he would visit the offices of his colleagues on the Transportation Committee on the day of the vote and ''find three cellphone industry lobbyists sitting in the legislator's office,'' Mr. Simitian said. ''They'd just smile.''
 He said they fought him even though their brochures said that distracted driving was dangerous. The exception was Verizon Wireless, which supported his efforts from the start.
 Opposition gradually eased, and his bill requiring use of headsets while driving took effect in July 2008. In the first six months the California law was in effect, a preliminary California Highway Patrol estimate showed that fatalities dropped 12.5 percent -- saving 200 lives. Mr. Simitian said it was too soon to determine whether the law or other factors caused the drop. 
 Mr. Simitian said one reason political opposition eased was that fellow legislators saw the dangers firsthand. ''They'd come to me and say: 'You may be bringing me around. I almost got creamed at the corner,' '' he recalled.
 For its part, the cellphone industry trade group said it had dropped its objection to restricting cellphone use by drivers -- it now is neutral on the subject -- because it decided the industry should play no role in trying to shape public policy on the issue. ''The change came after we had an epiphany that, if you will, we're in the business of providing service, and how they use that service is at their discretion,'' said Mr. Walls, the industry spokesman. 
 But Mr. Windsor from Nationwide Mutual and others are skeptical of the cellphone industry's explanation. They believe its position changed because its business has changed to rely less on total minutes that people spend talking. Cellphone companies' growth is coming more from customers surfing the Internet, downloading games and using other data services -- things that people typically do less of behind the wheel.
 Mr. Simitian believes that a ban on talking on cellphones while driving would save even more lives. But he hasn't proposed one, and has no plans to. ''It's a political nonstarter,'' he said. ''It'll be a cold day in hell before people give up their phones altogether in cars.'' 
 Not to mention other devices. 
 An Array of Distractions
 Mr. Hill now owns a silver Chevrolet Silverado pickup that he bought with help from his grandmother. When he drives, he keeps his cellphone tucked in a space in the dashboard, and has set strict rules not to use it -- rules he acknowledges he sometimes breaks. 
 He is also careful to keep his eyes on the road as he searches for his Nickelback, Christian rock or other CDs to play on his stereo. 
 His dashboard is relatively primitive compared with those of many other vehicles. Sales of multimedia systems for cars -- with audio, video and GPS -- were up 46 percent in the first four months of this year from a year earlier, according to the research firm NPD Group. More such systems also now come with a dock for MP3 players.
 Scientists say they are frightened by each new device, giving drivers more reasons to look away from the road -- like searching through song titles on the small screen of an iPod. 
 To device makers, it's a big and growing market, though they say they are keenly aware that drivers can become distracted. ''We have a chance to create what I call the 'digital car,' '' said Glenn Lurie, an executive at AT&T, the service provider for iPhones. ''There are phenomenal opportunities.'' 
 For instance, he said, new wireless technology could allow better real-time services, like maps that point to the closest, cheapest gas station. Mr. Lurie said devices would be developed foremost with ''safety and security'' in mind. 
 But other corporations emphasize just how engrossing their in-car entertainment can be. A recent ad from Audible.com, which sells audio books, says, ''you just might miss your exit on the turnpike.'' 
 Automakers also see a market for new features. Ford, for example, offers in most of its cars a $395 Sync system, which lets drivers use phones and music players with voice commands. The company says it is working to develop the product so drivers might even surf the Internet through voice commands and hear responses.
 Joe Berry, Ford's director of business and product development, said Sync enhances safety by providing a hands-free experience. But he said that not using a device is still safer.
 The bottom line is that Ford is catering to consumer interests, Mr. Berry said, using an argument that car makers have made when the safety and fuel economy of sport utility vehicles are questioned, and used by tobacco companies as health concerns grew. The Sync product, he argues, makes drivers safer because its voice-command features let them keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.
 ''It's not as if you are going to be able to take this away from people,'' he said of phones and other devices in cars. ''They simply won't give it up.''
 Mr. Berry compared the situation to eating unhealthy foods. ''We, as people, don't want to stop doing things that aren't in our best interest,'' he said. 
 And so the fight against in-car distraction has fallen to a small band of activists, notably those who have lost a loved one. They argue that, unlike eating unhealthy foods -- or for that matter, not wearing a seat belt -- mobile multitasking can cost someone else's life.
 The Resistance
 When Linda Doyle was hit by Mr. Hill's truck, she was on her way to pick up cat food. She volunteered at the Central Oklahoma Humane Society, and drove every day without fail to nearby Lake Overholser, where she fed abandoned cats. 
 She would sometimes talk on the phone in her car. ''If she was driving and I called, she would answer,'' said Jennifer Smith, 35, Ms. Doyle's daughter. ''If my sister called, she would answer.'' 
 Ms. Smith, who lives in Grapevine, Tex., and is a real estate agent, says she, too, once talked incessantly while driving. ''We're all guilty of it,'' she said. ''I'm the first to admit it.'' 
 In her case, no longer. Ms. Smith almost always ignores the ring of an incoming call. And she has become one of the cellphone era's answers to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She devotes half her time to her uphill battle -- contacting legislators in Texas and Oklahoma, filing a complaint with the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and reaching out to other victims and their families. 
 She has talked to a handful of class-action lawyers. ''They tell me this is the tobacco or asbestos case of our generation,'' she said. But she says they also tell her the case would be too time-consuming and expensive. 
 David Teater of Spring Lake, Mich., is also fighting distracted driving; he works for the National Safety Council on transportation issues. His son Joe was killed on Martin Luther King's Birthday in 2004, hit by a young woman talking on the cellphone to someone from her church, where she volunteered. Even after the accident, Mr. Teater said, he had trouble breaking his cellphone habit. 
 ''With all the motivation in the world I couldn't do it,'' he said, adding that he eventually took more decisive action: ''I put the cellphone in the trunk.'' 
 Some drivers who caused accidents themselves have become activists, too. Mr. Hill, as part of his misdemeanor charge, must devote 240 hours to community service -- talking about the risks of distracted driving, as well as working with animals, as Ms. Doyle's family said she would have liked. 
 He spoke to a classroom of fellow students about his experience, sparing no details. 
 ''Their jaws just dropped,'' he said. ''They couldn't believe they had someone standing in front of them who was talking on the cellphone and killed someone.''

 BODY:
THE DOORMAN-BOXER David Vega, 52, the son of a doorman, is a lobby attendant at an apartment building on West 86th Street, where he has worked since 1986. He said that he retired from professional boxing that year, but that he still earns extra money as a sparring partner. He said he started fighting in the ring at age 17, when he was an unemployed new father, and a friend saw the damage he was doing to his apartment. ''Whenever things didn't go right, I would lose my head and punch the walls,'' Mr. Vega said. He had his professional debut a year later, he said, at what is now Symphony Space on Broadway at 95th Street. Mr. Vega said he had boxed under Don King's promotional ticket, and sparred with boxing greats like Hector (Macho) Camacho and Ray (Boom Boom)Mancini. ''I was always the underdog,'' he said. He lives in the Frederick Douglass Houses on the Upper West Side with his wife, Maria.
 My wife tells me that, that, that I'm forgetting things a lot. It happens. I could be talking to you right now and say, 'Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot what I was talking about.' 
 She doesn't like when I go back into the ring, but I love it. When she's working, I go to the gym and try to get back before she comes back. Hoping she won't notice anything, but she does. She starts looking at me, and my eyes. 'Oh, you were at the gym, look at you, look at your eyes, I can see you're bruised.' I says, 'Look, honey, I didn't go to the gym.' I can't fool her. That's my second home. 
 I like when the announcer, he's always saying, 'Let's get ready to rumble!' You know, 'From New York City with a record of 34 professional fights,' or whatever, that really makes me feel good! They knock on the door in your dressing room -- dant, dant, dant da -- 'Vega, come on, you're next.' 
 I'm just a lobby attendant. This tenant, Mrs. Davis, saw me and says, 'Oh my God, David, what happened to you?' I says, 'Oh, nothing.' She says, 'Yeah, tell me that you fell down or something, because I'm not going to believe you. You was in another fight.' 'Yeah, sort of, Mrs. Davis.' She says, 'But I thought you was going to quit.'
 I told her that for the money they were offering me, it would take me years to make the money that I could earn just in one night, in 45 minutes, or even in five seconds. In my career boxing, I earn respect. In my building, where I live, they respect me. I got people coming up to me that I don't even know. I've been living here only 12 years. 'Hey you, you the guy that box, right?' I mean, they see me with my boxing equipment when I go to the gym and come back. You know, they know. 
 One day I was standing outside of the building where I'm working at. Two guys walk in the lobby, and they didn't even bother to say, 'I would like to see so and so,' whatever. They just walk right by us, into the elevator. And I say, 'Hey, yo, where you guys going?' He says, 'Oh, I got to see Amy.' I said, 'Yeah, but what do you think I'm here for? Do you see these tattooed gloves here? That represent, you know that represents something.'
 'Oh, is that a threat?' I said, 'No, you take it the way you want to take it. All I know is, when you come into this building, you have to see me.' What am I here, a piece of cake or something? 'Oh, wait until I tell Amy.' 'You tell Amy whatever you want,' I says. But you come into my building, I'm the man here. 'You see these gloves here? These represent, you know what I'm saying, what I'm all about.' And we left it at that.

HEADLINE: Before Creating the Car, Ford Designs the Driver

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
ANTONELLA is an attractive 28-year old woman who lives in Rome. Her life is focused on friends and fun, clubbing and parties. 
 She is also completely imaginary. 
 But her influence is definitely real. It is evident in the design of the Ford Fiesta, on sale in Europe now and arriving in the United States next summer as a 2011 model.
 Antonella was the guiding personality for the Ford Verve, a design study that served as the basis for the latest-generation Fiesta. A character invented by Ford designers to help them imagine cars better tailored to their intended customers, she embodies a philosophy that guides the company's design studios these days: to design the car, first design the driver.
 Antonella is the personification of a profile created from demographic research about the Fiesta's target customer, said Moray Callum, executive director of Ford Americas design. 
 Ford is using characters like Antonella to bring a human element to the dry statistical research drawn from polls and interviews. Based on psychological profiles, these characters are a more modern version of the ''theme boards'' that designers once covered with snapshots and swatches of material to inspire a design. They are also like avatars, those invented characters used in online games and forums to symbolize a participant's personality. 
 ''Invented characters get everyone on the same page,'' Mr. Callum said. ''Personalizing gives context to the information we have. Sometimes the target demographics are difficult to relate to by, say, a 35-year-old male designer. 
 ''We found in the past that if they didn't understand the buyer, designers would just go off and design something for themselves,'' he added. 
 Murat Yalman, Ford's director of global advanced product strategy, is a strong supporter of an approach that personalizes the ideal buyer for everyone involved in a vehicle's development.
 ''You get a common focus for everyone from the clay modeler to the chief executive,'' he said. 
 The method brings statistics to life. ''It creates very memorable ideas that live on after the meeting or presentation,'' Mr. Yalman said. 
 So Antonella is joined by Natasha, Ashley, Kristen and other characters from Ford's imagination, each depicted in a Dewar's profile type of write-up, and with images grabbed from the Internet. Antonella has her male counterpart in Anton. Jack is the presiding personality for the 2010 Taurus. Joe and Cal are the ideal characters for future trucks. 
 Antonella cares more about the design and function of her telephone than that of her car. Her priorities in the Fiesta are visible in the car's central panel, where controls inspired by those of a cellphone operate the audio and air-conditioning systems. Designers working on the Fiesta referred to the shape framing the dashboard instruments as ''Antonella's glasses.'' 
 Ford's goal in using made-up characters is that they will help produce cars that transcend national traits and are instead built around international, psychological archetypes. Antonella is an extreme version of a type the Ford designers call the fun-seeker. 
 ''There are fun-seekers in London and Cleveland,'' Mr. Callum said. 
 But the image of the fun-seeker appears sharply etched and more extreme when set in Rome. ''In Rome there are lots of small cars,'' Mr. Yalman said. ''They are always dodging each other. So a car there has to be nimble and it has to look the part. Romans have been conscious of how their vehicles look -- all the way back to Caesar. Every little crease of their toga has to be just right.'' 
 Mr. Yalman first found the composite characters useful when he began directing marketing efforts for Ford in Europe. Confronted with many boundaries of nation and language, he said, he looked instead at common values and attitudes, a process he referred to as mindset segmentation. ''We did a value and attitude map,'' he said.
 Mr. Yalman found that archetypes like Antonella, the type he called hedonistic, existed in all countries. 
 The approach ties in to Ford's efforts to create the Fiesta and other models as global products, with equal appeal in the Americas, Europe and Asia. 
 Mr. Callum said the technique could be used to help imagine concept vehicles as well as production models. 
 Ford's Lincoln division showed the Lincoln C design study, an idea for a smaller future luxury vehicle, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit last January. It was built around Natasha, a tech-savvy ''social achiever'' driver. 
 The designers imagined her life in detail in a video, ''A Day in the Life of Natasha.'' Several human models were screen-tested before one, who looks vaguely like Audrey Hepburn, was chosen to appear in the video. The video was also convenient for explaining the car to the press and public. It shows Natasha using a new generation of computer interface for the car's information systems. 
 The Ford Transit Connect Family One Concept, shown at this year's New York auto show, was created around Ashley, a very different character from Natasha. Ashley is billed as ''a cool mom'' who, like the vehicle, represents an update of traditional family priorities. In her profile, according to Ford's internal research documents, Ashley's ''friends are part of her family.'' She dresses up like her children at Halloween. She shops at T. J. Maxx, H&M and Target.
 The concept van offers a vision of a post-minivan, post-S.U.V. family hauler with constant Web access. It includes an electronic tagging system for children's backpacks, skateboards -- and perhaps even dog collars -- using the radio-frequency identification system Ford offers in some of its trucks; the tags help contractors assure that tools are collected when the work day is over. 
 Jack, the inspirational character behind the 2010 Taurus, is ''the life of the party,'' according to Earl Lucas, head of exterior design for the car. ''He cares what his car says about him. He wants to be seen in an American car and he is involved in the community.'' 
 Joe and Cal, the fantasy owners of the pickup truck of the future, are what Mr. Yalman called ''the heroes of their neighborhood.'' 
 Using psychological archetypes and patterns is more important when designing for younger people, Mr. Callum said. Some younger buyers invest less emotion in their vehicles than their elders did. ''This can be hard for us to understand.'' 
 Ford's involvement with the technique can be traced to 2002, said Mr. Yalman, when Daniel Kahneman, a cognitive psychologist and behavioral economist who taught at Princeton and other universities, shared the Nobel in economic science.
 Mr. Yalman had been following Dr. Kahneman's work for some time, and the prize marked the ascendance of a wider new emphasis in economics on the psychological side of decision making. Dr. Kahneman is a proponent of ''hedonic'' choice, which explores ideas of pleasure and preference in buying choices and questions older, rational models of buyer behavior based simply on price or other hard factors. 
 ''What this thinking suggested to us is that emotion played a much larger role than we thought,'' Mr. Yalman said. 
 The new economic theories supported Mr. Yalman's ideas. The choice to buy is not just about more horsepower per dollar or segment-leading rear legroom; design is critical, Mr. Yalman said. 
 ''Before, all our cars in Europe were taken as Germanic,'' he said. ''So we dialed up the style.'' Ford in Europe rolled out a more emotional exterior design language, called the kinetic look. 
 ''We had done lots of models based on rationality, but now we are recognizing that emotions play a much more dominant role than we ever admitted,'' Mr. Yalman said. ''In buying a car, you have to fall in love.'' 
 He added: ''We now focus quite a bit on aspirations and dreams.'' 
 These can be embodied in products. ''Think of someone who has a really high-end parka in which you could climb Mount Everest. But the person only wears it on the train to work.''
 So far, sales of the Fiesta have been strong. It is Ford's best-selling car in Europe, and it was the No. 2 seller over all in that market for the first half of 2009.

 Out of the social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s emerged two revolutionary artists, Emory Douglas and Dorothy Iannone. Now their works are being presented in separate exhibitions opening Wednesday at the NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART. 
 From 1967 to 1979 Mr. Douglas designed and oversaw the production of The Black Panther, the newspaper of the Black Panther Party. His bold, Pop-Social Realist graphics represented African-American men and women as heroic warriors for racial justice and economic equality. His newspaper illustrations and posters portraying ordinary citizens and luminaries from Huey Newton to Henry Kissinger asserted a politically urgent mix of cartoon drawing, photographic montage and abstract design. ''EMORY DOUGLAS: BLACK PANTHER'' includes more than 150 posters, newspapers and prints from 1966 to 1977. Works in the show were selected by the Los Angeles artist Sam Durant, who published a monograph about Mr. Douglas's art in 2007. Through Oct. 18, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-2000, newmuseum.org.
 Sexual freedom and spiritual transcendence are the enduring preoccupations of Ms. Iannone, whose paintings combine trippy, cartoon images of people making love; vividly colored patterns; and erotic, autobiographical texts. ''Icelandic Saga,'' a series of 48 drawings from 1978-86, documents her long love affair with the Swiss-German artist Dieter Roth. His pet name for her was Lioness, which explains the show's title, ''DOROTHY IANNONE: LIONESS.''Through Oct. 18. (A selection of her paintings is also on view at Anton Kern Gallery in Chelsea through Aug. 7.)

HEADLINE: Off the Beaten Path, Surrounded by Rebels

 BODY:
THE FIERY FURNACES, the indie-rock duo made up of the siblings Matt and Eleanor Friedberger, are releasing ''I'm Going Away'' (Thrill Jockey) on Tuesday. A conscious nod to the recession, the album is more pared down in its arrangement than their six previous studio albums, but even the most musically sparse songs pulse with a rich narrative. Matt, 36, wrote the music, and Eleanor, 32, wrote most of the lyrics. ''I was Carole King, and she was my husband,'' Mr. Friedberger said. This summer they are playing a handful of shows in the Midwest and the Northeast, including an Aug. 9 concert at East River State Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Via conference call -- with Matt at home outside of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Eleanor in Greenpoint, Brooklyn -- they spoke recently with Winter Miller about their own (and each other's) current favorite music. 
 Lang Lang 
 Matt: He has amazing technique, and he's definitely concerned with external effect, with showiness. He gets a lot of flack for his performing style being a combination of Liberace and Glenn Gould. People say he's all ridiculous affectation, and that he doesn't pay attention to the architecture of the work he's playing, in this case ''Chopin: The Piano Concertos'' (Deutsche Grammophon). He's looking at every page of the score as an opportunity for him to phrase something in a weird and amusing way. I think it's interesting the way he's marketed, as a new sort of pop star: ''Lang Lang Effect.'' He is high- and low-culture. 
 Eleanor: That's the only thing I know about him: There are 35 million Chinese piano students. How is that going to affect world music for the next few decades? That's terrible to think about.
 Matt: Terrible? It's wonderful! Things will get very complicated in all sorts of different music.
 Rodriguez
 Eleanor: I heard a link to his songs and immediately bought ''Coming From Reality'' (Light in the Attic). I can't think of the last time I've done that. The arrangements are heavy with strings that make it downcast. I like it. I grew up listening to those kinds of arrangements. His voice is gorgeous, unusual. There's something a little weird about it, maybe because he's Mexican-American and from Detroit, but it works really well. He made two records; one in 1969, one in 1971. He didn't have success in the States, and they were just reissued in the past six months. This record has like seven terrific songs with vocal melodies that are stuck in my head. 
 Matt: In the 1970s South African soldiers had pirated tapes, and draftees would listen to this while smoking up, ready to go fight, according to the liner notes. He has a first-rate rock voice. 
 Henry Butler
 Matt: He should be more famous than he is. ''PiaNOLA Live'' (Basin Street) is his collection of live recordings. He lost his house in Katrina, and he lost his archive, and this is what was left over. He's made proper jazz albums, but he's played maybe the last 15 years in a very recognizably New Orleans style. It's often nearly, or merely, tourist music. But he manages to be very idiosyncratic. And his singing! He does covers on this album, and he sings some of it really extravagantly and forcefully in a way that's almost embarrassing. It's shocking, the liberties he takes. It's all so strident, so energetic. 
 Eleanor: I saw this clip on YouTube where he starts playing a song within a song. It reminds me of how Matt plays and writes. It's pure fun and joy to see this man play. I'd never listened to him before. 
 Elliott Carter
 Matt: There's a funny clip of him on ''Charlie Rose.'' It portrays him as this cuddly, amazingly lucid 100-year-old, fun, nice, grandpa genius. He's the greatest living composer, quote-unquote. On ''Elliott Carter: String Quartets Nos. 2, 3 and 4'' (Naxos) each instrument often has its own pulse, or he'll group the quartet off, the two instruments against the other two. I can hear the phrasing of an individual line and how it changes on itself. He's the mainstream of the second half of 20th-century music; but now he's to some extent been knocked off the center by the Minimalists. So he's a rebel at 100.
 Eleanor: He looks like he's 75. His music is complex just for the sake of being complex, and that's what makes it good. Matt has the same attitude. That's a school of thought that I don't understand, really. I appreciate applying that to rock music. 
 Micachu & the Shapes
 Eleanor: Two people gave me ''Jewellery'' (Rough Trade) separately and thought I would really like it. They gave me physical copies, that rarely happens. It's catchy. It's not the kind of music I usually go for. It sounds so young and new, something you could write and record on your iPhone. I don't mean that as a bad thing. Micachu also looks like my friend Beth Lieberman.
 Matt: She does look like Beth.

HEADLINE: Fed's Forecast Lights a Fire Under Stocks

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market had its best week since March, with gains of about 7 percent in the major indexes, on strong earnings from Goldman Sachs, I.B.M., Intel and other companies. 
 The market's best day was Wednesday, when Federal Reserve policy makers released minutes from their last meeting that many investors found encouraging. The Fed staff revised upward its forecast for this year and 2010, saying the economy would resume growth in the second half of this year, the minutes said. Unemployment, however, will continue to rise until beginning to edge down at some point in 2010, the document said. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 597.42 points, or 7.3 percent, to close at 8,743.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 61.25 points, or 7.0 percent, to close at 940.38.
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 130.58 points, or 7.4 percent, to close at 1,886.61. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.65 percent, from 3.30 percent the previous week. Oil futures in New York climbed to $63.56 a barrel, from $59.89 the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Dismissing the Risks of a Deadly Habit

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY 

 BODY:
On his 15th birthday, Christopher Hill got his first cellphone. For his 16th, he was given a used red Ford Ranger pickup, a source of pride he washed every week. 
 Mr. Hill, a diligent student with a reputation for helping neighbors, also took pride in his clean driving record. ''Not a speeding ticket, not a fender bender, nothing,'' he said. 
 Until last Sept. 3. Mr. Hill, then 20, left the parking lot of a Goodwill store where he had spotted a dresser he thought might interest a neighbor. He dialed her to pass along news of the find. 
 Mr. Hill was so engrossed in the call that he ran a red light and didn't notice Linda Doyle's small sport utility vehicle until the last second. He hit her going 45 miles per hour. She was pronounced dead shortly after. 
 Later, a policeman asked Mr. Hill what color the light had been. ''I never saw it,'' he answered. 
 Extensive research shows the dangers of distracted driving. Studies say that drivers using phones are four times as likely to cause a crash as other drivers, and the likelihood that they will crash is equal to that of someone with a .08 percent blood alcohol level, the point at which drivers are generally considered intoxicated. Research also shows that hands-free devices do not eliminate the risks, and may worsen them by suggesting that the behavior is safe. 
 A 2003 Harvard study estimated that cellphone distractions caused 2,600 traffic deaths every year, and 330,000 accidents that result in moderate or severe injuries.
 Yet Americans have largely ignored that research. Instead, they increasingly use phones, navigation devices and even laptops to turn their cars into mobile offices, chat rooms and entertainment centers, making roads more dangerous. 
 A disconnect between perception and reality worsens the problem. New studies show that drivers overestimate their own ability to safely multitask, even as they worry about the dangers of others doing it. 
 Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.
 Police in almost half of all states make no attempt to gather data on the problem. They are not required to ask drivers who cause accidents whether they were distracted by a phone or other device. Even when officers do ask, some drivers are not forthcoming. 
 The federal government warns against talking on a cellphone while driving, but no state legislature has banned it. This year, state legislators introduced about 170 bills to address distracted driving, but passed fewer than 10. 
 Five states and the District of Columbia require drivers who talk on cellphones to use hands-free devices, but research shows that using headsets can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversation distracts drivers from focusing on the road. 
 Fourteen states have passed measures to ban texting while driving, and the New York State Assembly sent such a bill to the governor on Friday. 
 The states that rejected any efforts to limit distracted driving this year include Oklahoma. 
 ''I'm on the phone from when I leave the Capitol to when I get home, and that's a two-hour drive,'' said Tad Jones, the majority floor leader in the Oklahoma House, who helped block the legislation. ''A lot of people who travel are used to using the phone.''
 Scientists who study distracted driving say they understand the frustrations of colleagues who publicized the dangers of tobacco. Like cigarettes, they say, gadgets are considered cool but can be deadly. And the big device companies even offer warnings that remind them of labels on cigarette packs. 
 Verizon Wireless, for instance, posts instructions on its Web sites not to talk while driving -- with or without a headset. But neither Verizon nor any other cellphone company supports legislation that bans drivers from talking on the phone. And the wireless industry does not conduct research on the dangers, saying that is not its responsibility.
 Some researchers say that sufficient evidence exists to justify laws outlawing cellphone use for drivers -- and they suggest using technology to enforce them by disabling a driver's phone. ''Just outlawing the behavior cannot possibly go very far toward getting people not to do it,'' said Robert D. Foss, senior research scientist at the Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina. ''The behavior is too ingrained and compelling.''
 For his part, Mr. Hill rarely talks when he drives now. His mother gave him a hands-free headset two months after the accident. She thought it would create less distraction. He tried it once, and found his mind wandering into his phone call so much that ''I nearly missed a light,'' he said.
 He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, for the death of Ms. Doyle. Now, when he is a passenger in a car, it makes him nervous when the driver starts talking on the phone. But Mr. Hill, who is polite and deferential, said he doesn't want to badger drivers about the risks.
 ''I hope they don't have to go through what I did to realize it's a problem,'' he added.
 Dangerous Overconfidence
 Sgt. Matthew Downing, a tough-talking 11-year veteran on the Oklahoma City police force, drives a car with no lights on the roof. That way, drivers are less likely to notice him as he waits for speeders. 
 Increasingly, he sees erratic behavior -- swerving across lanes, running red lights -- that looks just like drunken driving. Instead, he sees drivers talking on their phones, or texting. ''A ton of people pass me literally unaware of their surroundings,'' he said. 
 Sergeant Downing, who often handles traffic fatalities, arrived at the scene of Mr. Hill's crash after paramedics had extracted Ms. Doyle, who was 61, from her car. He found Mr. Hill sitting on a fire truck, acting ''hysterical.'' 
 There was no mystery about the accident's cause; the roads were dry. ''He told me he was talking on the phone and didn't see the light,'' Sergeant Downing said. 
 ''He's a nice kid,'' he said of Mr. Hill. But he said he felt angry, both at Mr. Hill and at what he sees as an epidemic of multitasking on the road. ''Driving and talking are automatic,'' he said. 
 Over all, cellphone use has soared. From 1995 to 2008, the number of wireless subscribers in the United States increased eightfold, to 270 million, and minutes talked rose 58-fold.
 Last year, the federal agency dealing with road safety, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, published a study, based on researchers' observations of drivers, suggesting that at any time during daylight hours in 2007, 11 percent -- or 1.8 million drivers -- were using a cellphone. 
 And in a survey of 1,506 people last year by Nationwide Mutual Insurance, 81 percent of cellphone owners acknowledged that they talk on phones while driving, and 98 percent considered themselves safe drivers. But 45 percent said they had been hit or nearly hit by a driver talking on a phone. 
 ''When we ask people to identify the most dangerous distraction on the highway today, about half -- correctly -- identify cellphones,'' said Bill Windsor, associate vice president for safety at Nationwide. ''But they think others are dangerous, not themselves.''
 He and others who favor restrictions say drivers regularly make what amount to ill-informed analyses of cost-benefit tradeoffs, often deciding that the value of constant communication outweighs any risks. 
 Seven years ago, when cellphones and services like texting were less common, federal researchers estimated that drivers using cellphones caused about 1,000 fatalities and played a role in 240,000 crashes. (In 2007, drunken driving caused 13,000 fatalities.)
 By other measures, American roads are becoming safer. According to the highway safety agency, the number of driving fatalities has remained around 42,000 a year for most of the last decade, though it fell to 37,261 in 2008, when gas prices rose sharply and Americans drove less. 
 From 1997 to 2007, the number of reported accidents fell to 6 million a year from 6.7 million, according to the highway safety agency. ''There are more drivers, more talking drivers,'' said John Walls, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association. ''If it's so risky, then logically one would think there would be more accidents.'' 
 The association, a trade group, fought rules to ban phone use while driving until January, when it shifted to a neutral position on the issue. ''I wouldn't say, 'Talk on the phone more and have fewer accidents,' '' Mr. Walls added. ''I'm just saying, 'How does this square?' '' 
 Some scientists say this argument is flawed. ''We've spent billions on air bags, antilock brakes, better steering, safer cars and roads, but the number of fatalities has remained constant,'' said David Strayer, a psychology professor at the University of Utah and a leading researcher in the field of distracted driving. 
 ''Our return on investment for those billions is zero,'' he added. ''And that's because we're using devices in our cars.'' 
 Better data would help settle the debate. But 21 states do not include a box on accident forms for police to mark electronic devices as a cause. Those that now account for it started doing so only recently. Mr. Windsor of Nationwide Mutual said that such data, while valuable, would greatly underestimate the problem because it relies on driver confessions. Sometimes drivers say they just finished a call. Cellphone records are not much help because of the difficulty of establishing the precise time of an accident. 
 ''By the time you get to a crash, it's very, very difficult to determine whether someone was talking on the phone and whether the phone caused the crash,'' said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
 For Mr. Windsor and many scientists who study the issue, accident figures are not necessary to prove the risks. 
 ''The research is just so strong,'' Mr. Windsor said. 
 Risks of Multitasking
 In a windowless room at the University of Utah, Professor Strayer has spent a decade studying driver distraction. 
 On a recent afternoon, Anne McLaren, 19, who just finished her freshman year studying dental hygiene and who gets class credit for volunteer work, climbed behind the wheel of Mr. Strayer's $100,000 driving simulator. Her task was to closely follow a white car that often slowed abruptly. A voice on a speaker phone asked Ms. McLaren questions like, ''When you do a pull-up, do your palms face toward you?'' and ''Can you touch your elbow to your ear?'' 
 For the most part, she ably multitasked. But sometimes she took her hands from the wheel when trying to answer a question, like, ''True or false: A peanut butter jar opens clockwise.'' And she was so focused on her call that she seemed to miss surprises, like a body at the side of the road.
 Texting while driving was more difficult; she soon slammed into the virtual car in front of her. 
 Mr. Strayer's research, using a small camera to track his volunteers' eye movements, shows that texting drivers regularly focus on their screens for stretches of more than five seconds. 
 ''I should pay attention to the road,'' she said afterward. But sometimes it's hard to ignore the phone, she added, like when her parents want to reach her. ''My dad gets more mad if I don't have the phone than if I'm talking and driving.''
 Mr. Strayer's research, showing that multitasking drivers are four times as likely to crash as people who are focused on driving, matches the findings of two studies, in Canada and in Australia, of drivers on actual roads. 
 The highway safety administration estimates that drivers using a hand-held device are at 1.3 times greater risk of a crash or near crash, and at three times the risk when dialing, compared with others who are simply driving. The agency based its conclusions on research from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which placed cameras inside cars to monitor drivers for more than a year. The study found cellphones to be the most common cause of driver distraction. 
 Research also shows that drivers conversing with fellow passengers do not present the same danger, because adult riders help keep drivers alert and point out dangerous conditions and tend to talk less in heavy traffic or hazardous weather.
 Scientists note that there are limits to how much the brain can multitask. The brain has trouble assessing separate streams of information -- even if one is visual and the other aural, said Steve Yantis, professor of psychological and brain sciences at Johns Hopkins University. 
 Further, he said, when people talk on the phone, they are doing more than simply listening. The words conjure images in the mind's eye, including images of the person they are talking to. That typically doesn't interfere with driving. The problem starts when a car swerves unexpectedly or a pedestrian steps into traffic, he said, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.
 ''There is zero doubt that one's driving ability is impaired when one is trying to have a cellphone conversation -- whether hands-free or hand-held, it doesn't matter,'' said David E. Meyer, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. 
 In fact, some scientists argue that hands-free laws make driving riskier by effectively condoning the practice. As early as July 2003, researchers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reached that conclusion based on what they referred to, in a proposed draft of a cellphone policy for the agency, as ''a significant body of research worldwide.'' 
 The draft policy said: ''We are convinced that legislation forbidding the use of handheld cellphones while driving will not be effective since it will not address the problem. In fact, such legislation may erroneously imply that hands-free phones are safe to use while driving.'' 
 The agency's current advice is that people should not use cellphones while driving and that hands-free devices do not eliminate the risks of distracted driving.
 Scientists are grappling, too, with perhaps the broadest question hanging over the phenomenon of distracted driving: Why do people, knowing the risk, continue to talk while driving? The answer, they say, is partly the intense social pressures to stay in touch and always be available to friends and colleagues. And there also is the neurological response of multitaskers. They show signs of addiction -- to their gadgets. 
 John Ratey, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a specialist on the science of attention, explained that when people use digital devices, they get a quick burst of adrenaline, ''a dopamine squirt.'' Without it, people grow bored with simpler activities like driving. Mr. Ratey said the modern brain is being rewired to crave stimulation, a condition he calls acquired attention deficit disorder. 
 ''We need that constant pizzazz, the reward, the intensity,'' he said. He largely dismisses the argument that people need the time in the car to be productive. ''The justification for doing work is just that -- a justification to be engaged,'' he said. 
 In many legislatures, including Oklahoma's, the concerns of such scientists have made little impression. 
 Concerns About New Rules
 In February, five months after the accident that killed Ms. Doyle, Sue Tibbs was in Tulsa undergoing one of her regular seven-hour chemotherapy treatments for ovarian cancer.
 As an Oklahoma state representative, Ms. Tibbs was finishing a bill to require hands-free devices for drivers and to ban texting while driving. She had developed an interest in the issue last fall, after hearing about a growing number of crashes like the one involving Mr. Hill and Ms. Doyle, and after an Oklahoma state trooper told her he was increasingly concerned about multitasking behind the wheel. 
 As Ms. Tibbs sat in the cancer center, she overheard a conversation that sealed her resolve. A woman nearby talked of how her husband often became so engrossed in his cellphone calls he would miss the turn for the road to their home. The cellphone, Ms. Tibbs decided, isn't like other distractions. ''When you're eating, you're not concentrating like when you're on the cellphone,'' she said.
 On Feb. 19, the public safety committee voted 8 to 4 to send Ms. Tibbs's bill to the full legislature. She was thrilled. But on March 12, the last day her bill could be considered, the majority floor leader, Mr. Jones, hadn't brought up her bill. That night, she asked Mr. Jones, a fellow Republican, why. He explained that there was too much opposition, she said. Later, Ms. Tibbs said, he added another reason: she was fragile from cancer and he didn't want her to go through a long-shot battle for the bill. 
 Mr. Jones, in an interview, said he and his colleagues needed more evidence of the dangers before they considered restricting the freedom to talk while driving. ''We're concerned about going into the cellphone realm at this point,'' he said, adding that he was not lobbied by any companies that make money from the use of devices in cars.
 But he said he recognized from using his phone while driving that it could be dangerous, particularly when dialing. ''There's definitely a time when you're looking at your cellphone,'' said Mr. Jones, who uses a hands-free device. ''If you're going to do it, you have to be extremely cautious.''
 Like Oklahoma, many states have resisted legislating against multitasking behind the wheel because there is no long-term data on crashes caused by distracted driving, said Anne Teigen, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But she also acknowledged the shortcomings of any such studies. ''It mostly relies on self-reporting, and for insurance reasons people don't want to admit they were on the phone,'' she said.
 Others cite more fundamental reasons to block any such legislation. ''To me, the death of freedom is far worse than the risk of talking on the phone while driving,'' said Carl Wimmer, a state representative in Salt Lake City who successfully fought a bill this year to ban talking while driving. ''Why pick on cellphones?'' he asked, noting that distraction comes in many forms. ''You can't legislate against stupidity.''
 Some states have overcome opposition to pass restrictions. Joe Simitian, a state senator in California, managed to get his hands-free legislation, an effort he began in 2001, passed in 2006. He argued, based on data collected by the California Highway Patrol, that drivers using cellphones caused more fatalities than all the drivers distracted by eating, children, pets or personal hygiene.
 In each previous year, the bill was killed -- after lobbying by cellphone carriers, including Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile. Mr. Simitian said that in the first two years, he would visit the offices of his colleagues on the Transportation Committee on the day of the vote and ''find three cellphone industry lobbyists sitting in the legislator's office,'' Mr. Simitian said. ''They'd just smile.''
 He said they fought him even though their brochures said that distracted driving was dangerous. The exception was Verizon Wireless, which supported his efforts from the start.
 Opposition gradually eased, and his bill requiring use of headsets while driving took effect in July 2008. In the first six months the California law was in effect, a preliminary California Highway Patrol estimate showed that fatalities dropped 12.5 percent -- saving 200 lives. Mr. Simitian said it was too soon to determine whether the law or other factors caused the drop. 
 Mr. Simitian said one reason political opposition eased was that fellow legislators saw the dangers firsthand. ''They'd come to me and say: 'You may be bringing me around. I almost got creamed at the corner,' '' he recalled.
 For its part, the cellphone industry trade group said it had dropped its objection to restricting cellphone use by drivers -- it now is neutral on the subject -- because it decided the industry should play no role in trying to shape public policy on the issue. ''The change came after we had an epiphany that, if you will, we're in the business of providing service, and how they use that service is at their discretion,'' said Mr. Walls, the industry spokesman. 
 But Mr. Windsor from Nationwide Mutual and others are skeptical of the cellphone industry's explanation. They believe its position changed because its business has changed to rely less on total minutes that people spend talking. Cellphone companies' growth is coming more from customers surfing the Internet, downloading games and using other data services -- things that people typically do less of behind the wheel.
 Mr. Simitian believes that a ban on talking on cellphones while driving would save even more lives. But he hasn't proposed one, and has no plans to. ''It's a political nonstarter,'' he said. ''It'll be a cold day in hell before people give up their phones altogether in cars.'' 
 Not to mention other devices. 
 An Array of Distractions
 Mr. Hill now owns a silver Chevrolet Silverado pickup that he bought with help from his grandmother. When he drives, he keeps his cellphone tucked in a space in the dashboard, and has set strict rules not to use it -- rules he acknowledges he sometimes breaks. 
 He is also careful to keep his eyes on the road as he searches for his Nickelback, Christian rock or other CDs to play on his stereo. 
 His dashboard is relatively primitive compared with those of many other vehicles. Sales of multimedia systems for cars -- with audio, video and GPS -- were up 46 percent in the first four months of this year from a year earlier, according to the research firm NPD Group. More such systems also now come with a dock for MP3 players.
 Scientists say they are frightened by each new device, giving drivers more reasons to look away from the road -- like searching through song titles on the small screen of an iPod. 
 To device makers, it's a big and growing market, though they say they are keenly aware that drivers can become distracted. ''We have a chance to create what I call the 'digital car,' '' said Glenn Lurie, an executive at AT&T, the service provider for iPhones. ''There are phenomenal opportunities.'' 
 For instance, he said, new wireless technology could allow better real-time services, like maps that point to the closest, cheapest gas station. Mr. Lurie said devices would be developed foremost with ''safety and security'' in mind. 
 But other corporations emphasize just how engrossing their in-car entertainment can be. A recent ad from Audible.com, which sells audio books, says, ''you just might miss your exit on the turnpike.'' 
 Automakers also see a market for new features. Ford, for example, offers in most of its cars a $395 Sync system, which lets drivers use phones and music players with voice commands. The company says it is working to develop the product so drivers might even surf the Internet through voice commands and hear responses.
 Joe Berry, Ford's director of business and product development, said Sync enhances safety by providing a hands-free experience. But he said that not using a device is still safer.
 The bottom line is that Ford is cateringto consumer interests, Mr. Berry said, using an argument that car makers have made when the safety and fuel economy of sport utility vehicles are questioned, and used by tobacco companies as health concerns grew. The Sync product, he argues, makes drivers safer because its voice-command features let them keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.
 ''It's not as if you are going to be able to take this away from people,'' he said of phones and other devices in cars. ''They simply won't give it up.''
 Mr. Berry compared the situation to eating unhealthy foods. ''We, as people, don't want to stop doing things that aren't in our best interest,'' he said. 
 And so the fight against in-car distraction has fallen to a small band of activists, notably those who have lost a loved one. They argue that, unlike eating unhealthy foods -- or for that matter, not wearing a seat belt -- mobile multitasking can cost someone else's life.
 The Resistance
 When Linda Doyle was hit by Mr. Hill's truck, she was on her way to pick up cat food. She volunteered at the Central Oklahoma Humane Society, and drove every day without fail to nearby Lake Overholser, where she fed abandoned cats. 
 She would sometimes talk on the phone in her car. ''If she was driving and I called, she would answer,'' said Jennifer Smith, 35, Ms. Doyle's daughter. ''If my sister called, she would answer.'' 
 Ms. Smith, who lives in Grapevine, Tex., and is a real estate agent, says she, too, once talked incessantly while driving. ''We're all guilty of it,'' she said. ''I'm the first to admit it.'' 
 In her case, no longer. Ms. Smith almost always ignores the ring of an incoming call. And she has become one of the cellphone era's answers to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She devotes half her time to her uphill battle -- contacting legislators in Texas and Oklahoma, filing a complaint with the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and reaching out to other victims and their families. 
 She has talked to a handful of class-action lawyers. ''They tell me this is the tobacco or asbestos case of our generation,'' she said. But she says they also tell her the case would be too time-consuming and expensive. 
 David Teater of Spring Lake, Mich., is also fighting distracted driving; he works for the National Safety Council on transportation issues. His son Joe was killed on Martin Luther King's Birthday in 2004, hit by a young woman talking on the cellphone to someone from her church, where she volunteered. Even after the accident, Mr. Teater said, he had trouble breaking his cellphone habit. 
 ''With all the motivation in the world I couldn't do it,'' he said, adding that he eventually took more decisive action: ''I put the cellphone in the trunk.'' 
 Some drivers who caused accidents themselves have become activists, too. Mr. Hill, as part of his misdemeanor charge, must devote 240 hours to community service -- talking about the risks of distracted driving, as well as working with animals, as Ms. Doyle's family said she would have liked. 
 He spoke to a classroom of fellow students about his experience, sparing no details. 
 ''Their jaws just dropped,'' he said. ''They couldn't believe they had someone standing in front of them who was talking on the cellphone and killed someone.''

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
''The donut wars,'' several blogs and news organizations called them, as if a platoon of cinnamon crullers were advancing on a phalanx of glazed. The dispatches from the front were numerous -- and impassioned. This was clearly a contest of the utmost consequence.
 It pitted Tim Hortons, a Canadian doughnut leader, against Dunkin' Donuts, an American one. Last weekend, Hortons invaded Manhattan, displacing a dozen Dunkin' stores and girding for battle with the rest.
 But while this development could have been covered and discussed merely as a business story or even a parable of international comeuppance, it was almost instantly analyzed in epicurean terms. Which of the two fast-food chains fried a finer circle of dough? And how did the Hortons nuggetlike Timbit stack up against the shrunken Dunkin' Munchkin?
 The New York Daily News staged a taste test. So did the blogs Urbanite (affiliated with amNY), the Feed (affiliated with TimeOut New York) and Diner's Journal (affiliated with The New York Times). 
 In so doing, they showed how the humblest of foodstuffs have come to be treated in the most exalted and rapt of fashions -- worthy of probing, pondering and ranking.
 This elevation of what was once considered junk food to the subject of vigorous aesthetic analysis represents the convergence of two trend lines. The first is many Americans' growing sophistication about, and fascination with, what's for dinner (or breakfast or lunch): the variety of it; the vocabulary for it; where to buy the best this; how to cook the best that. More and more people seem to insist on deliciousness, and more and more seem to have readily articulated opinions to go along with that demand.
 But they're bumping up against a troubled economy and budgets with stricter limits. For food lovers and for the periodicals, newscasts and blogs that serve them (and are themselves cash-strapped), what's the solution?
 To apply one's powers of discernment to doughnuts. To mull the nuances of burritos and cupcakes. To assess rival burgers as if they were rival brasseries on the Left Bank.
 ''This one guy called Mister Hamburger was ranking all sorts of minute details of every burger,'' recalled Adam Kuban, a prominent New York food blogger, referring to a local peer whose Web site no longer exists. ''He did 'beef-to-bun ratio.' He did 'patty color.' ''
 Mr. Kuban also mentioned Texas Burger Guy, a blogger who rates burgers according to these criteria: ''herd killer,'' a reference to their size, and thus how quickly they're thinning a herd of cattle; ''handling,'' or how easily gripped they are; ''bling bling,'' their price; ''ooze factor,'' their juiciness; and ''gravedigger,'' how quickly their greasiness and heft might put you six feet under. Gravedigger ratings range from one to 10 shovels.
 Mr. Kuban has his own burger blog, A Hamburger Today, along with his own pizza blog, Slice, on which he occasionally evaluates pizzas in terms of the ''tip sag'' of a given piece.
 ''If it's not crisp enough, the tip will sag,'' he said, adding that a bit of sag is actually fine, even preferred, so long as it's not too much. ''Ideal tip sag would be -- you could have maybe an inch or so, three-quarters of an inch. If it starts sagging more than that, it's indicative of a soggy crust.''
 The Internet with its infinite real estate is of course a big force behind the fetishization of everyday food, giving voice to niche obsessions and connecting enthusiasts far and wide.
 But that's not the whole of it. In recent years a rising number of accomplished chefs have trained their energies on the sorts of mass-market foods once beyond (and beneath) their interest. And that adjustment carries the message that no food is too lowly to be fussed over -- or deconstructed.
 Daniel Boulud, one of New York's most celebrated French chefs, just opened a burger joint. At the downtown Manhattan cocktail lounge PDT you can compare hot dogs by David Chang, of the revered Momofuku mini-empire, with those by Wylie Dufresne, a renowned evangelist of avant-garde cuisine.
 Michael Psilakis, who took Greek food in an unusually creative -- and decidedly upscale -- direction when he opened Anthos in Midtown Manhattan two years ago, has just unveiled Gus & Gabriel on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Its menu includes hot dogs, pretzel nuggets, nachos and even fried mozzarella.
 All of the highbrow talent lavished on lowbrow fare -- and all of the discerning palates migrating in that direction -- are reflected in the girth of New York magazine's annual bargain-restaurants issue, which came out on Monday.
 In this year's installment, 25 pages -- including 15 on pizza alone -- are devoted to economical dining. Last year, the page count was 18; the year before that, 17.
 And no sooner had the issue hit stands than the magazine's Web site, Grub Street, supplemented it with an online ''burger register'' of the city's 82 best burgers. Apparently 25, 50 or even 75 burgers just wouldn't do.
 Food porn begets fast-food porn, which in turn has come to verge on fast-food parody, some of it perhaps intentional. The Web site Fancy Fast Food actually devises and presents recipes for seemingly refined, accomplished dishes that just rearrange and redeploy ingredients in items purchased directly from, say, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
 Or Domino's. That chain's American Legends Pacific Veggie pizza is the entirety of the shopping list for a dish that Fancy Fast Food labels Dao Mi Noh Chow Mein and that, as pictured on the site, looks like something in a proper Chinese restaurant.
 How crazy can it get? Do a Google search on ''cupcake blog'' and see how many pop up, including ''Hello, Cupcake!,'' ''Cupcake Project,'' ''Crumbs and Doilies,'' ''No One Puts Cupcake in a Corner'' and ''Cupcakes Take the Cake,'' whose inventory of posts includes ''cupcake kebab how-to,'' ''cupcake license plates'' and ''cupcake bakeries on Twitter.''
 The cupcake universe is obviously richer, subtler and more varied than was once imagined, but can doughnuts really reward much reflection? Especially chain doughnuts of the most basic order?
 Apparently, yes. The Urbanite blog judged Timbits superior to Munchkins because they were ''denser, more cake-like.'' But the Feed blog's 16 taste-test participants on balance favored Munchkins, finding them ''sweeter, lighter, fluffier.''
 You, no doubt, will come to your own conclusion, based on yeastiness and maybe ''crumb factor'' and possibly ''hole-to-dough ratio.'' Then you can move on to an exhaustive inventory of snow cones.

HEADLINE: Tightening Belts? She's The Expert

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
A SOAKING June rain is blowing sideways through the meatpacking district of Manhattan, pummeling umbrellas and already grim retail sales. Above the cobblestone streets, in her Balinese-inspired living room-cum-office, Diane von Furstenberg is stretched like a cat on the couch, coolly gazing beyond the Buddha statues and glass terrace doors at the rain.
 ''It's more important than ever to have confidence,'' says Ms. von Furstenberg, creator of the body-hugging wrap dress so emblematic of 1970s fashion that it hangs in the Smithsonian Institution. ''Everyone else is insecure. If you start to take a little bit of everyone else's insecurity -- forget it.''
 It takes chutzpah to say as much in a recession, when the nation's top department stores -- Neiman Marcus, Saks, Nordstrom -- are posting monthly sales declines. The fashion house of the couturier Christian Lacroix unraveled in May, filing for protection from creditors. Boutiques like Linda Dresner, Tracey Ross and Georgina are but memories. 
 Even so, Ms. von Furstenberg has the right to be confident. At 62, she has seen her business skyrocket in the 1970s, crash in the '80s and, unpredictably, thrive today. In the 1990s, a new generation of women discovered her clingy print dresses in vintage shops, prompting the resurrection of the brand. Today the dresses are worn by women like Jessica Alba, Madonna and Jennifer Lopez. 
 Sales may be down from last year, as they are at almost every retailer, but Ms. von Furstenberg says the company is profitable. 
 ''It's absolutely wonderful to be considered cool,'' says Ms. von Furstenberg -- her French-tinged drawl elongating the word ''cool'' -- ''by girls who are very often a lot younger than my children.''
 She never thought that she would have such success twice in a lifetime. That she has, and that she is now president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the industry trade association, has made Ms. von Furstenberg something of an authority on how to survive as an upscale brand. 
 ''Failure makes you a better person and a better executive,'' says Ronald Frasch, president and chief merchandising officer at Saks. ''And when she came back, she catapulted. She's evolved into a very highly respected, influential industry leader.''
 Slipping off her shoes this rainy afternoon, Ms. von Furstenberg is willing to proffer her business strategies, even as the fashion industry is still learning to navigate the new economy. 
 ''It's like we are on a surfing board in the middle of a tsunami,'' she says. ''It just so happens that I'm surfing a good wave now. But that doesn't mean I can't fall.'' 
 The recession is transforming retailing like no other event in decades. Consumers spent indiscriminately for years. And, because of easy credit, many spent more than they could afford, while big chains opened store after store. The industry, as Ms. von Furstenberg puts it, needed a ''laxative.''
 ''All of us, we made too many clothes,'' she says. ''Too much fat, too much spending. There was too much of everything.''
 Ms. von Furstenberg knows firsthand the perils of saturating the market. It is one reason she had to sell her dress business in the late 1970s and it is why today she tells young designers who hope their businesses are bought by a big company: ''Don't wish for that. Just grow yourself naturally. The more you can grow yourself naturally, the more you can control your own destiny.'' 
 Controlling one's destiny is far easier when you are not beholden to anyone. When Ms. von Furstenberg restarted her business in 1997, she and her family provided the seed money. Paula Sutter, president of Diane von Furstenberg, said the company, which has 31 of its own boutiques and sells in many other stores, now finances itself from operations and has no debt. 
 Ms. von Furstenberg says it is crucial to fill a niche rather than to aim to be a brand that is all things to all consumers. Her own specialty is feminine yet comfortable women's fashion.
 ''I am not interested in making children's clothes,'' she says. ''I want little girls to want to grow up to wear the clothes. I do not want to do men's clothes. My mission in life, what I understand in life, is women. I wanted to be a certain kind of a woman. I became that kind of a woman.''
 That last line is a Diane von Furstenberg refrain. Describing the woman she once only fantasized about being, she tilted her head back, running her hands through her thick, wavy hair.
 ''Independent,'' she says, taking her eyes off the rain. ''Independent. Independent. Financially independent.''
 BORN Diane Halfin in Brussels in 1946, Ms. von Furstenberg has a lust for freedom and a tenacity she attributes to being the daughter of a woman who survived the Holocaust. 
 Her much-sought-after independence was derailed in 1969, though, when she unexpectedly became pregnant. She married her boyfriend, Prince Egon von Furstenberg, a Swiss-born aristrocrat, and followed him to New York. ''I thought, 'Oh my God, this is not what I had designed for myself,' '' she says. 
 The couple's good looks and status made them party and society-column regulars. And in the early 1970s, Diana Vreeland, the editor of Vogue, ignited Ms. von Furstenberg's career by featuring one of her dresses in the magazine. The couple split after about three years. But the dress endured.
 In a decade when many women were entering the work force as well as reveling in a newfound sexual freedom, the affordable wrap dress also became a symbol of liberation. A tug of the slinky sash at the waist and a woman could go from boardroom to boudoir. By 1976, Ms. von Furstenberg was being described in Newsweek as ''the most marketable female in fashion since Coco Chanel.''
 But too many wrap dresses were on the market, and Ms. von Furstenberg, burdened with $4 million of inventory, was forced to license away her name. 
 The loss of control of her business in the '80s, however, may have helped prepare her for this economy. Many things she did differently when she began rebuilding more than a decade ago are moves analysts and consultants consider essential for outlasting the recession. Her business is not overgrown and her inventory is modest. Her clothes are practical, durable and sell for less than competitors' dresses. 
 ''This time around I decided I was going to be very much who I really am,'' says Ms. von Furstenberg, who is now a grandmother -- albeit one who is so nimble from yoga that she can hang upside down on a swing in her office. 
 Today her company, which also sells other kinds of women's apparel, accessories and shoes, is a private, family business. The rejuvenated company broke even in 2002, and by 2003 made its first profit on sales of $75 million, Ms. Sutter said. Ms. von Furstenberg, who married the media mogul Barry Diller in 2001, projects that sales this year will be about $200 million, and says the company is profitable.
 According to Ms. Sutter, the company had double-digit sales growth each year from 2003 to 2008. This year, she says that apparel sales are down but that the decline is not in the double digits, as it is at many rivals. 
 Inspiring consumers to shop in this economy is a daunting job for any brand or retailer not selling necessities like food and toilet paper. Even classic clothes at discounted prices are a hard sell as unemployment climbs.
 ''Nobody needs anything,'' Ms. von Furstenberg explained. ''Whatever you have in your closet is good enough, do you know what I'm saying? So you need to be very creative in times like that.''
 Creativity is expressed in the design and marketing of the clothes. The wrap dresses evolve, depending on what's in vogue. When mini dresses were popular, the hemlines went up. When kimono-inspired obi belts were in style, out came wrap dresses with obi belts.
 Just as important, though, is running a lean business. The company has slowed store growth and trimmed inventory. Supplies were so tight at the beginning of the year that Ms. Sutter ended up ordering more. 
 Pricing merchandise correctly is also essential. Saks and Neiman Marcus, for example, have asked elite brands to create more products in a wider range of prices. ''I don't want to sound condescending like everyone can afford a $400 dress,'' Ms. Sutter says. ''That is absolutely not the case. But we do have a much broader appeal than some of our competitors that only have $2,000 dresses.''
 If consumers are going to part with their dollars in a downturn, they want practical, timeless merchandise. The simple wrap dress, costing from $300 to $400, travels well. It is professional enough for the office and compelling enough for an aperitif.
 ''I think there's a big difference between women designers and men designers,'' Ms. von Furstenberg explains. ''Huge, huge, huge!'' She recalls a recent dinner with a male fashion designer where, she says, he commented: ''Us men designers, we make costumes. Women designers make clothes.' '' 
 Ms. von Furstenberg says she could not agree more, adding that women designers love working with comfortable materials like jersey while men designers prefer, for instance, satin. ''You know, because it looks more glamorous,'' Ms. von Furstenberg says. 
 She attributes much of her success to the fact that her company of 155 employees is 97 percent women. 
 ''It's cultlike,'' Mr. Diller explains. ''As she says, the only men there are drivers and waiters.'' 
 That is something of a joke, as there are a few male executives. But Ms. von Furstenberg designs for women. And she prefers women for her sales staff in stores because they wear her clothes and can be intimately familiar with them. 
 Terry J. Lundgren, president and chief executive of Macy's, says that Ms. von Furstenberg herself is what draws women to the brand -- ''her style and charm and charisma.''
 Ms. von Furstenberg says that installing a woman as president was the first smart decision she made when beginning to revive the business. ''I always used to hide -- because as a woman you have a tendency to hide behind a man in a suit, for the business part,'' she says. ''And every time I did that it was a mistake.''
 Her president, Ms. Sutter, thinks a main reason the company has been so successful is that ''we approached everything in the best interest of the brand long term.''
 ''We're constantly re-evaluating and making sure that the company will be here for when her grandchildren are ready to step in,'' Ms. Sutter says. ''And then I can retire. Happily.''
 TALITA, Ms. von Furstenberg's 10-year-old granddaughter, stands in the middle of the Diane von Furstenberg boutique in the meatpacking district, politely greeting visitors who trickle in from the rain.
 ''Shoes and handbags are 40 percent off,'' she says.
 Her father, Alexandre von Furstenberg, jokes by telephone that she's interning early. ''She's 10 going on 40.''
 The shop occupies part of the ground floor of a warehouse that also houses Ms. von Furstenberg's headquarters and her penthouse apartment. She put roots in the neighborhood more than a decade ago, when it was all but abandoned and the High Line was a rusted eyesore, not a park where sunbathers queue up to get in. (Incidentally, she helped to lead the revival of that, too.) 
 Talita has been in the shop all morning. ''She comes up and she says, 'You have the most fun job in the world,' '' Ms. von Furstenberg says.
 Perhaps a little less so in this economy. 
 But Ms. von Furstenberg takes a long view. ''I want to create a legacy,'' she says, playing absently with the hem of her dress. ''I would love for her to take over.''

HEADLINE: Pharisees On the Potomac

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
Like cats that have lost their whiskers, the Republicans seem off balance now that they have lost their talent for hypocrisy.
 They are still practicing the ancient political art of Tartuffery, of course, just without their former aplomb.
 Who can forget the glory years, when the Gipper invoked God but never went to church? When Arlen Specter accused Anita Hill of perjury to distract from Clarence Thomas's false witness? When Newt Gingrich and other conservatives indulged in affairs with young Washington peaches as they pushed to impeach Bill Clinton?
 No one had more flair than W. and Cheney, crowing about making us safe as they made the world more dangerous, and bragging about fiscal restraint while they spent us into oblivion. 
 Now when Republicans get caught flouting the principles they dictate, they are not able to practice hypocrisy with such impunity.
 Loverboy Mark Sanford's career continued to go south last week as news organizations exposed his two-faced tactics on travel expenses. When he ran for South Carolina governor in 2002, he attacked the Democratic incumbent for ''lavish spending'' on hotels and planes. Once elected, he asked state employees to bunk together in hotel rooms when they traveled and chastised staffers who spent more than the $208 federal rate.
 But, as Politico reports: ''He routinely billed taxpayers for high-end airline seats, racking up more than $44,000 on business and first-class tickets. He often stayed in pricey hotels that far exceeded the rates he imposed on other state employees.'' On a trade mission to China, Sanford spent $12,000 on business-class tickets, leaving aides in economy for about $1,900. 
 The religious boardinghouse in Washington where Sanford sought succor from fellow conservatives, where he agonized to pals about his tango with the enticing Maria, is also back in the news. Affiliated with a secretive Capitol Hill group known as the Fellowship -- which also sponsored Bible study and prayer circles attended by Hillary Clinton when she was a senator -- the pious dwelling is becoming a tourist attraction, a monument to Republican hypocrisy. 
 The C Street house, as the flag-flying brick rowhouse near the Capitol is known, serves as a residence and Bible study retreat for many Christian conservative lawmakers. But it looks as if what these guys were praying for was a chance to get lucky.
 John Ensign, the Promise Keeper who broke all his promises, resides there. As The Washington Post reported, Senator Tom Coburn, who lives there, had an emotional meeting about forgiveness at the house with Doug Hampton, the husband of Ensign's mistress. (Forgiveness plus bribery can often do the trick.) Coburn says he would not talk to a court or the Senate ethics committee about the episode because he was counseling Ensign partly as a doctor. (Coburn is an ob-gyn.)
 Last week, The Associated Press revealed that the estranged wife of a former Republican congressman, Chip Pickering of Mississippi, had filed an alienation of affection lawsuit seeking damages against her husband's gal pal, a wealthy former college sweetheart named Elizabeth Creekmore Byrd.
 The suit charges that as a lawmaker, Chip used C Street as a divine love nest. ''Ultimately,'' it says, ''Creekmore Byrd gave Pickering the option to remain a public servant or become a private citizen and continue relations with her.''
 Republican hypocrisy fell flat at the Sotomayor hearings. After railing all week against the ''empathy standard,'' as Senator Jeff Sessions called it, the Republicans tried to play the empathy card by calling in two New Haven firefighters, one white and one Hispanic, who were on the losing end of Sonia Sotomayor's ruling. Wearing their dress uniforms, the pair told their heart-tugging tales of studying for an exam that got thrown out after they scored high. Frank Ricci, who studied hard to overcome his dyslexia, used his finger to trace under the words as he read his testimony. 
 But the Republican complaint against Sotomayor in that case boiled down to wanting her to be more activist. They were upset that she sided with elected officials and precedent rather than intervening to strike down a result that many people, including me, found unfair.
 Sotomayor's syntax was unfathomable, but the Republicans' language sounded positively archaic: dire warnings against activist judges, when the conservative majority on this Supreme Court has ignored or upended precedent in a slew of cases.
 Judge Sotomayor kept her feelings in check, while her white male Republican interrogators dissolved into whining about wanting to keep their guns and nunchakus and wishing they could get back some sway over what women do with their bodies. 
 If they are so interested in women's bodies, maybe they should just move to C Street.

HEADLINE: The Shuffle President

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Inside the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
Like romantic comedies and superhero blockbusters, the modern presidency has evolved into a reliable form of dramatic narrative. A candidate comes into office brandishing a broad theme -- a vow to clean up government, perhaps, or to fearlessly prune it back -- and then lays out one or two big proposals to make it real. In time, of course, a presidency tends to sprawl as events intrude. Bill Clinton couldn't have imagined he would spend so much of his two terms fending off resurgent Republicans, just as George W. Bush didn't envision going to war. But at least for those first several months, while the White House controls its own fate, the presidency is supposed to unfold in discrete chapters, each building atop the last. Both Ronald Reagan and Bush began with an almost single-minded push for tax cuts during their opening months, while Clinton opened with an economic program and then a monthslong drive for health care reform. The simple premise here is that every new presidency is a story; the more muddled and erratic the storyline, the harder it is for the public to follow along and the less likely the chances of reaching a satisfying end. 
 Barack Obama is a born storyteller, which makes it all the more confounding that as president he refuses to inhabit a neat political narrative. Obama's themes are clear enough (salvaging the American economy, reversing the Bush years), but his legislative priorities seem to rotate in and out like so many suitcases on a conveyor belt. One day his presidency hinges on health care, then he's lobbying for a cap-and-trade plan to reduce carbon emissions and then he's out there trying to re-regulate the financial world or sell a new treaty with the Russians. ''An administration about everything is an administration about nothing'' is the way the conservative columnist Peggy Noonan put it in The Wall Street Journal. Colin Powell made a similar point, telling John King of CNN, ''I think one of the cautions that has to be given to the president -- and I've talked to some of his people about this -- is that you can't have so many things on the table that you can't absorb it all.'' 
 Some of this itinerancy must be attributed to the sheer scope of the wreckage Obama inherited. When you've got failing banks and corporate giants, two ongoing wars, melting icecaps and mountainous health care costs, it's hard to see what gets pushed to the margins. It's also true, though, that Obama's style reflects, whether he means it to or not, a cultural shift on the importance of narrative. Americans acclimated to clicking around hundreds of cable channels or Web pages experience the world less chronologically than their parents did. The most popular books now -- business guides like ''Good to Great'' or social explorations like ''The Tipping Point'' -- allow the casual reader to absorb their insights in random order or while skimming whole chapters. 
 Once we listened to cohesive albums like, say, Bob Dylan's ''Highway 61 Revisited,'' which kicked off with the snare hit of ''Like a Rolling Stone,'' almost like a starter pistol, and worked its way toward the melancholy postscript of ''Desolation Row.'' Now your iPod might jump mindlessly from ''Desolation Row'' to ''Tombstone Blues,'' or from Dylan to Rihanna. The shrink-wrapped record has given way to the downloaded single. Wasn't this one reason for all the tributes to Michael Jackson? It's not that ''Thriller'' was really as singularly awesome as so many of us thought it was in high school. It's more that we know there may never be an album that epic again. 
 Obama is the nation's first shuffle president. He's telling lots of stories at once, and in no particular order. His agenda is fully downloadable. If what you care most about is health care, then you can jump right to that. If global warming gets you going, then click over there. It's not especially realistic to imagine that politics could cling to a linear way of rendering stories while the rest of American culture adapts to a more customized form of consumption. Obama's ethos may disconcert the older guard in Washington, but it's probably comforting to a lot of younger voters who could never be expected to listen to successive tracks, in the same order, over and over again.
 Such an approach does, however, invite significant peril. Random play may popularize your music in the aggregate, but it doesn't foster the same kind of investment in the songs themselves. U2 may have more fans than ever, but that doesn't mean these listeners can name half the tracks on the band's latest release. 
 Similarly, Obama retains higher favorability ratings than any of his recent predecessors -- about 60 percent, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted last month. But only 46 percent in the same poll were either ''quite'' or ''extremely'' confident that Obama had the right policies to revive the economy, and only 33 percent volunteered support for his health care plan. That last number grew to 55 percent when the broad plan was explained to voters, which means that even the outlines of what is arguably Obama's most important proposal haven't been absorbed by the public. In other words, most Americans seem to like the president, but they're not engaged with the specific arguments he's making.
 And should the president prevail on one or another of his proposals, he might find that acclaim, in this digital moment, can be ephemeral. Landmark legislative proposals, like hit singles, can come to seem interchangeable and dispensable. Creating a new health care framework, after more than a half-century of talking about it, would be a monumental achievement for any president, but even that might seem somehow small when viewed as only one in a series of competing storylines. What about carbon emissions? How about reining in Wall Street? Too much comes at us now, too devoid of context, for any one thing to matter as much as it probably should. In a society on shuffle, we're always left to wonder what's next.

Curing the Patient
 To the Editor:
 In ''Good Intentions Aside, Are We Killing the Patient?'' (Everybody's Business, July 12), Ben Stein argued that President Obama should focus on economic recovery before worrying about other policy issues like health care or energy reforms. 
 The column used the metaphor of a patient who is suffering from internal bleeding but whose doctor also performs a face-lift and a stomach-stapling procedure during his treatment. But unlike the hospital patient, who may not need the face-lift or the stomach-stapling, our country has economic problems that are not independent of one another. Alleviating businesses of enormous health care costs, and/or increasing the relative attractiveness of alternative energy, would create thousands of new jobs and should be an integral part of any serious economic recovery effort.
 A more appropriate metaphor of the current situation would be a patient being treated for lung cancer. While treating the disease, the doctor should also discourage the patient from continuing to smoke.

 To the Editor:
 In contending that a cap-and-trade system would pose an undeserved burden on oil refining companies, Ben Stein asked: ''Why attack a healthy industry when so many other sectors are ill?''
 The answer is that once the economy regains its strength, measures like cap and trade will be conveniently forgotten so that oil companies can thrive even more -- that is, until the oil industry outdates itself.
 Look no further than the auto industry, which retooled in the 1980s and began to make smaller, energy-efficient vehicles to compete with imports. When lower oil prices emerged in the 1990s, automakers forgot the lessons of the '80s, put all their eggs into S.U.V.'s and now face the consequences.
 Unless the government takes advantage of the current opportunity to impose cap-and-trade policies, the oil refining industry may ultimately suffer a similar fate. Barth Keck

HEADLINE: Why We Must Raton Health Care

BYLINE: By PETER SINGER. 
Peter Singer is professor of bioethics at Princeton University. He is also laureate professor at the University of Melbourne, in Australia. His most recent book is ''The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty.''

 BODY:
 You have advanced kidney cancer. It will kill you, probably in the next year or two. A drug called Sutent slows the spread of the cancer and may give you an extra six months, but at a cost of $54,000. Is a few more months worth that much?
 If you can afford it, you probably would pay that much, or more, to live longer, even if your quality of life wasn't going to be good. But suppose it's not you with the cancer but a stranger covered by your health-insurance fund. If the insurer provides this man -- and everyone else like him -- with Sutent, your premiums will increase. Do you still think the drug is a good value? Suppose the treatment cost a million dollars. Would it be worth it then? Ten million? Is there any limit to how much you would want your insurer to pay for a drug that adds six months to someone's life? If there is any point at which you say, ''No, an extra six months isn't worth that much,'' then you think that health care should be rationed. 
 In the current U.S. debate over health care reform, ''rationing'' has become a dirty word. Meeting last month with five governors, President Obama urged them to avoid using the term, apparently for fear of evoking the hostile response that sank the Clintons' attempt to achieve reform. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published at the end of last year with the headline ''Obama Will Ration Your Health Care,'' Sally Pipes, C.E.O. of the conservative Pacific Research Institute, described how in Britain the national health service does not pay for drugs that are regarded as not offering good value for money, and added, ''Americans will not put up with such limits, nor will our elected representatives.'' And the Democratic chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, told CNSNews in April, ''There is no rationing of health care at all'' in the proposed reform. 
 Remember the joke about the man who asks a woman if she would have sex with him for a million dollars? She reflects for a few moments and then answers that she would. ''So,'' he says, ''would you have sex with me for $50?'' Indignantly, she exclaims, ''What kind of a woman do you think I am?'' He replies: ''We've already established that. Now we're just haggling about the price.'' The man's response implies that if a woman will sell herself at any price, she is a prostitute. The way we regard rationing in health care seems to rest on a similar assumption, that it's immoral to apply monetary considerations to saving lives -- but is that stance tenable? 
 Health care is a scarce resource, and all scarce resources are rationed in one way or another. In the United States, most health care is privately financed, and so most rationing is by price: you get what you, or your employer, can afford to insure you for. But our current system of employer-financed health insurance exists only because the federal government encouraged it by making the premiums tax deductible. That is, in effect, a more than $200 billion government subsidy for health care. In the public sector, primarily Medicare, Medicaid and hospital emergency rooms, health care is rationed by long waits, high patient copayment requirements, low payments to doctors that discourage some from serving public patients and limits on payments to hospitals. 
 The case for explicit health care rationing in the United States starts with the difficulty of thinking of any other way in which we can continue to provide adequate health care to people on Medicaid and Medicare, let alone extend coverage to those who do not now have it. Health-insurance premiums have more than doubled in a decade, rising four times faster than wages. In May, Medicare's trustees warned that the program's biggest fund is heading for insolvency in just eight years. Health care now absorbs about one dollar in every six the nation spends, a figure that far exceeds the share spent by any other nation. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it is on track to double by 2035. 
 President Obama has said plainly that America's health care system is broken. It is, he has said, by far the most significant driver of America's long-term debt and deficits. It is hard to see how the nation as a whole can remain competitive if in 26 years we are spending nearly a third of what we earn on health care, while other industrialized nations are spending far less but achieving health outcomes as good as, or better than, ours. 
 Rationing health care means getting value for the billions we are spending by setting limits on which treatments should be paid for from the public purse. If we ration we won't be writing blank checks to pharmaceutical companies for their patented drugs, nor paying for whatever procedures doctors choose to recommend. When public funds subsidize health care or provide it directly, it is crazy not to try to get value for money. The debate over health care reform in the United States should start from the premise that some form of health care rationing is both inescapable and desirable. Then we can ask, What is the best way to do it?
 Last year Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence gave a preliminary recommendation that the National Health Service should not offer Sutent for advanced kidney cancer. The institute, generally known as NICE, is a government-financed but independently run organization set up to provide national guidance on promoting good health and treating illness. The decision on Sutent did not, at first glance, appear difficult. NICE had set a general limit of $:30,000, or about $49,000, on the cost of extending life for a year. Sutent, when used for advanced kidney cancer, cost more than that, and research suggested it offered only about six months extra life. But the British media leapt on the theme of penny-pinching bureaucrats sentencing sick people to death. The issue was then picked up by the U.S. news media and by those lobbying against health care reform in the United States. An article in The New York Times last December featured Bruce Hardy, a kidney-cancer patient whose wife, Joy, said, ''It's hard to know that there is something out there that could help but they're saying you can't have it because of cost.'' Then she asked the classic question: ''What price is life?'' 
 Last November, Bloomberg News focused on Jack Rosser, who was 57 at the time and whose doctor had told him that with Sutent he might live long enough to see his 1-year-old daughter, Emma, enter primary school. Rosser's wife, Jenny, is quoted as saying: ''It's immoral. They are sentencing him to die.'' In the conservative monthly The American Spectator, David Catron, a health care consultant, describes Rosser as ''one of NICE's many victims'' and writes that NICE ''regularly hands down death sentences to gravely ill patients.'' Linking the British system with Democratic proposals for reforming health care in the United States, Catron asked whether we really deserve a health care system in which ''soulless bureaucrats arbitrarily put a dollar value on our lives.'' (In March, NICE issued a final ruling on Sutent. Because of how few patients need the drug and because of special end-of-life considerations, it recommended that the drug be provided by the National Health Service to patients with advanced kidney cancer.)
 There's no doubt that it's tough -- politically, emotionally and ethically -- to make a decision that means that someone will die sooner than they would have if the decision had gone the other way. But if the stories of Bruce Hardy and Jack Rosser lead us to think badly of the British system of rationing health care, we should remind ourselves that the U.S. system also results in people going without life-saving treatment -- it just does so less visibly. Pharmaceutical manufacturers often charge much more for drugs in the United States than they charge for the same drugs in Britain, where they know that a higher price would put the drug outside the cost-effectiveness limits set by NICE. American patients, even if they are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, often cannot afford the copayments for drugs. That's rationing too, by ability to pay. 
 Dr. Art Kellermann, associate dean for public policy at Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, recently wrote of a woman who came into his emergency room in critical condition because a blood vessel had burst in her brain. She was uninsured and had chosen to buy food for her children instead of spending money on her blood-pressure medicine. In the emergency room, she received excellent high-tech medical care, but by the time she got there, it was too late to save her. 
 A New York Times report on the high costs of some drugs illustrates the problem. Chuck Stauffer, an Oregon farmer, found that his prescription-drug insurance left him to pay $5,500 for his first 42 days of Temodar, a drug used to treat brain tumors, and $1,700 a month after that. For Medicare patients drug costs can be even higher, because Medicare can require a copayment of 25 percent of the cost of the drug. For Gleevec, a drug that is effective against some forms of leukemia and some gastrointestinal tumors, that one-quarter of the cost can run to $40,000 a year. 
 In Britain, everyone has health insurance. In the U.S., some 45 million do not, and nor are they entitled to any health care at all, unless they can get themselves to an emergency room. Hospitals are prohibited from turning away anyone who will be endangered by being refused treatment. But even in emergency rooms, people without health insurance may receive less health care than those with insurance. Joseph Doyle, a professor of economics at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., studied the records of people in Wisconsin who were injured in severe automobile accidents and had no choice but to go to the hospital. He estimated that those who had no health insurance received 20 percent less care and had a death rate 37 percent higher than those with health insurance. This difference held up even when those without health insurance were compared with those without automobile insurance, and with those on Medicaid -- groups with whom they share some characteristics that might affect treatment. The lack of insurance seems to be what caused the greater number of deaths. 
 When the media feature someone like Bruce Hardy or Jack Rosser, we readily relate to individuals who are harmed by a government agency's decision to limit the cost of health care. But we tend not to hear about -- and thus don't identify with -- the particular individuals who die in emergency rooms because they have no health insurance. This ''identifiable victim'' effect, well documented by psychologists, creates a dangerous bias in our thinking. Doyle's figures suggest that if those Wisconsin accident victims without health insurance had received equivalent care to those with it, the additional health care would have cost about $220,000 for each life saved. Those who died were on average around 30 years old and could have been expected to live for at least another 40 years; this means that had they survived their accidents, the cost per extra year of life would have been no more than $5,500 -- a small fraction of the $49,000 that NICE recommends the British National Health Service should be ready to pay to give a patient an extra year of life. If the U.S. system spent less on expensive treatments for those who, with or without the drugs, have at most a few months to live, it would be better able to save the lives of more people who, if they get the treatment they need, might live for several decades.
 Estimates of the number of U.S. deaths caused annually by the absence of universal health insurance go as high as 20,000. One study concluded that in the age group 55 to 64 alone, more than 13,000 extra deaths a year may be attributed to the lack of insurance coverage. But the estimates vary because Americans without health insurance are more likely, for example, to smoke than Americans with health insurance, and sorting out the role that the lack of insurance plays is difficult. Richard Kronick, a professor at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, cautiously concludes from his own study that there is little evidence to suggest that extending health insurance to all Americans would have a large effect on the number of deaths in the United States. That doesn't mean that it wouldn't; we simply don't know if it would.
 In any case, it isn't only uninsured Americans who can't afford treatment. President Obama has spoken about his mother, who died from ovarian cancer in 1995. The president said that in the last weeks of her life, his mother ''was spending too much time worrying about whether her health insurance would cover her bills'' -- an experience, the president went on to say, that his mother shared with millions of other Americans. It is also an experience more common in the United States than in other developed countries. A recent Commonwealth Fund study led by Cathy Schoen and Robin Osborn surveyed adults with chronic illness in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Far more Americans reported forgoing health care because of cost. More than half (54 percent) reported not filling a prescription, not visiting a doctor when sick or not getting recommended care. In comparison, in the United Kingdom the figure was 13 percent, and in the Netherlands, only 7 percent. Even among Americans with insurance, 43 percent reported that cost was a problem that had limited the treatment they received. According to a 2007 study led by David Himmelstein, more than 60 percent of all bankruptcies are related to illness, with many of these specifically caused by medical bills, even among those who have health insurance. In Canada the incidence of bankruptcy related to illness is much lower. 
 When a Washington Post journalist asked Daniel Zemel, a Washington rabbi, what he thought about federal agencies putting a dollar value on human life, the rabbi cited a Jewish teaching explaining that if you put one human life on one side of a scale, and you put the rest of the world on the other side, the scale is balanced equally. Perhaps that is how those who resist health care rationing think. But we already put a dollar value on human life. If the Department of Transportation, for example, followed rabbinical teachings it would exhaust its entire budget on road safety. Fortunately the department sets a limit on how much it is willing to pay to save one human life. In 2008 that limit was $5.8 million. Other government agencies do the same. Last year the Consumer Product Safety Commission considered a proposal to make mattresses less likely to catch fire. Information from the industry suggested that the new standard would cost $343 million to implement, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission calculated that it would save 270 lives a year -- and since it valued a human life at around $5 million, that made the new standard a good value. If we are going to have consumer-safety regulation at all, we need some idea of how much safety is worth buying. Like health care bureaucrats, consumer-safety bureaucrats sometimes decide that saving a human life is not worth the expense. Twenty years ago, the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, examined a proposal for installing seat belts in all school buses. It estimated that doing so would save, on average, one life per year, at a cost of $40 million. After that, support for the proposal faded away. So why is it that those who accept that we put a price on life when it comes to consumer safety refuse to accept it when it comes to health care?
 Of course, it's one thing to accept that there's a limit to how much we should spend to save a human life, and another to set that limit. The dollar value that bureaucrats place on a generic human life is intended to reflect social values, as revealed in our behavior. It is the answer to the question ''How much are you willing to pay to save your life?'' -- except that, of course, if you asked that question of people who were facing death, they would be prepared to pay almost anything to save their lives. So instead, economists note how much people are prepared to pay to reduce the risk that they will die. How much will people pay for air bags in a car, for instance? Once you know how much they will pay for a specified reduction in risk, you multiply the amount that people are willing to pay by how much the risk has been reduced, and then you know, or so the theory goes, what value people place on their lives. Suppose that there is a 1 in 100,000 chance that an air bag in my car will save my life, and that I would pay $50 -- but no more than that -- for an air bag. Then it looks as if I value my life at $50 x 100,000, or $5 million. 
 The theory sounds good, but in practice it has problems. We are not good at taking account of differences between very small risks, so if we are asked how much we would pay to reduce a risk of dying from 1 in 1,000,000 to 1 in 10,000,000, we may give the same answer as we would if asked how much we would pay to reduce the risk from 1 in 500,000 to 1 in 10,000,000. Hence multiplying what we would pay to reduce the risk of death by the reduction in risk lends an apparent mathematical precision to the outcome of the calculation -- the supposed value of a human life -- that our intuitive responses to the questions cannot support. Nevertheless this approach to setting a value on a human life is at least closer to what we really believe -- and to what we should believe -- than dramatic pronouncements about the infinite value of every human life, or the suggestion that we cannot distinguish between the value of a single human life and the value of a million human lives, or even of the rest of the world. Though such feel-good claims may have some symbolic value in particular circumstances, to take them seriously and apply them -- for instance, by leaving it to chance whether we save one life or a billion -- would be deeply unethical.
 Governments implicitly place a dollar value on a human life when they decide how much is to be spent on health care programs and how much on other public goods that are not directed toward saving lives. The task of health care bureaucrats is then to get the best value for the resources they have been allocated. It is the familiar comparative exercise of getting the most bang for your buck. Sometimes that can be relatively easy to decide. If two drugs offer the same benefits and have similar risks of side effects, but one is much more expensive than the other, only the cheaper one should be provided by the public health care program. That the benefits and the risks of side effects are similar is a scientific matter for experts to decide after calling for submissions and examining them. That is the bread-and-butter work of units like NICE. But the benefits may vary in ways that defy straightforward comparison. We need a common unit for measuring the goods achieved by health care. Since we are talking about comparing different goods, the choice of unit is not merely a scientific or economic question but an ethical one.
 As a first take, we might say that the good achieved by health care is the number of lives saved. But that is too crude. The death of a teenager is a greater tragedy than the death of an 85-year-old, and this should be reflected in our priorities. We can accommodate that difference by calculating the number of life-years saved, rather than simply the number of lives saved. If a teenager can be expected to live another 70 years, saving her life counts as a gain of 70 life-years, whereas if a person of 85 can be expected to live another 5 years, then saving the 85-year-old will count as a gain of only 5 life-years. That suggests that saving one teenager is equivalent to saving 14 85-year-olds. These are, of course, generic teenagers and generic 85-year-olds. It's easy to say, ''What if the teenager is a violent criminal and the 85-year-old is still working productively?'' But just as emergency rooms should leave criminal justice to the courts and treat assailants and victims alike, so decisions about the allocation of health care resources should be kept separate from judgments about the moral character or social value of individuals.
 Health care does more than save lives: it also reduces pain and suffering. How can we compare saving a person's life with, say, making it possible for someone who was confined to bed to return to an active life? We can elicit people's values on that too. One common method is to describe medical conditions to people -- let's say being a quadriplegic -- and tell them that they can choose between 10 years in that condition or some smaller number of years without it. If most would prefer, say, 10 years as a quadriplegic to 4 years of nondisabled life, but would choose 6 years of nondisabled life over 10 with quadriplegia, but have difficulty deciding between 5 years of nondisabled life or 10 years with quadriplegia, then they are, in effect, assessing life with quadriplegia as half as good as nondisabled life. (These are hypothetical figures, chosen to keep the math simple, and not based on any actual surveys.) If that judgment represents a rough average across the population, we might conclude that restoring to nondisabled life two people who would otherwise be quadriplegics is equivalent in value to saving the life of one person, provided the life expectancies of all involved are similar. 
 This is the basis of the quality-adjusted life-year, or QALY, a unit designed to enable us to compare the benefits achieved by different forms of health care. The QALY has been used by economists working in health care for more than 30 years to compare the cost-effectiveness of a wide variety of medical procedures and, in some countries, as part of the process of deciding which medical treatments will be paid for with public money. If a reformed U.S. health care system explicitly accepted rationing, as I have argued it should, QALYs could play a similar role in the U.S.
 Some will object that this discriminates against people with disabilities. If we return to the hypothetical assumption that a year with quadriplegia is valued at only half as much as a year without it, then a treatment that extends the lives of people without disabilities will be seen as providing twice the value of one that extends, for a similar period, the lives of quadriplegics. That clashes with the idea that all human lives are of equal value. The problem, however, does not lie with the concept of the quality-adjusted life-year, but with the judgment that, if faced with 10 years as a quadriplegic, one would prefer a shorter lifespan without a disability. Disability advocates might argue that such judgments, made by people without disabilities, merely reflect the ignorance and prejudice of people without disabilities when they think about people with disabilities. We should, they will very reasonably say, ask quadriplegics themselves to evaluate life with quadriplegia. If we do that, and we find that quadriplegics would not give up even one year of life as a quadriplegic in order to have their disability cured, then the QALY method does not justify giving preference to procedures that extend the lives of people without disabilities over procedures that extend the lives of people with disabilities.
 This method of preserving our belief that everyone has an equal right to life is, however, a double-edged sword. If life with quadriplegia is as good as life without it, there is no health benefit to be gained by curing it. That implication, no doubt, would have been vigorously rejected by someone like Christopher Reeve, who, after being paralyzed in an accident, campaigned for more research into ways of overcoming spinal-cord injuries. Disability advocates, it seems, are forced to choose between insisting that extending their lives is just as important as extending the lives of people without disabilities, and seeking public support for research into a cure for their condition. 
 The QALY tells us to do what brings about the greatest health benefit, irrespective of where that benefit falls. Usually, for a given quantity of resources, we will do more good if we help those who are worst off, because they have the greatest unmet needs. But occasionally some conditions will be both very severe and very expensive to treat. A QALY approach may then lead us to give priority to helping others who are not so badly off and whose conditions are less expensive to treat. I don't find it unfair to give the same weight to the interests of those who are well off as we give to those who are much worse off, but if there is a social consensus that we should give priority to those who are worse off, we can modify the QALY approach so that it gives greater weight to benefits that accrue to those who are, on the QALY scale, worse off than others. 
 The QALY approach does not even try to measure the benefits that health care brings in addition to the improvement in health itself. Emotionally, we feel that the fact that Jack Rosser is the father of a young child makes a difference to the importance of extending his life, but his parental status is irrelevant to a QALY assessment of the health care gains that Sutent would bring him. Whether decisions about allocating health care resources should take such personal circumstances into account isn't easy to decide. Not to do so makes the standard inflexible, but taking personal factors into account increases the scope for subjective -- and prejudiced -- judgments. 
 The QALY is not a perfect measure of the good obtained by health care, but its defenders can support it in the same way that Winston Churchill defended democracy as a form of government: it is the worst method of allocating health care, except for all the others. If it isn't possible to provide everyone with all beneficial treatments, what better way do we have of deciding what treatments people should get than by comparing the QALYs gained with the expense of the treatments? 
 Will Americans allow their government, either directly or through an independent agency like NICE, to decide which treatments are sufficiently cost-effective to be provided at public expense and which are not? They might, under two conditions: first, that the option of private health insurance remains available, and second, that they are able to see, in their own pocket, the full cost of not rationing health care. 
 Rationing public health care limits free choice if private health insurance is prohibited. But many countries combine free national health insurance with optional private insurance. Australia, where I've spent most of my life and raised a family, is one. The U.S. could do something similar. This would mean extending Medicare to the entire population, irrespective of age, but without Medicare's current policy that allows doctors wide latitude in prescribing treatments for eligible patients. Instead, Medicare for All, as we might call it, should refuse to pay where the cost per QALY is extremely high. (On the other hand, Medicare for All would not require more than a token copayment for drugs that are cost-effective.) The extension of Medicare could be financed by a small income-tax levy, for those who pay income tax -- in Australia the levy is 1.5 percent of taxable income. (There's an extra 1 percent surcharge for those with high incomes and no private insurance. Those who earn too little to pay income tax would be carried at no cost to themselves.) Those who want to be sure of receiving every treatment that their own privately chosen physicians recommend, regardless of cost, would be free to opt out of Medicare for All as long as they can demonstrate that they have sufficient private health insurance to avoid becoming a burden on the community if they fall ill. Alternatively, they might remain in Medicare for All but take out supplementary insurance for health care that Medicare for All does not cover. Every American will have a right to a good standard of health care, but no one will have a right to unrationed health care. Those who opt for unrationed health care will know exactly how much it costs them.
 One nal comment. It is common for opponents of health care rationing to point to Canada and Britain as examples of where we might end up if we get ''socialized medicine.'' On a blog on Fox News earlier this year, the conservative writer John Lott wrote, ''Americans should ask Canadians and Brits -- people who have long suffered from rationing -- how happy they are with central government decisions on eliminating 'unnecessary' health care.'' There is no particular reason that the United States should copy the British or Canadian forms of universal coverage, rather than one of the different arrangements that have developed in other industrialized nations, some of which may be better. But as it happens, last year the Gallup organization did ask Canadians and Brits, and people in many different countries, if they have confidence in ''health care or medical systems'' in their country. In Canada, 73 percent answered this question affirmatively. Coincidentally, an identical percentage of Britons gave the same answer. In the United States, despite spending much more, per person, on health care, the figure was only 56 percent.

HEADLINE: DEFYING SLUMP, 13 STATES INSURE MORE CHILDREN

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Despite budgets ravaged by the recession, at least 13 states have invested millions of dollars this year to cover 250,000 more children with subsidized government health insurance. 
 The expansions have come in the five months since Congress and President Obama used the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program to vastly increase its funding and encourage states to increase enrollment. Although the federal government covers the vast majority of the cost, states set their own eligibility levels and must decide whether to spend state money in order to draw even more from Washington.
 In addition to increasing income eligibility levels, three states are dropping requirements that legal immigrants wait five years before joining the program, a step newly permitted by the federal legislation. Others have extended coverage to pregnant women or streamlined enrollment and eligibility procedures.
 The states' willingness to spend, even under excruciating budget pressures, is a measure of the support for expanding health care coverage to the uninsured as Congress and the administration intensify their negotiations over a new federal health care bill. 
 But a number of states decided that their depleted coffers did not allow them to insure additional children, even as a minority partner. Several either deferred previously scheduled eligibility expansions or saw their legislatures defeat efforts to broaden coverage.
 In Arizona, only opposition from Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, prevented lawmakers in her own party from narrowing eligibility. And in California, where Democratic legislators and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, are struggling to close the country's largest budget gap, the state on Friday imposed a freeze on new enrollments.
 California officials estimate that up to 350,000 eligible children may be relegated to a waiting list, and that attrition could lower enrollment by 250,000 by June. If money is not found, the losses there might overwhelm the cumulative gains in other states.
 Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the potential for major reductions in California was ''a huge concern.'' But over all, she said, the Obama administration was ''very pleased that even in what are some of the worst budget times in a very long time, children's health insurance continues to be an absolute top priority.''
 The Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, has been politically popular since its enactment in 1997 because it primarily benefits working families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance.
 In many states, eligibility expansions have passed with solid bipartisan support. In one of her final acts as governor of Kansas in April, Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, signed a two-year expansion worth $4.4 million that had been approved by her overwhelmingly Republican Legislature.
 The broadening of eligibility has made a profound difference for parents like Vicky and Dewayne McIntyre of Yakima, Wash. When their state lifted the income cutoff for its program to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (or $54,930 for their family of three) from 250 percent (or $45,775), the McIntyres learned that their 8-year-old daughter, Sarah, had become eligible for the first time.
 Sarah, who endured lung surgery at 3 and heart surgery at 6 and now has asthma, had been uninsured for a year. ''We were into credit card debt and payday loans,'' said Ms. McIntyre, 41, who works part time in a store to supplement her husband's income as a welder. ''Her medicine at one point was $880 a month, and we had to pay cash, so we were struggling. It is such a relief now that I can just take her to the doctor if I need to and get her medicine.'' 
 The federal legislation, which extended the program through 2013, provided $32.8 billion in new financing over that period, paid with an increase in tobacco taxes. On the day Mr. Obama signed the bill, calling it a ''down payment'' on universal coverage, he also rescinded a Bush administration directive that effectively made it impossible for states to raise their eligibility limits above 250 percent of the poverty level.
 The new law allows states to provide coverage to children from families living at up to three times the poverty level. States can set thresholds higher if they wish, but will be reimbursed by the federal government at a lower rate -- the same paid for Medicaid recipients. A primary incentive for states to expand coverage is that Washington, on average, pays 70 percent of the cost of CHIP, compared with only 57 percent for Medicaid.
 Some states, including New York and New Jersey, were already enrolling children above three times the poverty level, but the federal legislation and the rescinding of the Bush directive made it possible for about 40 states to broaden eligibility.
 The reauthorization of CHIP concluded a bruising two-year political battle. President George W. Bush twice vetoed Democratic measures to expand the program in 2007, depicting the legislation as a stalking horse for government-run health care. Congressional Democrats sustained it through temporary extensions and took full political advantage of Mr. Bush's stance during the 2008 campaign. 
 CHIP, which served about 7.4 million people in 2008, is credited with helping reduce the number of uninsured children by 2.5 million over its first decade. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the revitalized program would eventually reduce the number of uninsured youths by an additional 4.1 million.
 Of the 8.2 million children who remain uninsured, about two-thirds are eligible for either CHIP or the much larger Medicaid program but have not been enrolled, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. This year's reauthorization includes $100 million in grants to help states find and sign up eligible children. 
 Forty-eight states faced budget shortfalls this year, totaling $121.2 billion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But in those that have managed to expand eligibility, governors and legislators said they viewed CHIP as a cost-effective investment.
 ''In a downturn, the number of people who need the safety net increases,'' said Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, a Democrat, whose state levied $600 million in fees on hospitals, some of which will be used to cover an additional 21,000 children.
 In Alabama, Democratic legislators overrode the veto of Gov. Bob Riley, a Republican, to extend coverage to 14,000 children at an additional cost to the state of $8 million.
 ''Our economy is tough here,'' said State Senator Roger H. Bedford Jr., a Democrat. ''But our decision was to fund the health care needs of our children because a healthy child learns better and they don't show up at the emergency room needing acute care.'' 
 Other states expanding eligibility include Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon and West Virginia. Ohio passed a budget last week that includes an expansion, but its financing depends on the resolution of a court case.
 Illinois, New York and Wisconsin, which had been paying for expansions with state money, are now applying for federal matching funds. And many states are enacting measures to make it easier for children to enroll and stay enrolled, steps encouraged by the federal legislation.
 But Louisiana and North Carolina chose not to proceed with previously authorized expansions this year, citing a lack of revenue. And bills to either raise eligibility levels or lower premiums failed in Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, Missouri, Rhode Island and Texas. The governor of Wyoming has imposed a cap on enrollment, and New Hampshire may follow. 
 Officials in those states and others said they had little choice but to leave federal money on the table. 
 ''Michigan's hard-pressed to come up with a quarter to support a dollar's worth of expenditure,'' said Stephen W. Fitton, that state's acting Medicaid director.
 In California, the Legislature beat back Mr. Schwarzenegger's proposal to eliminate CHIP altogether but seems to have accepted the enrollment freeze.
 ''It is heartbreaking,'' said Ginny S. Puddefoot, deputy director of the agency that administers the program there. ''For those of us involved with children's health care, this is just something we never imagined we would see.''

HEADLINE: In Washington, One Bank Chief Still Holds Sway

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and LOUISE STORY; Jackie Calmes reported from Washington, and Louise Story from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, will hold a meeting of his board here in the nation's capital for the first time on Monday, with a special guest expected: the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. 
 Mr. Emanuel's appearance would underscore the pull of Mr. Dimon, who amid the disgrace of his industry has emerged as President Obama's favorite banker, and in turn, the envy of his Wall Street rivals. It also reflects a good return on what Mr. Dimon has labeled his company's ''seventh line of business'' -- government relations.
 The business of better influencing Washington, begun in late 2007, was jump-started just as the financial crisis hit and the capital displaced New York as the nation's money center. Then Mr. Obama's election brought to power Chicago Democrats well-known to Mr. Dimon from his recent years running a bank there.
 One of them is Mr. Emanuel, who has accepted the invitation to speak to the board pending a review by the White House counsel. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, declined out of concern that he would be seen as too cozy with a company that has numerous business issues before the department, an administration official said. 
 ''It's a very nice thing for the board to have happen,'' said the chief of a major financial company. ''But you'd have to have a lot of influence to pull it off.''
 Mr. Dimon and his company enjoy a prominence in the city's K Street lobbying world that parallels their recent rise on Wall Street; JPMorgan went into the crisis stronger than most rivals and reported robust quarterly gains last week that confirmed its place at the top of the heap. 
 With the crisis, Mr. Dimon, a longtime Democratic donor, has become even more politically engaged, in the process becoming perhaps the most credible voice of a discredited industry. Other onetime giants like Citigroup and Bank of America find themselves muted as wards of the state.
 JPMorgan gave back its bailout money quickly, though like all the country's big banks it still benefits from government loan guarantees and lending facilities.
 He is ''one of the few Democratic C.E.O.'s in that line of work,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House banking committee. ''And look, he's been less impaired by failure than some of the others, so that's given him a kind of lead role.''
 Mr. Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, comes to Washington about twice a month, compared with maybe twice a year in the past. He requires senior managers to commute as well. 
 In recent months, he has met with officials including Mr. Geithner; the White House economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers; and lawmakers of both parties. He phones or e-mails Mr. Emanuel at whim. Each week, his staff gives him the names of a half-dozen public officials to call. 
 ''It's got to be a regular thing. You've got to have a few relations where people know and trust you; you can be an honest broker,'' Mr. Dimon said in an interview. ''You can't just fight everything.''
 While he has been quick to criticize the administration, JPMorgan has chosen its fights carefully, viewing his activism as a good investment, particularly as the government considers a historic rewrite of financial rules. 
 Mr. Obama has singled out Mr. Dimon for praise more than once. Yet some Democrats say Mr. Dimon can be too outspoken, and deaf to the anti-bank sentiment of the country. When he complained in a March speech about Washington's vilification of Wall Street, more than 40 House Democrats shot off a protest letter. 
 ''That was nonsense,'' Mr. Frank said. 
 Yet Mr. Dimon helped persuade Mr. Frank and Congress to ease the terms for banks, allowing JPMorgan to repay $25 billion in bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. He did so by complaining publicly and privately that JPMorgan only reluctantly took the money last year from the Bush administration to avoid stigmatizing more needy banks, and now was being hit with new limits -- on hiring skilled foreigners, executive pay and more.
 JPMorgan and the industry lost when a pro-consumer credit card bill became law. But it beat back a proposal to allow bankruptcy judges to lower the amount homeowners owe on mortgages. That victory came with a cost: JPMorgan angered Republicans by negotiating with Democrats and then enraged some Democrats when those talks collapsed. 
 But Mr. Dimon and JPMorgan are willing to bear such defeats if it translates into victory on the broader financial regulation fight that is just beginning.
 A centerpiece of that effort involves regulating the market for derivatives, which Mr. Dimon's firm dominates. While JPMorgan favors new reporting requirements for the complex financial instruments, it opposes the administration proposal to force trades onto public exchanges; doing so would likely cut into the firm's lucrative business of selling clients custom-made instruments. Like other banks, it also opposes a new consumer agency for financial products.
 Meanwhile, the company's reputation could be tarnished by investigations into the crisis. Among them, JPMorgan is under scrutiny from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for possible antitrust and securities law violations, including derivatives deals with local governments. 
 As he comes into these battles, Mr. Dimon, 53, must relish his and his company's hard-won status in both Washington and New York: For years, such pre-eminence was widely accorded to Citigroup, the financial supermarket that he helped build, and to Citigroup's former chief, Sanford I. Weill, who was Mr. Dimon's mentor and famously fired his protege in 1998. 
 Mr. Dimon's midcareer exile took him from his native New York to Chicago. There he rebuilt his career, reviving BankOne and merging it with JPMorgan in 2004 before returning to New York full time in 2007. In Chicago, he got to know the fast-rising Mr. Obama and his friends. 
 Mr. Dimon and Mr. Geithner know each other well from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Mr. Geithner was president and, as such, a JPMorgan regulator. Mr. Dimon sits on the New York Fed's board. The two men spent untold hours negotiating in 2008 when the government enlisted JPMorgan to buy some of Bear Stearns's assets and Washington Mutual to prevent their collapse. Mr. Dimon said the two had spoken by phone perhaps 10 times this year.
 A recent conversation involved their impasse over the warrants the government received from JPMorgan last fall in return for the bailout money. When the bank insisted on a lower price, the two sides agreed to let the Treasury auction the warrants. Even then, Mr. Dimon called Mr. Geithner to argue that the government's valuation was wrong, according to administration and company officials.
 But Mr. Geithner reiterated that the auction would protect the Treasury from any criticism that it had cut a backroom deal. 
 Mr. Emanuel was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton when he met Mr. Dimon, and briefly entertained a job overture from him at Citigroup. 
 When Mr. Dimon was fired, he got a supportive call from Mr. Emanuel, who recalled his own firing early in the Clinton years and how he worked his way back into the inner circle. 
 ''The bond here is both of us lost at some place in our career and both rebuilt,'' Mr. Emanuel said in an interview. Now, he added, ''He's not afraid to express his opinions and I'm not afraid to express mine.'' 
 He recalled that Mr. Dimon once phoned to protest the anti-business populism taking hold as voters tired of bailouts, and snapped, ''Washington doesn't get it!''
 ''You guys don't get the anger out there,'' Mr. Emanuel replied. ''Jamie, you're asking the American people to bail out the industry. And if they're going to bail out the industry, it's got to change its habits.'' 
 Another Obama associate is on JPMorgan's payroll. Mr. Dimon hired William M. Daley, a former commerce secretary and Chicago powerbroker, in 2004 as vice chairman and head of Midwest operations. Since 2007, Mr. Daley has overseen global government relations.
 It was at that time that Mr. Dimon assessed his own performance for his board and gave himself a ''D'' for effort in Washington. He subsequently revamped the firm's government affairs office, mindful of Democrats' ascendance: They had won control of Congress and were favored to seize the White House in 2008.
 Rick Lazio, a Republican former congressman, was replaced as head of government relations, reporting to Mr. Daley, with a wired Democrat: Peter L. Scher, a former official in the Senate, the Commerce Department and the trade representative's office.
 Despite his Chicago connections, Mr. Dimon said he did not know Mr. Obama well while he was there. 
 He met the future president during Mr. Obama's 2004 Senate run, at a living room discussion with about 10 pro-business Democrats, and sent his campaign $2,000, the maximum. 
 Now that Mr. Obama is in the White House, Mr. Dimon has been prominent when the president wants to talk to big business.
 During one such meeting in late March, as Citigroup's chairman, Richard D. Parsons, was trying to explain banks and lending, the president interrupted with a quip: ''All right, I'll talk to Jamie.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Business Allies, Clinton Connects With India's Billionaires

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India 

 BODY:
India's booming economy has turned some business executives into rock stars. So it was perhaps not surprising that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton -- a celebrity in her own right -- would stop first in India's commercial capital for a power breakfast with bankers and billionaires.
 Mrs. Clinton was to go to New Delhi on Sunday for meetings and ceremonies the next day with government leaders. But she began her visit to India, the first by a top official from the Obama administration, by discussing climate change, education and health care with private-sector potentates. 
 Flanked by Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $19.5 billion) and Ratan Tata (estimated net worth: $1 billion), Mrs. Clinton heard ideas from seven other guests about how Indian companies could provide health care, education and banking services to India's desperately poor. 
 ''You're so right, Ratan,'' Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. Tata when he explained how his Tata Group was delivering nutrients to children and young mothers through daily staples like milk. ''If we could get the nutritional status of children to improve, it would solve so many problems.''
 The purpose of her visit, Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference on Saturday, was to ''broaden and deepen'' dialogue between the United States and India. Given the potential for friction in the issues that face the two countries -- climate change, trade and the insurgency in Pakistan -- Mrs. Clinton's visit with business leaders was more than a sidelight.
 The United States is clearly hoping that Indian business will help bridge potential gaps between the two countries. 
 Mr. Ambani, for example, proposed that Indians and Americans work together to develop ''clean technologies'' that would reduce carbon emissions. The Indian government is resisting the Obama administration's push for a global treaty that would mandate cuts in carbon emissions, arguing that developing economies deserve to grow without compulsory constraints.
 ''Rather than argue about who has a right to pollute,'' Mr. Ambani said, ''we will move forward to create institutions.'' 
 As the richest man in India, Mr. Ambani is influential. But he may soon face his own problems with the United States. His conglomerate, Reliance Industries, operates refineries that sell fuel to Iran. That could make him vulnerable to sanctions against Iran being proposed in Congress.
 The choice of Mumbai as Mrs. Clinton's first port of call was steeped in symbolism for another reason: It offered her a platform to speak out against the coordinated terrorist attacks here last November that killed 173 people and wounded more than 300.
 Mrs. Clinton told an Indian broadcaster, Times Now, that she stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, one of two hotels that had been attacked, partly as a ''rebuke'' of the terrorists. 
 Last week, she encouraged India to support Pakistan's effort to stem a radical insurgency in Pakistan, a request that may unsettle some Indians. India and the United States blamed a Pakistan-based militant group for the Mumbai attacks, and India has long complained that Pakistan is not serious enough in cracking down on militants.
 Mrs. Clinton met with the hotel's general manager, who lost his wife and child in the attack, as well as other employees, before signing a condolence book. 
 ''Just as India supported America on 9/11, these events are seared in our memory,'' she said at the news conference, adding that terrorism is ''global, it is ruthless, it is nihilistic, and it must be stopped.''
 Mrs. Clinton delivered her message on an outdoor terrace at the hotel that had been littered with bloodied bodies during the siege. Just before the news conference, the Indian police urged her not to speak there for security reasons, but she resisted.
 The rest of her day was devoted to two longtime interests: women's issues and education.
 She visited a shop run by the Self Employed Women's Association, a cooperative of 1 million women who make and sell embroidery and other products using microfinance methods. In 1995, Mrs. Clinton visited the group as the first lady; she has stayed in touch since then.
 Inevitably, some of these encounters are more successful than others. In the category of less successful was a panel discussion on education at a Jesuit college, at which Mrs. Clinton appeared with Aamir Khan, a prominent Indian film star who campaigns for better teaching.
 While Mrs. Clinton offered an earnest discussion of teaching standards in Arkansas, Mr. Khan appeared to condone dropping out of school to pursue entertainment careers. 
 Mrs. Clinton appeared unfazed, closing with a quote from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who, she noted, ''of course learned so much from Gandhi.''

HEADLINE: First Lady Steps Into Policy Spotlight in Debate on Health Care

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
She has become one of the Obama administration's most visible surrogates on health care, announcing the release of $851 million in federal financing for health clinics, calling for tougher nutritional standards in the government's school lunch program and urging Democrats to rally around the president's efforts to revamp health care.
 The high-profile emissary? Not Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary, or Nancy-Ann DeParle, the White House health policy adviser. It is the first lady, Michelle Obama. 
 ''We're at a critical juncture in the debate about health care in this country,'' Mrs. Obama said at a clinic here in June. ''The current system is economically unsustainable, and I don't have to tell any of you that. And despite having the most expensive health care system in the world, we're not necessarily healthier for it.''
 After several months of focusing on her family, her garden and inspiring young people, Mrs. Obama is stepping into more wonkish terrain. She is toughening her message and talking more openly about influencing public policy as she works to integrate her efforts more closely with those of policy makers in the West Wing.
 In June, Mrs. Obama traveled to San Francisco with Melody C. Barnes, the president's domestic policy adviser, for the start of the administration's initiative to promote volunteerism. 
 A week later, she went to a Washington clinic with the director of the Health Resources and Services Administration to announce the release of stimulus money for clinics. This month, her policy director joined a new interagency working group, including health, agriculture and housing officials, that will develop policy, legislation and public outreach to combat obesity. 
 While her efforts are most visible in the health care arena, Mrs. Obama is also focusing on other issues. 
 In May, she convened a meeting -- with James L. Jones, the president's national security adviser; Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget chief, among others -- to consider new policies and programs to help military families. Her staff is also working with nonprofit, corporate and philanthropic groups to help rally resources to support such families. 
 Mrs. Obama's aides say the substantive speeches and increased coordination with the West Wing reflect the first lady's determination to have an impact on the issues she cares about. 
 ''The listening portion of this is over,'' said Camille Johnston, her communications director. ''Let's make sure that we're having an impact and delivering things as well.''
 But Mrs. Obama, a Harvard-educated lawyer and former hospital executive, is still treading cautiously as she fleshes out her priorities: promoting healthy living and community service and supporting military and working families. 
 Susan Sher, the first lady's new chief of staff, emphasized that Mrs. Obama would not testify before Congress or argue the merits of competing health care plans. Indeed, the first lady did not stand alongside her husband in the White House last week when he praised the Senate health committee for approving an overhaul of the health care system. 
 Mrs. Obama has chosen instead to deliver her recent remarks in more traditional settings for a first lady -- at a clinic, a playground and in the White House garden. Her aides say she will promote policy, not make it, and will continue to concentrate on children and families. They say they do not expect her to be accused of overstepping her bounds as Hillary Rodham Clinton was when she tried to remake health care as the first lady. 
 Jocelyn Frye, Mrs. Obama's policy director, said the first lady wanted to ''draw the connection between this massive conversation that's happening about health reform and what's really happening to people on the ground.''
 Mrs. Obama's advisers say this is a natural progression. After settling her family into the White House, the first lady could more easily turn to the garden and then a discussion of obesity, the importance of preventive care and corresponding government policies and legislation, they say.
 The shift also coincides with Mrs. Obama's decision in June to choose Ms. Sher, her longtime friend, to replace Jackie Norris as her chief of staff. At the time of that announcement, Ms. Sher, who was Mrs. Obama's boss at the University of Chicago Medical Center, was working on health care issues as an associate counsel to the president.
 Since then, as her husband has worked on health care, Mrs. Obama has peppered her speeches with statistics and references to health-related legislation, like the coming reauthorization of child nutrition programs.
 She has repeatedly cited the costs of preventable illnesses like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure to the nation's health care system ($120 billion a year, she says) and the impact of poor diet on children. (''Nearly a third of the children in this country are either overweight or obese, and a third will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lifetime,'' she said. ''Those numbers are unacceptable.'') 
 She sent out a mass e-mail message to Democrats across the country, urging them to volunteer to improve health care services and ''to make a difference as we work to reform America's health care system.'' 
 And while she has often focused on motherhood, gardening and other domestic subjects in interviews, she took on a thorny policy issue last month: the prospects for a health care overhaul in an Obama administration. 
 ''There are going to be tough choices that have to be made,'' Mrs. Obama said on the ABC program ''Good Morning America,'' emphasizing that ''no system is going to be perfect.''
 Still, Mrs. Obama said she believed that the president would succeed where the Clintons did not. The country ''has moved to another point in time,'' she said. ''More and more people are ready for this kind of reform.''

HEADLINE: For Alaska, a Remarkably Tumultuous Year

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: WASILLA, Alaska 

 BODY:
Politics and parody converge in the new Alaska. Right there on Wasilla Lake not long ago, in clear view of the former residence of Gov. Sarah Palin, two Russian pastors dipped seven Russian teenagers into the water as their mothers and fathers sang Russian hymns on a brilliant morning.
 Tina Fey was not involved. It was a real live baptism ceremony for Emanuel Evangelical Church, one of a handful of churches attended by Russian immigrants here in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. It seems that if Ms. Palin could not, in fact, see Russia from her house, she might at least have seen its people. 
 ''Really?'' said one of the pastors, Anatoliy Senyak, when told that the home Ms. Palin lived in while she was mayor here was just across the water. He was amused at the comic potential of the moment, but quickly emphasized that his congregation did not get ''physically'' involved in politics.
 ''Our role here,'' he said, ''is just to pray for the government.''
 It has been a remarkably tumultuous year here as Alaska celebrates its 50th anniversary of statehood. Sure, Ms. Palin roared out of sub-Arctic obscurity, but there was more: state lawmakers went to prison for corruption and then, in some cases, got out; a sitting United States senator was found guilty of a felony, at least temporarily; the ultimate measure of government stability here, the price of oil, went into freefall, then rose again.
 ''Will things return to normal?'' said Scott Goldsmith, a professor of economics at the University of Alaska Anchorage's Institute for Social and Economic Research. ''The thing is, they've never been normal up here.''
 As Ms. Palin climbed onto the national stage last August, the man who had long been the state's most prominent politician, Ted Stevens, was headed for the door. Mr. Stevens, the longest-serving Republican in Senate history, lost his re-election bid in November after being found guilty in October of not disclosing gifts he had received. Yet on April 1, the Justice Department moved to drop the charges, citing errors by prosecutors in the case. A week later, while not exactly exonerating Mr. Stevens, a judge threw out the conviction. 
 Like Ms. Palin's resignation, it was an exit with an asterisk. 
 ''It is a happy April Fool's Day,'' Mr. Stevens wrote in an e-mail message that day to his former law partner in Anchorage, Jack Roderick, who shared the message with a reporter last week. ''As an old fool, I enjoy it more than anyone.''
 All of this came as a clean new narrative seemed to be taking hold: a younger generation of Alaskans, led by Ms. Palin, was taking power as the state moved to diversify its economy away from oil production and federal spending. Alaska would raise its profile by portraying its gas and oil reserves as an answer to national energy needs. It would establish itself not as a quirky outpost, but as the ''microcosm of America'' that Ms. Palin insisted it was during her run for vice president.
 Trouble is, regardless of the message, the math has not changed.
 ''The picture remains the same as it has been for decades -- overdependence on oil,'' Pat Galvin, Ms. Palin's commissioner of revenue, told a business group in Anchorage the week after the governor announced her resignation, effective July 26. 
 Oil production revenue and taxes account for 88 percent of current state general fund revenue. For years, the price of oil has been relatively stable; since last summer, however, it has been all over the place, forcing the state to draw more than $2 billion out of savings to balance its budget. Even as prices are now rising, production in Alaska is in permanent decline.
 Mr. Galvin told the business group, ''We're floating into a whole different world where we don't know where we're going one day to the next.'' 
 Not long after Ms. Palin was chosen as Senator John McCain's Republican running mate, statewide pride was accompanied by backlash. (Alaska has long sent mixed signals about what it wants from the rest of America. Federal money? Yes, please. Federal regulations? No, thank you.) Many people said the state had been fundamentally altered by the intrusion of so much national scrutiny. Since her resignation announcement, Ms. Palin has referred to the din surrounding her as ''the new normal in Alaska.'' 
 That, of course, implies that there was an old normal. 
 On Independence Day, at the same waterfront pavilion in Wasilla where the Russian churchgoers would later hold their summer baptism ceremony, Eddie Burke, a local radio talk show host and a passionate supporter of Ms. Palin, rallied several hundred people for a so-called tea party to protest taxes and government spending.
 A stuffed ''liberal politician'' was tarred and feathered. A woman carried a sign: ''I voted for Palin. I'm a 'right-wing extremist.' '' At the end of his speech, Mr. Burke raised his voice with a flourish: ''Stand up, Wasilla! Keep fighting! Stand up, Alaska! Keep fighting! America is worth it!''
 Off to the side, LaDonna Hale Curzon was quietly interviewing people for her Web site, SarahPalinRadio.com. Ms. Curzon, who lives in Alexandria, Va., said that she was visiting Wasilla for the first time and that she had been lucky enough to meet Ms. Palin just days before her stunning announcement on July 3. (''She complimented me on my shoes,'' Ms. Curzon said.)
 Asked how it felt to have made the long trip only to learn that the state's political foundation was shifting once again, Ms. Curzon said, ''Confused; it was totally out of the blue.''
 ''But you have to step back,'' she added. ''This thing will unfold with time.''

HEADLINE: Windfalls for Bankers, Resentments for the Rest

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
There was a time in this country when a company reporting a few billion in earnings could count its money while basking in polite, reverent applause.
 That time ended Tuesday.
 It was the morning that Goldman Sachs reported net income of $3.44 billion, a number that surprised even analysts who follow investment banking. JPMorgan Chase came two days later with news that it had earned $2.7 billion in the second quarter, even more than it earned in the same period last year, before the economy had a cardiac infarction.
 Then on Friday, Citigroup and Bank of America -- two of the great basket cases of the meltdown -- reported outstanding numbers, too. 
 All of these companies were beneficiaries of gargantuan government bailouts, in assorted forms and varied sums, but if they assumed they'd hear bravos for prompt paybacks and quick turnarounds, they were in for a shock. At a time when so many people are struggling with foreclosures and are either unemployed or worried about losing a job, these earnings were bound to stir up some basic questions of fairness.
 And along with those questions, a rebirth, perhaps, of a type of anger that hasn't been widespread for a while: good old class resentment.
 It's making a comeback. As recently as April, President Obama could say at a news conference at a Group of 20 summit meeting, that Americans ''don't resent the rich; they want to be rich,'' without raising eyebrows. Today, the first half of that comment is starting to sound like a stretch. And when it comes to people who earned their fortunes through the financial industry, it seems wrong.
 Something closer to the current zeitgeist was captured last week by Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News commentator, who likened Goldman Sachs bankers to pigs during a scathing segment on his TV show. ''You've got to make an example of the big boy,'' he fumed in a rant about the company's tax-avoidance methods, suggesting Goldman ought to be punished for failing to cough up its fair share of taxes. ''And this is the big boy.''
 Jon Stewart went the deadpan comedy route on his show this week: ''Goldman Sachs makes $3.4 billion in profit from April to June. I guess the bailouts are working. For Goldman Sachs.''
 Class resentment has waxed and waned in this country, but it is not typically a widespread, default emotion of the American middle class. This is at least in part because it's an article of faith here that through some combination of hard work and luck, you might get rich, too. And why abuse, soak or heap scorn upon a group you at least have a theoretical chance of joining?
 The recession -- with its yawning gap between the bonus class on the one hand and the foreclosed upon and newly jobless on the other -- is changing that. It's not merely that Americans have, at least temporarily, abandoned the hope that they'll earn scads of money. It's the widespread sense that winners in this economy are produced by a game that's rigged.
 Which is why the response to last week's earnings bonanza has been a mix of, among other things, bafflement and anger. If these companies can return to the festivities so quickly, were they really having the near-death experience they and the government claimed? And if taxpayers risked their money when they backstopped Wall Street's misadventures, why aren't they sharing in the upside now that the party has started again? And did these companies have the time to rethink the risk culture that landed us in this jam in the first place?
 In private, Wall Street executives have questions of their own.
 Like, wait a sec -- isn't returning to profitability exactly what you wanted us to do? And if the nation's circulatory system of money is beginning to flow again, isn't that good news? Oh and by the way, we are paying you back.
 It's telling that from politicians, there's been mostly silence.
 Neither Representative Barney Frank nor Senator Chris Dodd -- respectively, the Democrats who lead the House and Senate committees that handle banks -- issued press releases about those earnings last week, according members of their staffs. Neither returned a call for this article. 
 The Obama administration, meanwhile, sounded like it was searching for the seam between cautious optimism and cautious skepticism. Mr. Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was quoted in Time magazine saying that ''the president continues to have concerns that compensation will be based on risky behavior instead of performance.''
 But class resentment can be a powerful tool in politics, and you don't need to stoke it explicitly to enjoy its upsides. House Democrats have proposed a 5.4 percent surtax on those earning more than $1 million as a means of underwriting health care reform.
 Whatever the wisdom of this idea, it is easier to imagine it catching on now that Goldman has posted its largest quarterly profit in 140 years -- enough to set aside more than $11 billion for bonuses, with the year only half over.
 Of course, taxing and tsk-tsking the rich might be gratifying, but like everything else in economics it is sure to have some unintended consequences. Already, conservative and libertarian scholars warn that if there's enough blowback against bonuses, Wall Street will simply distribute windfalls in the form of salary -- which might actually reduce incentives. Alternatively, the rich might just get better at shielding their wealth from the public.
 And don't expect the new class resentment to remain a Wall Street-only phenomenon for long. Last Monday, news broke that the ''American Idol'' host Ryan Seacrest would be paid $45 million to remain with the show for the next three years.
 With other TV and radio gigs, as well as investments in restaurants and media companies, the guy is walking the one-man-conglomerate trail blazed by Dick Clark. While Mr. Clark never inspired much hostility, a palpable irritation greeted the ''American Idol'' announcement. (Mr. Seacrest was called the ''Viscount of Vapidity'' in the widely read Deadline Hollywood Daily blog.)
 It's true, Mr. Seacrest has never seemed as benign and lovable as Dick Clark. But there is also the question of timing. If you had to announce a multimillion-dollar raise, last week was the worst week ever.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Lifestyle Cutbacks
 Show in TriBeCa
 For a relatively tiny Manhattan neighborhood filled with families and financiers, TriBeCa has found itself caught up in some of the city's most historic moments. Residents who saw their streets and buildings covered in dust after the 9/11 attack went on to see their neighborhood become one of the city's most valuable real estate markets. 
 Its Wall Street workers became some of the biggest benefactors of the recent Gilded Age. In the good years, they spent their fortunes on European summer vacations, children's birthday parties at Chelsea Piers and nannies and housekeepers.
 But many residents have watched their savings and their severance packages dry up. Peter Braus, chairman of the TriBeCa Committee of Community Board 1, a co-owner of Sierra Realty and a TriBeCa resident for a dozen years, notes that the signs of trouble are difficult to spot. Families still head to the recently expanded toy store, play in the local parks and eat in local diners. 
 But the money worries are there: The parks are filled with families who used to spend their summers away from Manhattan. Residents have mentioned cutting back on domestic help. Some higher-priced restaurants and furniture stores have closed. Mr. Braus spoke at length about the neighborhood's troubles.
 Q. How are TriBeCa residents responding to living on less?
 A. I don't get the sense that they are throwing in the towel and moving out. They're just making changes to their lifestyle. They're taking less extravagant trips. The typical weekends, you see more people around. They would have gone away for the whole summer. People who were going to Europe are now renting a house at the Jersey Shore.
 Q. What ways have you noticed that parents have tried to cut back?
 A. They try to enroll their kids in Little League, which is less expensive from what parents used to do, like horseback riding. We had our 4-year-old's birthday party in our own apartment. We didn't rent out a space.
 Q. What about the poorest residents?
 A. There's this homeless guy named Dale. He would always sell his books in front of a vacant building. The city cracked down on him and said he needed a license. You see a lot more people sleeping on the streets.
 Q. Why is it harder to spot signs of the recession in TriBeCa ?
 A. Even the wealthiest people I know, they're not that flashy. That doesn't fly in our neighborhood. People don't have a lot of tolerance for that. They're not driving around in Bentleys. CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

HEADLINE: After Murder of Office Cleaner, a New Light on an Isolated Job

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
When other workers in her office building are calling it a day, Elizabeth Magda is just beginning hers. She dumps out their wastebaskets, swipes a rag across their desks, dusts their computers and stocks their bathrooms with toilet paper and paper towels.
 As the vast skyscraper empties out and a twilight desolation slowly descends on her floor, Ms. Magda finishes off her night by vacuuming a half acre of carpet, making sure to discard the pizza cartons of the few office workers who stay especially late. By midnight, she is usually the only person left on the floor, yet she does not feel isolated or lonesome, she said, because she knows she will soon be on her way home to Ridgewood, Queens. 
 ''My personality is that I don't need much people around me,'' she said. ''I don't like a factory with a hundred people. It's my job and I'm doing my job and I'm not thinking I'm lonely or somebody is coming in. You have to do your job.'' 
 Few people pay attention to the workers who clean their offices, as long as the desks are clean in the morning and papers are not tampered with. But every once in a while, something happens to cast a spotlight on their relatively solitary, uncelebrated occupation. On July 11, there was a grisly discovery that did just that: the body of a cleaning woman was found stuffed in an air-conditioning duct in the Lower Manhattan office building where she had worked at night. 
 The victim, Eridania Rodriguez, who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in the early 1990s, was last seen four nights before. The police found her face down, her hands bound behind her back with black and yellow tape, still in her blue custodial uniform. An elevator operator, Joseph Pabon, 25, was arrested on Friday night and charged with two counts of second-degree murder in the killing of Ms. Rodriquez.
 Ms. Magda, like Ms. Rodriguez, is an immigrant, though she came from Poland 13 years ago. She has a master's degree in economics from the Krakow Academy of Economics (now the Krakow University of Economics) and taught high school math and physics. But after her husband lost his engineering job, the couple took advantage of an American immigration lottery and obtained green cards. Speaking no English when she arrived in 1996 and having to support her four children, she took random baby-sitting jobs until a friend who cleaned offices at 1155 Avenue of the Americas tipped her to an opening there. 
 ''I was thinking of my kids' education first -- then maybe mine,'' she said.
 There is a slight note of embarrassment in her voice that she did not do more with her own education. But economically, at least, it may have been a sensible decision. As a member of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents 26,000 cleaners in large commercial buildings in New York City, she earns $21 an hour, or around $45,000 a year, with health and pension benefits and a three-week annual vacation. It has allowed her to support her children, three through colleges like the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Hunter College; her youngest, Filip, 16, is still living at home and attending the selective Brooklyn Technical High School. (She separated from her husband in 2000.) 
 Ms. Magda is a slender, middle-aged woman with long brunet hair that grazes the sky-blue uniform her job requires. She is part of a cleaning force of 44 that, every weeknight, freshens all 40 floors of 1155, a glass and black-granite tower between 44th and 45th Streets owned by the Durst Organization; the tenant list includes the law firm of White & Case. Almost all the cleaners are women from either Eastern Europe or Central or South America, according to Patrick Mollin, operations manager for Durst. 
 From 5:15 p.m., when she changes into her uniform and starts her shift, until 12:45 a.m., Ms. Magda's domain is the fourth floor, whose main occupant is O.K.!, the celebrity magazine. That is evident by the front-page posters of Britney Spears and Angelina Jolie that adorn the territory. 
 Her steady companion is her cart, which carries two ballooning plastic bags -- one for trash, the other for recyclables -- as well as scouring powder, Windex and a duster. As the light streaming through the broad windows steadily dims, she wheels the cart around, collecting garbage and wiping the scores of desks that honeycomb the floor. She makes sure not to disturb any papers left out on desktops. 
 That first phase of the job takes four hours and then she has a break for ''lunch.'' Hers is often fruit because, she said with a smile, ''I take care of my weight.'' It is the only time during the shift that she gets to chat with her co-workers. (She has learned a few words of Spanish and some of them have learned a few words of Polish.) Then she returns to the fourth floor and cleans the bathrooms. When there are almost no magazine workers around to disturb, she pushes and drags a vacuum cleaner until her shift nears its end. Then she turns off the lights, changes into street clothes and punches out.
 She finds that the people whose offices she cleans are grateful -- ''friendly,'' she said. ''It's like you belong in the building. Sometimes they say, 'You're working so hard.' '' But in any case she is too busy to feel lonely, she repeated. Cleaning, she said, ''is not a team job.''
 ''The hardest part of the job is night hours,'' she said. It leaves ''you tired after work.'' While the murder of Ms. Rodriguez upset Ms. Magda, it did not especially sound an occupational alarm. ''This is a safe job,'' she said. ''Security is very good. I feel comfortable.'' Even other workers cannot get to her floor since keys are electronically programmed to admit workers only to the floors they clean. 
 Unlike most daytime workers, she goes to sleep as soon as she returns home. But during the day, she takes time to read and attend to things like dental appointments. Before leaving for work, she prepares dinner for her son, who often returns from school after she has begun her commute to work, navigating three subway lines. (On the slog home, there is also a shuttle bus, which lengthens the trip to an hour and a half or more.) 
 Sometimes, she said, she capitalizes on her economics training by dabbling in the stock market through an online broker. She has also taken a course in computers offered through the union. Over the three-day July 4 weekend, she and Filip treated themselves to a bus tour of Maine, including stops in Portland, Augusta and Acadia National Park.
 She realizes that her choice to clean offices was a sacrifice she made so her children could thrive. She recalls that she got advice to do exactly that from a woman whose grandchild she baby-sat for.
 ''Elizabeth,'' the woman told her, ''first educate your kids and then there will be time for you.''

HEADLINE: Forget the Trash Bag, Bring a Towel

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
The only thing cooler than a pool party on a summer night in New York City is a secret pool party.
 And the only thing cooler than that, as a few enterprising developers recently discovered, is a secret pool party in a pool made out of a Dumpster on the banks of the Gowanus Canal in industrial Brooklyn.
On a rented lot that's hidden from the street they have erected what they call a lo-fi urban country club: three connected pools housed in Dumpsters; a boccie court; some lounge chairs, grills and cabanas. On Saturday night just three dozen people got the nod to check it out, at an afterparty for the art journal Cabinet. ''Please don't forward,'' the invitation read. 
 ''It's amazing,'' the artist Nina Katchadourian said after taking a dip in the moonlight. ''It makes you wonder, as so many things in New York do, what's behind every wall that you can't see past.''
 Bobbing in the water on a pool toy was ''the last thing I expected to be doing tonight,'' added Aaron Levy, a curator visiting from Philadelphia. 
 Since the space opened over the Fourth of July weekend, it has been host to barbecues, photo shoots and a film screening. Lectures and other events are planned for the rest of the summer, but none are open to the public, to the chagrin of the design bloggers and other cool-hunters who have been chattering about it.
 The idea, said David Belt, a real estate developer and the president of Macro-Sea, the company behind the pools, was not to create an exclusive party destination but to experiment with underused space and materials, repurposing them with urban renewal in mind. 
 ''It's a very simple concept,'' said Jocko Weyland, Macro-Sea's project manager. ''There aren't that many places to swim in New York.'' And Dumpsters ''are everywhere; they're ubiquitous.'' 
 The concept itself is borrowed. Mr. Belt, Mr. Weyland and Alix Feinkind, Macro-Sea's creative director, heard about it in April, when they were scouting a project in Georgia. Curtis Crowe, a musician in the Athens band Pylon, had made one. 
 After Mr. Weyland had a brief phone conversation with him, Macro-Sea decided to make its own. It took about a month to find a suitably out of the way yet accessible space with an agreeable owner. (The pools are insured, Mr. Belt said, and the lot, filled with junk and machinery, is protected by a chain-link fence.)
 From there the project proceeded quickly and cheaply, in guerrilla fashion: the Dumpsters were donated by a construction company that suddenly had a surplus (thanks, economic downturn), the designers who helped render the plans were recruited through Craigslist, and members of the small crew that erected it in a week were unpaid. 
 ''They just wanted to be able to use it,'' Mr. Belt said. 
 The garbage containers, which he described as ''newish,'' were cleaned and lined in plastic, and a filtration system was installed, as on a regular above-ground pool. Mr. Belt's wife, Antonia, stitched together the coverings for the cabanas; the furniture came from Ikea. The main cost was the wood for the deck and the water: about 18,000 gallons, delivered from a New Jersey aquifer for $1,200.
 ''I tried to do it so that even if you had to rent one, you could do a stand-alone Dumpster, a grill and chair for under $1,000,'' Mr. Belt said. Copycats are welcome, because Macro-Sea itself is using the project as a template for a larger idea: turning eyesore strip malls into artsy community destinations, with Dumpster pools and other indie attractions. 
 ''I thought if we could get people to come here and swim in a Dumpster, I could probably use the same aesthetic sensibility'' to get people -- and, not incidentally, better retailers -- to come to a dingy strip mall, Mr. Belt said. The company hopes to open its first repurposed shopping center in Atlanta this fall, ideally with dozens of pools in the parking lot that visitors can rent for the day.
 While the project is conceptually simple -- get a bunch of trash containers, clean and seal them, fill with water, jump in -- there were a lot of details to finesse. The coarse edges inside the containers were filed down, and underneath the liners, the bottoms were covered in sand, for soft landings. Tightly packed sandbags double as benches along the walls, and pool toys and kid-friendliness provide an intentional counterpoint to the neighborhood grit.
 With brightly colored lanterns crisscrossing overhead and music piped in from an iPod connected to a boombox, the feel is of a do-it-yourself urban oasis. 
 ''The water's amazingly fresh, for swimming in a Dumpster,'' said Alexis Bloom, a documentary filmmaker from TriBeCa, after doing a few laps. She compared it favorably to the pool at Soho House, an actual urban country club. 
 The problem, of course, with having such a sexy space -- especially a sexy private space -- is that everyone wants to come. 
 After Mr. Weyland gave an interview to ReadyMade, the D.I.Y. design magazine, two weeks ago, breathless coverage and links began appearing all over the blogosphere. Soon the location was decoded. One post led to people standing on the roofs of cars in a nearby lot, snapping photos, Mr. Weyland said with an eye roll. 
 Though they're certainly aware that there's nothing more tantalizing to some New Yorkers than a party to which they weren't invited, the creators profess surprise at the level of attention their project has received. ''I'm glad that people like it,'' Mr. Belt said. ''But it's not the end all, be all.'' 
 They hope that visitors will be as chill as the Cabinet magazine partygoers, who somehow resisted the temptation to text all their friends the minute they got there. ''It's so easy to ruin something,'' one sighed.
 The pools are supposed to be open through August or until the coolness wears off. ''If it gets really crowded,'' Mr. Belt said, ''I'll shut it down.''

HEADLINE: In Purchase of School, Hopes of Saving A Neglected Monument

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan. 

 BODY:
The classrooms are haunting in their dusty silence. 
 It has been more than a half-century since Sumner Elementary School, now an abandoned shell of a building, had a brief and ignoble moment in the spotlight for what it would not do: allow a black father from the surrounding neighborhood, Oliver L. Brown, to enroll his daughter Linda in the third grade.
Mr. Brown, along with a group of similarly rejected black parents, brought a lawsuit against the school board here that went on to become one of the landmarks of this country's legal history: Brown v. Board of Education, the outcome of which banned segregation in public schools across the country and set off an era of civil rights progress. 
 Sumner's own future was less auspicious, however. Closed in 1996, used as storage space, neglected and vandalized, it barely escaped the wrecking ball. But now, a new owner hopes to bring the spotlight back again, and this time the result would be more flattering: plans call for Sumner to be opened to the public as a community center and human rights memorial after renovation next year.
 ''I believe we can make this place a catalyst for inspiration and hope for people,'' said the new owner, the Rev. W. R. Portee, minister of a nondenominational Christian church based in Los Angeles who bought Sumner at a city auction in April for $89,000. ''I want to involve the whole community and people beyond Topeka.''
 Mr. Portee, 70, said he was shocked to learn that Sumner was available for bidding. The Rev. Zaire Thomas, a local minister overseeing a branch of Mr. Portee's church, found the building while driving around Topeka looking for vacant sites that might be rehabilitated for a community center. Mr. Thomas forwarded the Sumner information to Mr. Portee, unaware of its past. 
 ''I said, 'Get it!' '' Mr. Portee, a former civil rights activist, recalled. '' Bid on it!' I knew instantly we had to save that building.''
 It was in dire condition.
 Last year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation put Sumner Elementary on its list of most endangered sites, concerned about how close a monument of American history was coming to slipping away altogether. 
 The school was named a National Historic Landmark in 1987, along with the formerly all-black school that Mr. Brown's daughter attended, Monroe Elementary. But, according to the National Trust, because Sumner was still in use at the time for classes and Monroe was not, Monroe was selected to house the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, the official commemorative location operated for the public by the National Park Service. 
 Sumner, on the other hand, was largely forgotten.
 Enrollment dwindled over the years. Then, in another twist having to do with race, Sumner was one of eight schools closed as part of a local desegregation plan that was an effort to satisfy the original Brown case, which was re-opened in the 1980s and not closed until 1999. The school's age and cost of upkeep also worked against it, a spokesman for the school system said. 
 For a while, Sumner was used as storage for the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library, which bought the building after it closed as a school. In 2002, the city bought the building from the library, with a hope of rehabilitating it. But because the city grew increasingly short on money over the years, the building languished, according to the deputy city manager, Randy Speaker. 
 The city tried unsuccessfully to sell Sumner several times, and even considered demolishing it at one point. 
 ''It was a situation where the city did not have the resources to renovate it,'' Mr. Speaker said, ''and thought it would be in better hands in the private sector.''
 In January, the city put the school up for auction. Mr. Portee's umbrella group, True Foundation World Outreach Ministries, outbid one other potential buyer and the sale was finalized in the spring, Mr. Speaker said.
 When Mr. Portee and Mr. Thomas hired a landscaper to start cleaning up the grounds this month, the man said he found himself literally in over his head. 
 ''I'm 5-11, and the grass was taller than that,'' Donald Dunbar, the landscaper, said. ''I never thought much about the building. But I get cold chills thinking about it now that I know what happened here.'' 
 Built in 1936 by the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, a New Deal government agency, as stated on a plaque in the school's foyer, Sumner has an unusual amount of stone detailing in the Art Deco style. Because of the high quality of the original construction, it retains many of its original features, including light and bathroom fixtures, clocks, carved woodwork and even a marble-rimmed fireplace in the kindergarten.
 There is no restriction on how the building may be used. Mr. Portee said he envisioned a combination educational site and community center that would be open to the public but run by the church. He is obligated to protect the structure's basic features. 
 ''It's a great building, and I have high hopes for the new owners that they can restore it to its former glory,'' said Amy Cole, a senior program officer at the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ''It is certainly deserving both in its historic and architectural significance.''
 While Mr. Portee said he recognized that significance, he also knows that he is facing an uphill battle in these economic times as he begins to apply for grants to begin renovation, starting with very little money in the bank for the job. Eight years ago, the repair bill was estimated to be about $3 million. Now, with extensive rain damage, some vandalism and the increased costs of construction, Sumner's restoration could cost $7 million.
 Still beaming with purchaser's pride despite the work ahead while touring the grounds recently, Mr. Portee said, ''I think it's a bargain.''

HEADLINE: Outsmarted

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
At first glance, Japanese cellphones are a gadget lover's dream: ready for Internet and e-mail, they double as credit cards, boarding passes and even body-fat calculators.
 But it is hard to find anyone in Chicago or London using a Japanese phone like a Panasonic, a Sharp or an NEC. Despite years of dabbling in overseas markets, Japan's handset makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
''Japan is years ahead in any innovation. But it hasn't been able to get business out of it,'' said Gerhard Fasol, president of the Tokyo-based IT consulting firm, Eurotechnology Japan. 
 The Japanese have a name for their problem: Galapagos syndrome. 
 Japan's cellphones are like the endemic species that Darwin encountered on the Galapagos Islands -- fantastically evolved and divergent from their mainland cousins -- explains Takeshi Natsuno, who teaches at Tokyo's Keio University.
 This year, Mr. Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, assembled some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones can go global.
 ''The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a superadvanced phone,'' said Mr. Natsuno. ''So we're asking, can't Japan build on that advantage?''
 The only Japanese handset maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
 And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
 Yet Japan's lack of global clout is all the more surprising because its cellphones set the pace in almost every industry innovation: e-mail capabilities in 1999, camera phones in 2000, third-generation networks in 2001, full music downloads in 2002, electronic payments in 2004 and digital TV in 2005.
 Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smartphones, twice the number used in the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access. 
 Indeed, Japanese makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But Japanese cellphone makers were a little too clever. The industry turned increasingly inward. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was rejected everywhere else. Carriers created fenced-in Web services, like i-Mode. Those mobile Web universes fostered huge e-commerce and content markets within Japan, but they have also increased the country's isolation from the global market.
 Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. The rest of the world dallied, essentially making Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
 At the same time, the rapid growth of Japan's cellphone market in the late 1990s and early 2000s gave Japanese companies little incentive to market overseas. But now the market is shrinking significantly, hit by a recession and a graying economy; makers shipped 19 percent fewer handsets in 2008 and expect to ship even fewer in 2009. The industry remains fragmented, with eight cellphone makers vying for part of a market that will be less than 30 million units this year.
 Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC, which pulled the plug on its money-losing international cellphone efforts in 2006. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
 ''Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business,'' said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan.
 At a recent meeting of Mr. Natsuno's group, 20 men and one woman crowded around a big conference table in a skyscraper in central Tokyo, examining market data, delivering diatribes and frequently shaking their heads.
 The discussion then turned to the cellphones themselves. Despite their advanced hardware, handsets here often have primitive, clunky interfaces, some participants said. Most handsets have no way to easily synchronize data with PCs as the iPhone and other smartphones do.
 Because each handset model is designed with a customized user interface, development is time-consuming and expensive, said Tetsuzo Matsumoto, senior executive vice president at Softbank Mobile, a leading carrier. ''Japan's phones are all 'handmade' from scratch,'' he said. ''That's reaching the limit.''
 Then there are the peculiarities of the Japanese market, like the almost universal clamshell design, which is not as popular overseas. Recent hardware innovations, like solar-powered batteries or waterproofing, have been incremental rather than groundbreaking.
 The emphasis on hardware makes even the newest phones here surprisingly bulky. Some analysts say cellphone carriers stifle innovation by demanding so many peripheral hardware functions for phones.
 The Sharp 912SH for Softbank, for example, comes with an LCD screen that swivels 90 degrees, GPS tracking, a bar-code reader, digital TV, credit card functions, video conferencing and a camera and is unlocked by face recognition.
 Meanwhile, Japanese developers are jealous of the runaway global popularity of the Apple iPhone and App Store, which have pushed the American and European cellphone industry away from its obsession with hardware specifications to software. ''This is the kind of phone I wanted to make,'' Mr. Natsuno said, playing with his own iPhone 3G. 
 The conflict between Japan's advanced hardware and its primitive software has contributed to some confusion over whether the Japanese find the iPhone cutting edge or boring. One analyst said they just aren't used to handsets that connect to a computer. 
 The forum Mr. Natsuno convened to address Galapagos syndrome has come up with a series of recommendations: Japan's handset makers must focus more on software and must be more aggressive in hiring foreign talent, and the country's cellphone carriers must also set their sights overseas.
 ''It's not too late for Japan's cellphone industry to look overseas,'' said Tetsuro Tsusaka, a telecom analyst at Barclays Capital Japan. ''Besides, most phones outside the Galapagos are just so basic.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Oil Corruption in Equatorial Guinea'' (Green Inc. blog, New York Times on the Web, July 9): 
 As the ambassador to the United States for the people of Equatorial Guinea, I found both the Human Rights Watch report on Equatorial Guinea and your coverage disappointing. While my government is keenly aware of the lasting effect the mistakes made by our past leaders have had on our country, people and global reputation, the real news story is that we are working to build a better future and making significant progress each day.
 With technical assistance from the United States, European Union and World Bank, Equatorial Guinea has invested billions of dollars in recent years to improve our national infrastructure; to increase the quality and accessibility of our social services, education and health care systems for our people; and to defend the human rights of every Equatorial Guinea citizen.
 We have built state-of-the-art hospitals and schools; we are modernizing our textbooks; our police force and military are receiving extensive human rights training; and Equatorial Guinea is now one of the most successful countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the fight against malaria.
 Sensationalized reports like the one published by Human Rights Watch may be the unavoidable price of past mistakes, but I believe your readers, like my fellow countrymen, are more interested in the future of Equatorial Guinea than its past.

HEADLINE: When NASA Defined Long Island

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 Frank Pullo remembers many things about the era from 1962 to 1972 when teams of Grumman engineers and technicians in Bethpage on Long Island built all of NASA's lunar modules, including the 23-foot-tall spacecraft that landed on the moon's Sea of Tranquillity 40 years ago today.
 Mr. Pullo, an electrical engineer in charge of testing and retesting the various systems on the modules, remembers the intricacies of verification protocols and the endless workweeks -- like the wrap-up of building Lunar Module 6, when he did not go home for a week and slept in the astronauts' trailers. But mostly he remembers the intoxicating feeling of being part of history. 
 ''I used this analogy even then,'' said Mr. Pullo, now 76, who, like many of the former Grumman engineers, works part time as a docent at the Cradle of Aviation Museum here in Garden City, where two of the four remaining modules not still on the moon reside.
 ''I told everyone, this is like building the pyramids, something that's been around for 5,000 years,'' he said. ''It's a first, and it isn't a small first -- going to another world -- something that will be around for a long, long time.''
 For a few days, we have been all awash in lunar fever (with a chaser of Cronkite nostalgia), which will have its extended 15 minutes in the media pinwheel only to disappear once again. But for Long Island, there is a more lasting question. It's easy to forget that this was America's first aviation center and then an early aerospace capital, where names like Grumman, Republic, Sikorsky Curtiss, Sperry and Fairchild all but defined the most glamorous, high-tech business of the mid-20th century.
 American aviation was essentially born on the broad, flat, treeless Hempstead Plains. Long Island was the starting point for the first transcontinental plane flight in 1911. Most famously, in 1927 Charles Lindberghtook off for Paris from Roosevelt Field, which by the 1930s was the largest civilian airfield in America. 
 Twice in history, the whole world has been totally transfixed by a story of flight -- Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic, and the Apollo 11 crew's first walk on the moon. Long Island was central to both of them.
 Roosevelt Field is now a shopping mall, and Northrop Grumman, as the manufacturer is now known, has a small operation on Long Island but does most of its work in California or Virginia, or other places far from here. So what replaces Grumman and Republic and the suburban wonks of NASA's past? Right now, no one is sure.
 In some ways, it was inevitable. There are still plenty of high-tech aviation parts and engineering design firms on Long Island, approximately 240 of which produce aircraft parts. But the big manufacturing and fabrication work that once came to Long Island was destined to move to newer areas with more land, cheaper housing and lower living costs. 
 Still, there's something bittersweet about it all, particularly as Long Island gropes around for a new economic engine and a forward-looking cultural identity. In the public mind, Long Island was once Gatsby and the shore and the romance of flight. Now it's ...what? At worst it's Joey Buttafuoco, the most iconic Long Islander of recent decades. At best, in the vision of Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, it's the template for modern suburbia desperately in need of a 2.0 upgrade. 
 Indeed, NASA was the first great industrial triumph of suburbia. Far removed technologically and culturally from the factories of Detroit, the stockyards of Chicago or the sweatshops of New York, the green industrial campuses of Long Island, Houston and Southern California produced one of history's crowning achievements.
 Particularly in the dour mood of the moment, it's easy to look back and see what was lost and wonder if there really is a 2.0 version that can compete with it. It is easy to be pessimistic. 
 Even F. Scott Fitzgerald, in perhaps the greatest American novel of them all, got it wrong in the book's final reverie, when Nick Carraway contemplates Jay Gatsby's failed dreams on Long Island's Gold Coast, and the pristine New World that once captivated the Dutch explorers: ''For a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.'' 
 But, as we were reminded over the weekend in the endlessly repeated images of Walter Cronkite shaking his head, almost speechless, as men first walked on the moon, nothing -- not the pyramids, not the New World -- was more wondrous than the marvel of exploration produced by those Grumman engineers and their counterparts around the country 40 years ago.
 You could look at it wistfully as a reminder of what was. Or you could look at it hopefully as a reminder of what could still be.

HEADLINE: Costs and Benefits

 BODY:
Democrats pushing for health care reform got serious jolts last week from critics who warned that their proposed legislation would do little to slow spiraling health care costs.
 A group of conservative Democrats vowed that they would join Republicans to block action in a crucial House committee unless more cost restraint was imposed. And Douglas Elmendorf, the respected head of the Congressional Budget Office, warned that none of the bills he has seen impose fundamental changes in how medical care is delivered and paid for. 
 Health care reform is vitally important both to cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans -- a moral imperative -- and to bring down the relentlessly rising costs of care. Those costs are straining not only the government's budgets for Medicare and Medicaid. American businesses are struggling to provide insurance for their employees. Millions of Americans are struggling to pay high medical bills and rising premiums; many are just a pink slip away from being uninsured. 
 Mr. Elmendorf's testimony should prod Democratic leaders to come up with more and better ways to restrain costs for federal programs and the health care system as a whole. The White House was certainly paying attention. It called for the creation of an independent expert body to propose fair payment rates and other cost-saving reforms for Medicare. That is a sound idea that could lessen the influence of high-pressure lobbying -- by drug companies, insurers, hospitals and doctors -- that inevitably drives up costs. 
 The pending bills do an excellent job of providing health insurance for millions of uninsured Americans at a cost of roughly $1 trillion over the next decade -- mostly for subsidies to low- and middle-income people and expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. 
 President Obama has rightly insisted -- and Congressional leaders have agreed -- that this expansion of coverage must not drive up the deficit over the next 10 years. It has to be fully paid for by new taxes or big savings in Medicare and other federal programs. Whatever legislation emerges from Congress is expected to do so -- or face a veto. 
 The knottier problem is how to slow the rate of increase in health care costs. Those costs are growing faster than inflation, wages and the overall economy. This is the issue that Mr. Elmendorf was addressing, and he seemed to be thinking beyond the 10-year budget window to the likely impact on future deficits.
 He is right to be concerned. If the government simply extends subsidized insurance to millions of uninsured people but fails to force fundamental changes in the delivery or financing of health care, then federal health care costs will keep escalating at excessive rates. That will drive up deficits in subsequent decades unless new taxes are imposed or new savings found.
 The budget office is concerned only with impacts on federal spending and the deficit. But any changes to Medicare's policies would reverberate through the whole health care system as health care providers changed their practices and private insurers followed Medicare's lead.
 The House bill makes a good start in the right direction by proposing changes in Medicare reimbursement rates and various pilot programs to encourage greater productivity and less costly forms of care. But more could and should be done.
 Medicare ought to be empowered, for example, to reduce its payment rates to the highest-cost hospitals and most inefficient doctors. That is probably the best way to get them to stop providing needless tests and treatments that don't improve the health of the patient.
 Medicare should also be allowed to use the results of comparative effectiveness research to set reimbursement policies favoring the best treatments. Unfortunately, as currently written, the House bill calls for that research but prohibits Medicare from using it to set rates. 
 All of these ideas seem well worth trying. The long-run solution is to move away from Medicare's fee-for-service system that rewards doctors and hospitals for each additional service they provide and move into a new system where doctors and hospitals are organized and rewarded in ways that encourage both low-cost and high-quality care.
 The problem is that nobody is sure of the best way to do that. The House bill is right to set up pilot programs to test some approaches. But more ideas should be developed and tested. 
 Much to the anger of leading Democrats, Mr. Elmendorf also suggested that Congress might consider taxing employer-provided health benefits. He seemed to mean the most generous policies that many economists think encourage excessive use of medical care.
 That could raise several hundred billion dollars to pay for the expansion of coverage and, unlike the taxes on wealthy Americans proposed in the House bill, is likely to keep pace with future increases in health care costs. 
 A tax on employer-provided benefits would probably also encourage workers to choose lower-cost policies and use health care more sparingly. But it is politically risky and it could turn many Americans away from supporting health care reform. It might best be considered as a last resort.

HEADLINE: China May Ease Charges of Rio Tinto Workers

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China's investigation into whether four employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto stole state documents may be treated as a commercial case rather than an espionage case, Australia's foreign affairs minister said Sunday. 
 In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the minister, Stephen Smith, suggested that the four employees, including one Australian, could be spared the more serious spying charges. The employees were detained in Shanghai on July 5 on suspicion of espionage.
 Mr. Smith could not be reached Sunday for clarification. But if China pursues the lesser charges, it will be an important turnaround in a case that has strained Australia's relations with China for two weeks. China has released few details about the case but has insisted that the four Rio Tinto employees stole state secrets, engaged in espionage and harmed the economic security and interests of the nation.
 Australian and American officials are pressing China for details of the case amid worries about the employees' treatment and fears that global companies doing business in China could face legal difficulties when dealing with Chinese companies. 
 In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Smith said the employees could still face criminal charges of misconduct during Rio Tinto's iron ore negotiations with Chinese steel executives earlier this year.
 The Chinese government charges that the employees had bribed Chinese steel mill executives in exchange for confidential government data. 
 ''It's quite clear they are focusing on a criminal or judicial investigation related to the 2009 iron ore negotiations,'' Mr. Smith said, according to a transcript of the interview. ''That is their clear focus; they're not interested in what we would regard as espionage or national security matters. These are commercial and economic matters, which, under their general definition of state secrets, is included.''
 Rio Tinto could not be reached for comment on Sunday. But on Friday, it released a statement defending its employees.
 Legal experts say that China's state secrets law is difficult to defend against because a suspect is not allowed to meet with a lawyer until charges are filed. Since being detained two weeks ago, Stern Hu, the Australian employee who is Rio Tinto's top iron ore executive in China, has not been visited by his family or a lawyer, Australian officials said.
 Australia wants China to expedite Mr. Hu's case. Chinese officials have promised to release information if charges are filed, Australia's government said.

HEADLINE: For Prostate Cancer, Many Options, Little Certainty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''In Health Reform, a Cancer Offers an Acid Test,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, front page, July 8), misses an essential principle in the genomic age of prostate cancer research: one cost and treatment cannot benefit every patient. 
 Prostate cancer is not one disease for policy reform: we finance research on more than six molecular and clinical subtypes of prostate cancer. Some are lethal, while others do not require treatment.
 We do not yet have tests that can distinguish between the two. Thus, we often overtreat, overburdening the resources of our health care system. Without intensified research now, we can never know perfectly who should receive which treatment. 
 Some 192,000 American men will receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer this year, and some 27,000 men (one every 19 minutes) will die annually from advanced, metastatic disease.
 Prostate cancer provides the ideal place to test policy reform and immediate reinvestment of any savings from waste into research that ends death from prostate cancer.
 Jonathan Simons
 President and Chief Executive
 Prostate Cancer Foundation
 Santa Monica, Calif., July 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 While I agree with David Leonhardt's premise that prostate cancer is an appropriate litmus test for health care reform, I disagree with his analysis of treatment issues.
 Mr. Leonhardt defines the ''fundamental problem'' in health care as ''the combination of soaring costs and mediocre results.'' That would apply to the expense and results to date with proton therapy, but it certainly does not apply to I.M.R.T. The actual costs of treatment are significantly less than those cited by Mr. Leonhardt. Numerous recent studies have shown that higher doses of radiation delivered by I.M.R.T. eradicate cancer more effectively with dramatically fewer side effects than any other treatment.
 Most men who forgo treatment and pursue ''watchful waiting'' (a.k.a ''watchful worrying'') ultimately end up on female hormones as the disease progresses. The hormones are not only extremely costly but also lead to heart disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment and ''andropause'' (hot flashes, depression, erectile dysfunction). Treating these hormone-induced maladies is more costly than treating prostate cancer, since they frequently result in mega-medications and repeated hospitalizations.
 Those patients still have prostate cancer, and while screening and advances in treatment have lowered the death rate significantly over the past decade, prostate cancer still kills almost 30,000 patients a year. Michael J. Dattoli

HEADLINE: Message to Moondoggie: Keep Our Beaches Clean

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Editor's note: Stuart Elliott is on summer vacation. You'll continue to receive the In Advertising newsletter while he's away, as Jane L. Levere writes the Campaign Spotlight feature. The Q & A and Webdenda are scheduled to return with Stuart, for the Aug. 10 issue.
 Keep California Beautiful has jumped on the retro bandwagon for a clever public service advertising campaign intended to maintain the state's beaches. 
 Created by BBDO West, a San Francisco-based unit of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, the campaign features a 60-second spot that was shot at Westward Beach in Malibu, where ''Gidget'' and ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' were made, and satirizes the wholesome teenagers who innocently romped in those films.
 The teenagers in the new commercial, released last week in California, wear authentic 1960's swimwear but sing and dance about a pressing 2009 problem: marine debris. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, almost 80 percent of marine debris -- on beaches and in coastal waters, estuaries and oceans -- is washed, blown or dumped from shore. Most debris -- likecigarette butts, soda cans and plastic bags -- is man-made and slow to degrade; it also threatens marine and coastal wildlife. 
 In the new spot, the youths discuss tossing ''junk up and down the beach''-- including broken glass, a bottle of bleach, used condoms and underwear -- and admit ''We're polluting and we don't even care!'' 
 One girl announces she has punctured her foot on a hypodermic needle, while a biker says he saw a seagull ''choking on a corn dog.''
 The end of the spot mentions ''cigarette butts, soda cans, a glasses' case, a diaper and a tennis shoe without a lace,'' before the teenagers sing, ''The party isn't over till we trash the place, let's trash the beach!''
 Then flash the words, ''Actually, let's not,'' in a 1960's-style font, with the URL of Keep California Beautiful's Web site.
 The spot is the second public service announcement created by BBDO West for Keep California, a 20-year-old, Sacramento-based, nonprofit organization; its board of directors includes government officials and executives from McDonald's, the Walt Disney Company and Northrop Grumman. The first spot, released three years ago, spoofed ''The Sopranos.'' It shows two thugs throwing a body wrapped in a carpet off a dock; one drinks from a plastic bottle, hesitating before pitching the bottle into a recycling bin. The tagline says, ''Redeem yourself. Recycle. KeepCaliforniaBeautiful.org.'' 
 Keep California Beuatiful helps more than 200 California communities with clean-up and beautification efforts, including the annual Great American Cleanup, during which volunteers collect litter and trash across the state. During last year's cleanup alone, volunteers removed almost 2.2 million pounds of litter and debris, saving state and local governments an estimated $4.7 million in labor costs. 
 Christine Flowers-Ewing, executive director of KCB, said the marine debris problem might well be exacerbated this summer, as more Californians vacation closer to home to save money: According to a poll last fall by TripAdvisor, the Web site that carries user-generated hotel reviews, 61 perecnt of travelers said they would visit a beach destination this year, while 60 percent of respondents to a Harris Poll survey in May said they hoped to economize on vacations this summer by finding less expensive activities, and half said they would vacation near home.
 Roz Romney, a creative director at BBDO West, said the prospect of ''a million people descending on the beach on a holiday weekend, and leaving tons and tons of trash behind, made us want to get out there with something that will potentially grab people's attention.''
 ''We didn't want to do something preachy, boring,'' she said, adding that the new spot provided the opportunity to skewer the ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' genre, ''contrasting innocent teens with what they're actually doing.''
 The spot's director, Geordie Stephens of Tool of North America, a Santa Monica-based production company, who is himself a surfer, said, ''I've watched for years the deterioration of beaches and the lack of effort of people to clean up after themselves. We felt that if we made something really impactful, maybe they'd think twice about leaving their leftover picnic food and trash.''
 ''The irony of the entire project is that films like 'Gidget' and 'Beach Blanket Bingo' showed very pristine beaches that are a happy place to be. People still have the perception that beaches have beautiful, white sand, and that the ocean has clean water, and are shocked that that vision no longer exists,'' he added. 
 Mr. Stephens and Ms. Romney say the spot is aimed at adults, particularly young adults in their 20's, who visit and party at California's beaches; the state's coastline is approximately 1,100 miles long.The spot's retro flavor should appeal to viewers of all ages, said Nick Bartle, director of behavioral planning for BBDO North America, because in stressful economic times, people find comfort and security in the familiar.
 Keep California Beautiful has given the new spot to Keep America Beautiful, the national organization, for dissemination in other states with beaches, either on the ocean or on rivers or lakes. 
 Keep America Beautiful, which has a network of almost 1,000 state and local groups that develop public-private environmental partnerships and programs, created the 1971 public service spot starring the American Indian actor, Iron Eyes Cody.
 Rob Wallace, a spokesman for Keep America, said, ''While the famous 'Crying Indian' campaign had a huge effect on an entire generation, one thing we're finding is that negative messages, and messages that use guilt as a motivator, don't sit well with today's young people. Doom and gloom has turned them cynical. As a result, they like humor. They appreciate irony. Keep California Beautiful, through their new p.s.a., is keeping the message light but also making a point, that in this day and age, littering is just ridiculous.''

HEADLINE: Americans Worried About Flu's Impact on Finances

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Most Americans think swine flu will be back with a vengeance in the fall, with almost 6 in 10 saying they believe a serious outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) is likely, a new survey has found. 
 But while most adults are not overly concerned about their own health or that of their families, they are worried about the financial hit they will take if illness or school closings keep them home from work, according to the survey by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
 Some 44 percent of those surveyed said they would lose income if they missed work for a week to 10 days due to illness, and a quarter said they could lose their jobs or businesses altogether. 
 Parents with children in school and day care were similarly concerned about the impact of extended school closings. More than half said they or another member of the household would have to miss work to care for children if schools or day care centers were closed for two weeks.
 Some 43 percent of parents said the loss of income would cause financial hardship, and 26 percent said it could cost them their jobs. 
 Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the school, said the findings are a ''wake-up call'' to businesses that they need to reexamine their sick leave policies.
 ''It's really clear: we live in a country where parents work. It's not 1918 anymore, where most families had someone who stayed at home,'' Dr. Blendon said. ''Unless we have some general leave polices that are supportive of people, we're going to have a lot of families in very difficult economic circumstances very quickly.''
 The survey was the third Harvard evaluation of perceptions of the flu outbreak and included the responses of 1,823 adults ages 18 and older. It was conducted in June of this year.

HEADLINE: Obama Aide Declines Visit To Bank Board

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, has decided not to speak to the board of JPMorgan Chase when it meets here on Monday, he said Sunday after considering the invitation for several days. 
 Mr. Emanuel is a longtime acquaintance of the bank's chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who previously headed BankOne in Chicago, where he met some influential Democrats, including Mr. Emanuel and President Obama. 
 Because of his relationship with Mr. Dimon, Mr. Emanuel agreed to consider JPMorgan's invitation after the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, declined out of concern that he would appear too cozy with a company that has numerous business and regulatory dealings with his department.
 Mr. Emanuel first sought advice from the White House counsel's office about the propriety of meeting with the bank's board. Mr. Emanuel said Sunday evening that the White House counsel held him to the same standard as Mr. Geithner when it came to avoiding what might be seen as a conflict of interest.
 Two officials for JPMorgan said the bank had no comment. Another administration official and two lawmakers were also expected to speak to the board, but their identities have not been disclosed. 
 Mr. Emanuel's decision came after a New York Times article on Sunday about Mr. Dimon's heightened profile and influence in Washington amid an economic crisis that has humbled much of the industry, both financially and politically. The report cited the initial expectation that Mr. Emanuel would speak to the JPMorgan board as an example of Mr. Dimon's political influence.
 Mr. Dimon has long been a Democratic donor in a generally Republican-oriented industry. His company has not been implicated in the crisis to the extent others have, and its quarterly report last week detailing robust earnings confirmed JPMorgan's pre-eminence. 
 The Chicago political scion William M. Daley, a former commerce secretary and Obama campaign strategist, has been a vice chairman of JPMorgan and head of its Midwest operations since 2004; since 2007, he also has overseen its government relations efforts.
 Mr. Dimon is also a friend of Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser and a longtime confidante of the Obamas, from business, civic and political activities in Chicago.
 Mr. Dimon first met Mr. Emanuel when Mr. Emanuel was a White House adviser to President Bill Clinton. After Mr. Emanuel left that job in 1998, Mr. Dimon invited him to consider a position at Citigroup, the banking supermarket that Mr. Dimon had helped build with Sanford I. Weill, his onetime mentor. 
 Mr. Emanuel went instead to another firm, and a short time later Mr. Dimon was fired at Citigroup. That led to his move to Chicago and BankOne; when it merged with JPMorgan in 2004, Mr. Dimon took charge of the combined company and was back on Wall Street. 
 After 2007, Mr. Dimon decided to ramp up government lobbying efforts. He called it JPMorgan's ''seventh line of business.''

HEADLINE: For Democrats, an Issue That Goes to the Roots

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
To understand the Democratic Party and its reflexes on health care, look no further than Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.
 As a senator's son and a former national Democratic chairman, Mr. Dodd carries the party's impulses in his DNA. As a stand-in for his ailing friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts on the Senate's health committee, he has met President Obama's call for prompt action on legislation greatly expanding coverage for the uninsured -- on a party-line vote.
 ''Would I prefer it's bipartisan? You bet I would,'' Mr. Dodd said in an interview. ''I think that sustains you over a longer period of time.'' 
 ''But given the choice between a bipartisan bill that's weak and doesn't do much for my people at home, or one that is a partisan bill that actually gets more done,'' he added, the second ''is where I'm going.''
 House Democratic leaders have mirrored Mr. Dodd's approach and initial success. Not coincidentally for the party of government activism, both have lavished more attention on expanding coverage to the more than 45 million Americans now uninsured than on controlling medical costs, which Mr. Obama also emphasizes.
 The question now facing Mr. Dodd, his colleagues and the White House is whether to continue moving briskly on that familiar path. The alternative course is slower, harder and less politically expedient -- but perhaps more able to attract Republican cooperation and curb health expenses.
 Keeping Costs Down
 It's no surprise that cost control has gotten relatively short shrift so far -- and not merely because Democrats bend naturally toward larger rather than smaller government services. No one knows what will work. 
 Health economists see promise in steps like the improved management of chronic diseases, increased focus on preventive care and advances in health information technology. But because those efforts have little track record, budget scorekeepers have trouble predicting their value.
 Other potential cost-saving changes, like shifting away from reimbursing medical providers based on the volume of services provided, are difficult for lawmakers to explain.
 Still others are all too easy to understand -- and politically risky. Democrats and Republicans alike flee from talk of rationing medical services, and of using the tax code to curtail health benefits that employers provide.
 Yet after decades of health care inflation exceeding inflation in other sectors, all those steps may be necessary to achieve Mr. Obama's ambition of ''bending the cost curve'' on what amounts to one-sixth of the American economy.
 After the Congressional Budget Office director, Douglas W. Elmendorf, cast doubt last week on the cost implications of Democratic bills moving on Capitol Hill, that approach -- what Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential candidate, referred to as ''all of the above'' in discussing energy policy -- began receiving fresh attention.
 Bid for Bipartisanship
 Mr. Obama called for augmenting a Medicare advisory board with new powers to reduce spending, the way a military base-closing commission has helped shutter unneeded defense installations. House leaders quickly embraced a beefed-up ''Med-Pac,'' which may be the closest lawmakers come to rationing care, if only indirectly.
 House leaders are seeking floor passage of their bill before the August recess, as Mr. Obama has requested. This week, attention will focus on whether Mr. Dodd and his Senate colleagues can do the same.
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the Finance Committee chairman, has lagged behind Mr. Dodd as he negotiates with Republicans on a bipartisan approach. Some Democrats argue that, using the expedited procedures of ''reconciliation,'' they can set aside that effort and pass legislation without Republicans.
 That idea carries at least two problems. One, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Sunday, is that a Democrats-only bill would deny Mr. Obama and his party political ''cover'' in elections.
 The other is that efforts to lure a half-dozen or so Republican senators revolve largely around steps that could curb costs, like taxing some health benefits that employers now give workers tax-free.
 In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama spoke out against Mr. McCain's proposal to tax benefits; labor unions fiercely oppose the idea as a raid on middle-class workers. Moreover, Mr. Dodd and White House electoral strategists see it as a political trap, since most Republicans would vote against the measure anyway and use it to attack Democrats. 
 Yet Mr. Baucus, joined by some health policy experts inside and outside the administration, sees taxing benefits as a potential linchpin of compromise that could raise revenue for expanded coverage and reduce incentives for excessive spending at the same time. 
 Mr. Dodd says the absent Mr. Kennedy, even as he battles brain cancer, ''would crawl over broken glass to be here'' if needed to break a health care stalemate. The Democrats' quandary over whether and how to ramp up cost controls could yet give Mr. Kennedy the chance to have such an impact.

HEADLINE: Governors Fear Medicaid Costs In Health Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss. 

 BODY:
The nation's governors, Democrats as well as Republicans, voiced deep concern Sunday about the shape of the health care plan emerging from Congress, fearing that Washington was about to hand them expensive new Medicaid obligations without money to pay for them. 
 The role of the states in a restructured health care system dominated the summer meeting of the National Governors Association here this weekend -- with bipartisan animosity voiced against the plan during a closed-door luncheon on Saturday and in a private meeting on Sunday with the health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius.
 ''I think the governors would all agree that what we don't want from the federal government is unfunded mandates,'' said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican, the group's incoming chairman. ''We can't have the Congress impose requirements that we are forced to absorb beyond our capacity to do so.'' 
 The governors' backlash creates yet another health care headache for the Obama administration, which has tried to recruit state leaders to pressure members of Congress to wrap up their fitful negotiations. Both Ms. Sebelius, who was Kansas' governor before she joined the cabinet in April, and the federal Medicaid chief, Cindy Mann, made appearances at the meeting on Sunday. Meanwhile, other administration officials spent the day pushing President Obama's proposal on television talk shows. 
 Mr. Obama also plans to address questions about his health plan at a news conference on Wednesday evening. 
 Ms. Sebelius emerged from her hour-long meeting with the governors saying that ''there's a recognition that states don't have cash right now'' and that ''it's difficult to send states the bill if they don't have the money.''
 Although many governors said significant change in how the nation handles health care was needed, they said their deep-seated fiscal troubles made it a terrible time to shift costs to the states. With the recession draining states of tax revenues even as their Medicaid rolls are surging, the National Governors Association projects that states will face aggregate deficits of $200 billion over the next three years. 
 Each of several health care bills coursing through Congress relies on a large increase in eligibility for Medicaid, the state and federal insurance program for the poor, as one means of moving toward universal coverage.
 Because the states and the federal government share the cost, any increase in eligibility levels, benefits or payments to doctors would impose new burdens on the states unless Washington absorbs them. In at least one of several bills circulating in Congress, the states would eventually pick up a share of the new costs, and the governors fear they cannot count on provisions in other bills that they will not bear costs. 
 It was unclear whether the governors would draft a statement expressing their dismay, at least partly because half of them did not attend. Many, including the group's chairman, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, stayed home to deal with budget crises.
 Some of the group's most notable names -- Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, Sarah Palin of Alaska, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana -- were not here.
 But the sentiment among those who were could not have been more consistent, regardless of political party. The governors said in interviews and public sessions that the bills being drafted in Congress would not do enough to curb the growth in health spending. And they said they were convinced that a major expansion of Medicaid would leave them with heavy costs.
 They are already anticipating large gaps in Medicaid financing after 2010, when stimulus money dries up. And they pointed out that Medicaid already suffered from low payment rates to health care providers, discouraging some doctors and hospitals from accepting beneficiaries. If Medicaid is expanded, states will almost surely have to increase payments to doctors to encourage more of them to participate.
 Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, said he feared Congress was about to bestow ''the mother of all unfunded mandates.'' 
 ''Medicaid is a poor vehicle for expanding coverage,'' added Mr. Bredesen, a former health care executive. ''It's a 45-year-old system originally designed for poor women and their children. It's not health care reform to dump more money into Medicaid.''
 Mr. Bredesen was far from alone in his concern. ''As a governor, my concern is that if we try to cost-shift to the states we're not going to be in a position to pick up the tab,'' said Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington, also a Democrat.
 ''I'm personally very concerned about the cost issue, particularly the $1 trillion figures being batted around,'' said Gov. Bill Richardson, the New Mexico Democrat who served in the Clinton cabinet and ran for president against Mr. Obama. 
 Asked about the concerns, Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, made two points. First, he said, one of Mr. Obama's overriding goals was to reduce the rate of growth of health costs, and that would benefit states by relieving pressure on their budgets. In addition, he said, some versions of the legislation, including the House bill, could slightly reduce state spending on Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program over the next 10 years.
 Many governors expressed frustration that the prolonged negotiations in Washington had made it difficult to gauge the potential impact on their budgets.
 ''There's a concern about whether they have fully figured out a revenue stream that would cover the costs, and that if they don't have all the dollars accounted for it will fall on the states,'' said Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, a Democrat. 
 Under the health care proposals before Congress, Medicaid eligibility would be based solely on income, without regard to factors that have historically been used to decide who qualifies. 
 In the House bill, Medicaid would be expanded to cover all nonelderly people with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level, or $29,300 for a family of four. The federal government would pay all the costs for those who were newly eligible. Medicaid would also cover newborns, for up to 60 days after birth, if they did not have insurance from other sources. 
 The Congressional Budget Office projects that 11 million more people would receive coverage through Medicaid under the House bill, and that it would increase federal Medicaid spending by $438 billion over 10 years. Medicaid thus accounts for about 40 percent of the cost and 30 percent of those who gain coverage.
 In a draft of the bill in the Senate Finance Committee, the federal government would pick up the extra costs for perhaps five years, but states would eventually have to pay their normal share. On average, the federal government pays 57 percent.
 One of the proposals being considered by the Finance Committee would encourage states to issue bonds to cover the costs of expanding Medicaid. Governors in both parties revolted, trumpeting their opposition in a conference call last week with Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who leads the committee. 
 ''There is strong bipartisan opposition to the idea of the states' issuing bonds to pay for operational expenses,'' said Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, chairman of the Republican Governors Association. ''One governor said it would be like taking out a mortgage to pay the grocery bill.''

HEADLINE: Event Shows U.S.-India Split on Climate

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: GURGAON, India 

 BODY:
It was supposed to be a showcase for how the United States and India can find common cause in fighting climate change: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton toured an innovative, energy-efficient office building on Sunday in this city on the outskirts of New Delhi.
 But simmering grievances about how countries should share the burden of cutting greenhouse gases abruptly changed the mood. No sooner had Mrs. Clinton marveled at the building's environmentally friendly features -- like windows that flood rooms with light but keep out heat -- than her hosts vented frustration at American pressure on India to cut its emissions. 
 In a meeting with Mrs. Clinton, India's environment and forests minister, Jairam Ramesh, said there was ''no case'' for the West to push India to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when it already had among the lowest levels of emissions on a per capita basis. ''If this pressure is not enough,'' he said, ''we also face the threat of carbon tariffs on our exports to countries such as yours.''
 Rather than projecting solidarity, the visit ended up laying bare the deep divide between developed and developing countries on climate policy -- a gulf the Obama administration will have to bridge as it tries to forge a new global agreement on climate change later this year.
 Mrs. Clinton, in the first visit to India by a top Obama administration official, offered reassurances that the United States had no intention of forcing India into an economically crippling deal.
 ''No one wants to, in any way, stall or undermine economic growth that is necessary to lift millions more people out of poverty,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference. ''The United States does not, and will not, do anything that would limit India's economic progress.''
 American officials said they did not expect these differences to be aired during what was supposed to be an upbeat event, focusing on technology. But they said they did not feel betrayed.
 To some extent, India's tough tone is a negotiating tactic as it and other countries prepare to advance their positions in talks leading up to a critical United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen in December. 
 ''We are simply not in a position to take over legally binding emission reduction targets,'' Mr. Ramesh declared at the news conference. ''That does not mean that we are oblivious of our responsibilities.''
 India's refusal to accept mandatory national cuts in emissions is neither new nor unique. China also opposes a deal with compulsory targets. Both countries say their economic growth should not be constrained when the West never faced such restrictions during its industrialization.
 India's stance may reflect its pique at a bill passed in Washington by the House of Representatives, which would impose sanctions on countries that did not accept binding emissions cuts.
 It may also reflect domestic political pressure because India acceded this month to an ''aspirational'' goal by the Group of 8 industrialized countries to cap the rise in temperatures because of global warming to two degrees Celsius. The group had sought a pledge of far-reaching reductions in global emissions. 
 Even the presence here of Todd Stern, Mrs. Clinton's special envoy for climate change, has raised eyebrows: On Saturday, The Times of India published an article with the headline ''Climate man's visit shocks India.'' American officials insist Mrs. Clinton had long planned to bring Mr. Stern, who said climate change presented an opportunity for India to invest in windmills and solar panels. ''India, with its knowledge base and entrepreneurial talent and elan, is well positioned to be a winner,'' he said.
 Mr. Ramesh leavened his tough words with a promise of cooperation in ''green technology.'' He proposed teaming up with the United States on solar energy and biomass, and setting up Indian-American centers to study the long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions.
 Despite India's opposition to binding reductions, he said the Indian government was committed to reaching an agreement in Copenhagen. ''It is possible for us to narrow our positions,'' he said.
 Mrs. Clinton also sought to put a good face on the differences. ''We have many more areas of agreement than has perhaps been appreciated,'' she said, ''and what we're looking for is a way to have a framework that includes everyone and which demands certain steps.''
 She still seemed fascinated by her tour of the office building, a squat structure built around a circular atrium and known as the ITC Green Center, which has been certified by an American green building council with its highest classification.
 Its owner, ITC Ltd., is a conglomerate that operates hotels and owns India's second-largest cigarette maker, a line of business that Indian officials say has made it eager to be regarded as a good corporate citizen. Mrs. Clinton compared the building to great Indian monuments like the Taj Mahal, though she conceded, ''No one will confuse it with the Taj Mahal.''

HEADLINE: Sharks Circle in Congress

 BODY:
The banking industry has made no secret of its desire to kill off President Obama's timely and important proposal to create a powerful new consumer protection agency. It's counting on the cooperation of lawmakers addicted to campaign contributions and eager to please their patrons. 
 But there are other sharks in the water. The administration must also fend off federal regulators, who far too often have placed the bankers' interests first and consumer protection second and want to preserve the status quo.
 The regulators are working mainly behind the scenes, but they surfaced during Congressional hearings last week. Elizabeth Duke, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said at a House hearing that the Fed was well situated to protect consumers. She said the Fed has ''the resources, the structure and the experience'' to create ''effective consumer protection in financial services.''
 It was an odd and unconvincing argument. In fact, the Fed and its fellow regulators seemed to look the other way during the buildup to the mortgage crisis, as was pointed out in testimony by Travis Plunkett, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America, which represents nearly 300 groups focused on consumer research, protection and education. 
 As Mr. Plunkett told Congress, the Federal Reserve was granted sweeping powers to fight predatory mortgage lending in 1994. But it did not issue new rules until July 30, 2008, he said, ''only after the world economy had collapsed due to the collapse of the U.S. housing market triggered by predatory lending.'' 
 Federal regulators did more than fail to protect consumers from predatory mortgages and usurious credit card rates. They also made the financial suffering worse by invalidating state fair-lending laws that might have shielded millions of people.
 Why? First, the main function of bank regulators is to ensure that banks are financially sound, not to protect consumers. Second, regulators like the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency get their budgets almost entirely from fees paid by the banks they oversee. Third, banks have been allowed to regulator-shop, moving from strong regulators to weaker ones. This created a regulatory rush to the bottom.
 At the moment, consumer protection is the unwanted stepchild in the regulatory community. The function of protecting consumers is spread across almost 20 statutes and is divided among seven different agencies. 
 The agency proposed by the White House would bring those functions into a single, strong unit that would have authority over all banks, credit card companies and credit-granting businesses. That would include the independent mortgage companies that created so much havoc and are not covered by federal banking regulators. There would be no more regulator shopping and states would be allowed to adopt laws more stringent than federal requirements.
 Banks and their minions in Congress have good reason to fear the proposed new agency. The administration will need to fight hard to see that it gets through Congress without being deliberately hobbled or gutted altogether.

HEADLINE: K.K.R., in Move to Go Public, Will Merge With European Sibling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, announced early Monday that it had reached a deal to merge with a European affiliate, giving it an Amsterdam listing and the option to later pursue a public listing in New York. 
 The independent directors of the affiliate, KKR Private Equity Investors, also known as K.P.E., approved the proposal, Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement. It ends a two-year effort by Kohlberg Kravis to go public, a move stymied by the turmoil in the credit markets that erupted last fall.
 Kohlberg Kravis also said that it expected to have earned $345 million to $370 million for the three months ended June 30, on $50.8 billion in assets. That represents a 16 percent drop in assets under management from the same time a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis lost nearly $12 million, under a measure it calls economic net loss, which excludes certain accounting charges.
 Under the terms of the plan, the two firms would combine their entities, with Kohlberg Kravis holding 70 percent of the combined business and K.P.E. investors holding 30 percent. While the initial combined business would be listed on Euronext Amsterdam, it could eventually seek to move its listing to the New York Stock Exchange.
 ''We are thrilled to be taking this next step in K.K.R.'s evolution,'' Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, Kohlberg Kravis's founders, said in a statement. ''We believe the combined business will be well-positioned to take advantage of the dynamic and exciting opportunities in asset management and financial services.''
 The deal is expected to close by Oct. 1, pending approval by a majority of K.P.E.'s unitholders. The proposal already has the support of 44 percent of the affiliate's investors.

HEADLINE: Methland Vs. Mythland

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Timothy Egan writes Outposts, a column at nytimes.com. Bob Herbert is off today.

 BODY:
Like a brief, intense summer squall, a media storm passed over small-town America a few years ago, stripping away what was left of the myth of the rural idyll to reveal a cast of hollow-cheeked white people smoking meth behind the corn silo.
 It was going to destroy the heartland, this methamphetamine epidemic, just as crack cocaine had done to the inner city. There was no George Bailey in this version of Bedford Falls. No John Mellencamp melodies on the soundtrack. Just toothless boys on bikes peddling some nasty stuff cooked up from cold medicine and farm products. 
 And then it all passed, as these things do, the damage done, leaving the impression of rural America as a broken land, scary. In the interim, the more traditional narrative, of country people somehow more authentic than city folk -- ''the best of America in these small towns'' -- came roaring back in the form of Sarah Palin. 
 In truth, neither of these images do justice to the complexities of small-town life. And neither of these versions do anything to advance the cause of an honest rural policy, something that might help some of the worst casualties of global economic tumult. 
 People in small towns are more likely to be poor, more likely to lack health insurance, more likely, if they are young, to move out, according to government statistics. In the invisible margins off the interstate, the story about decline takes place in slow motion, rarely attracting a headline. 
 Palin may soon hit the speech circuit as a woman from another era with an itchy Twitter finger. At the same time, we have a much different look at modern rural life in a new book by the journalist Nick Reding -- ''Methland: the Death and Life of an American Small Town.'' 
 Reding spent nearly four years charting meth's course in Oelwein, Iowa, a town of about 6,000 residents nearly 120 miles northeast of Des Moines. There, the people who grow our food are argribusiness oligarchs, and the people who run our factories have cut their workers' wages by two-thirds, dissolved the unions and shipped in illegals to work for a paycheck that would barely pay for dog food. 
 Meth is a symptom of this collapse, not a cause. And though its presence in small towns can be cancerous, it never took over rural America. The latest national surveys suggest that there are about 1.3 million regular users of meth -- hardly an epidemic in a country where 35 million people said they had used an illegal drug or abused a prescription one.
 Still, meth is different in at least one respect. Reding says it is ''the only example of a widely consumed illegal narcotic that might be called vocational, as opposed to recreational.'' It was given to starving Nazi soldiers to keep them in warrior mode on the Russian front. Now it's a preferred stimulant for people working two jobs in low-wage purgatory.
 ''Rural America remains the cradle of our national creation myth,'' Reding concludes. ''But it has become something else, too -- something more sinister and difficult to define.''
 Of the 1,346 counties that shrank in population between 2000 and 2007, 85 percent of them were outside the major metropolitan areas, according to the Census Bureau. Not far from Reding's story, the town of Postville has lost half its population just in the last year after one of the largest immigration raids in Iowa.
 Oelwein, like so many small towns trying to shape its destiny in an America that may have passed it by, has spruced up its Main Street, modernized its infrastructure and constructed a spec building ready for any employer who wants to move in. Alas, it's the same story in thousands of Oelweins: if you build it, they won't come.
 When candidate Barack Obama made that comment about bitter people in small towns clinging to guns and religion, he was criticized as a clueless elite from the big city. No one paid attention to the first part of what he said:
 ''You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration and the Bush administration.'' 
 Every president said he would do something about it, Obama continued, but never did.
 The mistake that Palin made was to cast small towns as more virtuous, morally superior in their struggle. The mistake that Obama made was to speak the truth. She can continue to pander all the way to the bank. But he has a chance to make a difference in places that are neither methland nor mythland, just overlooked parts of the same country.

HEADLINE: A Race to Provide Wi-Fi (But Not the Voice Part)

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THOUGH it is not yet clear how extensive the market is for in-flight Wi-Fi service, the competition to provide it is heating up. Row44, a California company whose in-flight Wi-Fi technology uses satellite connections, is emerging as an aggressive competitor to the market leader, Aircell, whose system uses ground-based stations.
 Aircell said it had installed its system, called Gogo, on 460 airplanes, with technicians working night shifts at airline maintenance centers across the country. The company hopes to have as many as 1,000 domestic airplanes outfitted by the end of the year. 
 Two airlines, Virgin America and AirTran, now have Gogo on their entire fleets. Other carriers installing the Aircell system are Delta, American and United. Delta expects to have 90 percent of its domestic mainline fleet outfitted by the end of September.
 Meanwhile, John Guidon, the chief executive and a co-founder of Row44, said the company was ready to begin installations, though it did not yet have a firm fleetwide contract. He estimated that Row44's system would be installed on 500 to 1,000 airplanes worldwide by the end of 2010.
 It would seem that Aircell is running so far ahead that competitors might be wary of entering the market. But Row44 is banking on making its domestic entry to the market aboard Southwest Airlines, which has been testing Row44 Wi-Fi on four of its more than 500 Boeing 737 aircraft. 
 Since June, after months of free trials on those planes, Southwest has been evaluating demand for the service at ''various price points,'' said a spokeswoman, Whitney Eichinger. 
 Alaska Airlines has also been testing the Row44 system on a single aircraft.
 Southwest is not expected to make any firm decisions on whether to install Wi-Fi fleetwide until after the summer. 
 The big question about in-flight broadband service has always been whether enough passengers would pay for it, especially during a poor economic period.
 ''Right now, as we run these trials we're seeing healthy single-digit numbers of paying customers ,'' Mr. Guidon said. He said that number was acceptable for the initial phase of development.
 ''We feel that's a conservative number,'' Mr. Guidon said. As more people acquire Wi-Fi enabled personal devices, which are easier to use in the cramped space of coach seats than laptops, ''this will become an essential service that customers will demand,'' he said.
 Aircell told me it cost about $100,000 to outfit an airplane with its land-based system. Mr. Guidon would not disclose how much the installation of Row44's satellite system costs for each plane, other than to say, ''It's quite a lot more, let's put it that way.''
 Prices for using the Aircell service have ranged as high as $12.95, depending on the length of a flight, though users of Wi-Fi enabled BlackBerrys and smartphones receive discounts. Last week, Aircell began offering a 24-hour pass for $12.95, covering multiple flights.
 Mr. Guidon anticipates that for Row44 service, airlines will charge about $10 for long-haul flights and $5 for short-hauls.
 Wi-Fi enabled devices, whether notebooks or smartphones, are capable of providing more than the Internet and e-mail. One big question surrounding the proliferation of smartphones and other Wi-Fi enabled devices on planes is whether they will soon lead to in-flight phone calls.
 Both the Aircell and Row44 systems are technically capable of providing voice-over-Internet protocol, called VoIP, service, which allows users to make phone calls over broadband Internet connections. 
 Aircell and Row44 both block the service for voice calls, but there are Web forums devoted solely to sharing tips on how to overcome the roadblocks.
 Like many probably bad ideas, there seems to be a certain inevitability to having people engage in phone calls aboard planes. In fact, some foreign carriers already allow it. 
 Earlier this year, for example, the big European budget airline Ryanair teamed up with a company called OnAir to install capability for making calls with cellphones, Wi-Fi enabled smartphones and BlackBerrys in flight on 20 airplanes.
 ''This is a political hot potato here in America, where there is concern over the social implications of having people talking on phones, annoying other passengers,'' Mr. Guidon said. ''Nevertheless, across the rest of the world this seems to be rolling out with no drama.''
 He said that airlines would ultimately decide whether it should become available.
 Until it does, ''we'll block voice over I.P.,'' he said. ''Nevertheless, there will continue to be a cat-and-mouse game between people who try to figure out ways of getting voice over I.P. over Row44 service and our attempts to stop them. I think that's just what makes the world go around.''

HEADLINE: String Quartets Alfresco, Surrounded by Sculpture and Sunsets

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
You could easily have missed the classical side of the Summergarden series at the Museum of Modern Art. Time was when these free concerts, performed by Juilliard School students in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, offered energizing bursts of contemporary music -- aural counterparts to the exhibitions inside -- every Friday and Saturday evening in July and August. The series was sidelined for three years during renovations, and when it returned in 2005, the concerts were moved to Sundays, with the Juilliard musicians alternating weeks with musicians from Jazz at Lincoln Center. 
 Now the August concerts have been jettisoned, so the Juilliard School's second program on Sunday -- four string quartets in their first New York performances -- was also its last. In an e-mail message Joel Sachs, who directs these concerts, blamed the recession for the cutback. 
 There seems, in any case, to be no lack of interest in the music: each performance drew about 900 listeners, the garden's capacity, and on Sunday dozens more crowded around the gate to the right of the stage, taking in the quirky, occasionally outlandish quartets from the street. 
 Jorg Widmann's endearingly peculiar, era-hopping ''Hunting'' Quartet (2003) opened the program. Mr. Widmann begins with a mute gesture: the players strike at the air with their bows, as if whipping invisible horses, and then shout as they head into an 18th-century hunting fanfare. The fanfare slowly dissolves as increasingly acerbic harmonies overwhelm the theme and transform the piece into a satirical evocation of a hunt by way of vigorous bowing, slides, pizzicato and further vocalizing, which returns with increasing frequency, duration and grotesqueness near the work's end. 
 The subtitle of David Flynn's Quartet No. 2, ''The Cranning'' (2005), refers to an ornament used in traditional Irish music that is the engine driving this work's finale. 
 Irish music is this Dublin composer's passion and main inspiration, and at times he has the quartet's two violinists digging into their instruments with the kind of power and grittiness you hear from Celtic fiddlers at their most raucous. Other influences creep in as well: in his program note Mr. Flynn lists Congolese, Zimbabwean and Balkan dance rhythms among his sources. Jazz and heavy metal are mentioned too, but those influences were harder to spot. 
 Daniel Bernard Roumain was represented by his early Quartet No. 1 (''X,'' 1993), written after reading ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' and before he perfected the genre-roaming style that is now his hallmark. It is an angry, insistent piece at first, but its fire is quickly subsumed in the purely musical energy of its Bartokian rhythms and harmonic brashness, and its five-minute duration does not permit much philosophizing. 
 Boguslaw Schaeffer, the only composer here not born in the 1970s (he turned 80 in June), practices an unusual form of chemistry in his Quartet No. 17 (2006). His themes are often long-lined and shapely. Heard on their own, some could pass as late Romanticism. But they are set in a thorny harmonic fabric that undercuts their appeal -- or is it that the beauty of the themes softens the harshness of Mr. Schaeffer's harmony? In any case, the juxtaposition, unusual at first, soon becomes predictable, and the 20-minute work's diffuse structure does it no favors. 
 The young players -- David Fulmer and Arthur Moeller, violinists; Jen Herman, violist; and Elizabeth Lara, cellist -- performed with an inviting vitality. 
 The Summergarden series ends with a jazz performance by the Dafnis Prieto Si o Si Quartet on Sunday at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, Museum of Modern Art; (212) 708-9400, moma.org.

HEADLINE: Chip Maker Profit Falls, But Worst May Be Past

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, said Monday its second-quarter profit fell 56 percent on a 27 percent decline in sales. 
 The company said sales were up from the first quarter as customers started building their inventories to more closely reflect demand. 
 ''For us, it's encouraging to see that revenue appears to have bottomed,'' Ron Slaymaker, vice president for investor relations, said. However, ''we don't necessarily see a significant strengthening in the broader economy,'' he said.
 Texas Instruments said it earned $260 million, or 20 cents a share, in the period, down from $588 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Revenue fell to $2.46 billion from $3.35 billion.
 The results were better than what analysts had been expecting. In a survey by Thomson Reuters, analysts on average had forecast a profit of 18 cents a share on sales of $2.41 billion.
 The company's third-quarter forecast for a profit of 29 to 39 cents a share, and revenue of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, was also better than most forecasts, which averaged 27 cents a share on sales of $2.52 billion.
 Sales in its three main divisions all fell compared with the year-earlier quarter but rose compared with the first quarter.
 Sales of analog chips used in music players and other personal devices fell 24 percent, to $983 million, from a year ago, but were up 21 percent from the first quarter. Sales of chips used in machinery and cars were down 20 percent, to $350 million, from last year but up 11 percent from the first quarter. And chips used in wireless devices like mobile phones were down 33 percent, to $601 million, from last year but up 9 percent from the first quarter.
 Orders in the second quarter were down 19 percent from last year but improved by 27 percent from the prior quarter.
 Mr. Slaymaker said he did not expect the company to cut any more jobs beyond those announced in January. The company has said it plans to cut 3,400 jobs, or 12 percent of its work force, through layoffs or attrition. 
 Texas Instruments released the results after the close of trading Monday. Shares in the company, which is based in Dallas, fell 31 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $23.30 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 60 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $23.61 during the regular session.

HEADLINE: TD Ameritrade Agrees To Auction-Rate Buyback

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The retail brokerage firm TD Ameritrade agreed on Monday to repurchase $456 million in auction-rate securities from investors as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general's office. 
 As the latest firm to reach a settlement, TD Ameritrade will repurchase all auction-rate securities it sold before Feb. 13, 2008, to individuals, charities, nonprofit groups, small businesses and institutions, the S.E.C said in a statement.
 TD Ameritrade, the brokerage unit of the TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, agreed to purchase all securities held by retail investors with accounts smaller than $250,000 within the next 75 days. It will repurchase the remaining securities by March 2010. The brokerage firm also agreed to reimburse investors who had sold their securities at a loss after the market for them collapsed last year.
 In the last year, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's office brokered a dozen settlements with other firms that wrote or sold the securities. Counting the settlements and others elsewhere around the country, more than 20 firms have agreed to repurchase $61 billion in the investments, according to the attorney general's office.
 In the auction-rate securities market, instruments that resembled corporate debt whose interest rates were reset at regular auctions, some as frequently as once a week, were traded. They were sold as being as safe as cash, but the market for them fell apart last year amid the downturn in the credit markets.
 Aside from the settlement with TD Ameritrade, Mr. Cuomo's office sent a notice Friday to Charles Schwab, saying it planned to sue the brokerage firm for claiming the securities were safe while selling them.
 The notice gives Schwab five business days to respond and resolve the investigation.
 In a statement, Charles Schwab said Mr. Cuomo's claims were without merit.
 The claims, ''unfairly lay blame on our company for an illiquid market and improper behavior by the large Wall Street firms that created and then, despite their obligations, stopped supporting auction-rate securities,'' the statement said. ''Schwab did not create the products and had no involvement in the events that led to the collapse'' of the securities market.

HEADLINE: Prostate Cancer and Health Care Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''In Health Reform, a Cancer Offers an Acid Test,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, front page, July 8): 
 At least five kinds of treatment are available to fight slow-growing, early-stage prostate cancer, but clinical questions remain over which results in the best patient outcome. That is a strong argument in support of patient-centered comparative effectiveness research. 
 Every body is different, and all patients deserve the best care possible. When comparative research is done right, it helps doctors know what works best for each patient. It leads to better health outcomes and could result in savings by reducing ineffective care. 
 This kind of research done wrong, however, could result in a cheapest-is-best approach to medicine, saving money but not saving lives or improving the quality of care. 
 There are bills in the House and the Senate that would create a strong framework for patient-centered comparative effectiveness research. We urge Congress to move forward with them as the health reform debate continues. 
 Tony Coelho Washington, July 15, 2009
 The writer, a former congressman from California, is chairman of the Partnership to Improve Patient Care.
 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt's ''prostate cancer test'' is a good but incomplete one for health care reform.
 In addition to removing financial incentives for high-tech intervention, we need to educate clinicians in the impartial, critical analysis of all therapeutic options, and in supporting their patients as they act on the choices they make.
 We need to realize that expensive, draconian treatment and ''watchful waiting'' are not our only choices. There is -- as Dean Ornish is showing in peer-reviewed studies on prostate cancer diet to fight cancer, and a number of us are doing with heart disease, diabetes, chronic pain, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder -- a far more promising third way. It is grounded in proven techniques of self-care, including dietary modification, physical exercise and mind-body approaches like meditation and yoga, and in group education and support.
 This approach holds great promise for treating and preventing chronic illness of all kinds and for saving large sums of money. It should be central to health care reform.
 James S. Gordon Washington, July 13, 2009
 The writer, a psychiatrist, is the founder and director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine and the author of ''Unstuck: Your Guide to the Seven-Stage Journey Out of Depression.''

HEADLINE: Home Burials Offering an Intimate Alternative, at a Lower Cost

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: PETERBOROUGH, N.H. 

 BODY:
When Nathaniel Roe, 92, died at his 18th-century farmhouse here the morning of June 6, his family did not call a funeral home to handle the arrangements.
 Instead, Mr. Roe's children, like a growing number of people nationwide, decided to care for their father in death as they had in the last months of his life. They washed Mr. Roe's body, dressed him in his favorite Harrods tweed jacket and red Brooks Brothers tie and laid him on a bed so family members could privately say their last goodbyes. 
 The next day, Mr. Roe was placed in a pine coffin made by his son, along with a tuft of wool from the sheep he once kept. He was buried on his farm in a grove off a walking path he traversed each day. 
 ''It just seemed like the natural, loving way to do things,'' said Jennifer Roe-Ward, Mr. Roe's granddaughter. ''It let him have his dignity.'' 
 Advocates say the number of home funerals, where everything from caring for the dead to the visiting hours to the building of the coffin is done at home, has soared in the last five years, putting the funerals ''where home births were 30 years ago,'' according to Chuck Lakin, a home funeral proponent and coffin builder in Waterville, Me. 
 The cost savings can be substantial, all the more important in an economic downturn. The average American funeral costs about $6,000 for the services of a funeral home, in addition to the costs of cremation or burial. A home funeral can be as inexpensive as the cost of pine for a coffin (for a backyard burial) or a few hundred dollars for cremation or several hundred dollars for cemetery costs.
 The Roes spent $250. 
 More people are inquiring about the lower-cost options, said Joshua Slocum, director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit watchdog group. ''Home funerals aren't for everybody, but if there's not enough money to pay the mortgage, there certainly isn't enough money to pay for a funeral,'' Mr. Slocum said. 
 Baby boomers who are handling arrangements for the first time are particularly looking for a more intimate experience. 
 ''It's organic and informal, and it's on our terms,'' said Nancy Manahan of Minneapolis, who helped care for her sister-in-law, Diane Manahan, after she died of cancer in 2001, and was a co-author of a book, ''Living Consciously, Dying Gracefully,'' about the experience. ''It's not having strangers intruding into the privacy of the family. It's not outsourcing the dying process to professionals.'' 
 While only a tiny portion of the nation's dead are cared for at home, the number is growing. There are at least 45 organizations or individuals nationwide that help families with the process, compared with only two in 2002, Mr. Slocum said. 
 The cost of a death midwife, as some of the coaches call themselves, varies from about $200 for an initial consultation to $3,000 if the midwife needs to travel. 
 In Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska and New York, laws require that a funeral director handle human remains at some point in the process. In the 44 other states and the District of Columbia, loved ones can be responsible for the body themselves. 
 Families are typically required to obtain the death certificate and a burial transit permit so the body can be moved from a hospital to a cemetery, or, more typically, a crematory. 
 But even in states where a funeral director is required, home funerals are far less expensive. 
 ''I think with our economy being the way that it currently is, and it's getting worse, that many people who may not have chosen to do these types of things may be forced to because of the finances,'' said Verlene McLemore, of Detroit, who held a home funeral for her son, Dean, in 2007. She spent about $1,300 for a funeral director's services.
 Some families, like the Roes, choose burial on private land, with a town permit. In most states, those rules are an issue of local control. ''Can Grandma be buried in the backyard? Yes, for the most part if the backyard is rural or semirural,'' said Mr. Slocum. 
 (Some members of Michael Jackson's family have spoken of making Neverland Ranch near Santa Barbara the singer's final resting place, but officials say no one has submitted an application to the California Cemetery and Funeral Bureau, which would have to approve the home burial.)
 Recently, some states, with the backing of the funeral industry, have considered restricting the practice of home funerals. Oregon legislators last month passed a bill that would require death midwives to be licensed, something no state currently does.
 Many death midwives are like Jerrigrace Lyons, who was asked to participate in the home funeral of a close friend, a 54-year-old woman who died unexpectedly in 1994. Ms. Lyons was initially frightened at the prospect of handling the body, but she participated anyway. 
 The experience was life changing, she said, and inspired her to help others plan home funerals. She opened Final Passages in Sebastopol, Calif., in 1995 and said she had helped more than 300 families with funerals. Weekend workshops for those interested in home funerals have a waiting list.
 Ms. Lyons educates the bereaved about the realities of after-death care: placing dry ice underneath the body to keep it cool, tying the jaw shut so it does not open. 
 Mr. Lakin, a woodworker, makes coffins specifically for home funerals. Ranging in price from $480 to $1,200, they double as bookcases, entertainment centers and coffee tables until they need to be used. 
 He became interested in home funerals after his father died 30 years ago and he felt there was a ''disconnect'' during the funeral process. Mr. Lakin is now a resource for funeral directors in central Maine and a local hospice.
 His coffins are sold to people like Ginny Landry, 77, who wants a home funeral one day but is content to use her coffin to showcase the quilts she makes. It once stood in her bedroom, but her husband, Rudolph, made her move it to a guest room because he pictured her in the coffin every time he laid eyes on it. 
 ''It's very comforting to me, knowing I have it there so my children won't have to make a decision as to where I'm going to go,'' Ms. Landry said. 
 During her battle with cancer, Diane Manahan also requested a home funeral, and the family did not know then how much it would help them with their grief.
 ''There's something about touching, watching, sitting with a body that lets you know the person is no longer there,'' Nancy Manahan said. ''We didn't even realize how emotionally meaningful those rituals are, doing it ourselves, until we did it.''

HEADLINE: Suits Against Critics Rise in Cambodia

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia 

 BODY:
Cambodia's courts have been busy in recent weeks with cases of defamation, disinformation and incitement brought by the government in what critics say is part of a broad assault on civil liberties.
 ''If you're just walking into the situation, it seems like a series of ridiculous lawsuits,'' said Sara Colm, a senior researcher for the New York-based rights group Human Rights Watch, who said at least nine lawsuits have recently been filed against critics and political opponents by Prime Minister Hun Sen and his supporters.
 But she and other analysts say the targets seem carefully chosen to send a chill through the free press, independent judiciary, political opposition and civic organizations that were introduced by the United Nations in the early 1990s. 
 The surge in lawsuits amounts to ''a serious threat to democratic development, which may undermine the efforts of the past 16 years to rebuild a tolerant and pluralistic environment in Cambodia,'' the United Nations human rights office in Cambodia said in a statement in June.
 In the most prominent cases, two opposition politicians have been stripped of their parliamentary immunity and sued for libel by Mr. Hun Sen and his associates. Threatened with a lawsuit and disbarment, their lawyer has abandoned the case, apologized to the prime minister and pledged allegiance to the ruling party.
 The editor of one of the country's last opposition newspapers was sent to prison in June for articles he had published, and another, soon afterward, apologized and agreed to shut down his newspaper to avoid court action.
 A young political activist was convicted of defamation in June and jailed for spray-painting slogans critical of the government on the walls of his house. 
 ''The court has always been used as a political tool,'' said Theary C. Seng, whose leadership of a human rights group, the Center for Social Development, is being challenged in what she says is a politically motivated court case. ''But recently, there is a concentration of cases which seem to be very political and which seem to use the court as a political tool to silence opposition voices.''
 Mr. Hun Sen dismisses, and even appears to parody, his critics, declaring earlier this month that he was acting in the interests of democracy by stripping the two lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity so that they could face prosecution in the courts.
 ''From now on we are strengthening democracy and the rule of law,'' he said. ''This is not an anarchic democracy. Democracy must have the rule of law.''
 Together with land seizures that are driving tens of thousands of people from their homes, analysts say these actions demonstrate a sense of impunity in a government that has resisted efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Cambodia.
 In the most recent evictions, about 150 poor families were forced from their homes on prime land in Phnom Penh on Thursday and Friday, part of what the World Bank called ''a major problem'' in Cambodia's fast-growing cities.
 The court cases come at a time when countries in the region are looking increasingly toward China as a political and economic model and questioning the democratic and humanitarian values of the West.
 In recent years, China has become a major donor and investor in Cambodia in projects that do not place the kinds of demands on governing and management that generally accompany assistance from Western nations and aid organizations.
 ''We have been fearing all along that Cambodia's government is looking eastward toward China and Vietnam as models,'' with their strong central governments and intolerance of dissent, said Ou Virak, president of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights.
 ''Now there are a lot of activities recently that confirm our fear, and so it's pretty scary,'' he said. ''What they are trying to do is to have only one strong party, and ultimately probably only one party.''
 The aggressiveness of the government has been matched by what appears to be resigned acquiescence among many of its opponents to the dominance of Mr. Hun Sen and his ruling elite in the Cambodian People's Party.
 Nothing demonstrates this more sharply than the apologies that Mr. Hun Sen apparently requires as the price of leniency.
 ''I ask permission to demonstrate deep respect and bow down to apologize,'' said Dam Sith, editor in chief of Moneaksekar Khmer, a pro-opposition newspaper, as he promised earlier this month to cease publication of his 10-year-old newspaper.
 ''I have in the past committed inappropriate acts again and again,'' he said, adding that his only hope to avoid a defamation conviction is the ''compassion and forgiveness'' of Mr. Hun Sen -- which he duly received.

HEADLINE: Stores Go Dark Where Buyers Once Roamed

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Among the marks of Manhattan's prosperity in recent years were the thousands of restaurants and shops that opened to meet an ever-growing demand. Confident in the appetite for spending -- on expensive shampoo at 24-hour drugstores, cheese plates at sleek wine bars and clothes at minimalist boutiques -- store owners signed high-rent leases with little haggling.
 But as New Yorkers have drastically cut back, the shops that line the streets, from chain outlets to family-run shops, have started to disappear.
 The storefront vacancy rate in Manhattan is now at its highest point since the early 1990s -- an estimated 6.5 percent -- and is expected to exceed 10 percent by the middle of next year, according to data gathered by Marcus & Millichap Research Services, a national real estate investment brokerage based in Encino, Calif. 
 And those numbers do not capture the full story. Some of the more desirable shopping districts are littered with empty storefronts. For example, Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and 49th Street, the stretch just south of Saks Fifth Avenue, has a vacancy rate of 15.3 percent, according to the brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.
 In SoHo, from West Houston Street to Grand Street and Broadway to West Broadway, among the high-end boutiques, art galleries and restaurants, 1 in 10 retail spaces are now empty or about to be.
 ''I've never seen such an across-the-board problem,'' said Lorraine Nadel, a lawyer who has represented tenants and landlords for 18 years. ''Store owners can't pay their rent, and they can't keep their businesses going.''
 It has long been difficult to run a small business in Manhattan, but a number of struggling store owners cite high rents and their landlords' unwillingness to negotiate as the leading obstacles to their survival.
 ''It's a crisis,'' said Stephen Null, director of the Coalition for Fair Business Rents, which has been promoting legislation to protect small businesses in lease negotiations since 1984. ''Lease renewals are the single biggest killer of small businesses in New York City.''
 Manhattan, with its high density, high incomes and near-constant foot traffic, has maintained a strong storefront culture while other urban areas have seen their downtowns empty out and lose customers to suburban malls. 
 Stores and restaurants in New York are open longer hours, increasing the potential for revenue, and residents tend to shop near where they live, if just by necessity.
 But because stores are such a part of their neighborhoods, the closings can have more of an emotional impact on residents. 
 ''New York is different than the rest of America because it is the last bastion of storefronts,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, a historian at Columbia University. ''You don't live in a city of eight and a half million people. You live in a city of neighborhoods.''
 ''We feel a loss when the store is gone,'' he added. 
 In one block alone, on the west side of Lexington Avenue between 74th and 75th Streets, three stores have closed in the past few months: a women's clothing shop called Cantaloup, a luggage shop and a design store -- places that the locals say had thrived for years. Those closings followed that of a sandwich shop across the street.
 ''The fabric of the neighborhood is up for grabs right now,'' said Elaine Abelson, a professor of history at the New School who has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years.
 The outlook is even worse in other boroughs. Hessam Nadji, managing director of research services at Marcus & Millichap, estimates that vacancy rates in Brooklyn and Queens, currently at 7 to 10 percent, will rise to 12 to 15 percent by year's end. He said some neighborhoods have been ravaged by vacancy rates of 25 to 40 percent.
 The problem is so bad that the city has become involved. It has offered grants for worker training, and it held a session last Wednesday on how to negotiate leases. Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, held a conference called ''Rescue and Recovery for Small Businesses'' on July 13 that drew 320 people, among them owners of an organic grocery store, a wine bar, and a coffeehouse and bookstore who swapped advice on how to keep their businesses afloat.
 High rents in the recession are the ''last straw for small business in New York City,'' Mr. Stringer said, ''and I hear it everywhere I go.'' 
 Without these storefronts, he said, the city loses ''our special sauce that gives us our panache.'' 
 The City Council is weighing in, too, considering a Small Business Survival Act that would require businesses to have the option of 10-year leases, renewals and the right to mediation if they cannot reach an agreement.
 The legislation does not have the support of the Bloomberg administration, which argues that tracking lease negotiations would be too costly because of expenses like hiring staff, and that the need for such a law has ''greatly dissipated'' because rents have declined. 
 But as jobs disappear and neighborhoods suffer, the tide of opinion is growing that the government may need to step in. While data on the challenges of small business owners is limited, a survey of 937 Hispanic small business owners conducted by the U.S.A. Latin Chamber of Commerce between November 2008 and January 2009 found that most of them said they would not stay in the city because their rents had become so high. 
 The closing of stores has started to chip away at the city's tax collections. Sales tax revenues have declined by 3 percent through May, to $4.15 billion from $4.3 billion the year before, according to the city's Office of Management and Budget.
 Some neighborhoods seem better positioned to hold on to their storefronts. Times Square has had relatively fewer closings because more people have been staying in town for vacations and attending Broadway shows, said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. Doug Griebel, president of the Columbus Avenue Business Improvement District and an owner of the Rosa Mexicano restaurants, said there were only two vacant storefronts on Columbus between 67th and 82nd Streets. 
 Gary Schwartzman, broker with Grubb & Ellis, a commercial real estate firm, said many landlords were trying to find ways to keep retail businesses open.
 ''The risk of losing a good tenant is something that landlords don't want,'' Mr. Schwartzman said. ''Right now, it's all about tenant retention.''
 Ms. Nadel, the lawyer, says that if a landlord tells her that he or she will not negotiate with tenants, she points to a stack of eviction files and says the chances of finding a new tenant are slim. 
 ''You can't maintain the rents,'' she says she tells them. ''People have run through their savings. They've run through everything.''

HEADLINE: Big Estimate, Worth Little, On Bailout

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Just how much could the bailout of the financial system end up costing American taxpayers?
 Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program set up by the Treasury Department, came up with the largest number yet in testimony prepared for delivery Tuesday to a House committee. ''The total potential federal government support could reach up to $23.7 trillion,'' he stated.
 But in the report accompanying his testimony, Mr. Barofsky conceded the number was vastly overblown. It includes estimates of the maximum cost of programs that have already been canceled or that never got under way. 
 It also assumes that every home mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac goes into default, and all the homes turn out to be worthless. It assumes that every bank in America fails, with not a single asset worth even a penny. And it assumes that all of the assets held by money market mutual funds, including Treasury bills, turn out to be worthless.
 It would also require the Treasury itself to default on securities purchased by the Federal Reserve system.
 The sheer unreality of the number did not stop some members of Congress from taking the estimate seriously.
 ''The potential financial commitment the American taxpayers could be responsible for is of a size and scope that isn't even imaginable,'' said Representative Darrell E. Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which will hold the hearing. ''If you spent a million dollars a day going back to the birth of Christ, that wouldn't even come close to just one trillion dollars -- $23.7 trillion is a staggering figure.''
 Mr. Issa's staff distributed a briefing memo for Republicans on the committee that quoted the testimony relating to the $23.7 trillion number, but did not mention any of the qualifications contained in the report.
 In an interview Monday evening, Mr. Barofsky said he did not view his testimony as misleading. 
 ''We're not suggesting that we're are looking at a potential loss to the government of $23 trillion,'' he said. ''Our goal is to bring transparency, to put things in context.''
 Asked what he thought the maximum total cost could be, he replied that it was not his job to estimate that, and declined to give a figure.
 Mr. Barofsky has no authority to investigate most of the programs he discussed. He came up with far smaller numbers for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, that he is charged with monitoring. Of the $700 billion appropriated by Congress, the Treasury has so far spent $441 billion, and about $70 billion of that has been repaid.
 ''TARP does not operate in a vacuum,'' Mr. Barofsky said in his prepared testimony. To properly evaluate that spending, ''the context of these broader efforts'' must be considered.
 That $23.7 trillion figure would amount to about $77,000 for every person in the United States, and would be almost $10 trillion more than the country's entire economic output, which is $14.1 trillion.
 To reach that figure, Mr. Barofsky added up all possible Federal Reserve programs, and got a total of $6.8 trillion. He figured the TARP program could end up costing $3 trillion, including possible spending by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Fed. 
 For those totals to be reached, every dollar invested by the government in banks would have to become worthless, and the banks would have to default on securities guaranteed by the F.D.I.C. All the collateral posted by the banks to get loans from the Fed would also have to become worthless.
 Added to those figures are $4.4 trillion in other possible Treasury programs, and $2.3 trillion in F.D.I.C. guarantees of deposits. The final $7.2 trillion comes mostly from various mortgage-related programs.
 Even if all those numbers somehow turned out to be accurate, the report conceded that the total would be smaller because ''there is potential for double-counting of exposures where different federal agencies provide guarantees for the same financial institutions.''
 The report does not appear to discuss how total government obligations are increased when the Fed either guarantees or purchases Treasury securities. In the interview, Mr. Barofsky declined to address that question.
 Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, called the figures ''distorted'' because they did not consider the value of the collateral posted for loan programs, as well as the value of securities the Treasury has received from banks.
 ''These estimates of potential exposures do not provide a useful framework for evaluating the potential cost of these programs,'' Mr. Williams said, according to Bloomberg News. ''This estimate includes programs at their hypothetical maximum size, and it was never likely that the programs would be maxed out at the same time.''
 He added that the United States had spent less than $2 trillion so far, and that much of that was backed by valuable assets.
 It may be the first time that $2 trillion appears to be a small number.

HEADLINE: Markets, Buoyed by Leading Indicators, Gain Momentum

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Most Americans are still waiting for this painful recession to end. But on Wall Street, new signs that the economy just may be turning heartened investors on Monday. 
 The broad stock market leapt to its highest level since the bleak days of November on news that the index of leading economic indicators, which is used to spot peaks and troughs in the economy, rose in June for a third consecutive month -- something it had not done since 2004. Hopes that the CIT Group, the troubled commercial lender, would avert bankruptcy added to the buoyant mood. 
 While the economy remains fragile -- some experts warn that any incipient recovery could falter, resulting in a ''double dip'' recession -- optimism on Wall Street seems to be growing. The June leading indicators, coupled with a run of healthy earnings reports from major banks and corporations in recent days, added to the growing sense that the worst was over and that the recession was at least easing. 
 While many Wall Street traders remained cautious about pushing share prices much higher, momentum seemed to be building in the marketplace. The chief United States investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, for instance, raised his year-end target for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Monday to 1,060 -- a level nearly 11.5 percent higher than Monday's close.
 ''There's a loud noise coming from reports turning out better than expected,'' said James W. Paulson, the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''We've got tons of information telling us we've turned the corner.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 104.21 points, or 1.19 percent, to 8,848.15, driven by big gains in Caterpillar, Alcoa and Walt Disney. Since June 10, the blue-chip index has gained 8.6 percent to land back in positive territory for the year.
 The S.& P. 500 jumped 10.75 points, or 1.14 percent, to 951.13, its highest level since November. It has gained 41 percent since early March. 
 The Nasdaq composite index climbed 22.68 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,909.29.
 The index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7 percent in June, the Conference Board reported. Seven of the 10 leading indicators released Monday -- including building permits, stock prices and initial jobless claims -- improved in June. Analysts now say that another strong week of earnings reports could lure hesitant investors back into the fray and begin the next bull run.
 ''Momentum is on our side,'' said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''There's a lot of sideline money right now. They're not yet convinced that the train's leaving the station without them, but whenever they feel compelled to go in, that's when you might see this market spike to 1,000.''
 As of last week, 71 percent of the companies in the S.& P. 500 reported earnings that surpassed expectations, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.
 Still, Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, warned on Monday that economic growth next year was ''very much in doubt.'' 
 In an interview with Bloomberg News, Mr. Summers said, ''I don't feel there's a basis for predicting that income growth is going to resume in the near term.'' 
 Adding to the optimism on Monday was news that CIT, one of the nation's largest lenders to small and midsize businesses, was nearing a deal for emergency financing. On Sunday, the company's bondholders agreed to supply a $3 billion emergency loan that would buy some time for the 101-year-old company to restructure its looming debt burden outside of bankruptcy. 
 European shares also rose on the strength of CIT. The FTSE 100 index in Britain was 54.87 points, or 1.25 percent higher at 4,443.62, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 51.75 points, or 1.04 percent, to 5,030.15. The CAC-40 in France gained 52.48 points, or 1.63 percent, to 3,270.94.
 Investors will closely watch earnings reports throughout this week and next week. Texas Instruments announced results on Monday; Apple, Coca-Cola and Caterpillar will follow on Tuesday. 
 In addition to stocks, the oil market has seen a resurgence on the steady stream of robust earnings. 
 Further aided by a weak dollar, contracts for crude delivery in August rose 42 cents, to $63.98 a barrel. 
 Oil traders cannot seem to reach a consensus on how the world economy and its appetite for oil will shape up, but prices have been rising since crude hit a low of $59.52 a barrel on July 14.
 Analysts said that the markets are now pricing in expectations that reports later this week will show a decline in oil inventories in the United States. Moreover, a sudden pickup in demand from China in particular, analysts say, could be expected after Beijing officials reported growth of 7.9 percent in the second quarter, comfortably surpassing projections.
 ''China is compelling; it's what we're paying attention to,'' said John Kilduff, vice president of MF Global, who believes that $70 a barrel will shortly be reached.
 ''All it'll take is another week or two of declining crude oil inventories. Even the good signs on the earnings front and today's leading economic indicator played into the thesis that things are picking up,'' he said.
 Bond yields slipped as stocks gained. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.65 percent late Friday. The price rose 10/32, to 96 1/32. 
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Lobbyists Adopt a Tone of Conciliation Toward Obama and His Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and RON NIXON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Top lobbyists for the banking industry were gathered in a war council. The Obama administration had proposed big changes in financial industry oversight, including a consumer protection commission and regulation of some executives' paychecks. The lobbyists listened to presentations from big Washington public affairs firms ready to deploy arsenals including television commercials and direct-mail campaigns.
 But at the end of the meeting, the lobbyists publicly opted to emphasize, if with caveats, their industry's backing of President Obama's broader call for reform.
 Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial Services Roundtable and a participant in the discussion, said in an interview, ''This administration has reminded us of the lesson our mother taught us: If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.'' 
 And so it goes the length of K Street. Industry groups and lobbyists typically hostile to intrusive government programs have been professing solidarity with Mr. Obama and his agenda on matters like health care, energy and financial regulation. Industry has calculated that it stands a better chance of achieving its ends by negotiating with the White House than by fighting it -- at least publicly, and at least until the various proposals get down to the final details. 
 For partisans who are more ideological, the parade of industry lobbyists trooping to the White House is unnerving. Conservatives fret that to avoid a messy fight, their business allies are selling out too cheaply, while liberals voice the same worry about the White House and its Congressional supporters. Some lobbyists argue that all the ''kumbaya,'' as several called it, may be reaching its final chorus, for instance with banks' efforts to redirect the regulatory overhaul. 
 ''We have sort of a dual goal,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''One is to support comprehensive reform, and the other is to kill the consumer financial protection commission.''
 In any case, the administration's emphasis on inviting in business lobbyists has arguably changed the way Washington does business as much as any of the White House's new rules intended to shut them out. 
 ''The Obama people have very skillfully said, 'Hey, we are working on this, and if you want a seat at the table you can't be out there throwing rocks at us,' '' said Doug Goodyear, chief executive of DCI Group, a corporate public affairs firm. ''And that has restrained large corporations or trade associations from waging full-scale campaigns.''
 In the last two weeks, the American Medical Association has endorsed the House's version of the health care overhaul, and lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies and for-profit hospitals have stood with the White House to pledge billions in cost cuts so long as the proposed public health insurance program does not threaten to undercut them. The drug companies are even underwriting television commercials supporting an overhaul. 
 Lobbyists for coal-powered electric utilities say they are backing House emissions-cap legislation as it moves to the Senate, so long as they can perhaps loosen the caps a bit and retain subsidies that the House provided to win their support.
 Lockheed Martin publicly washed its hands of any lobbying to save its F-22 fighter jet contract from Pentagon cuts, then watched as its unions, subcontractors and Congressional allies persuaded House committees to restore the plane. (The White House is threatening a veto.)
 And Wall Street firms insist that they welcome more oversight, so long as it does not cramp their profits or involve checks on compensation.
 Conservatives complain that the support for ''reform'' deprives them of firepower. ''Disgusting,'' said Amy Menefee of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. 
 Ms. Menefee's organization recently announced a $1.2 million advertising campaign against the health care overhaul, but she said none of that campaign's cost was being paid by the industry.
 Similarly, Patrick Creighton, a spokesman for the oil-industry-backed American Energy Alliance, said that group had been unable to finance a full assault on the greenhouse-gas emissions limits. The alliance wound up spending only about $200,000, for radio commercials in 10 districts, before the bill passed the House, Mr. Creighton said.
 ''Why didn't the floodgates open?'' he said. Because ''a lot of industry was at the table looking for their cutouts and carve-outs'' -- that is, special treatment.
 Liberals, meanwhile, say they fear that the White House and Democratic Congressional leaders are conceding too much. The House emissions bill, for example, gave away as sweeteners about 85 percent of the emissions permits that Mr. Obama had proposed to sell at auction. 
 Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called the emissions bill a cautionary lesson for the health care fight.
 ''Collaboration can turn into concessions,'' said Mr. Grijalva, who recently sent the president a letter saying the caucus feared accepting conditions in exchange for the support of hospitals or drug makers.
 The conciliatory tone on K Street has combined with the recession to tamp down lobbying firms' revenue. Total reported lobbying spending was about $789 million in the first quarter, roughly flat from the corresponding period last year. 
 Health industry spending rose about 10 percent, to some $126 million, but financial industry spending fell about 7 percent, to $110 million. And even in the face of a major overhaul of the Pentagon's budget, spending by the defense industry dropped a bit, to roughly $30 million. 
 ''The issues are more complicated,'' said Charles M. Campion, a founder of the public affairs firm Dewey Square Group, ''but the budgets are smaller.''
 Certain lobbyists with strong Democratic connections have bucked the revenue tide, though. The Podesta Group, whose chairman, Tony Podesta, is a top Democratic fund-raiser and the brother of the Obama administration's transition chief, John D. Podesta, reported that first-quarter lobbying fees were up 60 percent, to $5.4 million, from $3.4 million a year ago. 
 At the firm of Steve Elmendorf, a longtime aide to Richard A. Gephardt, a former House Democratic leader, fees jumped nearly 24 percent, to about $1.6 million.
 Mr. Elmendorf said he encouraged clients to work with the administration. ''Look at the landscape,'' he tells them, ''and realize the Democrats will control the White House, House and Senate for at least four years.''
 Republican lobbyists say they are growing tired with the talk about shared goals.
 ''How do you oppose such a popular president, especially when he has a style that seems so inviting and sensible?'' said Ed Rogers, a Reagan administration official whose lobbying firm, BGR Group, reported a 13 percent decline in first-quarter fees, to about $4.1 million.
 ''A lot of the typical industry players that would, on paper, be against these initiatives,'' Mr. Rogers said, ''have been in part co-opted and in part intimidated by the administration.''

HEADLINE: Help Wanted

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
If the Obama administration has a strategy for reviving manufacturing, Douglas Bartlett would like to know what it is. 
 Buffeted by foreign competition, Mr. Bartlett recently closed his printed circuit board factory, founded 57 years ago by his father, and laid off the remaining 87 workers. Last week, he auctioned off the machinery, and soon he will raze the factory itself in Cary, Ill. 
 ''The property taxes are no longer affordable,'' Mr. Bartlett said glumly, ''so I am going to tear down the building and sit on the land, and hopefully sell it after the recession when land prices hopefully rise.''
 Though manufacturing has long been in decline, the loss of factory jobs has been especially brutal of late, with nearly two million disappearing since the recession began in December 2007. Even a few chief executives, heading companies that have shifted plenty of production abroad, are beginning to express alarm. 
 ''We must make a serious commitment to manufacturing and exports. This is a national imperative,'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said in a speech last month, while acknowledging that G.E. was enriched by its overseas operations too. 
 President Obama, agreeing in effect, has declared, ''The fight for American manufacturing is the fight for America's future.''
 The United States ranks behind every industrial nation except France in the percentage of overall economic activity devoted to manufacturing -- 13.9 percent, the World Bank reports, down 4 percentage points in a decade. The 19-month-old recession has contributed noticeably to this decline. Industrial production has fallen 17.3 percent, the sharpest drop during a recession since the 1930s.
 So far, however, Mr. Obama's administration has not come up with a formal plan to address the rapid decline. Instead, it has pursued ad hoc initiatives -- bailing out General Motors and Chrysler, for example, and pushing green energy by supporting the manufacture of items like wind turbines and solar panels. 
 ''We want to make sure that we grow a manufacturing base for renewable energy,'' said Matthew Rogers, a senior adviser in the Energy Department, explaining that this is being accomplished in part by ''accelerating loan guarantees from zero'' in the Bush years. 
 Xunming Deng, a physicist and the chairman of the Xunlight Corporation, sees himself as a beneficiary of what he describes as the Obama administration's more flexible loan guarantees. His factory in Toledo, Ohio, with 100 employees, is in the early stages of making solar panels, and Dr. Deng is already planning to quadruple the plant's size. He has applied to the Energy Department for a $120 million loan guarantee. If he gets it, he will not have to pay the hefty fees charged for loan guarantees before Mr. Obama took office.
 ''Getting rid of that fee makes the loan guarantee very attractive and very helpful,'' Dr. Deng said. ''We can't grow as fast without it.''
 Beyond energy, the administration's approach gradually outlines the elements of a manufacturing policy -- what Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council, described as ''a number of things to support manufacturing.'' 
 The auto bailout, for all its improvisations, served notice that the administration would probably rescue any giant manufacturer it deemed too big (or too iconic) to fail, and would help the suppliers of failing giants transition to other industries.
 The Buy America clause in the stimulus package pointedly favors the purchase of American-made goods for infrastructure projects. The Commerce Department is adding $100 million, more than double the current outlay, to a program that helps American manufacturers operate more effectively. And trade agreements negotiated by the Bush administration -- agreements that would make the United States more open to imported manufactured goods -- have been allowed to languish in Congress.
 ''The administration's policy is evolving in the right direction,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who is particularly concerned about auto imports. ''I think they have essentially shed the political chains that prevented government from having a role in manufacturing. They are working their way toward what makes sense.''
 Not everyone agrees. 
 ''Bush and Obama,'' Mr. Bartlett said scornfully, ''one is as bad as the other in terms of manufacturing policy.''
 He acknowledged that the recession was the immediate reason for the demise of his family's business. But what really did it in, he said in an interview, was the competition from less expensive Chinese circuit boards -- less expensive, he argued, because the Chinese undervalue their currency and this administration, like the ones before it, lets them get away with it.
 ''Our orders went from $8 million at an annual rate to $4 million, which was not enough to make money,'' he said.
 Mr. Bartlett, who is co-chairman of an organization called the Fair Currency Coalition, said that Chinese competitors charged only $1 for each printed circuit board sold in this country, while he charged $1.40. Like many economists and government officials, he says he believes the Chinese currency is artificially undervalued. As a countermeasure, he said the Obama administration should impose a 40 percent tariff on imported Chinese goods. 
 ''I can compete against Chinese entrepreneurs, and Chinese labor cost is not that big a factor,'' he said, ''but I cannot compete against the Chinese government's manufacturing policies.''
 Manufacturing has long been viewed as an essential pillar of a powerful economy. It generates millions of well-paid jobs for those with only a high school education, a huge segment of the population. No other sector contributes more to the nation's overall productivity, economists say. And as manufacturing weakens, the country becomes ever more dependent on imports of merchandise, computers, machinery and the like -- running up a trade deficit that in time could undermine the dollar and the nation's capacity to sustain so many imports.
 One tactic for strengthening the manufacturing sector, in the administration's view, would be a shift in tax policy. The research and development tax credit, which is now subject to renewal by Congress, would be made permanent, encouraging much more R.& D. among manufacturers, a senior Commerce Department official argued. And foreign taxes paid on profits earned overseas would not be deductible in this country until the profits were repatriated, a restriction that might discourage locating factories abroad. 
 The goal is to arrest manufacturing's dizzying decline. It ''was the pillar on which we built the middle class,'' said Thea Lee, policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., ''and it is hard to see how you rebuild the middle class without reviving manufacturing.''

HEADLINE: Liberal Suicide March

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
It was interesting to watch the Republican Party lose touch with America. You had a party led by conservative Southerners who neither understood nor sympathized with moderates or representatives from swing districts.
 They brought in pollsters to their party conferences to persuade their members that the country was fervently behind them. They were supported by their interest groups and cheered on by their activists and the partisan press. They spent federal money in an effort to buy support but ended up disgusting the country instead.
 It's not that interesting to watch the Democrats lose touch with America. That's because the plotline is exactly the same. The party is led by insular liberals from big cities and the coasts, who neither understand nor sympathize with moderates. They have their own cherry-picking pollsters, their own media and activist cocoon, their own plans to lavishly spend borrowed money to buy votes. 
 This ideological overreach won't be any more successful than the last one. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday confirms what other polls have found. Most Americans love Barack Obama personally, but support for Democratic policies is already sliding fast.
 Approval of Obama's handling of health care, for example, has slid from 57 percent to 49 percent since April. Disapproval has risen from 29 percent to 44 percent. As recently as June, voters earning more than $50,000 preferred Obama to the Republicans on health care by a 21-point margin. Now those voters are evenly split.
 Most independents now disapprove of Obama's health care strategy. In March, only 32 percent of Americans thought Obama was an old-style, tax-and-spend liberal. Now 43 percent do.
 We're only in the early stages of the liberal suicide march, but there already have been three phases. First, there was the stimulus package. You would have thought that a stimulus package would be designed to fight unemployment and stimulate the economy during a recession. But Congressional Democrats used it as a pretext to pay for $787 billion worth of pet programs with borrowed money. Only 11 percent of the money will be spent by the end of the fiscal year -- a triumph of ideology over pragmatism.
 Then there is the budget. Instead of allaying moderate anxieties about the deficits, the budget is expected to increase the government debt by $11 trillion between 2009 and 2019.
 Finally, there is health care. Every cliche Ann Coulter throws at the Democrats is gloriously fulfilled by the Democratic health care bills. The bills do almost nothing to control health care inflation. They are modeled on the Massachusetts health reform law that is currently coming apart at the seams precisely because it doesn't control costs. They do little to reward efficient providers and reform inefficient ones.
 The House bill adds $239 billion to the federal deficit during the first 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It would pummel small businesses with an 8 percent payroll penalty. It would jack America's top tax rate above those in Italy and France. Top earners in New York and California would be giving more than 55 percent of earnings to one government entity or another.
 Nancy Pelosi has lower approval ratings than Dick Cheney and far lower approval ratings than Sarah Palin. And yet Democrats have allowed her policy values to carry the day -- this in an era in which independents dominate the electoral landscape. 
 Who's going to stop this leftward surge? Months ago, it seemed as if Obama would lead a center-left coalition. Instead, he has deferred to the Old Bulls on Capitol Hill on issue after issue.
 Machiavelli said a leader should be feared as well as loved. Obama is loved by the Democratic chairmen, but he is not feared. On health care, Obama has emphasized cost control. The chairmen flouted his priorities because they don't fear him. On cap and trade, Obama campaigned against giving away pollution offsets. The chairmen wrote their bill to do precisely that because they don't fear him. On taxes, Obama promised that top tax rates would not go above Clinton-era levels. The chairmen flouted that promise because they don't fear him.
 Last week, the administration announced a proposal to take Medicare spending decisions away from Congress and lodge the power with technocrats in the executive branch. It's a good idea, and it might lead to real cost savings. But there's no reason to think that it will be incorporated into the final law. The chairmen will never surrender power to an administration they can override.
 That leaves matters in the hands of the Blue Dog Democrats. These brave moderates are trying to restrain the fiscal explosion. But moderates inherently lack seniority (they are from swing districts). They are usually bought off by leadership at the end of the day.
 And so here we are again. Every new majority overinterprets its mandate. We've been here before. We'll be here again.

HEADLINE: OBAMA PUSHING, BUT EARLY VOTE ON HEALTH FADES

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama began a new push to overhaul the health system, Democratic Congressional leaders, bowing to unease among lawmakers and governors in their own party, on Monday suggested scaling back a plan to tax top earners to pay for the sweeping legislation and signaled a retreat from their ambitious timetable. 
 House and Senate leaders had been pressing for floor votes in each chamber before lawmakers depart for the August summer recess. But Congressional aides said that it was increasingly clear the Senate would not be ready to vote on its bill before its recess begins on Aug. 8, and that House Democrats seemed unwilling to vote to raise taxes without knowing where the Senate stood. 
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, suggested revising the tax-raising provisions, one of the most contentious parts of the House bill, which would impose a surtax on high-income households. Ms. Pelosi said she would prefer that fewer people had to pay the tax, which was approved Friday by the Ways and Means Committee. 
 Mr. Obama, in an interview on ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS, said he had not given up on his timetable. He also pressed a group of bloggers to help him keep the pressure on lawmakers to act. And earlier in the day, while on a visit to the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, he spoke out strongly against a health system that he said was increasingly unaffordable to families.
 ''If we do nothing, then families will spend more and more of their income for less and less care,'' he said Monday. 
 But rather than repeating his demand that each chamber of Congress pass a health care bill before the August break, Mr. Obama emphasized the need to reach a final agreement by the end of the year. ''So let's fight our way through the politics of the moment,'' he said. ''Let's pass reform by the end of this year.'' 
 Despite White House insistence to the contrary, the end-of-year deadline suggested that Mr. Obama was backing away slightly from his timetable; previously he had called on Congress to send him legislation to sign by mid-October. 
 A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami, said she still hoped for a vote before the House adjourned on July 31. 
 Even as Mr. Obama sought to answer critics, the Mayo Clinic, cited by the president and lawmakers of both parties as a model, criticized the House health care bill on Monday, saying, ''The legislation misses the opportunity to help create higher-quality, more affordable health care for patients.''
 Under the House bill, the surtax would apply to individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $280,000 and couples filing joint returns with incomes over $350,000. Aides to Ms. Pelosi said she wanted to lift the thresholds to $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for joint filers, so the new levy could be described as a tax on millionaires. 
 The Senate, however, has shown little interest in such a tax to pay for the legislation. And House Democrats, especially more junior members elected in 2006 and 2008 from Republican-leaning districts, are reluctant to vote for a big tax increase if it is unlikely to be included in the final bill. 
 Such a vote, they argue, would provide easy fodder for opponents seeking to paint them as tax-and-spend liberals. Those concerns prompted Ms. Pelosi to warn the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, that she might have to delay the House vote on the bill until September unless she had a clearer idea of the Senate's plans. 
 Ms. Pelosi's comments on the surtax, made initially in an interview with the Web site Politico, , came as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee met with several fiscally conservative Democrats who are worried abut the cost and scope of the health care bill. 
 Aides to Ms. Pelosi said Congress would not need as much revenue from the surtax if lawmakers could squeeze additional savings out of the health care system, perhaps by demanding greater concessions from private insurers and pharmaceutical companies. 
 The bill, projected to cost roughly $1 trillion over 10 years, would extend health coverage to 37 million people, according to an analysis issued by the Congressional Budget Office.
 The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said Monday that members of his committee had made progress in their effort to forge a bipartisan proposal. House Democrats monitoring the negotiations in the Finance Committee suggested that a deal between Mr. Baucus and the senior Republican on the panel, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, could yield a plan to pay for the bill that would eliminate the need for the income surtax. 
 Mr. Grassley, in an interview Monday on MSNBC, dismissed the idea of a so-called millionaire's tax. ''Definitely that's off the table,'' he said. 
 Eric J. Toder, a tax economist at the Urban Institute, said that if the income thresholds for the surtax were increased to the levels suggested by Ms. Pelosi, ''it would reduce the number of people affected by more than half.'' 
 The Ways and Means Committee said the tax approved by the panel last week would apply to 1.2 percent of households and would raise $544 billion over 10 years.
 ''I really do not understand the politics of trying to sell health care reform, which is supposed to be for the benefit of the vast majority of Americans, and saying it should be paid for only by people making over $1 million,'' Mr. Toder said. ''If it's worth doing, and I think it is, more people should be willing to pay for it.''
 As Democrats seemed to ease their deadline of approving the legislation within the next two to three weeks, employer groups sent a letter to Mr. Reid, saying he should not short-circuit the work of the finance panel.
 ''We strongly urge you to encourage the Senate Finance Committee to continue its discussions on a bipartisan basis to reach consensus on how to improve our health care system and identify ways to expand coverage, without dramatically affecting those who do have coverage,'' said the letter, signed by nine groups, including the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 Some of the sharpest criticism seemed to come from the Mayo Clinic, which has endorsed efforts to overhaul the health care system. 
 ''Unless legislators create payment systems that pay for good patient results at reasonable costs, the promise of transformation in American health care will wither,'' the clinic said.

HEADLINE: Gates Says Army's Size Will Grow By 22,000

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates on Monday announced a temporary increase in the size of the Army of up to 22,000 troops to meet what he called the ''persistent pace'' of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The increase, to occur over the next three years, will raise the size of the Army to 569,000 active-duty soldiers. An expansion to 547,000 soldiers, announced by Mr. Gates in 2007, was completed in May. 
 Currently there are about 130,000 American troops in Iraq and about 60,000 expected in Afghanistan by the end of the year. Although there is a scheduled reduction of close to 80,000 troops in Iraq, most will not start to come home until after March 2010. 
 ''The Army faces a period where its ability to continue to deploy combat units at acceptable fill rates is at risk,'' Mr. Gates said, meaning that he was concerned that Army units sent to Iraq and Afghanistan in the future might not have enough soldiers. He spoke at a Pentagon news conference with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Mr. Gates did not say what the increase would cost over all, but indicated he would ask Congress for money to pay for it in 2011 and 2012. He estimated the cost in the fiscal year that ends in October at ''less than a hundred million dollars'' and in fiscal 2010 at $1 billion. He said he would absorb the costs in 2009 and 2010 into the existing Pentagon budget.
 ''We will take that money from some place that we think isn't as high a priority as more soldiers, and taking some additional steps to relieve stress in the force,'' Mr. Gates said, then segued into one of his frequent criticisms of Congress for adding money to the Pentagon budget for weapons and programs he did not want. 
 ''This is why, frankly, some of the wheeling and dealing on the Hill of a few hundred million here and a few hundred million there for a pet project here and a pet project there confront us with ever more difficult choices when we're trying to make trade-offs in terms of how do we help our soldiers out,'' Mr. Gates said.
 Pentagon officials said they expected to increase the size of the Army through more recruitment and increased retention of the existing force. Recruitment is already up this year because the recession has lured people to the steady paychecks of the military. Officials said they also expected the Army to encourage re-enlistment so more soldiers would serve beyond the standard two years.
 At the news conference, Mr. Gates also said he would travel to Israel next week and meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, the Israeli defense minister. Mr. Gates said the topics would include Iran, but declined to elaborate.
 ''I think the only thing that I'm prepared to say about that is that I'm confident that subject will come up,'' Mr. Gates said.
 The administration has sent different signals in recent weeks about what it would do should Israel strike the plants at the heart of what is suspected to be Iran's nuclear weapons program. Israel has long threatened such a strike.
 Earlier this month, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said that the United States ''cannot dictate'' Israel's decision about an attack and that only Israelis could determine that ''they're existentially threatened'' by Iran's nuclear ambitions. Admiral Mullen has warned that any military strike on Iran ''could be very destabilizing.''
 Despite the subject of Iran, Mr. Gates characterized his trip to Israel as ''a routine visit, as far as I'm concerned.''

HEADLINE: Inside the Meltdown: Financial Ruin and the Race to Contain It

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
A year ago it would have been hard to imagine a book about the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department making it onto people's must-read summer reading lists. But the financial calamities of last autumn put the global economy on the brink of disaster and led to continuing fiscal woes. Understanding what happened has become vitally important not just for bankers and economists, but for everyone affected by the fallout, which means ... well, just about everyone. 
 For all of us then, David Wessel's new book ''In Fed We Trust'' is essential, lucid -- and, it turns out, riveting -- reading. 
 In these pages Mr. Wessel, the economics editor of The Wall Street Journal, chronicles how the Fed chairman Ben S. Bernanke, with Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, and a small group of associates, frantically worked to shore up the United States economy, capturing how this handful of people -- ''overwhelmed, exhausted, beseeched, besieged, constantly second-guessed'' -- tried to catch and stabilize one toppling fiscal domino after the next. 
 In this volume Mr. Wessel uses his narrative gifts and a plethora of sources to give readers a vivid, highly immediate sense of what transpired in last-minute, high-pressure, seat-of-their-pants meetings in Washington and New York while placing these events in a broader historical context. He examines the Fed's increasingly important (and increasingly debated) role as an economic first responder, looks at how personality and personal philosophy can inform policy making and offers a concise explication of the causes of what he calls ''The Great Panic.''
 At the same time Mr. Wessel assesses the efficacy of Fed and Treasury moves -- which, in the heat of battle, were often improvised and contradictory -- and offers a telling analysis of decisions made on critical matters like the implosion and rescue of Bear Stearns in March 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 (after the Fed and Treasury Department declined to commit public funds to support the institution), the bailout of A.I.G., and Congressional passage in October of a $700 billion economic bailout package. 
 His overall assessment: ''Every time officials at the Treasury or the Fed thought they finally had gotten ahead of the Great Panic, they turned out to be insufficiently pessimistic. This would be a distinguishing characteristic of this chapter in American economic history: even when officials thought they were planning for the worst-case scenario, they weren't.'' 
 Three policy makers in particular receive low scores from Mr. Wessel. He argues that Mr. Paulson's abrupt changes of course and failure to understand ''the theater'' of crisis management hurt his credibility and undermined public confidence. He says that President George W. Bush was ''largely a spectator'' to ''the biggest threat to American prosperity in a generation'' possibly because he knew how unpopular he was and figured ''he would make Paulson's job tougher if he appeared to be calling the shots'' or because the Bush White House, ''stumbling through its last few months, was simply exhausted and understaffed.'' And he takes the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to task for allowing economic conditions to develop that fueled the credit crisis in the first place.
 Mr. Wessel argues that the Greenspan Fed ''kept interest rates too low for too long,'' missed warning signs that subprime mortgages were a growing problem and was reluctant to use its powers to restrain subprime lending. He adds that the former Fed chairman, revered during his tenure as an economic wise man, made the incorrect assumption that a national decline in house prices was extremely unlikely and ''put too much faith in markets,'' failing to use the Fed's ''regulatory clout and rhetoric to restrain the shortsighted, excessively ebullient players in financial markets and to at least try to resist the worst of the abuses in the subprime lending market.''
 Mr. Greenspan's successor, Mr. Bernanke, along with Mr. Paulson and Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (and now President Obama's Treasury secretary), Mr. Wessel says, all ''had a gut sense that the U.S. economy was overdue for a financial crisis of some sort'' before the catastrophic events of last fall, but ''no one at the Fed'' rang ''the gong and warned investors, lenders, business executives, and consumers that years of easy credit even for risky borrowers, placid markets, and shared optimism were unsustainable.'' 
 While Mr. Wessel suggests that Mr. Bernanke was initially timid in his response to brewing problems, he gives the Fed chief credit for being ''creative and bold'' once he realized the risks, pushing ''the Fed to places it had never gone before or at least to places it hadn't visited since the Great Depression.'' A conscientious student of that calamity, Mr. Bernanke was determined, Mr. Wessel writes, that ''he would not go down in history as the chairman of the Federal Reserve who dithered and delayed during a financial panic that threatened American prosperity,'' and he ''adopted a new mantra: whatever it takes.'' 
 In this book Mr. Geithner emerges as a usually cool deliberator, admired by his colleagues at the Fed for his ''capacity to size up a situation and lay out options coherently and calmly.'' His experience dealing with the United States government's response to the Mexican and Asian financial crises of the 1990s, Mr. Wessel writes, taught him ''a lot about crisis management and an enduring lesson: smart people solve crises one at a time and worry about dealing with unintended consequences tomorrow.'' 
 As for Mr. Paulson, Mr. Wessel describes him as ''a deal maker'': ''Like many on Wall Street, he could shout 'No! No!' before, citing changed circumstances, abruptly saying 'Yes!' The approach provided flexibility in negotiating the best business deal; it didn't build lasting credibility in Washington.'' In contrast, Mr. Wessel says, Mr. Geithner understood ''that a tough bargaining stance in a room full of investment bankers made sense, but that the press, the markets, and foreign officials abroad couldn't distinguish a bargaining position from a policy position.'' 
 In Mr. Wessel's view the collapse of Lehman Brothers on Sept. 14 ''caused -- or coincided with -- so much financial turmoil in large part because of the lack of a consistent story.'' It was unclear whether the government let Lehman fall ''to teach Wall Street a lesson'' about moral hazard or whether it was ''legally powerless to save it.'' It was unclear whether the earlier rescue of Bear Stearns was a one-time thing and whether the government would intervene to save other major financial firms teetering on the brink. 
 Mr. Wessel quotes Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman: ''People in the market often say they can make money under any set of rules, as long as they know what they are. Coming just six months after Bear's rescue, the Lehman decision tossed the presumed rulebook out the window. If Bear was too big to fail, how could Lehman, at twice its size, not be? If Bear was too entangled to fail, why was Lehman not? After Lehman went over the cliff, no financial institution seemed safe. So lending froze, and the economy sanklike a stone. It was a colossal error, and many people said so at the time.'' 
 Although an enormous amount of recent attention has been understandably focused on why the government let Lehman Brothers go under, an equal amount of attention might understandably be focused on why Lehman -- and other firms like Bear Stearns and A.I.G. -- were ever allowed to engage in the sort of reckless, illogical, self-destructive gambling that turned them from Wall Street behemoths into combustible houses of cards in the first place. 
 Why, in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world where financial woes can spread virally like swine flu, was there so little regulation of derivatives, the complex financial instruments that the financier Felix Rohatyn once described as ''financial hydrogen bombs''? Why was there so little oversight of the rating agencies that drastically underrated the risk of such flammable, infectious products? Why did the top management of these companies overleverage their firms, why did they willfully ignore the warnings of experts, and why did they fail to take quick, corrective action when the dangers their companies faced became self-evident?
 Such questions are all raised and italicized by ''A Colossal Failure of Common Sense: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers'' by Lawrence G. McDonald, a former vice president of that firm, with an assist from the writer Patrick Robinson. Mr. McDonald approaches the story not as a journalist but as a former employee, a member of a group of dissidents who believed that Richard S. Fuld Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, and its president, Joseph M. Gregory, were leading Lehman off a cliff. 
 Mr. Fuld and Mr. Gregory, Mr. McDonald contends, ignored the warnings of three of the company's ''cleverest financial brains'': ''Mike Gelband, our global head of fixed income, Alex Kirk, global head of distressed trading research and sales, and Larry McCarthy, head of distressed-bond trading.''
 ''Each and every one of them laid it out, from way back in 2005,'' Mr. McDonald writes, ''that the real estate market was living on borrowed time and that Lehman Brothers was headed directly for the biggest subprime iceberg ever seen, and with the wrong men on the bridge. Dick and Joe turned their backs all three times. It was probably the worst triple since St. Peter denied Christ.'' 
 Mr. McDonald depicts Mr. Fuld and Mr. Gregory as out of touch and in denial: arrogant, reckless, eager to embrace ''risk, more risk, and if necessary bigger risks'' in pursuit of short-term profits, willing to borrow more and more money (on the way to leveraging the firm to ''44 times our value'') in order to buy commercial and residential real estate at the top of the market, even though one of his lieutenants had warned in 2005 that the housing market was on steroids and headed for serious trouble. 
 At times Mr. McDonald's rage or Mr. Robinson's penchant for melodrama leads to some hyperbolic writing. Mr. Fuld, for instance, comes across as a sort of Lord Voldemort, a ''strange wraithlike presence,'' an ''oddball demigod who ruled everyone's lives.'' 
 Over all, however, Mr. McDonald's book gives the reader a visceral sense of what it was like to work at Lehman Brothers and the fateful decisions and events that led to the company's death spiral -- decisions that turned the once-proud firm into a grim illustration, in the words of one of the author's colleagues, of the ''colossal failure of common sense.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey G.O.P. Candidate Picks Woman as His No. 2

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Christopher J. Christie, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, picked a running mate in his own image on Monday, choosing another former prosecutor with a hard-charging reputation both in pursuing corruption cases and in advancing her political career.
 Mr. Christie, former United States attorney in New Jersey, named Kimberly M. Guadagno, the first woman elected sheriff of Monmouth County, as his choice for lieutenant governor. 
 The selection of Ms. Guadagno, 50, like Mr. Christie an outsider to Trenton, suggests that he will redouble his emphasis on reforming state government. In a video posted online Monday morning, he described their ticket as ''two candidates who will not shy away from turning Trenton upside down.''
 In the video, Ms. Guadagno also echoed Mr. Christie's complaint about the New Jersey economy under the Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine. She said she and her husband were raising three sons, but ''unfortunately, because of the economy today, they're not going to be able to stay'' in New Jersey.
 ''They're going to have to go and find opportunities elsewhere, because this state is broken,'' she said.
 The Christie campaign may be gambling that Ms. Guadagno will help him with women and others who support abortion rights. While Mr. Christie declared in the Republican primary that he opposed abortion, Ms. Guadagno said Monday that she supported a woman's right to choose an abortion, though she sees a need to reduce the number performed in New Jersey.
 The Corzine campaign nonetheless attacked the new ticket as ''completely out of touch.''
 ''While we applaud Christie for picking a woman, Republicans still have a top of the ticket that will not protect women's rights in Trenton,'' a Corzine spokeswoman, Elisabeth Smith, said in an e-mail message that also mentioned Mr. Christie's opposition to the state's paid family leave law.
 There is little evidence to predict what effect Ms. Guadagno's selection will have, since this is the first year New Jersey will vote for lieutenant governor. The job was created in 2005 after two successive governors resigned, leaving the president of the Senate to serve simultaneously as acting governor.
 Mr. Christie said in an interview that Ms. Guadagno would oversee economic development and regulatory reform efforts if they are elected. ''She'll be in the room on anything she wants to be in the room on,'' he said.
 If Ms. Guadagno does play the role of attack dog in the campaign, as is often the case with running mates elsewhere in politics, she will have ample experience in landing and taking punches.
 As a candidate for sheriff, she was scolded by a local newspaper for unfair campaign tactics. And she drew criticism from Hispanic groups for vowing to seek federal permission for her deputies to initiate deportation proceedings against illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes. Her department is one of 11 law enforcement agencies nationwide given that permission earlier this month under the so-called 287(g) program, albeit with stricter federal guidelines.
 Angel Matos, a Monmouth County leader of the Latino Leadership Alliance, which opposed Ms. Guadagno's application for the program, said her selection would hurt Mr. Christie with Hispanic voters.
 ''Our position was, the only real reason she was pushing for this was as a political steppingstone on the back of immigrants,'' Mr. Matos said. ''And here we are, lo and behold, that's what's occurred.''
 Ms. Guadagno was deputy chief of the United States attorney's corruption unit from 1990 to 1998, and prosecuted a former Essex County executive, Thomas D'Alessio, and a former Somerset County prosecutor, Nicholas Bissell. She also led an inquiry into kickbacks involving a former executive of Gtech, the lottery contractor. In that case, she was castigated by a judge for publicizing grand jury testimony. She left the federal prosecutor's office soon after.
 Mr. Christie said he believed that she had done nothing wrong in that case, because the judge ''never referred the matter'' to the Justice Department or state ethics officials for investigation.
 Ms. Guadagno later served as deputy director of criminal justice in the state attorney general's office and worked in private practice.
 Mr. Christie also praised her executive experience. Ms. Guadagno, elected sheriff in 2007, oversees an office with 695 employees and a $65 million budget that says it is the first accredited by the National Sheriffs' Association in five areas: law enforcement, corrections, correctional health care, emergency dispatch and youth detention.
 Ms. Guadagno's three sons range from 8 to 16. Her husband, Michael A. Guadagno, was a State Superior Court judge in Monmouth but was transferred to Ocean County after her election. They live in Monmouth Beach.
 Mr. Guadagno has his own history with Mr. Christie: As chief of the United States attorney's frauds division before Mr. Christie was named to run the office, Mr. Guadagno started the corruption inquiry that ended the career of Senator Robert G. Torricelli. But Mr. Christie, a few months after arriving, banished Mr. Guadagno to a lesser job in Trenton.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pledges Closer Ties Between U.S. and India

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
With both poetry and prose, the United States pledged Monday to embark on a new era of deeper relations with India -- a partnership of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton likes to call the world's largest democracy and its oldest continuously functioning one.
 As Mrs. Clinton conjured up a soaring vision of friendship between the two countries in a speech to a university audience here, the Obama administration signed off on a nuts-and-bolts technical agreement that will open the door to lucrative military sales by the United States to India. In addition, India said it had designated two sites where American companies would build nuclear power plants. 
 ''We will work not just to maintain our good relationship, but to broaden and deepen it,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference with the Indian minister for external affairs, S. M. Krishna.
 Earlier in the day, at the University of Delhi, she leaned heavily on her personal experiences of India to argue that the countries needed to draw more heavily on the vast web of personal connections between India and the United States, home to nearly three million Indian immigrants.
 The United States and India inaugurated a strategic dialogue, spanning issues from education to climate change, and drawing in participants from the business world and academia, as well as the government.
 ''What I see today is thrilling to me,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ''and what I hope is that the partnership that we are developing together will truly change the future for all of the children in both of our countries.''
 The United States generally reserves strategic dialogues for major countries like China, so this is a symbolic acknowledgment of India's rising role in the world. Mr. Krishna said the dialogue would set a ''new agenda for India 3.0'' -- an allusion to India's high-tech prowess.
 Behind the high-flown talk are some obvious economic considerations: the United States won India's agreement to allow it to monitor the ''end use'' of military equipment and technology sold to India, to ensure it is not diverted to other uses or sold to other countries. The provision would pave the way for a proposed sale of 126 advanced fighter jets to India.
 India also confirmed the two sites, in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh States, for nuclear power plants to be supplied by American companies. The contracts, worth billions of dollars, are a key benefit of a civilian nuclear deal with India signed in the last days of the Bush administration.
 The American companies, however, will not sign contracts until India agrees to shield them from liability above $450 million in the event of catastrophic nuclear accident. Indian officials told Mrs. Clinton they would press for the protection in the next legislative session.
 On this trip, the first by a top official of the Obama administration, Mrs. Clinton's itinerary spoke as vividly as her words to the changing nature of the relationship. She did not meet Mr. Krishna or Prime Minister Manmohan Singh until Monday, three days after she arrived in Mumbai.
 Her schedule has been packed with meetings with Indian business tycoons, a film star, agricultural experts, university students and rural women who work in cottage industries like textiles.
 The message, she told a crowd of 700 on Monday, was that ''we need not only the professional diplomats who serve in our foreign services and represent our countries to one another. We need the citizen diplomats.''
 Mrs. Clinton deployed the full power of her celebrity -- regaling the audience with stories about her unsuccessful run for the presidency, her husband, her relationship with President Obama and even her appetite for Indian food.
 ''I eat way too much of the food at every chance I get,'' she said. ''I have to go on a diet when I get back home, back to carrots and celery.''
 A young female student asked Mrs. Clinton to compare the status of women across countries, noting that India had its first female leader within three decades of its independence while -- ''if I may say so,'' she said gingerly -- the United States has not yet elected a woman president.
 ''You can say so to me,'' Mrs. Clinton replied in a sardonic tone that cracked up the crowd.
