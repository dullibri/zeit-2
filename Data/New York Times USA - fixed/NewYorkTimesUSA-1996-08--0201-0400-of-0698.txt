HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Says Dole's Plan Would Bust The Budget

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SALINAS, Calif., Aug. 8

 BODY:
Savoring a last moment in the California spotlight before the Republican National Convention takes center stage, President Clinton today ridiculed Bob Dole's sweeping plan for $548 billion in tax cuts over the next six years and promised that he himself would not offer any tax cuts that jeopardized a balancing of the Federal budget.
Mr. Clinton never mentioned his Republican opponent by name. But under a bright sun here in the Central Valley that was Steinbeck country, he told a crowd, "You'll hear a lot of talk between now and November about tax cuts and how much we should have and whether we can afford them, and they all sound good." 
 "It's like going to the candy store," Mr. Clinton said. "You know, 'I'll have some of that and some of that and some of that and some of that.' But if you eat it all at once, you might get sick."
The President held out as a counterpoint his own proposals for tax credits for specific purposes like community-college tuition, and implied that Mr. Dole's approach would jeopardize programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
"I say to you that it might not be popular," he said, "but I will not advocate any cuts in taxes in this election that cannot be paid for in our attempts to balance the budget."
Mr. Dole has said his economic plan would eliminate the deficit over six years even with the tax reduction, for which he would partly pay with a surge in growth that he envisions as resulting from the cut. But the White House has ridiculed his adoption of that supply-side approach, and the targets of some of the budget cuts that would also be needed to pay for the tax breaks have been left sketchy.
California, with its 54 electoral votes, is a must-win state for Mr. Clinton, and he has lavished attention and Federal money on it, through flood, earthquake and the post-cold-war conversion of the defense industry.
Today, with Republicans arriving in San Diego for a weeklong convention that will mount a concerted assault on his record, Mr. Clinton devoted his 26th trip to the state as President to emphasis on his economic, crime-fighting and education credentials.
Much of the battle for California between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole has focused on crime-fighting, an issue the Republicans had long dominated until the President adopted an approach that mixed his gun-control efforts with those on victims' rights and on punitive measures like expanding the Federal death penalty.
On a stage outside the Salinas courthouse today, Mr. Clinton, surrounded by uniformed police officers, received a formal endorsement from a police organization for the first time in the current campaign. "You, more than any other President, have understood law enforcement," said Sam Cabral, the president of that group, the 80,000-member International Union of Police Associations, which supported Mr. Clinton in 1992 as well.
Mr. Clinton also used the occasion to announce that for the first time in seven years, the arrest rates among juveniles for murder and for violent crime as a whole both declined in 1995, an announcement timed to coincide with the release in Washington of new data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
And the arrival back home of a local Olympic hero, Alvin Harrison, born to poverty but today wearing around his neck the gold medal he won in Atlanta as a member of the 4-by-400-meter relay team, led Mr. Clinton to make a pitch for an additional way of fighting crime: providing opportunity to those who might otherwise gravitate toward gang violence.
"When you tell kids that they matter," he said, "and you tell them they can belong and that they can amount to something and they can live out their dreams and that no matter where they might start out they might wind up with a gold medal, and at least they can win a gold medal in the race of life if they do the right things, then you can change this."
Besides being significant for its electoral votes, California has been a wellspring of money for Mr. Clinton and other Democrats, and this trip was centered on a fund-raising event tonight at the Los Angeles home of Marc Nathanson, a cable television executive. The event was expected to raise $1.2 million for Democratic Congressional candidates.
Earlier, in San Jose, the President made a highly partisan speech that was delivered by satellite to a Pittsburgh conference of the United Steelworkers of America. In it, he attacked the Republican Congress and called for the Democrats to be put back in control of Capitol Hill.
"You remember what they tried to do," he said of the Republicans, "how they shut the Government down twice, what they tried to do to Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. Unless we win the Presidential race and change the composition of the Congress, they'll keep trying to do it over and over and over again."

HEADLINE: Trenton Man Faces Charges in the Slayings of 4 Women

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
At least four women who roamed the streets of a shabby part of Trenton looking for crack cocaine in the middle of the night met a slight soft-spoken young man.
The women offered sex for drugs, the police said yesterday, and because of that they died. 
 Investigators said they had charged the man, Anthony Balaam, 31, with killing four women after having lured them into drugs-for-sex encounters. The police said that Mr. Balaam, who uses crack, had confessed to the four killings and that he might be implicated in similar cases.
Mr. Balaam was described by a detective who arrested him, Anthony Manzo, as unassuming and polite, "a 'Yes, Sir, No Sir' kind of person."
Deputy Police Chief Joe Constance, who has been on the force for 27 years, called Mr. Balaam, 5 feet 5 inches and 150 pounds, "one of the calmest and coolest murderers I've encountered."
After his arrest, without incident on Wednesday, Mr. Balaam talked to detectives in polite, measured tones. "He talked about rage," Chief Constance said. "He talked about power, about his power over the women."
Investigators said Mr. Balaam would strike bargains with the women, threaten them with a knife in the sexual encounter and strangle them. Three victims were found in vacant lots and the fourth was in a rundown hotel.
The suspect has been charged with murder in the deaths of Karen Denise Patterson, 41, on Oct. 24, 1994; Valentina Cuyler, 29, on March 19, 1995; Connie Hayward, 27, on April 10, 1995, and Debora Ann Walker, 37, last July 29. Ms. Hayward was found dead in the hotel.
The deputy chief said that Mr. Balaam raped another woman on Feb. 16, but that she escaped before he could strangle her. She provided a description of the attacker, and the police soon concluded that Mr. Balaam was the man who had been killing women on the streets in the predawn hours.
Investigators said that they thought that at least one other woman had fled after having encountered Mr. Balaam, and that they hoped that she would come forward. The investigators added that they were conferring with the police in Detroit, where Mr. Balaam lived from July 1995 to last January, to determine whether he might have committed crimes there.
A homicide investigator in Detroit said yesterday that the city had no string of unsolved murders and that the police did not recognize Mr. Balaam's name.
Not much was known about Mr. Balaam. The police said he had been born in Trenton, was unemployed and lived at 421 Stuyvesant Avenue, where he was arrested about 2:30 P.M. Mr. Balaam has a roommate, the police added.
Two killings were near Mr. Balaam's home, Chief Constance said. The body of the last victim, Miss Walker, was found by Mr. Balaam's neighbors.
One of the neighbors said yesterday that she did not know Mr. Balaam, who lived a few doors away.
"Oh, my God," the neighbor, Catherine Emerson, of 415 Stuyvesant Avenue, said in a telephone interview when she learned that a murder suspect lived nearby. She said she had no image of him.
Mrs. Emerson said a neighbor telephoned her on the morning of July 29 and said, "Go look out the back door." Mrs. Emerson did so, and she saw a body in a nearby lot.
"I thought it was a little child," she said, recalling the small-frame woman who was on the grass with her blue-and-white coveralls pulled down.
Chief Constance said that DNA testing on semen recovered near two bodies had linked Mr. Balaam to the crimes and that the police hoped that further tests would tie him to all four killings and the rape on Feb. 16.
In addition to murder, Mr. Balaam has been charged with robbery and the possession of illegal weapons. He has convictions on minor burglary and drug charges and has refused offers of counsel, the police said.
Mr. Balaam was being held without bail.
Chief Constance spoke with compassion about the kind of women who were slain.
"It's like 'The Night of the Living Dead,' " he said. "They will do anything, literally anything, to obtain the drugs."

HEADLINE: At Office Of Campaign, A Protest On Welfare

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
It was intended as a celebration of Bill Clinton's strong support among New York Democrats. The opening of the Clinton-Gore campaign's New York headquarters at 300 Park Avenue yesterday was a made-for-television event that brought out the firmament of the state's best-known Democrats: former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and a throng of congressmen, City Council members and state legislators.
But the opening ceremony turned out to be a far more raucous affair than any of its organizers expected. Of the hundreds of people who attended the event, nearly half were protesters, voicing their disdain for the far-reaching Federal welfare bill approved by a Republican Congress and destined to be signed by the Democratic President whom the event was intended to laud. 
 The freshly opened campaign headquarters was adorned with red, white and blue Clinton-Gore signs, but there seemed to be an equal number of protesters' signs saying, "Veto the Welfare Bill." And while many of the speakers were taken aback by the vehemence of the protests, they found themselves largely agreeing that the welfare bill the President has embraced would be devastating to the New Yorkers they represent.
As speaker after speaker mounted the podium, each was heckled, booed and, ultimately, outshouted by the protesters.
"The one thing we know is that we can't permit Dole and Gingrich to be in there," Mr. Dinkins said, struggling to be heard over the roar.
"What's the difference," the protesters shouted. "Veto, Veto, Veto," they chanted in unison, drowning out the former mayor.
When Mr. Cuomo took his turn at the lectern, he told the protesters that he, too, shared their concerns about the bill, which requires states to establish a lifetime limit of five years on welfare payments to any family and abolishes a major Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, replacing it with grants to states.
Mr. Cuomo said that, in a letter to the White House, he had urged the President to veto the bill. He said that the best hope for Democrats was to elect a Democratic-controlled Congress and to re-elect the President. He said he supported Mr. Clinton, recognizing that as President "sometimes you have to do things you're not totally comfortable with."
That drew the loudest chants of the afternoon, with protesters offering a chorus of "Shame, shame, shame" that left the former Governor visibly shaken.
Protests at political functions and press conferences are no novelty in New York City. But what was notable about yesterday's protest was how it seemed to touch a nerve among the politicians, who often respond to protests with nonchalance.
The protesters who disrupted yesterday's event came from an array of social service and welfare rights organizations, from the Community Food Resource Center and the Bronx Welfare Advocacy Network to Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and Housing Works.
Most of the officials at yesterday's event indicated publicly or in interviews afterward that they, too, were deeply disappointed by the President's decision to sign the welfare bill. Their disappointment, they said, reflected a major difficulty facing Mr. Clinton's campaign in the state, which has a long history of generous welfare policies.
Mr. Clinton is still expected to win handily in New York. But many of the politicians at the opening of the new headquarters questioned how enthusiastic about the President Democrats in the state would remain and whether voters' growing ambivalence might keep many of them from going to the polls in November.
"I don't like a lot of what the President's doing," said Deborah J. Glick, an Assemblywoman from Greenwich Village in one of the few moments when a speaker could be heard. But, she said, he was better than having Bob Dole, the Republican, as President. "And the best way to keep him from caving in to the Republican Congress," she said of Mr. Clinton, "is by getting rid of the Republican Congress."
In the end, some politicians said, New York Democrats would overwhelmingly support the President because they find Mr. Dole's policies too distasteful. "Let's face it," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn. "There is a lot of concern about this welfare bill and its effect on New York. But the overwhelming number of people who disagree with the President on this issue are going to wind up voting for Bill Clinton."
But several officials made it clear that the President's position on the welfare bill would require his campaign to devote more attention to New York. Judith Hope, who is chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, said that resentment among some Democrats "means that there will be more work for the state party and for the campaign."
Mr. Cuomo was perhaps the most outspoken after the news conference. Speaking of the President's support of the welfare bill, he said: "There is no justification for it. It's political. He chose to do what's popular. Reagan did what was popular and it was devastating to us. Some of the time what's popular is wrong."

HEADLINE: A POLITICAL LIFE: The Legislative Years -- THE REPUBLICAN;
As Candidate, Dole Casts Off His Feats as a Skilled Senator

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A few days into the first campaign swing by Bob Dole as a private citizen, he was asked to list some of the accomplishments that, looking back over his long tenure in the Senate, he was most proud of.
The former Senator paused for a moment. Then he said: "Just being there. I mean being in the United States Senate. I can't think of very many days I went to work without being a little excited. You see the Capitol dome and know that you're part of something that most people would give anything for. It's a great opportunity, and a great privilege." 
 The answer -- unstudied and even moving in its modesty -- is characteristic of Mr. Dole. In person, he can be disarmingly soft-spoken, coming across as a man who, for all his obvious ambition, is genuinely self-effacing. But in its reticence the answer also points to one of the central puzzles of Mr. Dole's campaign for President.
Without doubt, Mr. Dole was one of the most influential senators of the late 20th century. First as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and later as the Senate's Republican leader, he played a part in many -- if not most -- of the major pieces of legislation of the last 15 years. He enjoyed the respect not only of colleagues in his own party, who made him the longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history, but also of many colleagues across the aisle.
And yet Mr. Dole has still to translate this impressive record into a clear argument for his candidacy. Rarely does he refer to any of his accomplishments as a legislator or to his central role as the Senate's leading Republican. Indeed, in resigning his seat and campaigning as "just a man," Mr. Dole has seemed to be deliberately distancing himself from the long career that is his strongest claim on the Presidency.
This approach may, in part, simply reflect Mr. Dole's personality. As he observed in the same interview, "I've always had a hard time going out saying, 'I did this, I did that.' "
But, in part, it also clearly reflects the character of Mr. Dole's legislative career. Even Mr. Dole's admirers acknowledge that his accomplishments in the Senate resist the kind of neat summarizing that is required for effective campaign biography.
Unlike many of his colleagues in the Senate, Mr. Dole cannot point to a significant body of legislation that he originated. Indeed, for someone whose career in the Senate spanned nearly three decades, he has surprisingly few bills that bear his name, and one of the most prominent of these was a bill to raise taxes.
Mr. Dole can claim credit for shepherding into law many important bills written by others. But many of these bills strain against the main themes of his candidacy. They include bills that expanded Federal entitlements and mandated rafts of new Federal regulations.
Finally, Mr. Dole can point to his devoted service as Senate leader, which many call the hardest job in Washington. But he cannot easily characterize for voters the larger purpose and direction of that leadership. At different points in his 12 years at the helm, he has been a hardliner and a moderate, a partisan obstructionist and a bipartisan conciliator.
Steve Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota who has studied Senate leadership, summed up Mr. Dole's difficulties this way: "My view is he's been a fairly effective leader. But being an effective power in the Senate is a lot different from making a case for yourself as President."
Mr. Dole's service in the Senate, Mr. Smith added, "doesn't make a compelling case that he stands for a lot of things."
 
Conservative Credentials
Building a Record On Bipartisanship
At issue in November's election, Mr. Dole frequently says, are two fundamentally different visions of government. There is his vision, which he characterizes as the authentically conservative. And then there is President Clinton's.
"Can you imagine what Bill Clinton would do in a second term -- his liberalism unrestrained by the need to face the American people?" he asked an audience recently in Ohio.
By many measures, Mr. Dole's legislative record matches his conservative rhetoric. Over the years, his positions on a range of issues from from defense spending to the environment have consistently won near-perfect ratings from groups on the right, and near-zero scores from those on the left.
But the major bills Mr. Dole is most closely associated with tend to cloud rather than confirm his conservative credentials. Several are bills Mr. Dole championed in opposition to conservative lawmakers and in concert with liberal ones. And while supporters of Mr. Dole say the bills demonstrate a statesmanly commitment to bipartisanship, even they concede this is not necessarily a quality that a Presidential candidate these days wants to stress.
"If you were to define Bob Dole, it would be on his willingness to work across party lines to find solutions to the nation's problems," said Norman Ornstein, a Congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and self-described admirer of Mr. Dole. "But as he moves toward the election, that's not particularly the message he wants to send."
Mr. Dole's first real legislative triumphs were a product of one of the more unlikely partnerships in American politics.
As chairman of the Republican Party in the early 1970's, Mr. Dole had routinely denounced Senator George McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, accusing him and his 1972 Presidential campaign of a host of legal as well as ethical lapses. Not long after Mr. McGovern lost to Richard M. Nixon in a landslide, though, Mr. Dole became one of Mr. McGovern's closest allies, working with him on efforts to expand Federal nutrition programs. With Mr. McGovern, Mr. Dole helped pass legislation that enlarged the food stamp and the school lunch programs, inaugurated the Women, Infants and Children program and eventually eliminated the requirement that food stamp recipients pay part of the cost of their benefits.
All of these bills were popular among farmers -- clearly a factor in the Kansas Senator's support for them. But Mr. McGovern, also a farm-state representative, said that while Mr. Dole might have initially been most attracted to benefits the programs provided farmers, he came to be "really moved by what those programs did to help kids and hard-pressed families."
In his farewell speech to the Senate, Mr. Dole alluded to his partnership with Mr. McGovern, acknowledging that it has over the years often given conservatives pause.
"I remember working with Senator McGovern, and that crops up now and then in conservative articles, saying that I can't be a conservative because I know George McGovern," Mr. Dole said, adding, "I think George McGovern is a gentleman and has always been a gentleman."
Another important legislative victory credited to Mr. Dole was a product of a similarly improbable bipartisan alliance.
In 1982, crucial sections of the Voting Rights Act came up for renewal. Two years earlier, the Supreme Court had made it more difficult -- some argued impossible -- for voters to sue under the act, ruling that victims of discrimination had to show the discrimination was intentional.
Liberal lawmakers, led in the Senate by Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, argued that voters should be able to prove discrimination based on "results" not "intent." But conservative senators maintained that an emphasis on "results" rather than "intent" would ultimately lead to demands for proportional representation and racial quotas.
It was Mr. Dole who came up with the compromise that bridged the gulf. The compromise said that judges could consider the "totality of circumstances" surrounding a case of possible discrimination, but also stipulated that no minority group had a right to proportional representation.
Ralph Neas, counsel to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, who worked with Mr. Dole on drafting the compromise, recalled that after the deal was completed, Mr. Dole had managed to persuade a reluctant President Reagan to embrace it, too.
"It was a great story of Senator Dole at his best, getting everybody under the tent," Mr. Neas said.
Mr. Dole played an analogous role on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or A.D.A. The measure, which provided sweeping protections for the disabled, was opposed by conservative senators, who argued that it would be onerous to business and provoke a rash of lawsuits. Some of these senators had threatened to keep the bill bottled up in committee; once again working with liberal Democrats, like Mr. Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, Mr. Dole helped guide it onto the floor and past the objections of some in the Bush Administration.
Tony Coelho, the former House Democratic whip and the chief sponsor of the bill before his resignation in 1989, called Mr. Dole "the spiritual father of A.D.A. in the Senate."
"We would never had gotten it through if Bob Dole hadn't been supportive," Mr. Coelho said.
Critics of Mr. Dole argue that his record on these important bills, viewed in the context of his current campaign, betrays a philosophy of government that is really no philosophy at all. And they maintain it will be difficult for Mr. Dole, who is now advocating a smaller and less intrusive Federal government, to get much political mileage out of a set of bills that helped to expand the reach of the Federal government.
"The issue is whether there's a consistency in what he believes," said Howard Paster, President Clinton's former chief Congressional liaison. "Is Bob Dole really going to campaign as the key Republican on A.D.A., or the one who helped bring about food stamps?"
Mr. Dole's supporters maintain, by contrast, that there is no ideological friction between the highlights of his Senate career and the themes of his current campaign.
Sheila Burke, Mr. Dole's former Senate chief of staff, who herself was often an object of conservatives' wrath, pointed to Mr. Dole's work on food stamps, on the Voting Rights Act of 1982, and on the Americans With Disabilities Act as some of his most significant achievements. Underlying all these measures, she argued, is the same philosophy that guides Mr. Dole today.
"It is a compassionate but focused government," Ms. Burke said.
 
The Tax Record
'Old-Time Religion' On Deficit Cutting
For decades, an anti-tax message has been a staple of Republican Presidential politics. This year promises to be no different.
Just this week, Mr. Dole announced that if elected, he would press for a 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income tax rates. The proposal, unveiled after months of debate among the candidate's advisers, is clearly intended to position him as the nation's best hope for tax relief.
Here again, though, Mr. Dole's record in the Senate is likely to be of little help.
"What really comes to mind as a true Dole product?" said Barbara Sinclair, a Congressional scholar at U.C.L.A. "It's something he probably doesn't want to have remembered -- the 1982 tax bill."
The bill was titled the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, or, as it is known in Washington, Tefra. Mr. Dole, at that time the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was the act's chief author and the moving force behind its bitterly fought progress.
Although tax bills normally originate in the House Ways and Means Committee, Tefra was not a normal bill. In an extraordinary departure from the usual protocol, the bill eventually went to a House-Senate conference with no House version at all; just a few months before a national election, the Democrats who controlled the House were only too happy to step aside and the Republicans who controlled the Senate take credit -- or blame -- for the tax equity act.
Mr. Dole proposed Tefra two years into the Reagan Presidency as a response to the ballooning Federal deficit. Just the year before, Congress had approved the foundational plank of supply-side economics -- a 25 percent cut in individual income tax rates.
As one former Reagan Administration official put it, the act was "the revenge of everyone who was against supply-side economics." The act raised revenues through a series of incremental -- and often arcane -- changes in the I.R.S. code; among its provisions, it increased excise taxes on cigarettes and phone service, increased airport fees, and raised the threshold at which medical expenses became tax deductible. All told, the bill was expected to generate over $100 billion.
In his recently re-issued autobiography, Mr. Dole defends the tax act and the principles behind it this way: "If the old-time religion says you can't endlessly spend more than you take in, then old-time religion is good enough for me."
Over the next several years, Mr. Dole would continue to champion deficit reduction, even at the expense of raising taxes.
In 1983, together with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, he helped engineer a deal to save the Social Security system from insolvency; the deal included a significant increase in payroll taxes as well as a six-month delay in cost-of-living adjustments. The next year, Mr. Dole helped push through a numbingly complicated set of tax increases aimed at reducing the deficit by $50 billion.
In 1985, Mr. Dole, then Senate majority leader, made another bold stand in favor of fiscal responsibility, leading the Senate to adopt a budget plan that would have eliminated 13 Federal programs and, perhaps even more significantly, reduced benefits to Social Security recipients.
The Senate vote on the bill was the sort of cliffhanger rarely captured on C-Span. Then-Senator Pete Wilson of California arrived by ambulance after an emergency appendectomy to cast the crucial "aye" vote, while then-Vice President George Bush flew from Arizona to break the tie. The vote was, at the time, seen as a major victory for Mr. Dole.
Just a few weeks later, though, the Reagan Administration backed away from the Senate bill and its high political price tag, leaving Mr. Dole and his caucus to bear the cost alone. The next year, the Democrats regained control of the Senate.
Mr. Dole's admirers point to the tax and budget bills he championed in the early 1980's as signs of his willingness to take tough political stands when the national interest is at stake. But Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, at that time a House backbencher, was referring to these same bills when he famously branded Mr. Dole "the tax collector of the welfare state."
 
The Political Actor
Reconciling Public And Private Roles
When Mr. Dole resigned from the Senate in June, his colleagues lined up to praise him. Republicans recalled his shrewdness, his sense of honor and his ever-sharp wit. Democrats, for their part, were hardly less admiring.
"His sense of fairness and decency is a standard by which all people in public life should be held," said the Senate's Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who, on matters of substance, tangled with Mr. Dole almost daily.
The praise was more than mere professional courtesy. As the leading Republican in the Senate for 12 years, Mr. Dole affected the lives of virtually every member, helping to determine whether their bills passed and when they got home for the vacation. In this role, Mr. Dole earned the esteem both of colleagues who agreed with him on questions of public policy and those, like Senator Moynihan, who generally did not.
"He has admirers across the political spectrum," Mr. Ornstein observed, "and very few enemies."
What his colleagues prized in Mr. Dole's leadership were skills that, almost by definition, are exercised behind closed doors. Mr. Dole, his fellow Senators observe, was expert in a kind of delicate negotiation and tactical maneuvering that is the real work of the legislative process. His contribution to a bill could consist of offering an amendment to satisfy a crucial but recalcitrant senator, or of persuading a senator not to offer an amendment that could upset a carefully crafted deal. As one former Dole aide put it: "People will never even know a lot of what he did late one night in the Senate."
In the dozen years that Mr. Dole led his fellow Republicans, control of the Senate switched parties twice, first forcing him to give up the majority leader's title and take on the less-exalted minority leader's post, then allowing him to reclaim it. In both positions, Mr. Dole's job was to maintain a unified Republican caucus, a job that grew increasingly difficult as the Senate grew more fractious and individual members more assertive.
In the same years, control of the White House also shifted from one party to the other. By the time Mr. Dole resigned in June, he had played every possible part in the leadership repertoire: majority and minority leader under a Republican President, as well as minority and majority leader under a Democratic President.
Ms. Burke, Mr. Dole's former chief of staff, said the Senator "didn't seem to have difficulty shifting roles" as his job description changed, and it is a credit to Mr. Dole's versatility that his Republican colleagues never seemed to question his ability to make the needed transitions. Indeed, even as one of his chief allies, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, was ousted from the position of Republican whip, Mr. Dole was never seriously challenged.
But if Mr. Dole's record as a Senator presents difficulties for him as a Presidential candidate, his versatility as a political actor is potentially just as problematic.
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Dole's range of political personas was accepted as a necessary response to the shifting demands of his position. Colleagues point out, for example, that when former Senator George Mitchell was majority leader and Mr. Dole minority leader, the two maintained a close working relationship in private even as Mr. Dole excoriated Mr. Mitchell on the floor. For voters, on the other hand, the range of Mr. Dole's roles may simply be confusing.
Americans who remember Mr. Dole from his early years in the Senate, when he served a term as Republican Party chairman, are likely to recall a fierce partisan, one who seemed always willing, even eager, to lash out at his Democratic opponents. Those who remember Mr. Dole from the midpoint of his career are likely to view him as a more moderate figure, a conciliator willing to set aside party advantage for bipartisan agreement. So stark was the contrast in Mr. Dole's behavior, in fact, that journalists in the early 1980's began to speak of a "new" Bob Dole. And some of the Senator's former allies began to question whether he was still committed to conservative causes.
In the last years of his Senate career Mr. Dole's public image went through yet another gyration, from conciliator back to staunch partisan.
Under pressure from his caucus to be more assertive, Mr. Dole became expert at using Senate procedure to all but paralyze the Democratic-controlled chamber, delaying or killing outright a host of Democratic-backed initiatives, including, most famously, President Clinton's economic stimulus package of 1993, which the Administration abandoned when it became clear it could not overcome a Senate Republican filibuster.
When the Republicans took over Congress in 1994, Mr. Dole's renewed partisanship became, if anything, more pronounced. Many had predicted a rocky relationship between the new House Speaker and the longtime Senate Republican leader. The rise of Newt Gingrich, after all, represented a shift of power in the party away from Mr. Dole and his entire generation, toward a younger, more militant group of lawmakers.
But Mr. Dole was determined not to be outflanked by the hardliners in the House -- or by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who was hoping to wrest the Republican Presidential nomination from him -- and he often deferred to Mr. Gingrich on key tactical decisions. Thus, for example, although he generally opposed shutting down the Government as a negotiating tactic in budget talks last year, Mr. Dole agreed to a shutdown when House Republicans insisted they would oppose efforts to reach a compromise with the Administration.
"Might he have moved more quickly on the budget stuff and not shut the Government down?" Ms. Burke asked. "He would probably say 'yes.' "
Ultimately, Mr. Dole's identity in the Senate was, according to many, that of a political pragmatist in the broadest sense of the term.
"Dole is very much from the old school of believing you have to compromise to get things done," Ms. Sinclair, the U.C.L.A. Congressional scholar, said. "But he also has a long history as a sharp partisan. When for partisan reasons, blocking seemed to be the best policy, he certainly was willing to do that."
 
The Insider
Thriving in the Role Of a Deal Maker
One of the keys to Mr. Dole's long tenure as a Senate leader, according to his colleagues, was that he understood the internal dynamic of his caucus so well. Mr. Dole seemed to carry a file in his head, they say, of each member's concerns, from the principles he held dear to the pet projects he wanted protected. And he knew how to use this knowledge to coax and, more occasionally, threaten the members into line.
"He knows where the pressure points are," said Warren B. Rudman, the former Republican Senator from New Hampshire. "And the key to that is understanding everyone and what their needs are. He's not a social guy, but he's a very close observer of humankind."
Mr. Dole himself said: "If I've been successful, it's because I try to know everyone. I tried to know my colleagues and what their interests were. I knew where they were from and what their hot buttons were."
He also knew, colleagues suggest, how important it was to let his fellow Senators have their say; often they did not even know where he stood on a given matter under debate. "His genius is really allowing something to work itself out," said Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine. "He will allow the arguments to play themselves out until you reach a consensus or stalemate."
When agreements were reached, Mr. Dole was known among members of both parties as a man who kept his word. "You could meet with him for 10, 15 minutes and cut a deal and know he would deliver," said Mr. Coelho, the former Democratic House whip.
But above all else, Mr. Dole's colleagues trace his success as a Senate leader to his intense commitment to the institution and, beyond that, his genuine passion for the give-and-take of legislative politics. His hours on the job are legendary, and it is widely asserted that he was happiest when he had two or three meetings going simultaneously.
"Bob is a consummate politician," one longtime adviser observed. "He loves the legislative process. While others had families and interests, he has thought mostly about the Senate and how to get things accomplished. He enjoys it the way other people enjoy golf."
The qualities Mr. Dole brought to his job as Senate leader -- a mastery of the legislative process, an understanding of the folkways of Congress, a commitment to honoring agreements -- are also qualities that presumably would be desirable in a President. Mr. Dole said he thought "it would be a lot easier being President" than Senate majority leader, adding "I frankly don't think Clinton's done a very good job of working with Congress."
But Mr. Dole's skills are also skills that do not necessarily translate well on the campaign trail. They are skills that evoke late-night log rolling and split-the-difference deal-making; skills, in other words that smack of political insiderdom.
"I think being a Senate leader and getting things done is a good thing and will work to Dole's favor," Mr. Smith, of the University of Minnesota, said. "But those aren't the same traits that make an attractive Presidential candidate."
Mr. Dole is clearly aware of Americans' impatience with the political process, and the challenge this poses for him as a candidate. Asked whether Congress deserved its low standing in popular opinion, Mr. Dole said it did not. Then he turned ironic.
"If you go out and say how do you rate your Senator on a scale of 1 to 10, I assume most of us would get a 6 or 7," he said. "How do you rate all these people together? You get about a, what, a 2 or 3? It's only when we're together. If we don't ever meet, we're great."

To the Editor:
"Capitalism Won No Medals" (Op-Ed, Aug. 4), by the Le Monde columnist Erik Izraelewicz, is a wonderful example of the French notion that all works best when entrusted to authoritarian technocrats as long as they are provided with endless funds from taxpayers. Atlanta's approach to the Olympics (fundamentally a private initiative) has certainly made Mr. Izraelewicz's stomach turn.
But let us not apologize for the "two weeks of questionable efficiency, horrendous traffic jams and computer foul-ups." Every noble effort falls short of perfection. Instead, let us celebrate the citizens of Atlanta and their heroic efforts, even in the face of adversity. 
 And if we really want to celebrate, let us celebrate our freedom from those authoritarian technocrats who have brought France unemployment of more than 13 percent, a bankrupt social security system and payroll taxes that can exceed 60 percent.

HEADLINE: A New Fashion Attitude by Women? Maybe;
High Fashion Lives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If the fashion industry were in the dire shape you suggest in your front-page stories (Aug. 5, 6), those of us who report on fashion could put down our pencils and go home. As it is, the fashion industry is alive and well, and it is curious that you should choose this moment to suggest otherwise.
In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, the fashion industry suffered serious setbacks, as did virtually every other industry in the country. Few people while away a recession shopping for co-ops, cars or clothes.
More recently, a stronger economy has resulted in more confident consumers, who, however chastened by the early 90's, are not so chastened that they are ready to spend the late 90's dressed exclusively in khakis and T-shirts. 
 As for the evidence you have compiled to prove that fashion is a dated folly American women are no longer willing to indulge, I find it incomplete. For example, while Sharon Stone did wear a black Gap turtleneck to the Oscars this year, she wore a Giorgio Armani evening coat over that turtleneck -- a detail you chose to omit.
Another example is the news that Martha's has closed its Park Avenue doors. But the vacancy left by Martha's has been more than filled by Calvin Klein, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Prada, Gianni Versace and Valentino, all of whom either have opened or are about to open dazzling new stores in Manhattan.
There is another indicator that the rumors of fashion's death are greatly exaggerated: the 708-page September issue of Vogue is the largest since September 1989.

A Final Round In Dole's Dance To Pick a No. 2

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Just two days before he plans to announce his choice of a running mate, Bob Dole let it be known today that he had added a late entrant to the Vice-Presidential list, Jack F. Kemp, with whom Mr. Dole has often feuded in the past.
But for all the sudden interest in Mr. Kemp, one person close to both him and Mr. Dole cautioned that the ever-evolving list could change again by nightfall. Mr. Kemp, he said, was the top contender "for the hour." 
 So goes the quadrennial dance of the running mates. Before Mr. Kemp's rise, Senator Connie Mack of Florida was purported to be Mr. Dole's favorite on the list. A day or so earlier, it was Senator John McCain of Arizona on the top of the list. Former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell of South Carolina has been on and off more times than a head waiter's smile.
Then there is Gov. John Engler of Michigan. For a year he was the contender most heavily promoted (often by his own aides). Then, Mr. Dole's advisers said they were not interested. Then they were. Now, no one knows where Mr. Engler stands.
In fact, only one man -- Bob Dole -- knows where all the Vice-Presidential wannabees stand. And, as a politician who likes to pop surprises, he must be thoroughly enjoying the confusion. After all, Mr. Dole had told aides that he would not have gone through with his dramatic decision to quit the Senate in June had the move been leaked to the press.
Today only Mr. Dole knew whether he would really pick Mr. Kemp. Or whether he was tossing out the name to keep the guessing game going (better to have the press focus on a running mate than on the tussling over abortion). Or whether he was trying to prove to stalwart supply-siders that he really does believe that tax cut he proposed this week will strengthen the economy.
"Bob Dole may have been thinking about Kemp for the last three months and not told any one," said former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, who is close to Mr. Dole and marvels at his love of suspense.
Asked for his best analysis of Mr. Dole's thinking, Mr. Rudman -- who once served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this afternoon, "at least until yesterday, he didn't know." But then again, Mr. Rudman quickly added, even if Mr. Dole had made up his mind, he might not have told him.
If for no other reason, the notion of a Dole-Kemp ticket is intriguing because the two have never been fond of each other. Republicans were rolling their eyes at the vision of the laconic Mr. Dole gritting his teeth through weekly lunches at the White House with a garrulous Vice President Kemp.
Mr. Kemp, 61, a Housing Secretary in the Bush Administration, has many appealing attributes.
But most of Mr. Dole's advisers had ruled out Mr. Kemp on the day last April when he infuriated Mr. Dole by endorsing Steve Forbes's sputtering bid for the Republican nomination. That capped years of tension between the two men.
The strain between Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp was most public in 1988 when both vied -- unsuccessfully -- for the Republican Presidential nomination.
After a mailing by the Kemp campaign attacked Mr. Dole for trying to freeze Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, Mr. Dole lambasted Mr. Kemp for trying "to scare old people."
The Clinton campaign is no doubt salivating over the possibilities for commercials, such as a reminder that Mr. Kemp once ridiculed Mr. Dole and then-Vice President George Bush as "old guard Republicans."
Jude Wanniski, a political economist who for months has promoted Mr. Kemp as the best choice for Mr. Dole, said Mr. Kemp's outspokenness was an attribute. "The big argument against Jack is that he's a loose cannon on deck," he said. "What Dole is saying is, 'With Jack Kemp in the adjoining office to mine, whenever I have an uncontrollable urge to raise taxes or bomb North Korea, Jack will tackle me in the corridors.' " Mr. Wanniski played down the strains between the two, saying, "I know Dole doesn't dislike Jack as much as everyone thinks he does."
Whatever their motivation, Mr. Dole's aides today were unexpectedly enthusiastic about the potential for a Kemp pick. They noted that Mr. Dole met with the former Buffalo Congressman for at least two hours on Wednesday night at the Watergate complex in Washington, where Mr. Dole owns an apartment.
Aides to Mr. Dole said that, for now, their plan is to unveil his running mate on Saturday in Mr. Dole's hometown of Russell, Kan., before the two arrive here for the Republican National Convention that opens on Monday.
The betting on the running-mate is something of an industry for politicians, consultants and analysts who are talked-out on abortion and on the strengths and weaknesses of Bob Dole. Some of the speculation center on whether Mr. Kemp's apparent emergence is a sign that the nominee-in-waiting is hard pressed to find a choice who would get voters' attention, fill the specifications Mr. Dole has set for the No. 2 slot and satisfy all of the competing constituencies within the Republican Party.
Part of the frustration for the Dole camp is that even Mr. Dole's advisers say they still long for a powerhouse like Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is wildly popular in the polls but has professed not to be interested in the Vice Presidency. Without General Powell, some advisers say, the choice may come down to a contender who will simply not damage the ticket.
"I've always felt that Colin Powell would be a terrific Vice President and I believe the next best choice is Jack Kemp," said Steven Merksamer, a lawyer in Sacramento, Calif., who is close to Mr. Kemp and an informal adviser to the Dole campaign. "The rest of the choices are fine, but I don't think any of them have the charisma or the energy."
Mr. Dole has long said that his main concern about the selection was that he be comfortable with his running mate. But Mr. Dole has also said he wanted someone who would score a '10' with the public -- and others whom his advisers have said have been considered may be solid but have never been accused of being exciting: Mr. Mack is not well known nationally; Mr McCain has had a social life that may be a bit too colorful for some Republicans; Mr. Campbell is a consummate Washington insider; and Mr. Engler is thought by some Republicans to have little charm.
Michael Nelson, a political scientist at Rhodes College in Memphis who has written extensively about the Vice-Presidential selection process, was not ready to believe the whispers about Mr. Kemp. Asked to evaluate the possible choice, he said: "It will depend on whether he's seriously considering Kemp or making a show. It's not clear to me whether he's seriously considering Kemp or creating an illusion that he's seriously considering Kemp."
Despite their differences, Mr. Kemp is regarded as having many plusses: He can be be presented as possessing the stature and experience to step into the Oval Office. He is popular with the party's rank and file. He is well liked by some Democrats because of his championing of inner cities.
"Kemp has always been someone who Dole has been interested in because he, simultaneously, is the most popular Republican among Republicans and the most popular Republican among Democrats," said a senior aide to Mr. Dole, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. But there is another reason Mr. Dole may -- or may not -- be thinking of Mr. Kemp. As the candidate said recently of his selection: "It'll be, hopefully, a surprise. But not to me."

The approval was a formality after the United States said Wednesday that it would accept the program; the committee's other 14 members had already agreed. 
 Iraq is to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months, on a renewable basis. Before exports can begin, the United Nations must appoint overseers to approve individual contracts and station monitors in Iraq.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Mark Rises on New Doubt About Europe's Money Plan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday on dimming prospects for higher interest rates in the United States and a broad rally in the German mark, which benefited from new doubts about plans for one European currency by 1999.
Traders said the mark's strength was the dominant theme in the market, reflecting fear that divergent agendas of the large European countries would undermine the proposed single currency. The mark has tended to rise on any sign that the proposal might be delayed or altered. 
 The French franc was particularly hard hit by surging demand for marks, falling to a four-month low against the German currency. France, Europe's second-biggest economy behind Germany, is facing big deficit problems and may not meet the strict criteria required under the single-currency plan.
"We had a big flight to quality to the Deutsche mark today," said Jack Stearns, an analyst with Refco Group in Chicago.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4780 marks, down from 1.4842 Thursday. The dollar traded at 108.24 yen, unchanged from Thursday. The British pound slipped to $1.5485 from $1.5490.
The dollar's steadiness against the yen reflects an expectation that interest rates in Japan will remain at historic lows for a while. Japanese finance officials said earlier this week that they foresaw no need to raise them. Rising rates in Japan would tend to strengthen the yen by increasing the return on yen-denominated investments.
The prospect of steady or lower rates in Japan emerged early yesterday after the Bank of Japan reported sluggish lending by Japanese banks in July. The data suggested that many companies were still unwilling or unable to borrow because the economy remained weak.
The dollar benefited from that news initially but the gain was offset later when the Labor Department reported that producer prices stagnated in July. The report, coupled with other evidence of an economic slowdown in the United States, suggested that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates at its next policy-making meeting Aug. 20.
"With dollar-yen, there was no reason to sell or buy today," said Kosuke Hanao, head of foreign exchange trading at the New York office of the Industrial Bank of Japan.

HEADLINE: More Previews Than Performances

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Largely sold out since its previews began on July 25, "Hughie," the Eugene O'Neill revival directed by and starring Al Pacino at Circle in the Square, has extended its run by two weeks, to Sept. 14.
The one-act drama, about a restless gambler who talks the ear off a night clerk at a fleabag hotel, is not scheduled for its official opening until Aug. 22, and was to have closed on Aug. 31. Still, it will probably be seen by more people before its opening than after. 
 As the wisecracking Pacino character, Erie Smith, might ask: What gives?
Only the latest example of that latter-day Broadway institution: the extended preview.
After the famously exacting Mr. Pacino tried out the play for nearly three weeks last month at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, it came to Broadway for four more weeks of performances designated as previews, from which critics, by convention, are excluded. The play, last seen on Broadway in 1973 with Ben Gazzara, was to have run only 10 more days after its opening, but the extension has added 14 days. So: previews, 28 days; regular run, 24 days.
Although ticket prices at preview performances are often discounted, seats at the previews of "Hughie" have been going at full price, $55. But a spokesman for Circle in the Square said yesterday that starting on Sept. 2, it would make available 50 tickets at each performance for same-day sale at $20. In addition, he said, students with valid identification will have access to 50 more seats on Aug. 25 and Sept. 8 for same-day sale at $20.
The indelicate balance of a performing schedule that consigns the opening to the tail end of a run is hardly unknown on Broadway. Presenters of musical spectacles in particular have sometimes looked to the relative financial security of a long preview run as insurance against a bad review. Off Broadway, Joseph Papp became adept at prolonged previews at the Public Theater, but the practice has been less common at nonprofit theaters like Circle in the Square.
Mr. Pacino, approached through representatives, did not respond to requests for an interview. But Josephine R. Abady, co-artistic director of the theater, said that Mr. Pacino's crowded schedule allowed for only a limited run. "Our feeling is any artist deserves two or three weeks of previews," she said. She said that "Hughie," like other plays, depended on "a collaborative process" between artists and audience that took time to perfect.
When it comes to previews, "people are savvy theatergoers," she said. "They understand it's an opportunity for an artist to amend his work." She called Mr. Pacino "extremely meticulous about the production" and said there was no intention to bypass the critics, although, she said, the heavy ticket sales meant the show did not have to depend on critics for an audience.
The circumstances parallel Mr. Pacino's last appearance at Circle in the Square, in 1992, when he starred in two one-act plays, "Salome" and "Chinese Coffee," which were not open to reviewers until almost six weeks into a two-month run.
Now previews are again in the spotlight. The New Yorker this week raised the issue in a short article on "Hughie" that slipped in a brief pre-opening critique (positive) of Mr. Pacino's performance. Some critics argue that with so many people flocking to the show or clamoring to get in, the public should not be deprived of an evaluation.
While producers would still prefer to rehearse a show away from New York City's prying eyes and ears, said the longtime producer Alexander Cohen, the economics are prohibitive. "To take a show to Boston for two weeks," he said, "would cost $400,000." Instead, he said, shows are now routinely tested or fine-tuned in previews.
Bernard Gersten, executive director of Lincoln Center Theater, said: "We normally preview for the better part of four weeks. With a new play, you're wrestling with the text and revisions with the playwright. With a revival, you're dealing with nuance." But he acknowledged that there had been abuses by producers trying to maximize income before a reckoning with the critics.
After the Broadway musical "Merlin" went through eight weeks of previews, seating 60,000 full-paying customers with no sign of opening, Frank Rich of The New York Times attended unbidden in 1983, finding little to like apart from the illusionist stunts of the magician Doug Henning.
Even more notorious was the musical "Nick and Nora," which performed 71 previews over nine weeks in front of 100,000 customers paying full price before the troubled show opened in December 1991 and closed after nine performances. The experience prompted an inquiry by the city's Department of Consumer Affairs and a new industry practice of clearly labeling as previews all shows that have not been open to review.
For their part, many producers link the growing reliance on previews to a concentration of power in the hands of ever fewer critics, increasing the risks of a critical failure. "There's an undue dependence of the Broadway theater on the critic," said Robert Brustein, artistic director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and theater critic of The New Republic. "They want to run as long as possible before the death sentence."

HEADLINE: Price Report Shows No Sign Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Inflation is nowhere to be found these days.
After more than five years of solid economic expansion -- and a spring surge at perhaps twice the sustainable pace -- producer prices for finished goods showed no change in July while goods at an earlier stage of production declined in price for a second month, Labor Department figures showed today. 
 David Orr, an economist for the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., called it "an amazing performance," adding that it would be hard to imagine any reason for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates at its Aug. 20 meeting.
The bond market rallied on the figures, which were better than most analysts had expected. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10 basis points, to 6.69 percent. Stocks, however, finished lower.
The prices of finished goods -- those ready for sale to the final business or individual user -- remained flat last month, helped by the third consecutive monthly decline in energy prices. When the volatile energy component was excluded, prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent.
Over the last 12 months, producer inflation has been at an overall rate of 2.6 percent. The rate was only 1.5 percent without energy or food, another erratic component.
"This is an excellent reading," William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said of today's report. "What was particularly impressive was the total absence of pressures in the pipeline," he said, referring to the price of goods at the next-earlier stage of production, like bolts of cloth or sacks of flour. For these goods, prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent last month to generate the first back-to-back decline in nearly five years.
Raw materials climbed 1.2 percent in price last month, recovering about half of the June decline. Crude goods other than food and energy fell a hefty 1.6 percent, a bit more than in June, to bring the 12-month decline to 13.5 percent.
The only apparent inflation risk might come from a tightening labor market. With the unemployment rate at 5.4 percent, many employers have been forced to step up efforts to attract and retain workers.
If the still-subdued pace of pay increases was to accelerate, the shift would probably show up in the Consumer Price Index -- 57 percent of which reflects the price of services -- before it would push up the Producer Price Index, which only indirectly reflects pay.
The consumer index for July, to be released Tuesday, is expected to show a moderate rise of two-tenths of 1 percent, further reassuring an inflation-wary Federal Reserve.
Still, with a nod toward the possibility of surprise, Mr. Sullivan and other analysts did not entirely rule out a Fed move to tighten monetary policy this month.
The flat showing of producer prices in today's report was heavily influenced by a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the price of energy. Gasoline prices fell 2.8 percent while residential electricity prices dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Food, meanwhile, edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent, after June's surge of 1.6 percent. Last month, the price of fresh fruits and melons tumbled 15.4 percent, pork prices dropped and the prices of dairy products, beef, veal and processed chickens rose at a slower pace.
Passenger car prices registered a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent, essentially erasing a June rise, while textiles for the home jumped 1.7 percent and capital equipment rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase since November.
Among intermediate goods, which as a group are now two-tenths of 1 percent less costly than in July 1995, nondurables used in manufacturing dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent. In June, nondurables were unchanged. The prices of plastic resins, chemicals and paint materials turned down and paper prices fell again. But, the price of wood pulp accelerated, jumping 5.3 percent after advancing 2.9 percent in June.
For durables used in factory processes, overall prices turned down by nine-tenths of 1 percent as aluminum ready for fabrication fell faster and various forms of hot-rolled steel rose at a slower pace than in June. Copper, aluminum and plywood prices also fell less than in June, while the price of flat glass turned higher.
The index for construction materials eased one-tenth of 1 percent in July, after a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent. Softwood lumber slumped 3.2 percent, reversing a June rise.

HEADLINE: Rally Sends Bond Yields To the Lowest In 4 Months

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The bond market rallied strongly yesterday after a Government report showed that inflation at the producer level remained subdued in July. The rally pushed long-term interest rates to a four-month low.
Bond prices rose after the Labor Department reported that producer prices over all were unchanged in July, after a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in June. 
 The core Producer Price Index, which excludes the volatile energy and food sectors, rose a slight one-tenth of 1 percent in July, against an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in June.
"The P.P.I. data show there is not even a glimmer of an inflation problem in the pipeline," said Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc. "The inflation picture is excellent."
The inflation data lured investors back to the market after two days of losses tied to a large influx of fresh bonds from the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32 , to 10026/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell from 6.79 percent on Thursday to 6.69 percent, the lowest the yield has been since early April.
The report on producer prices bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged at the next meeting of its policy-making committee on Aug. 20.
"The market got a good boost from the P.P.I. report," said William Sharp, an economist at Smith Barney Inc.
Treasury bonds also received a helping hand from two surprising interventions by the Federal Reserve, as the central bank bought back Treasury securities in an effort to add reserves to the nation's banking system.
During the operations, known in the market as coupon passes, the Fed bought securities with maturities ranging from Nov. 15, 2006, to Feb. 15, 2026. It also bought securities expiring from Aug. 15, 2001, to July 15, 2006.
Both operations are for delivery on Monday.
Analysts said the Fed action was technical and reflected a seasonal currency need in the economy.
The operations had no implications for monetary policy, the analysts said.
Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America) Inc., said he believed the Fed would have to undertake another such intervention soon, most likely "just ahead of Labor Day," which is on Sept. 2.
Although market sentiment was mostly positive, some analysts dropped a word of caution, saying a possible rise in consumer spending in August could revive some inflationary fears.
"I think the market will be fine over the very near term because the news will be consistent with what the market thinks about the economy," said William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The risk is later on when the August data start to show that the consumer is coming back."
Mr. Dudley said he expected gross domestic product to rise at a 3 percent annual pace in the third quarter and 3.5 percent in the last three months of the year. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter.
In the corporate market, prices rose in lock step with Treasuries across all sectors, traders said.
High-yield bond activity yesterday was topped by $200 million of 10-year senior notes offered by the Stone Container Finance Company of Canada in a private placement led by Salomon Brothers Inc.
The notes, rated B1 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by Standard & Poor's, were priced at par to yield 11.50 percent.
In another private placement, Mariner Energy Inc. sold $100 million of 10-year senior subordinated notes to yield 10.58 percent via Morgan Stanley & Company.
The notes are rated B3 by Moody's and B- by Standard & Poor's.
A flood of new corporate issues is expected next week including a $1.5 billion, four-part offering from Aetna Services, a unit of Aetna Inc.
Aetna Services will be offering 5-year, 10- and 30-year notes along with a 40-year tranche with an 8-year put, traders said, adding that demand for the issue is strong. Merrill Lynch is the lead manager.
Also, the Sprint Spectrum L.P./Finance Corporation is expected to issue $650 million in a two-part offering, with Lehman Brothers as the lead manager.

HEADLINE: Domingo Cavallo's Achievement

 BODY:
Few people get the chance to play so constructive a role in their country's history as Domingo Cavallo, who resigned last month after five years as Argentina's Finance Minister. Applying his own powerful intellect and personality, and enjoying the unflinching political support of President Carlos Saul Menem, Mr. Cavallo guided an economy desperately sick with hyperinflation and corruption back to vitality and international respectability.
The benefits of Argentina's economic revival have been unequally distributed. Mr. Cavallo's ruthless war against inflation and his vigorous privatization campaign have brought high unemployment and painful reductions in social programs. But by most measures Argentina's overall economic performance and its future prospects now look better than at any time in the past 65 years. 
 Before Mr. Cavallo took office in 1991, the Government paid its bills by printing money, sending prices soaring. Mr. Cavallo stripped the Government of its unfettered right to print money, creating a "currency board" that tied the value of the peso to the United States dollar. He pledged that additional pesos would not be created unless Argentina, through trade and investment, accumulated sufficient dollar reserves to back new currency. That way foreigners would be assured that they could redeem pesos for dollars at full value.
Inflation fell to near zero and the economy prospered, growing more than 7 percent a year. Mr. Cavallo then sold large blocks of the economy to private investors, who managed to boost output even as they laid off employees from bloated Government enterprises. If the economy continues to prosper, the laid-off workers will soon find new jobs.
Mr. Cavallo's success helped Mr. Menem win re-election in 1995. But last month, after union protests against increased unemployment, Mr. Menem decided that the Finance Minister's political usefulness had come to an end.
By replacing Mr. Cavallo with Roque Fernandez, the University of Chicago-trained president of the central bank, Mr. Menem signaled that he remains committed to anti-inflation policies. But Mr. Fernandez lacks Mr. Cavallo's independent authority to confront corrupt bureaucrats and unions, many of whom wield influence in the ruling Peronist Party. If Mr. Menem wants credit for Mr. Cavallo's impressive achievement, he must take on that politically hazardous assignment himself.

HEADLINE: Mr. Kemp's Return

 BODY:
He could not get Colin Powell, and he apparently felt that neither the new-generation Midwestern Governors like John Engler nor the low-recognition Senators like Connie Mack and John McCain could help him close President Clinton's 20-point lead. So after a last-minute courtship, Bob Dole is said to have settled on Jack Kemp as his running mate. Given the relative obscurity of those who were still on the leader board as of mid-week, it was not a dumb choice.
Mr. Kemp does not have Mr. Powell's national allure, but his careers as a football star, Congressman and Cabinet member have made him highly visible. He is a strong campaigner who looks younger than his 61 years, he actually believes in Mr. Dole's newfound economic views, and he is just enough of an original thinker to give the Democrats something to worry about. His independent turn of mind may also cause Mr. Dole anxious moments. 
 
 His selection can only reinforce the widening gulf between the G.O.P.'s economic strategy and Bill Clinton's. Mr. Kemp, an original supply-sider, has long argued that massive tax cuts promote economic growth and social regeneration. He endorsed Steve Forbes in the primaries because he liked Mr. Forbes's flat tax more than he liked Mr. Dole's preoccupation with deficit reduction. Mr. Dole has now publicly embraced Reaganomics, but he has not revealed what he thinks of Mr. Kemp's long-winded sermons for the gold standard.
Mr. Kemp is also against abortion, which should please the Christian right but will do little to win back the legions of pro-choice women in the G.O.P. On other issues he has infuriated many of his Republican colleagues. In 1994, for example, he opposed Proposition 187, a California ballot initiative that denied public services like health care to illegal immigrants. His generally tolerant views on immigration have greatly annoyed the G.O.P.'s Buchanan wing, and Pat Buchanan's combative sister, Bay, said yesterday that Mr. Kemp would not have been her first choice.
Mr. Kemp also believes in affirmative action and criticizes those who would make it an issue. When he removed himself from the Presidential running last year, he warned his party that it would find it "very hard to govern if it runs a campaign that separates people by race and gender."
In truth, Mr. Kemp has been one of the G.O.P.'s more thoughtful politicians on issues involving the cities and the underclass -- albeit with a Kemp-like spin. Under the banner of "empowerment," he has encouraged "enterprise zones" in poor neighborhoods and promoted market-driven strategies to help the poor buy their own homes and choose their own schools. Those may not be the right answers, but at least Mr. Kemp has thought about the problem. One of his regrets about his tenure as Housing Secretary was that he could not get George Bush's White House to focus on inner-city poverty.
Bob Dole, once a deficit hawk, and Jack Kemp, a tax cutter, have had their difficulties over the years. Mr. Dole has obviously chosen to set past differences aside to strengthen his ticket with someone who himself might have been a plausible Presidential candidate.

HEADLINE: Bad Driving Knows No Bias;
And Women Are Paying Insurance Rates to Prove It

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

 BODY:
Once the butt of sexist jokes, women drivers now pose a genuine hazard: they are acting too much as men do behind the wheel. Having already drawn about equal in their numbers on the road, women are making gains in categories in which they have always lagged far behind: accidents and deaths.
As they compete with men in the working world and otherwise erase differences in roles, women under 25, in particular, are also paying heftier auto insurance premiums. 
 "What we see today is a considerable blurring of differences between American men and women compared to 10 years ago and surely 20 years ago, and this is being reflected in highway accident statistics," said Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry-sponsored research group based in Arlington, Va.
"Women used to get in the right- hand lane and stay there," observed Capt. Patrick McQueeny of the Rhode Island State Police. "Now you see them speeding more and weaving in and out of traffic. It's not unusual to find them bombing up behind you at 80 m.p.h."
As a group, men still far outdistance women in the speeding and drinking associated with high-risk driving. But as fatalities among male drivers held steady over the last decade, the death rate for women climbed. Two decades ago, more than five times as many male drivers were killed in traffic crashes as were female drivers. Today, the ratio has narrowed to 3 to 1.
And during a period when public campaigns against drunken-driving cut the number of fatal accidents for both sexes, the death rate for women in alcohol-related accidents has not dropped as sharply as the rate for men.
From an actuarial perspective, the historic advantage women under 25 held on auto insurance rates has been pared almost in half the last 20 years, according to insurance industry figures.
In 1980, for instance, unmarried women ages 17 to 20 paid 47 percent above the adult base rate for insurance, while men in the same age group paid 187 percent more, according to the Insurance Services Office, a New York nonprofit organization that advises the industry on rates. By 1995, comparable rates for women jumped to 115 percent above the base rate; rates for young men, meanwhile, dipped slightly to 185 percent of the base. There was an even greater convergence of premiums for men and women in the 21-24 group.
"The accident frequency of younger women as reflected in our claims certainly has increased, while it remains comparatively constant for males over the same period," noted Dale Nelson, an actuary for State Farm, the nation's largest underwriter of auto insurance.
Researchers point to a variety of economic and social reasons for the change. Clearly, they say, more women are driving today than have ever before. In 1994, the nation's 175 million licensed drivers were almost evenly split between men and women. In 1963, women represented less than 40 percent of 93.5 million licensed drivers.
Not only are there more female drivers on the road, but they are also driving many more miles a year than their mothers did -- often at night and in bad weather, conditions when accident rates spike. Besides commuting to jobs, women do more than their share of ferrying children to day care, school and weekend activities.
"Men drive longer distances, but women take more trips," said Patricia Waller, director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.
"What is troubling is how societal pressures are putting more women at risk," she said. "Single moms make the most trips daily of any group, often under great stress and distractions. Racing to pick up a child at a day center so you won't be penalized $1 a minute if you're late can be very stressful."
Still, Mr. Nelson of State Farm, among others, said he doubted that women drivers would ever match men, either in overall aggressiveness or in high-risk behavior like road racing, drunken driving and using vehicles as weapons against other motorists. It is an axiom of the industry that testosterone is the most powerful drug on the road contributing to accidents.
Indeed, critics of "unisex" insurance rating in Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Hawaii and Montana contend that the laws, intended to prohibit insurance companies from discriminating between the sexes, effectively leave young women subsidizing the bad driving records of men. Diana Lee, an assistant vice president of the National Association of Independent Insurers, estimated that in a unisex-rating state like Michigan, young woman pay $400 a year more for auto insurance than they would based on actuarial standards used in other states.
"Women are being more aggressive in their careers, competing with males in the same fields, and it's no surprise this pattern would naturally carry over to their life styles and driving behavior," Ms. Lee said. "But young female drivers still have substantially lower loss costs than male drivers."
Capt. Paul Krisavich of the Connecticut State Police agreed that women as a group tended to be more safety conscious than men were. "But you find more today who are assertive in a negative way on the roads," he was quick to add. "You run into as many obnoxious female drunks behind the wheel as males." He added that when he is driving in an unmarked patrol car, he finds that female drivers are just as likely to make obscene gestures as are male drivers.
"I think if I do anything on the road that guys do all the time, people say, 'Look at that woman driver,' " said Amy Hughes, a 19-year-old from Philadelphia. Defiance edged into her voice as she waited outside the Dover Township Municipal Court in New Jersey with a friend who was answering a charge that she was going 72 miles an hour in a 50-mile-an-hour zone on the way to a beach resort.
The friend, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said she was fearful her insurance premium would shoot up if she pleaded guilty to the charge; it would be her second moving violation this summer. "But I can't afford to take time off from work and come back and fight it," she explained, adding with a shrug that it would probably be a losing cause, anyway.
Steven A. Zabarsky, the Dover Township traffic court prosecutor, said the rate of tickets issued for moving violations is now "gender neutral," though men continue to hold a big lead in charges involving alcohol or drugs.
"Women in the 17 to 25 age group are held to the same social standards of men, and that shows up in their driving habits," he said. "There is very little difference in the numbers we see today."
Serious research on sex-based differences in driving habits is scant. Most studies concentrate on male drivers because they have accounted for most accidents, injuries and deaths. But issues specific to women drivers are now getting more attention, even though financing for research remains a problem.
"We know there are significant and disproportionate injuries to females that are of concern to everyone," said Mr. O'Neill of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. "For instance, short drivers -- more often than not female -- have trouble reaching the gas pedal and brakes and are forced to sit too close to the steering wheel for their own safety." A possible solution, he said, was for auto makers to offer cars equipped with adjustable controls not just adjustable seats.
"There are suggestions in the literature that women drivers may be more impaired than men at the same levels of alcohol in their blood," added Dr. Waller, the Michigan researcher. For example, in a study for the Insurance Institute, Dr. Paul Zador, the investigator, found that female drivers ages 21-30 faced a significantly higher risk of death than did male drivers the same age with blood alcohol levels below 0.10 percent, the usual standard for drunken-driving citations.
Carol Popkin, a researcher in North Carolina who heads a National Academy of Sciences subcommittee on female drivers, said further study was needed to explain why women have more rear-end, left-turn and angle collisions than do men. "How do women handle divided-attention tasks as relate to driving?" she asked, referring to common situations such as having a fighting pair of 8-year-olds in a back seat.
Whatever the explanation, it appears law enforcement is more likely to ticket women for driving infractions than in the past.
In Maryland, state police, alarmed by recent increases in driving deaths, are taking aim at aggressive drivers -- and ticketing increased numbers of women in the process.
Fatal accidents involving female drivers in the state totaled 184 in 1993, climbed to 209 in 1994 and jumped again to 241 last year, according to highway officials. Fatal accidents involving male drivers held steady, in the 605 to 614 range, during the same period.
"There are some females out there crazier than men," said Amy Constanzi, a Maryland state trooper, as she patrolled Ocean City-bound traffic on a busy Route 50 one recent weekend. "The worst drunk I've arrested was a female who was way more belligerent than any man, who said I was locking her up only because she was a female."

Graphs: "Picking Up Bad Habits"
As the driving habits of women have become more like men's, the number of accidents they are involved in has also grown. Insurance companies have responded by raising the premiums women pay for car insurance, significantly narrowing the gap between what young female drivers and young male drivers pay.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Suit Erases Impact Of Price Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A verdict against a leading tobacco maker late yesterday afternoon pulled stocks sharply lower, erasing slim earlier gains from a tame inflation report that had sent interest rates lower in the bond market.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.18 points, to 5,681.31. But most of it came in the last half-hour as Philip Morris shares plunged on news of the $750,000 damage award in Florida against another tobacco company. 
The verdict against Brown & Williamson Tobacco, a unit of B.A.T. of Britain, will be appealed. But the potential crack in the cigarette industry's armor against smoker liability suits sent Philip Morris, a Dow component, and other tobacco shares sliding and provided investors with a late excuse to sell in an otherwise lackluster session.
Philip Morris shares were halted at 102, a loss of 3 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange -- the equivalent of more than 10 Dow points -- but the stock wound up falling 14 5/8 in after-hours trading, threatening the Dow with the equivalent of a 45-point slide at Monday's opening.
Other tobacco makers tumbled. RJR Nabisco plunged 4 1/4, to 28; Loews, sank 3 5/8, to 78 7/8; UST, skidded 2 1/8, to 31 3/4, before also being halted on the Big Board; American Brands slid 1 5/8, to 44 1/8, and the American depository receipts of B.A.T., each representing two shares, dropped 5/16 , to 15 5/8.
Stocks received a lift earlier as bonds rallied after a Labor Department report that producer prices were unchanged in July, the latest in a stream of signals that inflation is not threatening to ruin a six-year economic expansion.
But the stock market failed to rally even as long-term interest rates fell to their lowest level since early April.
"You've got a lot of the good news factored in here already," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, noting last week's rally on a series of mild economic readings. "The market had already gone a long way toward anticipating the good Producer Price Index news and interest rate scenario."
Broader indexes were lower yesterday. The Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.24 point, to 1,137.27, up 12.35 on the week. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 0.49, at 662.10, off 0.39 from last Friday. For the week, the Dow was up 1.48 points.
 But the number of stocks that rose yesterday exceeded the number that declined on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
Semiconductor issues were weaker yesterday after a report late on Thursday from the Semiconductor Industry Association. The association said its July book-to-bill ratio, which measures new orders against shipments, fell to 0.85 from a downwardly revised June ratio of 0.88.
Micron Technology fell 7/8, to 24 5/8; LSI Logic 1 1/8, to 22 5/8; Texas Instruments 1, to 46 3/4; Motorola 1 5/8, to 56 1/4, and National Semiconductor fell 3/4, to 15 1/2. Intel, however, rose 1 5/8, to 82 3/8, in active trading.
Among other decliners, Pepsico dropped 1 1/8, to 30 3/8, on concern that a third-quarter loss at its Argentine bottler would hurt earnings.
America Online lost 4 1/8, to 29 1/4, despite a strong quarterly earnings report. Investors remained concerned about a possible repeat of a service blackout and nervous about subscriber and revenue growth, industry analysts said.
Earlier, stocks closed lower in Tokyo and London. The Nikkei index of 225 leading Japanese issues fell 180.26 points, or nearly nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 20,551.05. For the week, the Nikkei was down 389.36 points. In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 shares slipped seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 3,810.7. But the index was up 40.1 for the week.

HEADLINE: Economic Worry On South Africa Again Hits Rand

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The South African rand is getting its second hammering of the year as foreign investors and currency traders worry that President Nelson Mandela's Government may be losing its will to force through the economic-liberalization measures it has proposed to increase growth and curb the country's mounting social ills.
The rand took a beating earlier this year when rumors about Mr. Mandela's health swirled through the currency markets. Now, the latest assault on the rand, which has been building since the installation of a new Finance Minister and the subsequent unveiling of an economic plan, represents the first signs that international confidence in post-apartheid South Africa is faltering. 
 The concern is that the Government may lose its will to construct an open, liberal economic order and stem a slide toward political instability at a time when a third of the black population remains unemployed and violent crime is rising sharply.
"The A.N.C. knows what to do," said Jean-Francois Mercier of Salomon Brothers, referring to the governing African National Congress. "The question is: Can it afford to do it politically? They have a plan to raise growth and ease social tensions. But they can't implement it because it looks like a present to the whites."
Not everyone agrees that President Mandela's honeymoon with Western investors is coming to an end. Some South Africa-watchers remain deeply impressed by the pragmatism his Government has displayed and its readiness to embrace Western capitalism.
"The bulk of the political risk is behind us now, but there are always investors who see a political disaster coming," said Douglas Clark Johnson, senior international investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, adding, "South Africa has a lot going for it."
But the fact remains that the Mandela Government is having increasing difficulty convincing its supporters that sacrifices are needed now to foster economic growth later and with it, a lasting reduction in poverty, unemployment and homelessness.
In a vote of confidence in President Mandela's restrained economic policies, the rand strengthened sharply early last year, rising from around 4.25 to the dollar, or 23.5 cents, to the 3.70 range, or 27 cents, where it held roughly steady until February. Then it started to slide, reaching an all-time low of 4.58 in intraday trading late in April before climbing back to around 4.35 to the dollar, where it again held steady until a second bout of weakness set in around mid-July. Late yesterday, it settled in New York trading around 4.53 to the dollar.
Just why the rand began falling in February is less than clear. Andre Jonker of Rand International Securities, a New York trading house, thinks that the decline was set off by rumors about Mr. Mandela's health and reports that the Government might dismiss the conservative governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Christian Stals.
Mr. Johnson of Merrill Lynch thinks it fell victim to the bond selloff in the United States, which encouraged investors to move out of South African bonds, as well. Whatever the case, many economists say the rand was basically overvalued at 3.70 to the dollar and ripe for a correction.
In March, confidence was shaken when Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg, a politically nonaligned white former bank chairman, was replaced by Trevor Manuel, an ex-Communist from the A.N.C.'s ruling elite, who says he has now converted to the virtues of free enterprise.
Late in April, Mr. Manuel visited the United States to reassure bankers, investors and Government officials that he would continue his predecessor's moderate policies. But the effect was "rather negative," according to Carsten Hills of Standard of New York, a subsidiary of the Standard Bank Group of South Africa, "because his background was not in finance."
Now, rumors are again swirling that the Government is unhappy with its central banker, Mr. Stals, about high interest rates.
And there is renewed concern over the relatively low level of South Africa's foreign-exchange reserves. The reserves fell 8 percent in July, to $2.4 billion.
Further contributing to the bearish sentiment last week, dealers said, was the central bank's failure on Thursday to again raise interest rates in hope of stemming the rand's descent, as some had expected it to do.
But a more fundamental concern, traders said, was the view that the Mandela Government was not moving fast enough to carry out its promised economic changes, with the purpose of stimulating growth. In June, it introduced a package of measures intended to lift the growth rate to 6 percent from about 3 percent and to create a more stable political environment by starting to ease glaring social ills.
The package, which the Government said would create 400,000 jobs and 100,000 new houses a year by the end of the century, involved extensive privatization, deregulation of the labor market, wage restraint and a cut in the budget deficit to 4 percent of national output in 1997 from a target of 5.1 percent this year.
These pledges won enthusiastic backing from South Africa's predominantly white business establishment. But they ran into heavy opposition from many of the Government's black supporters. The Congress of South African Trade Unions, usually the African National Congress's closest political ally, called the package "a recipe for economic disaster."
The unions regard appeals for wage restraint as blocking their campaign to close the gap between the pay scales of blacks and whites, their highest priority. They are strongly opposed to privatization and dismayed by promises of new budgetary rigor.
"The market suspects it's talk and no action," Mr. Jonker of Rand International said. "There's an underlying skepticism about the whole package," Mr. Hills added.

Cigarette Maker Ordered To Pay Damages for Cancer
A Florida court ordered the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the maker of Lucky Strikes, to pay a record $750,000 to Grady Carter, 66, who got lung cancer after 44 years of smoking. 
 It was only the second time the tobacco industry has been ordered to pay damages in a liability case, and the company's lawyer said an appeal was likely. Allan Kaplan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said, "This is a severe blow to the industry." [8.]
 
Former Lazard Partner Found Guilty
In one of the biggest criminal cases in municipal finance, Mark S. Ferber, a former partner at Lazard Freres & Company, was found guilty in Boston of bribery and defrauding his clients. The conviction, which resulted from a secret kickback contract between Lazard and Merrill Lynch, is considered a resounding victory for the Government in its efforts to rid the $1.3 trillion municipal bond business of corruption and cronyism. [1.]
 
Stocks Tumble on Tobacco News
Stocks tumbled after news of the tobacco judgment, reversing slim gains that had been inspired by a producer price report that showed inflation tamed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.18 points to 5,681.31, mostly in the last half-hour, when shares of tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, Loews and UST skidded. The Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.24 point, to 1,137.27, up 12.35 on the week. For the week, the Dow was up 1.48 points. [41.]
 
Interest Rates at 4-Month Low
Prices of Treasury securities surged after a report that prices at the producer level remained subdued in July. The rally pushed long-term interest rates to a four-month low, with the yield on the 30-year bond dropping to 6.69 percent. [40.]
 
Saatchi's No. 2 Executive Leaves
Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide said that its No. 2 executive, John Fitzgerald, would leave the agency after only eight months, effective immediately. The announcement followed a week of reports and speculation that Mr. Fitzgerald, who was president and chief operating officer, would leave after a series of disagreements with other top executives. [38.]
 
$5 Billion Into Stock Funds
Stock mutual funds took in more than $5 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the biggest weekly inflow in two months, AMG Data Services, a tracker of mutual fund cash flows, reported. [40.]
 
Nordstrom Profit and Stock Fall
Surprised and angered by Nordstrom Inc., Wall Street pummeled its stock, sending it down 8 percent, or $3.50 a share, in heavy Nasdaq trading to $38.25. The department store chain announced after the market had closed on Thursday that its second- quarter earnings had fallen to 55 cents from 65 cents a year earlier. That was far below the consensus estimate of 73 cents a share. [38.]
 
Dollar Slides as Mark Rallies
The dollar ended mostly lower because of dimming prospects for a rise in American interest rates and a broad rally in the German mark, which benefited from new doubts about plans for one European currency by 1999. [36.]
 
Soybean Futures Up Sharply
Soybean futures prices rose sharply on expectations that the Agriculture Department would report that the crop is in trouble. Corn and lumber also advanced. [36.]
 
AIDS Researchers Seek Vaccine
AIDS researchers hope to develop drugs, or even a vaccine, based on the discovery by scientists in New York and Brussels that a mutant gene can protect some people from infection with the AIDS virus. [12.]

HEADLINE: New Turkish Chief's Muslim Tour Stirs U.S. Worry

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Turkey's new Prime Minister, the leader of the country's growing Islamic party, heads off on his first foreign visit on Saturday to fundamentalist Iran, the Clinton Administration's least favored nation, and then proceeds on a kind of Muslim world tour: to Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The Prime Minister, Necmettin Erbakan, installed last month when Turkey's Western-oriented parties split, wants better ties to Iraq and Syria, has spoken of an "Islamic NATO" and has praised Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian group that opposes Yasir Arafat and has sent suicide bombers into Israel. 
 The sudden rise of Mr. Erbakan and his pro-Islamic Refah, or Welfare, Party has set off alarms in Washington, which is officially professing calm about the instability at the heart of a vital NATO ally that bridges Europe and Central Asia, the Balkans and the Middle East.
Morton Abramowitz, a former American Ambassador to Turkey and now president of the Carnegie Endowment, asked, "How do you deal with a NATO ally led by a man who is fundamentally anti-NATO, fundamentally anti-Semitic and fundamentally pro-Islamist, even when he's largely behaving himself?"
The rise of Mr. Erbakan presents serious policy concerns, especially in the Middle East and the Aegean, with the potential to undermine Washington's effort to isolate what it considers "rogue nations" that support terrorism, like Iran and Iraq, and to push Syria toward a comprehensive peace with Israel.
Greece and Turkey, which are both in NATO, almost went to war once this year over a tiny Aegean island, and a nationalist Mr. Erbakan might raise the stakes. NATO regards its air bases in Turkey as vital, and any indication that Mr. Erbakan would want to limit their operations, or that he is sharing NATO intelligence with other countries, let alone Iran, would roil a NATO alliance that already has a post-Soviet identity crisis.
The Americans are not the only ones worried. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt went to Turkey two weeks ago to take the measure of Mr. Erbakan after the new leader met with a high-ranking member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that opposes the Egyptian Government.
But senior Administration officials argue that whoever his friends are, Mr. Erbakan's freedom of action will be restrained by his coalition partner, the conservative former Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, and by the powerful Turkish military, which values its NATO ties and has intervened in politics before.
And while Mr. Erbakan's party finished first in parliamentary elections in December, it received only 21.4 percent of the vote. So at least in the short term, the officials say, Mr. Erbakan will compromise to earn his party more credibility, if only to prepare for future elections. In any event, they say, nationalism and national interests will trump Islam.
Just last week, the officials note, the Turkish Parliament voted to extend the operation that allows NATO aircraft based in Turkey to patrol northern Iraq, to protect Iraqi Kurds from President Saddam Hussein. The Welfare Party had originally opposed the extension, which Washington and the Turkish military had demanded.
In return, American officials said, Washington speeded up its approval of a United Nations mechanism to allow Iraq to sell some oil to buy food, medicine and other civilian needs. The sale will benefit Turkey, which has applied for an exemption from the boycott of Iraq that has cost Ankara an estimated $20 billion since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Still, American officials acknowledge considerable longer-term concern. The Welfare Party, which tripled its vote from 1987 to 1995 in traditionally secular Turkey, is feeding on popular discontent with the widely corrupt political elite.
With experience in local government, Welfare is the best-organized and most modern political party in Turkey, the officials say, while the other centrist and right-wing parties are in decline, representing powerful interests and individuals but with weak grass-roots support.
Mrs. Ciller, although a favorite in Washington for her Western manner and formerly staunch opposition to Islamic fundamentalism, is widely believed to have gone into coalition with Mr. Erbakan to halt corruption investigations Parliament initiated against her last spring. That is why their coalition is known in Turkey as "the Government of deep secrets."
Part of the problem, said Mr. Abramowitz and Alan Makovsky, a Turkey specialist and former State Department official now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, is that the United States knows a lot more about Mr. Erbakan, 70, than about his friends and the younger members of his party, who are more radical.
Although the Welfare Party is on a rising curve, "I remain to be convinced that these guys are the inexorable wave of the future, and the U.S. Government shouldn't act as if they are," Mr. Makovsky said.
He and Mr. Abramowitz took part two weeks ago in a State Department seminar on the new Turkey. Ordered by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who attended, it was an effort to understand Turkey, and also to recover from what Mr. Makovsky called "a stumbling start."
After some internal debate, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff went ahead with a scheduled visit to Turkey in early July, before Mr. Erbakan's Government was confirmed in Parliament and while some officials argued that the confirmation vote was not a certainty, because of defections in Mrs. Ciller's party.
The domestic effect of the visit, which included a meeting with Mr. Erbakan, was to give him more credibility and improve the chances of confirmation, the officials argued in opposing the visit. Other officials, however, argued that it was important for the United States to have an early meeting with Mr. Erbakan.
Nicholas Burns, the Department spokesman, said then: "We knew they had the right number of votes. This is not the kind of relationship to play games. It's a NATO ally, we have interests, and we would want to have early and frequent contact with a new Prime Minister from a religious party, to be sure those interests are met. There's a great struggle over the future of Turkey, and Refah is part of it."
Mr. Burns later said Washington was carefully watching Turkey's "rhetoric as well as its actions."
Even in the short term, Mr. Erbakan is making more waves in a Middle East already maneuvering to deal with a new Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his harder stance toward the Palestinians and Syria. Mr. Erbakan has put the growing Turkish-Israeli relationship on hold.
Those who thought Turkey would become a less important ally in a post-Soviet world were wrong, argued Eric Rouleau, a former French Ambassador to Turkey, writing in Foreign Policy magazine before Mr. Erbakan took office.
He said Turkey's importance had only grown as a Westernized, moderate Muslim ally standing up to Iran, Iraq and Syria, supporting American policy in equipping and training the Bosnian Muslims, helping Israel integrate economically into the region and working with the Muslims of the newly independent Caucasus and Central Asian countries.
In return, Washington has been playing down Turkey's human-rights violations against its Kurds and pressing the Europeans to integrate Turkey as much as possible into the European Union and its trading area.
But a strongly Islamist Turkey would undermine nearly all those strategies and benefits.
Some officials hope that the Government will crumble quickly, discrediting Mr. Erbakan's party. But Ian Lesser, a former State Department official now at the Rand Corporation, is skeptical. "The coalition may prove more lasting than some think, especially if new elections mean Refah can win on its own," he said.
The stronger the party politically, the less likely the Turkish military will try to intervene with a coup. "This is a mass political movement, constitutional and nonviolent," Mr. Lesser said. "Turkey is going through a profound transformation, and there are a lot of people with grudges against the state. The military knows it would be very risky to shut them out and find them on the streets."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE INDEPENDENTS;
Ex-Perot Volunteers Say Reform Party Is Using Old Tactics to Change the System

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
For several years, John Forrest has pitched in at the volunteers' telephone bank of United We Stand America, the nonprofit group that Ross Perot founded here three years ago. But Mr. Forrest quit late last year after discovering, he said, that the supposedly independent group was tapping its membership lists to drum up support for Mr. Perot's partisan political enterprise -- getting the Reform Party on the 1996 Presidential ballot nationally.
Mr. Perot founded United We Stand as a research and educational organization that would study domestic problems and find ways to press for economic and government reform in Washington. Above all, the organization was supposed to operate apart from a political system that Mr. Perot portrayed as corrupt. 
 In a speech in Augusta, Me., on July 20, for example, Mr. Perot said, "Keep in mind, our highest priority is to restore trust and confidence in government."
"Over the next few years," he added, "in order to accomplish the difficult task we'll talk about today, we must first earn the trust and respect of the people."
In its February news letter, the group describes itself this way: "United We Stand America, Inc., was launched on Jan. 11, 1993. It is an educational, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization committed to involving citizens and their government."
But interviews with former volunteers and a review of the organization's documents show that United We Stand has been closely aligned with the Reform Party, providing a wide range of assistance. From late last September through at least January, according to these interviews and documents, the nonprofit group's telephone lines, mail room supplies, volunteers and paid staff members regularly helped solicit support to get the Reform Party on the ballot in California and Maine.
Indeed, so intertwined is United We Stand with the Reform Party that, according to internal memorandums, volunteers at United We Stand were instructed to answer the telephone by saying, "Information center," so that callers could be routed to either the party or the nonprofit group, whichever they wanted.
On Sunday, Mr. Perot and his supporters will gather in Long Beach, Calif., to begin a weeklong process to select the Reform Party's Presidential nominee. Mr. Perot is being challenged for the nomination by former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado; the winner will be announced on Aug. 18 in Valley Forge, Pa., after a tally of ballots cast by by mail and telephone and over the Internet.
It is not unusual for nonprofit groups to help politicians by, for example, sponsoring events to showcase them to members. But Federal laws limit what such groups can do for partisan causes if they want to maintain their tax-exempt status.
Last week the Federal Election Commission sued the Christian Coalition, contending that it illegally promoted Republican candidates in 1990, 1992 and 1996, pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into their campaigns. The F.E.C. contends that by coordinating the distribution of voters' guides with political campaigns, the coalition made illegal in-kind contributions.
But to Mr. Forrest and other former volunteers for Mr. Perot, the issue is not one of legality alone, or an esoteric debate about the role of tax-exempt educational organizations in American politics. To them, the Reform Party's use of United We Stand's databases illustrates how Mr. Perot's effort to change the political system has capitalized on the same time-honored tactics he has decried.
Russell J. Verney, a top Perot aide, denied that the party has used United We Stand's current membership database, which includes tens of thousands of names, to solicit support. He declined to comment on whether the party had used the databases of former members.
Mr. Perot declined to be interviewed for this article.
There is also evidence that United We Stand has used another common political maneuver -- presenting self-serving polling data as proof of its popularity.
In 1995, before the Reform Party was formed, United We Stand took a poll that it said found that 77 percent of the group's members supported the formation of a third party. Mr. Verney, who has been on the road since late last September trying to get the Reform Party on the ballot in all 50 states, tells audiences at his speeches and says in interviews that the poll showed overwhelming support for creating a third party.
To obtain the results, forms were mailed to all members of United We Stand. The people who responded, said Sheldon Gawiser, president of the National Council on Public Polls, were "a self-selected sample."
He added: "In a scientific poll, the pollster selects the sample and tries to get a demographically representative group to respond. You can't make any judgment about a whole group from a self-selected sample."
But Mr. Gawiser said the poll's greatest flaw was its fund-raising appeal, presented at the bottom of the survey form.
Such an appeal skews the pool of respondents, he said, because those who are more likely to answer are also more likely to make a contribution. "Democrats do it and Republicans do it," he added. "It is all garbage, and it's basically a fund-raising technique."
In addition, Mr. Gawiser said, by seeking the name and address of the respondent, the poll denied anonymity, making it less likely that some people would answer. Referring to the survey, Mr. Gawiser said, "There is essentially no value in this activity for any kind of measurement that would be useful."
Mr. Verney defended the polling data as the source of "rock solid data" on the United We Stand membership's support for a third party. He said accusations about the accuracy of the poll data "amount to a bunch of whining."
In another instance of how Mr. Perot's organization has adopted well-worn political techniques, Mr. Forrest and another former United We Stand volunteer, who did not want to be named, say that when television crews came to film a United We Stand telephone bank, Perot staff members flooded the group with calls to make it look as if large numbers of voters had great interest in a third party.
Former volunteers also said that paid staff members at the Dallas headquarters of United We Stand routinely ordered phone bank volunteers to pretend to be handling a high volume of calls from late September 1995 through last January.
"It is something we used to do to accommodate the cameras," Sharon Holman, spokeswoman for the Perot Reform Committee, which worked to get the party on the ballot nationally, said on Thursday. "It was at my request so crews could get their pictures and go on and not wait for the phones to ring."
Mr. Verney said he would look into the assertions about faked phone calls.
Mr. Lamm, who is Mr. Perot's only rival for the Reform Party's nomination, has questioned whether the party is truly independent of Mr. Perot, who founded the national party and has financed efforts to get it on the ballot nationwide.
Lamm campaign officials said they were uncomfortable with the multiple roles played by people like Mr. Verney, who is the volunteer executive director of United We Stand, the director of the Reform Party's convention and of its effort to get on the ballot nationally, and is a top aide in Mr. Perot's campaign for the party's nomination.
Trying to negotiate with Mr. Verney for access to the Reform Party's list of 1.3 million supporters, Tom D'Amore, a senior Lamm adviser, said he was never sure which Mr. Verney he had on the phone: the party official who theoretically would want to encourage his candidacy, or the Perot adviser who might view him as a threat.
Mr. Verney says he is not working for Mr. Perot's nomination. "If I were running Ross Perot's campaign," he said in an interview, "I would be like the Maytag repairman, nothing to do yet, because he is not going to campaign until the members of the Reform Party say, 'We want you to be the candidate.' "
Like many not-for-profit groups, United We Stand is seeking an exemption from paying Federal taxes, contending it is performing a nonpartisan public service that taxpayers should help subsidize.
But in exchange for this status, it is governed by strict rules that limit its political activities. To be tax exempt, social welfare groups like United We Stand may spend no more than 49 percent of their time in political endeavors.
Mr. Verney concedes that from late last September to Dec. 31, United We Stand devoted "99 percent plus" of its resources, staff time and energies to the Reform Party. But in the context of a full year of operation, he said, the group meets the Government's test.
United We Stand's biggest asset is its mailing list, filled with the names and addresses of thousands of people interested in political issues and who work as volunteers. The lists can be so valued, in fact, that the Federal Election Commission says giving them to a political group could constitute a campaign contribution.
Late last year, dissident members of United We Stand in Ohio filed a complaint with the F.E.C. accusing Mr. Perot's aides and supporters of taking the group's assets, including membership lists in California and Ohio, and transferring them to the third-party effort. Mr. Verney said the complaint was without merit.
Mr. Verney also said that even if the Reform Party had used United We Stand volunteers to seek support for the party, to do so would not have run afoul of tax or election law.
He said Mr. Perot owns the United We Stand membership database, obtaining the lists last year in exchange for forgiving the group's debts. The Texas billionaire also owns the list of the more than one million people who enrolled in the Reform Party or signed petitions to get it on the ballot, Mr. Verney said, because he paid about 10 cents a signature, or about $130,000, to computerize the list.
Mr. Verney also said a service agreement between United We Stand and Mr. Perot permits the group to be paid by Mr. Perot to work for the Reform Party.
Larry Sabato, a government professor at the University of Virginia, said in an interview that the use of nonprofit, nonpartisan groups by political campaigns violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.
"With nonprofits," he said, "the rule is there are no rules," but he added that their use in political campaigns "is very much politics as usual.
"If you're running a party that has as one of its goals cleaning up politics, you really ought to be cleaner than a hound's tooth yourself."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Spars With Monitors on the Budget

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday lashed out at recent reports from fiscal monitors on the city's $33 billion budget, which warn that a series of what the monitors call shortsighted measures might push New York into its worst financial trouble since it almost went bankrupt in the 1970's.
The monitors focused on the Giuliani administration's estimate that the budget was balanced in a way that would lead to deficits of $2.7 billion in 1999 and $3.4 billion in 2000. They said those figures were evidence that Mr. Giuliani and the City Council had relied on questionable fiscal maneuvers essentially to shift their problems into the future. 
 Mr. Giuliani did not dispute the figures, which his own budget office generated. But he played down their importance, saying that he had made great strides in putting the city's finances in order and would continue to do so.
"We see a tremendous amount of confidence in New York City," he said on his weekly radio call-in program. "And a lot of it has to do with the fact that we have -- in a very realistic way -- straightened out the budget and financial plan of the city."
He also questioned the political motivations of some of the monitors, including the State Financial Control Board, the State and City Comptrollers and Wall Street bond-rating firms.
Mr. Giuliani's comments renewed a debate over the city's fiscal health that has flared repeatedly in recent months. The monitors noted that in the last 20 years, the city has never confronted a gap as large as the one projected for 2000 -- both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of city spending.
They said that in the new budget, Mr. Giuliani did not take on the issue that is at the heart of the city's ills: Expenses are increasing much faster than revenues. They said that by postponing efforts to correct that imbalance, often by using so-called one-shots to plug holes in the budget, the city would find it much harder to do so in the future.
The State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, estimated that over the next four years, the city's expenses would rise 6 percent annually, while revenues would grow only 1.2 percent annually.
"The city's fiscal health is worse than it has been in years," Mr. McCall said in an interview. "You are just building up to a disaster in the future."
Mr. Giuliani countered that he had already cut billions of dollars from the budget since he came to office in 1994, reducing the city's work force by 22,000, to a little more than 200,000. But he emphasized that if he cut too much, he would deprive residents of important social services.
"We have made the reductions that can be done, at the same time without devastating services in the city," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani's aides were asked on Thursday if the Mayor would be interviewed for an article on the fiscal monitors' evaluations of the budget, which the Council approved in June. Mr. Giuliani declined. But he used part of his radio program yesterday to criticize The New York Times before the article was published.
Mr. Giuliani said he was certain that the article would be unfair to his administration, asserting that it would focus too much on the views of Mr. McCall and the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. Both Comptrollers are Democrats with whom the Mayor, a Republican, has often clashed.
"Often, the slant in The New York Times is their way," Mr. Giuliani said, referring to the Comptrollers. "People don't get the actual and complete picture of the progress that we have made in straightening out the budget of New York City." But other fiscal monitors have echoed the views of Mr. McCall and Mr. Hevesi. On his program, Mr. Giuliani did not mention the State Financial Control Board, which oversees the city's finances.
The control board has grown increasingly critical of the city's budget. At the board's meeting last month, its executive director, Cornelius F. Healy, joined the two Comptrollers in lambasting the new budget. Mr. Healy was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.
Jeffrey L. Sommer, the board's first deputy director, said in an interview that the city had to find a way to cut spending. "The size of these projected gaps are the highest that we have seen since the mid-1970's," said Jeffrey L. Sommer, the board's first deputy director, adding that the city had to balance its budget more prudently. "And the concern is that they keep getting larger."
The monitors are not predicting that the city will plunge into the kind of crisis that occurred in 1975, when it suddenly had to lay off tens of thousands of workers and implore the state for help.
Yet they said that by deferring cost-cutting, Mr. Giuliani and the Council had worsened future gaps. The recently adopted budget relies on $1.5 billion in one-shots -- non-recurring revenues that the city reaps from, for example, selling assets. The biggest one-shot in the new budget is an assumption that the city will settle its dispute with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over rent that the authority pays for the two city airports. The administration projects that it will receive $339 million. It also has worked out a deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to get an infusion of $250 million.
To understand one-shots, imagine that city is a tenant who does not earn enough in salary to pay the monthly rent. The tenant sells a family heirloom to help pay the rent one month. The next month, the tenant must pay the full rent again, but the salary still falls short.
And if the rent rises faster than the tenant's salary, his financial situation gets worse. The only solution is to find a cheaper apartment or get a salary raise.
For the city, that means cutting expenses or reaping more from tax revenues -- either through a tax increase or a more robust economy.
The Financial Control Board estimated that if the city did not rely on one-shots in its budgets for the next three years, the projected gap for the year 2000 would be $762 million, rather than $3.4 billion.
The Wall Street firms that rate the city's bonds said they were concerned about the projected gaps, though they stressed that the city's financial condition was not dire.
"Very clearly, these gaps are troubling," said Robert Kurtter, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, which has given the city's bonds a Baa1 rating, slightly below average.
Martin Arrick, a director at Standard & Poor's Corporation, said, "We see continued chronic budget stress." Standard & Poor's lowered the city's rating last year to BBB+ because of its financial troubles.

Since New York City's fiscal crisis in 1975, the city has been required to give an estimate each year of how its finances will look in the four years after the adoption of the current budget. As the city works on its fiscal year 1997 budget, it has projected a budget gap for the year 2000 of $3.4 billion. That amounts to 14.77 percent of expceted spending that year, the biggest gap yet projected. (Source: New York City Comptroller's Office) (pg. 27)

HEADLINE: Car Dealer Gets 5 Years for Bilking G.M. of More Than $400 Million

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
A former Long Island car dealer who admitted bilking the General Motors Corporation out of $422 million in one of the largest frauds in American corporate history was sentenced yesterday to five years in prison.
John M. McNamara, 56, had not spent a day in jail since he pleaded guilty in 1992 to swindling G.M. by borrowing billions of dollars from it for nonexistent vans. The delay in sentencing was the result of his agreement to help Federal prosecutors uncover political corruption on Long Island, but his testimony in several bribery cases failed to secure any convictions. 
 Nonetheless, Judge Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court in Brooklyn granted the Government's request for leniency, departing from sentencing guidelines that called for 9 to 11 years in prison.
Mr. McNamara's five-year sentence, which he will begin serving on Oct. 1, is to be followed by three years' supervised release. He was also ordered to repay General Motors more than $412 million in outstanding loans within three years of his release. General Motors has already recovered $13 million from the sale of cars that were on Mr. McNamara's lots and the sale of dealership properties. It claims Mr. McNamara actually took $425 million, $3 million more than he has admitted to.
In sentencing Mr. McNamara, the judge said, "I always believe that, based on my own experience as a U.S. attorney, people who cooperate with the Government are vital to the success of law enforcement against those who have committed crimes."
The agreement with prosecutors allowed Mr. McNamara to keep $1.8 million in assets and start a new company, even though he owes his creditors hundreds of millions of dollars. Once a ubiquitous presence in Port Jefferson, his hometown, where he was known for his extensive land holdings and his gifts to local charities, Mr. McNamara became reclusive after his guilty plea. But he continued to live in the area, in a rambling white house with an indoor pool.
In the prosecution's request for leniency, Loretta E. Lynch, an assistant United States attorney, wrote that Mr. McNamara's cooperation had been fruitful, providing "substantial assistance in a number of important prosecutions within the Eastern District of New York."
"He has provided important substantive information about the nature and the scope of public corruption on Long Island," the prosecutor wrote. "The resulting trials, despite their verdicts, have increased public exposure to and knowledge of the inner workings of local government."
But Robert Gottlieb, a criminal defense lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for district attorney in Suffolk County in 1989, said yesterday that the Government had had "no choice but to make this deal with the devil."
"What was somewhat surprising, even today," Mr. Gottlieb added, "is the extent to which he has been able to profit by his activities, and that certainly hurt the Government. I don't think there's any question that they are embarrassed."
"This is a case where the Government was willing to make an extraordinary deal with a con man in the hopes of obtaining convictions in political corruption cases and they obviously failed to do that."
The leniency request was challenged by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the financial arm of the auto maker, which urged the judge to impose a "substantial prison sentence."
A lawyer for General Motors, Charles E. Brown, said yesterday that Mr. McNamara deserved at least the sentence he had received.
"Mr. McNamara is an admitted criminal who took advantage of individuals and associates through deceit and theft," Mr. Brown said. "He abused the bond of personal trust he developed."
A G.M.A.C. spokesman in Detroit, Terry Sullivan, said the auto maker had filed a civil lawsuit this week against Mr. McNamara that seeks up to $1.2 billion in restitution and damages.
In court testimony, Mr. McNamara admitted that over the course of eight years, he had obtained $6.2 billion in loans from G.M.A.C. for vans that did not exist. The fraud was discovered by G.M.A.C. auditors, who realized that his claims of shipping thousands of vehicles overseas per month were false.
During the bribery trials in which Mr. McNamara was the Government's star witness, defense lawyers forced him to explain in detail how he had lied, cheated and forged documents to deceive G.M.A.C.
Mr. McNamara used the money to keep up payments on his loans to G.M.A.C.; by borrowing increasing amounts, he kept one step ahead of payment-due dates. At the same time, he bought gold mines, other companies and land development projects, and traveled the globe in his own nine-seat jet. The scheme collapsed in the recession of the late 1980's. The pressure of keeping up payments, prosecutors said, forced him to bribe local officials into quickly approving his building projects without requiring costly changes.
Although Federal agents seized most of his holdings, the authorities allowed him to retain $1.8 million in real estate. He also disclosed in court this year that he had not been forced to give up $300,000 he had put in trust for his 16-year-old daughter or $138,000 he had made from various business ventures last year, including the sale of vans in Germany.
Mr. McNamara has also been permitted to travel throughout the New York metropolitan region and to take vacations in Florida.
His lawyer, G. Michael Bellinger, expressed disappointment with the sentence and questioned the restitution order, calling it "a little bit unreasonable."
In the cases Mr. McNamara aided, two former councilmen, Donald Zimmer and Anthony Losquadro, were acquitted last year on charges that they had taken bribes from Mr. McNamara in return for favorable votes on his real-estate projects. Jurors said that they had doubted Mr. McNamara's credibility. And in a third case in March, a jury acquitted Anthony Aliperti, a former member of the Brookhaven Planning Board, of extortion charges but deadlocked on conspiracy and perjury charges. The judge declared a mistrial on those counts. An earlier trial of Mr. Aliperti also ended in a mistrial.
The civil lawsuit by G.M.A.C. alleges that Mr. McNamara "siphoned off money and assets from his various businesses and transferred assets in real properties to various persons in order to shield assets and defeat his creditors," Mr. Sullivan said.
He added that the lawsuit had been delayed at the request of prosecutors to avoid interfering with the bribery trials.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE FACTORS;
THE QUARTERBACK AT THE GAME'S END

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 9

 BODY:
When Bob Dole would meet with his advisers to mull over prospects for his running mate, every once in a while he would blurt out, "What about The Quarterback?"
But for weeks, many of Mr. Dole's advisers said they did not think that their candidate would ever settle on The Quarterback -- Jack F. Kemp, formerly of the Buffalo Bills and the United States Congress -- because the two men had had such a contentious relationship for years. 
 The uncertainty was such that even tonight, for nearly two anxious hours, Mr. Dole's top aides feared that their candidate -- who is notorious for tearing up his scripts -- had changed his mind and given up on this unlikely alliance.
Dole-Kemp T-shirts had already popped up here on the eve of the Republican National Convention. Mr. Dole's emissaries had already been dispatched to promote Mr. Kemp's qualifications to reporters. And privately, Mr. Dole's top aides had let it be known that their candidate would seal the deal in a phone call to Mr. Kemp this evening.
Shortly after 11 P.M. Eastern time, Mr. Dole finally made the call, his aides said.
In the end, his aides attributed the delay not to indecision by Mr. Dole but to unexpected last-minute preparations. One was that Roderick DeArment, a lawyer on the search team, had to conduct one final background check on Mr. Kemp. Another delay was that Mr. Kemp still had to iron out with one or two Dole advisers the final details of what would his role would be as running mate.
As they waited for Mr. Dole to make the call tonight, aides who had said with confidence that Mr. Dole had made his decision were now hedging their bets. One said "60-40." Another, more optimistic, put the odds at 75-25. One adviser even speculated that Mr. Dole was making one last pitch tonight to Colin L. Powell.
"People are pressing him to make the call," one Dole aide said in a panic.
Later, another senior aide said: "No one understood why it was taking so long. People were saying, 'What's going on here?' "
Even before tonight, there was great uncertainty that Mr. Dole would ever turn to Mr. Kemp.
"You have to remember there are a lot of people in the campaign who have privately wanted Kemp to be the Vice-Presidential candidate all along," said one person close to Mr. Dole who, like others interviewed, would only speak on the condition of anonymity until Mr. Dole formally announced his decision. "They didn't have the courage to ask Dole to select him."
Yet there was no unanimity among Mr. Dole's top aides that Mr. Kemp was the best choice. As another person familiar with the discussions put it, "There were powerful arguments back and forth over whether Kemp should be considered."
Even Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager and a former chief of staff to Mr. Kemp, was described by several people as initially reluctant. Mr. Reed had been furious at Mr. Kemp for endorsing Steve Forbes in the primaries. "Scott had to be persuaded it was the right choice," said one person close to Mr. Reed.
Mr. Kemp shot to the top of the list after two events this week: The unveiling of Mr. Dole's economic plan on Monday and, on Wednesday, the compromise on abortion forged between the Dole campaign and the committee here drafting the Republican Party platform.
People close to Mr. Dole said he was pleased with the public reaction to his economic proposal, which calls for the same sort of tax-cutting remedies that Mr. Kemp has espoused for years. They said Mr. Dole had concluded that Mr. Kemp, who is known for his supply-side economic mantra, could best champion the signature campaign proposal.
These people said the second turning point in Mr. Dole's decision came once the abortion compromise had apparently been resolved. That freed Mr. Dole from pressure to pick a candidate to soothe relations with social conservatives. (Mr. Kemp has consistently voted against abortion rights, but has never particularly been identified as an abortion opponent.)
The fall-back contender, said several of Mr. Dole's advisers, was Senator Connie Mack of Florida, who was considered more popular with opponents of abortion. One concern about Mr. Mack, the advisers said, was their fear that reporters would devote the coming weeks focusing on Mr. Mack as a fresh face on the national scene -- rather than the message of the campaign. They said that would not happen with Mr. Kemp since he has long been a national figure.
"We need a candidate whose first two weeks are about ideas," one aide said, "and not about his own story."
One person involved in the deliberations described how Mr. Kemp's fortunes improved this week: "As Dole himself saw the way the economic message was being positively received, it became clear that Kemp deserved a second and strong look. And once the platform debate was resolved, it became apparent that we could now go to a big-tent candidate as opposed to a particularly Southern candidate to shore up the pro-life forces."
Another person close to Mr. Dole said that while "Kemp has always been the unnamed surprise," he "did not become a viable option until about two or three days ago."
The serious negotiations were under way on Wednesday, when Mr. Kemp met with Mr. Reed. "Scott's role was to make sure the answer would be yes if asked," one person said. That night, Mr. Dole met with Mr. Kemp, at the Watergate apartment complex where the Doles live in Washington. The talks between Mr. Kemp and top Dole aides continued on Thursday.
The first public notice of Mr. Dole's campaign decision was this morning when Mr. Dole walked to the back of his campaign plane and told reporters that the decision had been made -- though he would not say what it was.
But some people close to Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp said Mr. Dole made his decision on Thursday night. On the flight this morning from Washington to Russell, Kan., they said, Mr. Dole spent time reading through background information on Mr. Kemp, to make sure nothing questionable emerged that would disqualify Mr. Kemp.
Mr. Dole's search team short-circuited the usual process of compiling extensive background information on Mr. Kemp because he had already been fully vetted in 1988, when he was on the short-list to be George Bush's running mate.
People close to Mr. Dole said they grew to realize that their candidate would put aside his past frictions with Mr. Kemp. One noted that even after Mr. Dole's bitter relationship with George Bush in the 1988 primaries, Mr. Dole ended up being one of Mr. Bush's staunchest allies in the Senate.
The larger concern among some people on the campaign was that Mr. Kemp would not have the discipline needed of a running mate to promote Mr. Dole's message. "He is not a team player," said one person close to Mr. Dole.
After the tensions over Mr. Kemp's backing of Mr. Forbes, his relations with his old friends in the Dole hierarchy began improving in recent weeks as Mr. Kemp provided advice for Mr. Dole's economic proposal.
But at a breakfast just over a week ago, Mr. Kemp did not sound as though he thought he was a prospect. In fact, he was critical of the campaign's decision not to include Patrick J. Buchanan as a convention speaker.
Asked why he had not been mentioned as a running mate, Mr. Kemp replied: "You have to ask Bob Dole. I made it clear I didn't want anything. I'm very happy. I'm making a lot of money. And my role as a senior statesman in the party. I can tell it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say."
But would he turn down the job if asked? "You don't turn down something for which you have not been asked," Mr. Kemp said. "Would you date Sharon Stone?"

HEADLINE: POLITICS;
A Known Quantity

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9

 BODY:
In choosing Jack F. Kemp as his running mate, Bob Dole emulated the two most successful Republican politicians since World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. Like them, he reached out to an element of the party with which he has often been at odds, the low-tax, pro-growth conservatives.
Eisenhower, an Eastern moderate who wrested the nomination from the conservatives' favorite, Robert A. Taft of Ohio, chose Richard M. Nixon, a Western conservative; Mr. Reagan, a Western conservative, chose George Bush, who was seen at the time as an Eastern moderate. Both sought to unify their party. 
 Mr. Dole, an establishment Republican in a party that has turned its back on his style of politics yet will nominate him for President, is trying to do the same thing.
But this time, there is an added twist: Mr. Dole has already been pushed farther from the center than is his wont by the strength of the Christian conservatives and their allies, who will dominate the convention opening on Monday in San Diego, and by the need to open some space between himself and President Clinton, who spends a lot of his time these days singing Republican siren songs.
Mr. Dole has chosen to reverse his field on economic policy, giving tax cuts priority over budget-balancing and making a 15-percent tax cut a centerpiece of his campaign. Some who have long supported this supply-side approach have been suspicious of the candidate's belated conversion; they will surely be much less so now. Mr. Kemp, a charter member of the supply-side club, gives Mr. Dole credibility on this issue, although it of course remains to be seen whether they will be able to convince the country of the wisdom of their position.
Mr. Clinton has already denounced Mr. Dole's ideas as a recipe for a ballooning deficit, and he has the support of many of the nation's economists.
Vice-Presidential choices, at least in the modern era, have seldom had a profound outcome on the results in November, and there is little reason to believe that Mr. Kemp will contribute much to cutting into Mr. Clinton's huge national lead. That is Mr. Dole's job. Nor will Mr. Kemp bring to the ticket any special regional strengths; born in California, a former Congressman from New York, Mr. Kemp has spent his whole career in Washington, no great advantage in these times.
From Mr. Kemp's viewpoint, though, Mr. Dole's nod could prove a turning point. Vice-Presidential nominees who give good accounts of themselves, even in losing causes, automatically move up in the sweepstakes the next time around. A strong showing by Mr. Kemp would make him a Presidential contender in 2000, which is no doubt why he and his friends so actively sought the No. 2 spot.
Mr. Nixon and Mr. Bush, when they had their own chances to choose running mates, chose relatively obscure figures in Spiro T. Agnew and Dan Quayle. Mr. Dole reportedly flirted with that notion, too, giving serious consideration to Senator Connie Mack of Florida, but turned away. The precedents were not encouraging, and Mr. Mack, as a Senate colleague said, "is the kind of guy you have to introduce to everyone in the room, because nobody outside of Florida knows him much."
Mr. Kemp could help Mr. Dole in several ways, all subtle, none decisive but all quite worthwhile.
Mr. Dole, at 73, has been widely described as too old for the Presidency. Mr. Kemp, a vigorous 61 with a background as a pro-football quarterback, could make the ticket look less dated.
From the start of his career, Mr. Dole, a plainspoken plainsman, has had trouble stirring the troops -- even committed, enthusiastic Republicans. Mr. Kemp is an accomplished speaker, much in demand for Lincoln Day dinners and other Republican fund-raising events, who can rouse the faithful. His verbal skills can become a liability, however, when he crosses the line into long-windedness and bombast.
Members of the Bush Cabinet, in which he served, often complained about that.
Finally, partly because of his age, Mr. Dole has long felt he needed someone who could step on short notice into the Oval Office. Not only that, he said in a talk last spring, he felt he needed someone whose qualifications to do so would be instantly apparent to voters, who might otherwise feel, because of Mr. Dole's age, that a vote for him was a leap in the dark. Mr. Kemp certainly has the credentials: A Presidential campaign of his own in 1988, service as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and years as a television spokesman for his wing of the party. Mr. Kemp will do little to mollify the moderates who are displeased by the party's position on abortion, though his opposition to abortion, while firm (and backed by the even firmer position of his wife, Joanne), has never been grating.
If he has always been an insurgent rather than an establishment conservative, he has always fought his corner without rancor. He and Mr. Dole have never been close and have often differed on major issues, but it is entirely in character for Mr. Kemp to join Mr. Dole at this point.
In one area at least Mr. Kemp will appeal to moderate Republicans and perhaps some Democrats as well. He is a strong supporter of civil rights, with many black friends, and he has opposed the recent movement in the party to deny rights and benefits to immigrants.
Once it became clear that former Senator Dole could not have Gen. Colin L. Powell as his running mate, he had trouble finding someone who fit his specifications. Had he not had trouble, it was doubtful he would have turned to Mr. Kemp. He had sought someone who was personally compatible, and the effusive, upbeat, sometimes almost monomaniacal Mr. Kemp, with his habit of belaboring a policy idea long after others have lost interest, could hardly be a worse stylistic fit with the laconic, mordant Mr. Dole, a skilled dealer in compromise.
In the end, though, that must have seemed less important as Mr. Dole went through his lists of governors and senators. He could not afford to reopen the abortion battle, which he had already lost, by choosing a supporter of abortion rights, and he wanted no surprises from a candidate he did not know well.
"He wanted someone who was safe," said a person whose name was on the list until the last, or at least the next-to-last, round of deliberations.
"Kemp worked his way in, late in the game, because too many of the others were gambles.
"The first rule in this running-mate business is to pick someone who is unlikely to hurt you. That's the last thing you want, especially when you're already 20 points behind."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
DOLE IS SAID TO SETTLE ON KEMP, A SOMETIME FOE, TO FILL TICKET

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: RUSSELL, Kan., Aug. 9

 BODY:
Bob Dole settled tonight on Jack Kemp, the 61-year-old former Congressman from Buffalo and periodic political nemesis to Mr. Dole, to be his Vice Presidential running mate, aides to the former Kansas Senator said.
Nelson Warfield, the Dole campaign's press secretary, refused to confirm to reporters tonight that it was Mr. Kemp. All he would say was that Mr. Dole had called his top pick at 10:06 and that they spoke for 15 minutes. 
 "Bob Dole made the call and got the answer he was looking for," Mr. Warfield said. "We've got a veep."
Despite the widespread confirmation that Mr. Kemp was chosen, the campaign was determined not to spoil the element of surprise that Mr. Dole had wanted. But Mr. Warfield made some football analogies -- Mr. Kemp was a onetime quarterback for the Buffalo Bills -- and made references to a "very upbeat, positive, energetic" conversation, using words that are associated with Mr. Kemp.
At 10 P.M., Scott Reed, the campaign manager, began telephoning those who had been in the running but had not made the final cut. Mr. Warfield said there were 6 to 12 calls.
Mr. Dole planned to present Mr. Kemp on Saturday at a ceremony here in Mr. Dole's hometown, where bleachers were being erected in front of the Russell County courthouse.
Mr. Warfield said that despite rumors to the contrary, no communication had taken place today with Colin L. Powell, the retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whom the campaign had held out hope of wooing even after he had closed the door.
For a brief period tonight there was consternation among some Dole aides after word spread that Mr. Dole was having second thoughts and was delaying his call to Mr. Kemp. Later, they said the delay of nearly two hours was a result of some incomplete arrangements regarding Mr. Kemp's campaign role.
Mr. Kemp, who this evening flew to Dallas, where he had a speaking engagement on Saturday morning, was later spotted boarding a private plane that was said to be bound for Great Bend, Kan.
Earlier in the day, he told reporters in Florida, "Quarterbacks are always ready," when asked if he would be Mr. Dole's running mate.
While Mr. Kemp would seem a somewhat surprising pick given his endorsement earlier this year of Steve Forbes and his differences with Mr. Dole over economic priorities, the former Congressman fills out a lot of the weaknesses in Mr. Dole's own political resume.
The Dole team views Mr. Kemp as an energetic, highly competitive campaigner with an optimistic, even ebullient outlook and who, as a former Cabinet member and Buffalo Bills quarterback who served 18 years in the House, comes with some national standing. Another plus for the 73-year-old Mr. Dole was Mr. Kemp's relative youth and vigor, while he also carries some plausibility as a potential President.
The White House seized on Mr. Dole's interest in Mr. Kemp to portray the Republican candidate as having abandoned his reputation as a deficit hawk for the political payoff of promising deep tax cuts.
"He's gambling his whole campaign on the supply-side economic plan," said George Stephanopoulos, President Clinton's senior adviser. "It's somebody at the roulette table who's way down. He's put half his stack of chips on black -- or, I would say, on red -- and now he's taking the second half and doubling up."
Among other things, senior aides to Mr. Dole say, Mr. Kemp is expected to help the Republican ticket in California, where he grew up, and in large cities and urban areas because of the activist role he sought to play on behalf of inner city redevelopment as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration in 1988.
At HUD, Mr. Kemp backed the idea of enterprise zones, which offered economic and tax incentives to businesses to invest in depressed inner city areas, and spoken out about the importance of racial justice.
Republicans praised Mr. Kemp for reaching out to minorities and others who have historically felt unwelcome in the party. Several said longstanding differences between Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp over economic policy and other issues would not damage the ticket.
"The fact is that winning political marriages are usually marriages of convenience, not marriages of love," said Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania.
While Mr. Kemp is a longstanding opponent of abortion, the central tenet of his political agenda has been economic, and Dole aides said that Mr. Kemp embodies the elements of the tax-cutting economic plan that Mr. Dole will make the centerpiece of his campaign.
As a supply-side economist who believes that cutting taxes is the best way to stimulate economic growth, Mr. Kemp's position once was considered his greatest liability, but now that Mr. Dole has moved from budget-balancing to tax-cutting himself, Mr. Kemp has become an asset.
But at the time, Mr. Dole has yet to show a lot of enthusiasm for one of the central tenets of Mr. Kemp's economic agenda, the flat tax.
Mr. Kemp seemed a popular choice among delegates and party faithful gathering in San Diego for the Republican National Convention, which opens on Monday.
"Dole is a very stiff candidate, which is why Kemp is an asset to the campaign," said Ron Schmidt, a delegate from South Dakota attending party meetings here before the convention. "He is a very warm and articulate person." And, he added, "Kemp is very conservative, which is what the people are looking for."
By late afternoon in San Diego, vendors were selling "Dole-Kemp '96" T-shirts for $15.
And Democratic officials in San Diego began distributing small footballs with "Hail Mary Pass" printed on them, suggesting that the selection was a desperation move.
Weeks of speculation surrounded the choice, and more than a dozen names have been kicked around, ranging from Governors, including John Engler of Michigan and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, to Senator Connie Mack of Florida.
Plans proceeded on Main Street here for the Saturday announcement at the Russell courthouse where Mr. Dole will introduce his running mate.
When Mr. Dole arrived at his red brick boyhood home at 4:10 this afternoon, followed by his six-bus entourage of staff members and reporters who had traveled 70 miles across the state from Abilene, Kan., to Russell in a staggered caravan, he joked that he had his running mate secreted in a trailer nearby.
"We are going to practice for the running mate shot," he said, referring to the television picture. "Right now he is in the trailer back here."
Mr. Dole refused to confirm the name of his selection, but he told reporters that he had picked someone who, on a scale of 1 to 10, would be considered an 11.
The former Senator had flown from Washington to Abilene this morning to draw spiritual sustenance at the boyhood home of President Dwight D. Eisenhower before the intense days ahead -- officially announcing his running mate here and then flying on Sunday to San Diego, where he will finally claim his party's nomination. But once rumors started flying about 1 P.M., the campaign was engulfed in staving them off until Mr. Dole made his official offer to Mr. Kemp later tonight.
Mr. Kemp is perceived as being more credible on the topic than Mr. Dole, whose 35 years in Congress were spent in relentless pursuit of balancing the budget, not cutting taxes. This was the opposite of Mr. Kemp, who ran against Mr. Dole and several others in 1988 for the nomination largely on the one issue of cutting taxes.
Their rocky relationship stems in part from their differences over the proper economic course for Republicans to champion. Mr. Kemp once declared that he and his supporters "no longer worship at the shrine of a balanced budget."
They differ on other issues, too. Mr. Kemp opposes the crackdown on immigration that Mr. Dole has advocated and favors affirmative action programs that Mr. Dole has proposed eliminating.
Mr. Kemp has been staking out so many positions contrary to his party and has left his friends so vexed at his behavior that in March he described himself as being "in my wilderness years."
At the time, he had just poisoned the well anew by endorsing Mr. Forbes, one of Mr. Dole's rivals for the Presidential nomination, even as it was clear that Mr. Dole had secured the nomination. Mr. Forbes dropped out eight days later.
Mr. Kemp considered running himself this year, but then decided he did not have the fire in the belly. "My passion for ideas," he said, "is not matched with a passion for partisan or electoral politics."
But the Dole adviser said that previous Presidential nominees had chosen rivals with whom they have been at odds and that such situations often sorted themselves out.
One of the most famous examples was Ronald Reagan's selection in 1980 of George Bush, who had labeled as "voodoo economics" the very supply-side model that Mr. Kemp had advocated to Mr. Reagan -- and that Mr. Dole found himself promoting earlier this week as the economic plan that he hoped would re-energize his campaign against Mr. Clinton, who leads in most national polls by about 20 percentage points.
It was the apparent bad blood between Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp that led many pundits to exclude Mr. Kemp as a likely choice for Mr. Dole, who has frequently said that one of his chief criteria for a running mate would be someone with whom he felt comfortable.
The surprising aspect of Mr. Dole's apparent selection of Mr. Kemp is not only their personal history and perceived incompatibility on several issues, but also Mr. Kemp's reputation as someone who speaks his own mind.
"Jack does not have an easy time swallowing hard and subordinating his own ideas to somebody else," said Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
While that complicates matters, he said, Mr. Kemp would bring several political assets to the ticket. "Bob Dole needs somebody who energizes that activist Republican conservative base without scaring to death the rest of the country," Mr. Ornstein said. "He wants to go into this convention with delegates saying, 'We've got a real reason to work night and day for this ticket."'
While Mr. Kemp is perceived as a conservative, he also has certain libertarian if not liberal tendencies, and is not the favored choice of the religious right.
Angela Bay Buchanan, the sister of Mr. Dole's rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, said that she hoped Mr. Dole would pick someone else. Mr. Kemp opposes abortion but, according to a Dole aide, he also prefers legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to outlaw it, a position contrary to the party platform that the religious right just wrestled into place.
Douglas Johnson, a spokesman for the National Right-to-Life Committee, said Mr. Kemp had a 100 percent favorable rating on abortion when he served in the House from 1970 to 1988. He co-sponsored a human-life amendment during that period although the House did not have any recorded votes on the amendment, Mr. Johnson said, and he also co-sponsored a statute to challenge the legality of abortion.

HEADLINE: The Literary Agent as Zelig

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni; Frank Bruni, a reporter for The New York Times, wrote about the novelist David Foster Wallace for the Magazine in March.

 BODY:
TO BE EVEN REMOTELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE legend of Andrew Wylie is to have certain images and ideas fixed in your mind. There are the berets and bad poetry of the 1970's, when he aped the avant-garde and genuflected before Andy Warhol. There are the hard drinking and the hard-driving bargains of the 1980's, when he clawed his way into the pantheon of powerful literary agents with the hunger and cunning of a scavenger come late to a feast.
None of these jibes with the version of Wylie that trots into view on a breezy morning in Central Park, just a few blushes past dawn. Outfitted in running shoes, a blue tennis shirt and black spandex shorts that cling to surprisingly muscled thighs, he jogs into the leafy sanctuary from Fifth Avenue and hits the dirt path around the reservoir in a brisk stride. 
 "This is exhilarating," he says as he skirts the northern edge of the water and glances to the south for a postcard view of midtown Manhattan. Somewhere in that vertical muddle is his own office, crowded with mementos from such clients as Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Salman Rushdie and Saul Bellow. It is a gilded gallery arguably unrivaled by that of any other agent in town.
But it is not enough. It is never enough. At the age of 48, Wylie is intent not on slackening but on maintaining his pace -- on proving that the flamboyant sprinter who turned so many heads in publishing circles over the past decade can go the distance. He feels the eyes of his peers upon him once again, riveted by the recent unraveling of his trans-Atlantic partnership with two London agents, Gillon Aitken and Brian Stone. He is suddenly alone in the world, with fresh challenges to meet and new strategies to hatch.
"I wouldn't have the energy for it if I hadn't changed my ways," he says as he runs, alluding not only to this daily exercise regimen but also to his strict sobriety and near-vegetarian diet. "I feel stronger than ever."
As if to illustrate his point, he picks up speed for the last half mile of the almost two-mile run, roaring to the finish. Then he drops to the ground for 25 perfectly executed push-ups, not a wobble or a cheat in one of them. He does this only after his straggling companion has caught up with him, and in full view of dozens of passers-by. With Wylie, every gesture seems to be a boast; every triumph, a taunt.
IN ONE SENSE, THERE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT Wylie's business, aside from his bombast. Like Mort Janklow and Lynn Nesbit, Amanda (Binky) Urban, Kathy Robbins and other superagents who have become demi-celebrities in their own right, he makes his living and stakes his fortunes on luring major writers into his fold, selling their work for as much money as possible, then slicing off a small pocket of that purse. Some agents take 15 percent; others, only 10. Wylie's in the second camp, a fact that goes no small distance toward establishing good faith with his clients.
But there are more interesting ways in which Wylie stands out from his peers. Start with his nerd-cumSprockets physical appearance: ludicrously bulky eyeglasses, a cadaverous complexion and a connect-the-dots hairline, the apparent legacy of a transplant that didn't take. Add his intellectual vanity and snobbish eschewing of writers whose talents veer toward the commercial. And top it all off with his insistence that the paydays for literary thoroughbreds like Rushdie and Roth be somewhere in the league of those for workhorses like Danielle Steele and Dean Koontz.
When Wylie began his ascent little more than a decade ago, he brazenly refused to do business as usual, flouting and reinventing the rules of a staid game. By demonstrating a willingness to whisk authors from one publishing house to another, he negotiated advances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for critical darlings like Susan Sontag and David Leavitt whose sales records hardly seemed to merit such yields. With a blithe disregard for industry etiquette, he pried established writers away from the agents who helped establish them. He was to literary agency what Michael Milken was to investment banking: somebody willing to get ahead by playing faster and looser than everybody else.
But both he and the game have changed, and yesterday's rascal has become today's Establishment figure, a standard-bearer instead of a rabble-rouser, an anointed member of the Round Table rather than a dread barbarian at the gate. For a moment in mid-July, he set the publishing industry atwitter anew when he summarily moved Rushdie from Pantheon to new handlers at Henry Holt & Company, which reportedly paid more than $2 million -- $500,000 more than Pantheon's offer, according to industry insiders -- for English-language rights to his next novel, "The Ground Beneath Her Feet." (Wylie will not confirm specific figures.)
This coup rekindled the familiar, frequently lodged complaint that Wylie sets serious writers up to be commercial disappointments, embarrassing and isolating them in the long run. "The question is one of consequences," says the writer Jonathan Raban, a onetime Wylie client. "I suppose Andrew would be a dream to have if you were diagnosed with a terminal disease, had one book left in you and wanted to provide for your family."
But in general, Wylie's triumphs and antics -- which earned him the nickname the Jackal from the British press -- no longer set tongues to vigorous wagging. "If he once seemed bratty, he doesn't anymore," says Joni Evans, a former publisher of Random House who is now a literary agent. "The kinds of things he was doing to make his mark have almost become commonplace." The close relationships and loyalty between publishing houses and individual authors have been washed away by the tides of avarice and conglomerization, and literary agents have come to resemble their Hollywood counterparts. "There's more of that kind of shark-ism," says Jonathan Galassi, editor in chief of Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
Now that his peers in this country have caught on and caught up, how will Wylie maintain his advantage? He finds himself focusing on distant shores and foreign rights, envisioning untapped possibilities for riper contracts in Asian, European and Latin American countries than American and British writers have traditionally enjoyed. He is also thinking long-term in a way that he never did before. Colleagues have noted his growing affinity for the estates of deceased writers like Italo Calvino and the backlists of aged authors like Bellow. Such work has proven its currency and will continue to generate income as it winds up on academic syllabuses.
"They're cash cows, and everyone's happy to sit around and drink cups of milk," Wylie says one afternoon over lunch at San Domenico on Central Park South. "The trick is to turn them into cash bulls." He sounds like an investment banker, and he looks like one, too, in a nondescript gray suit, perfectly starched white shirt and icy yellow tie. There is a spray of arugula before him and a bottle of mineral water to his side. He did not need to ask for either; the staff has his regimen down pat.
Although Wylie still likes to fancy himself something of a renegade, bragging that his refusal to peddle authors like Jackie Collins has left him poorer than some of his peers, he has certainly amassed the trappings and habits of success. He moved his family five years ago from a brownstone in the West 70's to a regal edifice on Park Avenue. He belongs to the Knickerbocker Club and shops at Barneys. Summer weekends find Wylie among the lemmings on the Long Island Expressway as he heads out to join his wife and two daughters, ages 2 and 11, at the family's second home in Watermill.
Last year, he expanded and spruced up his agency's suite on West 57th Street, installing new computers and ensconcing himself for the first time in a corner office, which is flooded with light. "In a way, he is the emblem of his generation," says Deborah Karl, an agent who worked alongside him for the better part of a decade before a bitter parting in early 1995. "In the late 60's and early 70's, he did drugs. In the 80's, he became fanatical about his career. And in the 90's, he got conservative."
 THE FIRST TIME WYLIE SAW "DUMB AND DUMBER," indulging one of his daughters, he thought the film perfectly suited its title. But one of his most cherished clients, Martin Amis, begged to differ, lecturing Wylie on the movie's apparently elusive merits. "And then later," Wylie says, "I found myself watching it a second time and weeping with laughter, because I was seeing it through Martin's eyes. I think I just tend to adopt other people's perspectives."
Wylie is sitting in his office, an eerily undisguised shrine to the writers and artists whose perspectives he not only adopts but also sells. On the coffee table sits a pile of childish doodles by Mailer that bear such odd epigrams as "I feel bloated," "I'm a handful" and "My beard is so scraggly I can only speak of it as a wee little bush."
Propped up on another table is a nude photograph of Allen Ginsberg and in front of it, a stack of books by Jorge Luis Borges that Wylie says he adds to, or subtracts from, as a way of concealing or exposing Ginsberg's genitalia, in accordance with the anticipated tolerance of the visitor to the office. Right now, the Beat poet is wearing his literary fig leaf.
Elsewhere are gifts from, tributes to or books by other clients, arranged so that a single spin in the center of the room affords an introduction to the entire salon: David Mamet, Larry McMurtry, John Edgar Wideman, Annie Leibovitz, Richard Avedon, William S. Burroughs. "I tend to just glom onto someone and adapt their personality, penmanship, speaking style, everything, and I keep moving through a set of individuals I admire," Wylie says by way of explaining what he likes best about being an agent. "If I spend five days with Salman, I end up looking like him. If I spend two hours with Martin, I look like a Martin doll that evening. I have this sort of void core."
Wylie grew up in a prim and proper New England family, the only son of a stern man who worked as an editor at Houghton, Mifflin. Coming of age in the 1960's, he was ripe for rebellion, and a few years after completing his requisite paces at St. Paul's School and then Harvard, he headed for the naughtier niches of Manhattan. He composed befuddling verse -- "silver limp/ of your throat/spermlegs" -- and read it in the basement of a Maoist bookstore. He swayed to the throaty incantations of Patti Smith. He smoked unfiltered cigarettes and indulged in an array of drugs. "I was as wild as I could be without dying," Wylie recalls.
And then, on the precipice of the 1980's, he abruptly changed directions, out of both boredom and the recognition that he needed a real career with a real income. Some of his peers see his decision to become a literary agent as merely a new phase in a protracted rebellion, and they interpret his zest for warring with publishers as a way of symbolically attacking Daddy, who died in 1977. Wylie says, "I'm not that pathetic."
He started from scratch, without the backing of any large agency. He had only his considerable erudition and his nonpareil chutzpah. In beating the bushes for clients, he set his sights first on I. F. Stone, called him up cold and won him over by singing Homeric verse in the ancient Greek, or so the story goes. Surrounding every Wylie conquest there is some kind of story, and although Wylie now brands many of these tales apocryphal, he probably had no small hand in their dissemination.
In wooing Roth, Wylie is reputed to have approached him at a cocktail party and cooed, "I'd give the last hair on my head to be your agent." In a trans-Atlantic call to Rushdie, Wylie secured the author's promise to have a cocktail with him on his next trip to London. That night, he boarded a plane; the next day, he called Rushdie and announced: "I'm in London. Can we have that drink?"
But in crediting Wylie's success almost entirely to his rapaciousness, his peers have perhaps given short shrift to his basic mathematical skills. When Mailer's former agent, Scott Meredith, died and Mailer went shopping for a new one in 1993, the pitch Wylie made to him centered on the fact that roughly 12 of Mailer's books had fallen out of print in each of 12 languages. This represented roughly 144 possible inactive contracts, Wylie calculated; if each netted just $1,000 a year, that meant more than $100,000 in lost annual income. Needless to say, Wylie got the job and the contracts.
He also gets results. Rushdie's largest advance prior to his association with Wylie was less than $100,000; Wylie got him more than eight times that amount for "The Satanic Verses." Before Wylie, Roth was reportedly being paid $150,000 a book; after Wylie, he secured a three-book contract believed to be worth $1.7 million.
Celebrated authors find more than just a canny negotiator once they sign on with Wylie, however. They encounter an acolyte with boundless devotion. In fact, the timing of Wylie's breakup last March with Aitken and Stone, a partnership that soured gradually after its inception in 1986, was dictated by his gallant defense of Martin Amis's honor. The Times of London had just run an excerpt of Eric Jacobs's diaries of the last weeks of Kingsley Amis's life, which were characterized by drinking in bed and infantile behavior. Martin Amis, Kingsley's son, and Wylie had fought diligently to prevent the story's publication and were caught unaware when it happened, despite the fact that Aitken was Jacobs's agent and knew all about it.
"Andrew was impeccable -- quietly impeccable," Amis says, by which he means that Wylie flew to London within a matter of days for a face-to-face confrontation with Aitken and severed ties with him immediately. Wylie says there was no question in his mind: Amis came first. "He's Martin. If you want to publish English writers, and you're serious, you have to consider Martin."
 ON A SPRING MORNING IN CHICAGO, WYLIE prowls the miles of aisles inside the convention center where the American Booksellers Association is holding its annual exposition. He wears sunglasses, a gesture of transparent shtick. He does not wear his name tag, explaining, "Why not give people a hard time, make them guess?"
The huddle of editors and publicists at the Henry Holt booth don't need to; they recognize him instantly. Behind them hangs an enormous poster advertising a forthcoming book, "Guided Tours of Hell."
"We changed the title," one says to Wylie. "It was really called 'A Visit to a Literary Agency.' "
That such a joke is made openly in front of Wylie is as good an illustration as any that his horns no longer look as devilishly fearsome as they once did; besides, Beelzebub is spending more time these days on foreign soil. Because of the breakup with Aitken and Stone, Wylie has set up his own office in London and plans to sell directly to markets in Europe, rather than subcontracting to other agents, the more common practice.
He is also engaged in talks to buy an interest in Spain's premier literary agency. With these footholds in Europe, he says, he can pitch a writer's work first in the country with the strongest appetite for it -- Susan Sontag's "The Volcano Lover," for example, was a surprise best seller in Spain -- and thus set the right tone for subsequent negotiations. To make that pitch, he says, he will not rely on the fax or the phone, but do what he did to build interest in Rushdie's forthcoming novel: fly from city to city.
The result was a deal with German publishers in May that Wylie says doubled the advance Rushdie received for all of the English-language rights to his last novel, "The Moor's Last Sigh." More important, this enabled Wylie to plump up the bidding from publishers in the United States and Great Britain, leading to Rushdie's big payday from Holt.
The deal, interestingly, also reflects another of Wylie's current obsessions, because it calls for Holt to reissue in paperback three titles from Rushdie's backlist: "The Satanic Verses," "The Jaguar's Smile" and "Shame." More and more frequently, Wylie is making the sale of an author's new book conditional on the publisher's promise to re-issue old ones, whose rights have often reverted to the author, with updated covers, in uniform editions. Wylie grasps the economic wisdom of ushering titles toward the status of classics, just as he appreciates how lucrative it can be to manage the estates of writers with enduring appeal. He has acquired a number of such estates, including those of Calvino, John Cheever and Jorge Luis Borges. He would like others, but this form of literary ambulance-chasing requires delicacy. To get Borges in 1994, he never approached the writer's widow directly, instead telling people who knew her how much he wanted the job. She ultimately came to him, he says.
Wylie is also paying careful attention to the spread of electronic publishing, with its accordant threats of copyright infringement and piracy. But he is not trembling to the degree that some others are, because he does not envision a day when books take a back seat to glowing letters on a screen. "Good books sell in tremendous volume, and always will," Wylie says. "All you have to do is go to Shakespeare in the Park and see the longevity of Shakespeare. You can do almost anything to Shakespeare and the language survives the experience."
Wylie fancies himself on a sort of crusade for quality in publishing. "I would like all of the books at the front of the store to be at a slightly higher level," he says. "You know, something other than this penis-missile-heartbeat-techno-thriller-passion-soapbox formula. If you want to climb on the ocean liner with the rest of the industry, you can go to the Riviera. I want to get myself a boat in the other direction."
As he says this, he is docked at a restaurant in the Drake Hotel in Chicago, which is booked solid for the convention and teeming with the agents and editors from whom he distinguishes himself. While they shuffle into breakfast with the hangdog expressions of people who have been partying too hard, he looks hardy. He turned in early last night, waking up to a run along Lake Michigan.
"Staying out of trouble?" shouts an editor devouring eggs and bacon at a nearby table. Wylie, looking up from his bran muffins and berries, lets the question hang for a few seconds, perhaps because it is no longer so easy to answer. Then, slowly, he grins. As long as people keep asking, he is exactly where he wants to be.

HEADLINE: Reagan's Legacy;
It's His Party

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills is the author of a number of books on the Presidency, including "Nixon Agonistes" and "Lincoln at Gettysburg." He last wrote for the Magazine on political polls and leadership.

 BODY:
Ronald Reagan, physically absent from the Republican National Convention, will nonetheless be everywhere in San Diego. This is the party he built up. Its victories are his. He championed small government so successfully that even President Clinton must now pay it lip service. He made conservatism such an honored term that Democrats had to flee its antonym, the liberal label. He made possible the Republican revolution that is at stake in San Diego. One could say of the convention site what Sir Christopher Wren's tomb says of the cathedral built over it: Don't look for his monument; you are in it.
Every faction in the party can look to Reagan as its leader -- the religious right, the tax cutters, the anti-regulators, the budget balancers, the defense spenders. Whatever their own differences, each can claim some past victory won in Reagan's name. Even Patrick Buchanan, who differs from his old boss on the North American Free Trade Agreement (which Reagan gave birth to as his proposed North American Accord), can claim to be wearing the Reagan mantle when he preaches traditional values. 
 Some parts of the Reagan legacy are overlooked because of their very success -- the collapse of the Soviet Union, the triumph of Reagan-Thatcher free enterprise around the world, the strengthening of democracy in Latin America. And his indirect legacy, only partly visible, still cripples the Democrats: the budget deficits he ran up, which virtually preclude using the Government for social change. Unions are only beginning to recover from the blow he struck them by his treatment of the air traffic controllers.
Intangible parts of the legacy infused confidence into conservatism, and infused conservatism into our national life. Though Reagan is no intellectual himself, conservative ideas, publications and foundations prospered under his aegis. He made old-fashioned things respectable and even avant-garde. He radically reoriented conservatism to the future.
When William F. Buckley founded the National Review in 1955, he said that its task was to stand "athwart history yelling 'Stop!' " Reagan, the congenital optimist, was never comfortable with a purely obstructionist conservatism. He was too swoony over the wonders of science and technology. In one of his favorite stories, a student issued him this challenge: "You didn't grow up in an era of space travel, of jet travel, of cybernetics, computers figuring in seconds what it used to take men years to figure out." Reagan triumphantly produced this response: "It's true . . . we didn't grow up, my generation, with those things. We invented them." When Reagan worked for General Electric, he let the company make his home a well-advertised display of the company's latest luxury products. Many of the items showcased there went into G.E.'s Carousel of Progress, created with Walt Disney for the 1964 World's Fair in New York -- which, in turn, was absorbed into Disney's Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom. Progress was always Reagan's favorite product.
A parable for Reagan's brand of conservatism could be fashioned from his rejection of the historic Lincoln Steffens house, lived in by former governors of California. He had a new place built with the help of financial backers, one with all the modern conveniences. That is what Reagan did, symbolically, for conservatism itself -- took it from its historic home and gave it a new operating center. Some of the charm he found in the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, was precisely its complex of barely conceived technologies. He hated nukes, partly because they were old-fashioned. He loved lasers, partly because they were so "far out" as to remind him of the ray gun in his old Brass Bancroft serials. With his repeated mantra that "nothing is impossible," he believed that technology could make the space weapon entirely benign -- so incapable of offense that we would give it, for free, to the Kremlin. This apparatus for delivering love taps is in accord with Newt Gingrich's hope that an expanded space shuttle will become the Love Boat, so that "a honeymoon on the moon may become commonplace."
Older-style conservatives were not comfortable with Reagan's fondness for a citation from the radical Tom Paine: "We have it in our power to start the world over." Reagan also said: "I don't think we ought to focus on the past. I want to focus on the future." He said that about the Holocaust, in connection with his visit to a German cemetery with the graves of storm troopers in it, but it expressed his generally optimistic futurism. Even the most fundamentalist parts of the conservative coalition now talk a language of the future. Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, boasts that his kind of movement "owes more of a debt to Buck Rogers than to Elmer Gantry." Or more to Brass Bancroft than to Edmund Burke. Gingrich was prophesying in 1984, well before Reed's arrival on the scene, that religion could be reborn thanks to technology -- washed, as it were, in the baptismal streams of the information age:
"The rise of high-tech preachers on cable television is accelerating the re-emergence of religion as a legitimate vehicle for explaining the world. Presently, there will be religious software for home computers and a host of modern high-tech efforts to spread a new electronic gospel."
"Give Me That Old-Time Religion" is not a song you will be hearing from these Reaganized conservatives.
The cognitive scientist George Lakoff claims that conservatives think of themselves as punitive parents, while liberals think of themselves as caring parents. But President Reagan was benign and grandfatherly in style, not harsh and retaliatory -- more a Democrat like Franklin Roosevelt than a dour Calvin Coolidge. Bob Dole's problem with his own supporters is that he seems to lack the genial confidence that worked so well for Reagan. Last year, Dole seemed to recognize that he needed more of Reagan in his persona. He even promised: "If that's what you want, I'll be another Ronald Reagan." Easier said than done.
Reagan, in the overworked story, thought a room half-filled with manure meant there was a pony in there somewhere. Dole's scowl suggests that he expects, any moment, a delivery that will fill the room entirely. Perhaps the dissonance between conservative message and liberal rhetoric could not be maintained indefinitely. But Reagan made it last for his two full terms, and conservatives cannot help dreaming that the combination is still possible. Why not put Ralph Reed's cherubic features on the Dole effort, like a "happy face" sticker?
 RALPH REED IS NOT THE ONLY HEIR to Reagan. Ross Perot is another. His balanced-budget campaign of 1992 made Republicans rank that issue first in the Contract With America, and Newt Gingrich twice closed down the Government in order to force its passage. This whole effort was made necessary by Ronald Reagan. No one, over the years, taught people more emphatically to hate a Government deficit -- and no one ever gave us bigger ones to hate.
Reagan was like Roosevelt not only in his rhetoric. Roosevelt campaigned on a promise to cut spending and balance the budget. Instead, his first term increased spending -- significantly, but not on Reagan's scale. Reagan nearly tripled the deficit in his eight years, and never made a realistic proposal for cutting it. As Lou Cannon, his best biographer, noted, it was unfair for critics to say that Reagan was trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor, since "he never seriously attempted to balance the budget at all." Even Reagan's ideological ally and defender, George Will, made no effort to defend him on this. The six budgets Reagan had most control over "produced deficits totaling $1.1 trillion," Will wrote. "The budgets Reagan sent to Congress proposed thirteen-fourteenths of that total. Congress added a piddling $90 billion a year."
It is claimed that Reagan brought down the Soviet Union by forcing it to spend so much on defense that it collapsed. Perhaps. But in the process he made America spend so much on its military that the budget deficit nearly tripled and the trade deficit more than quadrupled. Moreover, interest payments on the national debt more than doubled (according to Will, "a regressive transfer of wealth to buyers of government bonds"), savings dropped and cutbacks caused severe neglect of the national infrastructure. Even when the cold war was over, few in America seemed to be celebrating. It is not given to many Presidents to spend two world empires toward decline.
How on earth did a Republican, an enemy of "big government," give us the most Government debt ever? No single cause can explain such a mystery. But the elements of disaster arranged themselves around a campaign ploy the Reagan team rejected in 1976 as too kooky but eagerly adopted in the 1980 race -- the "supply side" claim that tax cuts pay for themselves in increased production. This notion was given a visual aid (always helpful with Reagan) when the idea-merchant, Arthur Laffer, drew his famous "curve" on a napkin.
Reagan entertained the exhilarating Laffer heresy without giving up Republican orthodoxy on the balanced budget, smaller government and no inflation. Purists of supply side could accept on principle any short-term deficits while tax cuts had time to generate greater productivity. But that was asking too much from Reagan, whose life had been spent preaching (though not practicing, even as Governor) frugality. Jude Wanniski, the supply-side guru, was able to satisfy this orthodox Reagan with a second doctrine, that of an inflation-busting stable money supply. (Actually, what Wanniski wanted was a return to the gold standard.)
David Stockman, the man asked by Reagan to sell the supply-side tax cuts to Congress, later complained that he was given, in effect, two napkins to reconcile -- the Laffer Curve napkin and the gold-standard napkin -- and the two were irreconcilable.
To make things worse, Stockman had to accommodate another part of Reagan's constituency -- the neoconservative Committee on the Present Danger, which claimed that Jimmy Carter had engaged in unilateral disarmament. The only way to cure that was by major leaps upward in defense spending. Stockman was being lobbied by his friend George Will, whom he called "adamant" on the need for huge defense expenditures. Caspar Weinberger, Reagan's Defense Secretary -- his reputation as "Cap the Knife" notwithstanding -- was determined to flex financial muscle even before he knew what the new money would be buying. During the campaign, Reagan had called for a 5 percent increase in the Pentagon budget, but in the aftermath of Carter's attempt to rescue hostages in Iran ("Desert One"), the outgoing Administration had itself upped defense costs by 5 percent in its 1981 budget.
Sitting in Weinberger's office with his pocket calculator, Stockman suggested a 7 percent increase. Weinberger said, "In light of the disgraceful mess we're inheriting, 7 percent will be a pretty lean ration." Stockman sweetened the deal by figuring the annual raises from the projected Reagan defense budget of 1982, not the lean Carter budget of 1980. Stockman had been doing this, in other areas, to construct "rosy scenarios" counting on income down the line from supply-side magic. That produced lower projected costs elsewhere, but it had the opposite effect for defense -- a fact that Stockman discovered, with chagrin, after the Reagan military budget worked out to a 10 percent increase in real growth over six years, ending up with a 160 percent higher outlay by 1989. It was too late to cancel the announced rates -- the last thing Reagan would do is back off on defense. Stockman says he groaned when he saw that "they were squealing with delight throughout the military-industrial complex."
Stockman became a sorcerer's apprentice as each problem "solved" created another one. For instance, cutbacks that slowed inflation led to revenue losses not at first counted on, since inflation had, through "bracket creep," raised the annual tax intake. It was hard to make the numbers work with that income, too, going down. Stockman gave up, at one point confessing to the journalist William Greider, "None of us really understands what's going on with all of these numbers." His own forecasts were "absolutely doctored," he said.
It did not end there. Another Reagan belief that mired Stockman deeper in deficits was the deregulation mania. Stockman considered it a blessing that his cuts would force agencies to cut back their regulatory tasks, staff and inspections. One of the areas where this had most impact was the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, where Reagan's appointee, Richard Pratt, abolished a regulation requiring savings-and-loan associations (S.& L.'s) to have at least 400 stockholders. This allowed single operators -- like James McDougal, of later Whitewater infamy -- to turn such institutions into "a huge casino" (as U.S. News and World Report described them).
The savings-and-loan crisis had been set up by Democrats in Congress, who lowered restrictions on the associations while raising the limits on Federal deposit insurance (from $40,000 per account to $100,000). The trouble this created was aggravated by Pratt's hands-off attitude toward the banks, and by a new law that let the S.& L.'s move out from their original home loans to virtually any kind of investment.
The prospect of billions of dollars shelled out by the Government to make good on these bad investments was literally unthinkable to Stockman. This would make "wallpaper" of his rosy scenarios about the tax cut's good effect. He did not even want to consider S.& L.'s, as William Seidman, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, discovered: "No matter how many requests were made to him to focus on the troubles of the S.& L.'s, he passed the problem down the chain of command and, as far as I know, never took any interest in it."
No wonder the deficit began to scare people so. The stage was set for Ross Perot's entrance into the 1992 Presidential race. The Government was not working, and we were paying exorbitant sums for it not to work. In effect, Reagan had made his case for governmental fecklessness and oppressiveness by making it practice what he preached against. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a mentor to Stockman, wondered whether supply-side economics was not just an indirect way of dismantling the Government, by creating a debt that dried up its resources. Stockman denied that was the plan's intent (while admitting that it was its effect), but others always saw supply-side as more a political tool than an economic theory.
In "Neoconservatism," Irving Kristol, the influential Republican thinker, confessed as much. "I was not certain of its economic merits," he wrote, "but quickly saw its political possibilities." His ignorance of supply-side realities did not hinder him from berating Stockman for being a mere accountant concerned only with cutting spiraling costs. Kristol kept on seeing light at the end of the deficit. If debts mounted, the Fed could just print more money.
How did Republicans manage to create the monster deficit? By replacing the Democratic slogan, "Spend and spend, tax and tax," with their own formula: "Spend and spend, spend and spend." The first solution a Republican looks to now is to cut taxes. George Bush broke his promise not to raise taxes, and that was considered the ultimate betrayal of Reaganism. Dole, despite his own past ridicule of supply-side ideas, is being stampeded into proposing large tax cuts -- even though the Contract With America called for fiscal austerity to balance the budget (a longtime priority with Dole). Republicans are now working from the Laffer napkin, the Wanniski napkin and the Perot napkin. Reagan never did reconcile frugality and growth, Stockman's realism and Kristol's optimism. His legacy is that circle, still unsquared.
The proof of this contradictory legacy is the way Irving Kristol's son, William, adopted the Stockman austerity Irving had ridiculed, for similarly political reasons. He said the usefulness of a balanced-budget amendment rests not on its fiscal elegance, but on its punitive effect with Democrats. "The balanced budget hurts the Democratic Party for the next decade. It will force a number of budget-cuts-versus-tax-increase fights and that's good for us. The balanced-budget amendment issue will survive [even] if it loses. . . . "
So the political effect of the balanced budget is the same that Moynihan found in supply side. Both deprive the Government of money for social programs. Big Government at home was to be defeated by big Government spending -- as in the Soviet Union. Despite the supply siders' claim that their tax cuts would increase savings and investment, both of them went down in the 1980's. Reagan had cut taxes on the very income that was supposed to give a jolt to growth -- the top rate fell from 70 percent to 28 percent over seven years. But the lost growth of the 1981-82 recession was not made up (despite a sharp rise from that trough, which is what Reagan fans remember).
Lou Cannon, taking stock of the Reagan years, wrote: "The nation's private wealth, adjusted for inflation, grew only 8 percent in the last five Reagan years compared to 31 percent in the period between 1975 and 1980, years that Reagan had derided as inflation-prone and unproductive." Yet, while income growth for the many was slow, it was rocket-fast for the rich. When income for the bottom 10 percent of the population fell by 10.5 percent from 1977 to 1987, that for the top 10 percent went up 24.4 percent -- and that for the top 1 percent went up 74.2 percent.
And the Reagan trends have continued. The ratio between the earnings of chief executives and those of the average workers in their companies has exploded from 41 to 1 in the 70's to 225 to 1 in the 90's. The share of national wealth owned by the top 1 percent of families jumped from 22 percent in 1976 to 42 percent in 1992. Stockman had confessed to Greider that supply side was simply a disguised form of "trickle down" theory -- the view that the only way to get money to the poor is to give it to the rich, from whom in dribbles it will descend. But this was not even trickle down, disguised or undisguised. It was trickle up. While the Government was spending more and more, the mass of the people were not profiting by this expenditure. The profiteers were.
Reagan's strategy-by-accident for trimming the Government tied President Clinton's hands when he took office. There was simply no money for the kinds of programs he advocated in his campaign -- New Deal measures like public works to restore the nation's infrastructure, or public service to create jobs. Bob Woodward traces in his 1994 book, "The Agenda," how public fear of the deficit, striking Democrats in Congress, made Clinton create a tax package to close the budget gap.
Republicans now like to say that they "converted" Clinton to the balanced budget in 1995, when they "shut the Government down" over the issue. But he had been dragged to that position by his own advisers in 1993, when he raised taxes (mainly on the upper brackets). As a result of his austerity, he cut the deficit in half, though Representative Dick Armey, who holds a Ph.D. in economics, had said the tax hike would raise the deficit. Clinton still gets little credit for his accomplishment since he enraged Republicans with the tax increase and offended traditional Democrats and his own campaign staff by abandoning programs he had promised. Policy was held prisoner to the deficit. The Reagan legacy was still at work.
PART OF REAGAN'S LEGACY IS WHAT we do not see now. We see no Berlin wall. He said, "Tear down this wall," and it was done. We see no Iron Curtain. In fact, we see no Soviet Union. He called it an Evil Empire, and it evaporated overnight. Alexander Haig, Reagan's first Secretary of State, wrote recently: "We did not storm the trenches. The enemy suddenly rose up and left, and the Soviet Union was no more. Few in Washington and even fewer in Moscow expected that." But Reagan did.
Admittedly, Reagan did not accomplish all this by fiat. But it was more than coincidence that the fall began on his watch. People agree he had something to do with the collapse of Communism; but even his admirers are not clear on the exact chain of causality. Did he spend the Soviets down, bankrupting the system as it tried to respond to his military buildup? Or did he scare them into surrender, with a Star Wars proposal that the Soviets (quite reasonably) saw as an offensive threat, despite all the defensive talk? Or did he talk them down, greeting Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika with enthusiasm, terrifying his own aides at Reykjavik by seriously entertaining Gorbachev's offer to destroy the Soviet nuclear arsenal if we would do the same?
George Will claimed, in his essay sending Reagan off to retirement, that the President had sold the farm to Gorbachev:
How wildly wrong he is about what is happening in Moscow. Reagan has accelerated the moral disarmament of the West -- actual disarmament will follow -- by elevating wishful thinking to the status of political philosophy. . . . The mind boggles and the spirit sags at the misunderstandings -- of Soviet history, of the 20th century. Reagan blandly says that Gorbachev has just "come along." How is it that the Soviet Union suddenly fell into the hands of such a pleasant fellow? That does not puzzle our cheerful President.
 Just as the Soviet Union was toppling, Will thought it had won. He was not alone in that illusion. The C.I.A. was notoriously slow to recognize what was happening. Certain things were too obvious to be noticed -- like Richard Barnet's assertion that Russia was the only regime in the world surrounded by hostile Communist countries (China, Romania, Hungary, Poland). It was Richard Nixon's opening to China that gave the Soviet Union 4,000 miles of troublesome border with that country. With its resources stretched and its edges fraying, with dissent in its bosom, with economic shortages and malfunctions, the Soviet Union was not the giant terror of our dreams. We had nightmares about nonexistent bomber gaps, then missile gaps, then spacecraft gaps. We were not so much scaring the Russians as scaring ourselves witless.
The hysteria peaked with Reagan's 1980 campaign on the issue of a "window of vulnerability," fast approaching, when the Soviet Union would have such a preponderance of accurate nuclear missiles that it could dictate our surrender with a single threat -- "just take us with a phone call," as Reagan put it. This confecting of nightmares continued into Reagan's first term, a time when Newt Gingrich published the claim that "the Soviets have nuclear weapons in orbit." While we were imagining our own impossible Star Wars missile defense, we fantasized that they already had what we could barely imagine.
There were structural, psychological and ideological pressures to exaggerate the threat. In "Fall From Glory," Gregory Vistica traces John Lehman's effort as Reagan's Secretary of the Navy to create a nearly trillion-dollar budget for a 600-ship Navy by disregarding or concealing evidence that showed the shabby state of Soviet naval forces. Vistica believes that much of the Navy's current trouble comes from the institutional deceit involved in that effort. Cap Weinberger's huge military budget, of which Lehman's trillion was merely a part, may or may not have broken the bank in Moscow; but it certainly mired us deeper in debt.
According to Reagan's admirers, the President turned this situation around by trumping the window with Star Wars. It is not clear why, if the Soviets had such technological wizardry as to build an arsenal of awesomely accurate missiles, they could not match our Star Wars gadgetry. Sure, it would cost money; but they had been able to afford Newt Gingrich's phantom nuclear fleet in orbit -- which could blow up our space defense in its construction stage.
Actually, if mere military superiority prevailed, then we should have won long ago, since we always had a huge advantage -- in world bases, technology and economic resources. Our weakness, dating from the days of Joseph McCarthy, was a strong willingness to believe that Communists were doing everything, everywhere. They were in our Government, they had infiltrated every major Government around the world. The Soviet Union, still reeling from World War II, was our equal if not our superior. Despite our claim that capitalism is the more productive system, we presented it to ourselves as unable to keep pace with Soviet socialism.
If superior American weaponry had not brought down the Soviet Union in preceding decades, it is doubtful that it was solely responsible for doing so in the 1980's. Other things were at work, not all of them in our control. Despite what Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagan's authority on authoritarianism, said about the impossibility of internal cracking in totalistic regimes, the internal dissent, contradiction and demoralization that burst into the open when the Iron Curtain fell had long been at work. Richard Nixon had destroyed the myth of a monolithic Communism by his opening to China. Nixon's policy of detente also gave dissidents channels to the outside world. The economic deals that made the Chinese want to slip out of their cold-war sterilisms were attractive to elements in Russia. Gorbachev was not just "faking" glasnost to trap us. He was containing pressures from within, trying to hold together a dissolving regime. We tend to give ourselves too much blame or credit for things that happen in the world. We are not the only agent in history. The dissidents within Russia (pace Jeane Kirkpatrick) deserve much of the credit we try to monopolize for the Soviet downfall.
Pressure from outside helped, but the pressure Reagan exerted was not confined to weaponry. We have always recognized that Reagan's achievement at home was largely rhetorical, his use of the bully Presidential pulpit. We rarely give enough weight to his sheer persuasive impact on events abroad. While others, like President Nixon, thought mainly of national interests, Reagan cast the struggle with the Soviet Union as basically a moral encounter.
It seemed to many (and to me) that Reagan's talk of an Evil Empire was irresponsible. When a colleague was lecturing in Moscow, during a 1980's exchange effort, his wife taught French in a Russian high school, where a girl asked why President Reagan thought she was irredeemably evil. Moral absolutism looses fanaticism, a dangerous thing when nuclear weapons lie ready to a trembling hand. The risk might not have worked. It might have blown us up.
But it didn't. Reagan's comments on the Soviet Union were not a ploy but, for him, a statement of the obvious. His evident sincerity, even simplicity, gave weight to his view -- not only abroad but at home. David Hume said that political efforts are sustained more efficiently by moral arguments than by appeals to mere advantage or self-interest. People will sacrifice for what they are persuaded is deeply right.
Our national cohesion for 40 years of the cold war depended on a consensus that Communism was an evil system threatening every value we hold precious. Harry Truman started it all with his own version of the Evil Empire -- he always called it "godless Communism." That crusading fervor was revived by Reagan. In terms of military hardware, he put his money where his mouth was; but that mouth had said the right thing for getting the results he wanted.
And, besides, the Soviet Union was evil. Weak, but evil. Few could see the obvious weakness. But he made us see the obvious evil. And since he believed even more in the power of good than in the power of evil, he was ready to talk with repenting sinners -- to George Will's disgust. He even found signs of hope in a perception that "in glasnost and perestroika and all that, there is much more smacking of Lenin than of Stalin." The hyperbolic bad cop could become, in the blink of an eye, the almost smarmily hopeful good cop -- and both of them were Reagan.
Even Jesse Jackson had to admire the result:
"Kissinger types bitterly argued that it was absurd to expect a guy like Reagan could do anything with Gorbachev, who had about 597 volumes of Lenin, whole libraries of history and economics. And yet Reagan, not knowing any of all that stuff Kissinger had learned, not knowing any Russian except maybe vodka, sits down and gets an historic deal out of Gorbachev. He made history that all those little wannabe Kissingers in the future will spend their working lives analyzing. . . . That's the way it often is with the great creators. A real leader, once he moves and sets the pace and sends the word out, people say, 'Well, now, that's what time of day it is.' "
While Reagan demonized the Soviet empire, he was also hollowing out our own Government, denying its claims upon the citizenry. The belief in simple good and evil was just as strong in him when he decided that big government at home is evil -- the problem, not the solution, the burden on our backs, the underminer of our freedoms. It is not given to many Presidents to drain legitimacy -- as well as solvency -- from two world empires.
THE FACT THAT REAGAN HAD TO use a huge military complex, fed by high taxes, to fight Communism led him to a compensatory denial that government should make other demands on people. The principle of small government, suspended for the one great crusade, must for that very reason be asserted with special force elsewhere. The Government that could use secrecy and compulsion against foreign enemies had to be reined back from tyranny at home. Taxes, always a necessary evil, were an unnecessary and indefensible evil apart from the military.
Reagan campaigned against the New Deal when speaking for Barry Goldwater in 1964. He had softened his anger at Roosevelt's programs by 1980, but he still promised to end many kinds of regulation and dismantle useless agencies. After all, even Jimmy Carter had deregulated the airlines, trucking and oil prices. A Republican would have to go much further, especially one who spoke with such moral assurance about governmental intrusion into business and private activities.
Yet Reagan surprised many by failing to deregulate a single industry or to abolish any important governmental agency. The conservative David Frum lamented that "only one spending program of any size was done away with, and even that --the worthless Comprehensive Employment and Training Act -- was instantly replaced by another program, the Jobs Training Partnership Act, meant to achieve almost exactly the same end." Reagan accomplished his own purposes by a malign neglect of governmental machinery rather than legislative abolition of it. As the political scientist, Theodore Lowi, puts it: "Reagan left all of the New Liberal state intact but made it almost impossible for it to work. Drastic tax cuts coupled with maintenance of defense and welfare commitments effectively killed governmental capacity." But it was not, as Lowi put it, simple impoverishment that defeated governmental capacity. There was a real animus against even diminished government action; a hatred of one's own tools.
Reagan signaled a disinterest in, when not active dislike for, Federal agencies to which he appointed people with equal disinterest, or even disdain. He did not abolish the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But he never went near the abomination, and he could not even recognize his own appointee, Samuel Pierce. In turn, Pierce was so neglectful of his department that he let a young conservative opportunist, Deborah Gore Dean, run it largely for the benefit of family, friends and fellow ideologues -- which led to her conviction on 12 felony counts, including fraud, taking a payoff and perjury. For her, ripping off a hated agency could serve the ultimate cause of driving it into disrepute or desuetude. Dean and her circle were flip and cynical, forerunners of the young, conservatism-is-fun crowd that would pullulate in 1990's Washington.
Other agencies were being discredited by the very people asked to defend them. One of the leading advocates for despoliation of natural resources, James Watt, was cynically made Secretary of the Interior. The Department of Education, a target of Reagan's campaign animosity, which Ed Meese called "a bureaucratic joke," was given to Terrel Bell, who was perceived as a lightweight.
Reagan's Commerce Department drew up a hit list of regulations resented by business ("the Terrible 20") and recommended their nonenforcement. Vice President Bush was put in charge of a deregulatory task force. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration had to be brought into court to perform its own acts mandated by law -- and no wonder: Reagan put it under the leadership of Thorne Auchter, whose family construction firm had been cited for nearly 50 violations of safety rules. Reagan's lawyers cut back on legal services to the poor.
The Environmental Protection Agency became, under Reagan, something more like the Polluters' Protection Agency. Given the opposition of Reagan's followers to feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment, there may have been a dismissive motive for putting women in charge of some despised regulation. We had not only Dean but Rita Lavelle, convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for her responses to Congressional questions about her work in the hazardous waste division of the E.P.A. We also had Anne Gorsuch Burford, Lavelle's superior, forced out of the E.P.A. by the White House chief of staff, James Baker, when her agency became a notorious embarrassment.
Republican blacks were also sent into these thankless bureaucracies -- not only the invisible Sam Pierce at H.U.D., but Clarence Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where he let cases of discrimination accumulate unacted upon. When the backlog on age discrimination complaints reached 13,000, and with the statute of limitations running out, the Senate felt moved to investigate his inaction.
Reagan wanted no association with those parts of the Government he despised. Here his temperamental detachment served him well. He could still attack Washington and the Federal Government; he took no responsibility for the parts of it he despised or disapproved of. Ross Perot would later say that the Government needed hands-on management, someone who would "look under the hood." If Reagan had wanted to look into things at H.U.D., he would not have had the remotest idea where to find the latch. Most people put in charge of a major operation will try to defend it or restore its credibility. But Reagan had no intention of bringing respect to government. Let it rot under him. He always knew it was worthless. The better it worked, the more harm it would do. The attitudes of the Republicans who later wanted to "shut the Government down" for their long-range ideological purposes grew naturally from this Reagan attitude.
Americans have always harbored a healthy suspicion toward politics and politicians. But something different has been growing over the last 15 years -- a positive contempt for government itself. Washington has become the fons et origo of all that is wrong with the country. That attitude was fostered by Reagan as he voiced from the inmost center of government a low regard for governing. And, as is usual in such things, the little zealots under Reagan carried his contempt for government much further. Oliver North felt he was acting in Reagan's spirit when he broke laws to get things done. In the same way, a Deborah Dean or Rita Lavelle could abuse the offices entrusted to them because they felt the offices deserved no trust. There is something morally corrosive about performing tasks you despise.
Conservatives have for decades been concerned about "subversives" in government. But the real subverters of our Government were the ones who worked in and against it at the same time, acting from a disloyalty they could not openly express. Now their legatees are open in expressing their hatred for government. Representative Dick Armey, captain of the Republican revolution, thinks of the American Government as engaged in the same activities as the old Soviet regime:
 Behind our New Deals and New Frontiers and Great Societies you will find, with a difference only in power and nerve the same sort of person who gave the world its Five Year Plans and Great Leaps Forward -- the Soviet and Chinese counterparts.
If our system differs from the Soviet Union's only in nerve, the task of the freedom fighter is to bring it down. It is not surprising that militia groups would express such feelings -- or that even the stray House members would (like Helen Chenoweth of Idaho or Steve Stockman of Texas). But it is a mark of how deep Reagan's legacy runs that a major House leader should agree with them.
Patrick Buchanan said that his "culture war" aimed at the Clintons is more important than the cold war aimed at Russia. Some observers feel that the current confusion on the political scene comes from the loss of a clear enemy, the kind that united us in the cold war. That is not a problem for the Armeys and Buchanans, the self-proclaimed heirs to Reagan. They have an enemy clearly in view, and it is their own Government. Irving Kristol agrees. He now says: "There is no 'after the cold war' for me. . . . Now that the other 'cold war' is over, the real cold war has begun." This battle, he explains, is against American liberalism, against "a rot and decadence that was no longer the consequence of liberalism but was the actual agenda of contemporary liberalism."
This fierce attack upon our own is the result of what Theodore Lowi calls the false continuum of all political systems. Instead of recognizing that each different system has a different ethos, these critics of power see every degree of governmental power as an inch up toward the same kind of tyranny, whether Communist, or fascist, or liberal. In fact, the nearest encroachment is the most dangerous, because it is the least suspected. F.D.R. was worse than Stalin because he lulled us toward Stalinism without showing the cloven hoof.
It is said that disillusion with government began with the revelations of Watergate. But it continued to grow through the 80's and into the 90's, since Reagan governed by discrediting government. And now the distrust is not only for this or that abuse of government but for its very existence. As Lowi remarks, "Whenever Americans are fed up with government, they do not go after the allegedly hated and feared bureaucracy but after representative government itself." People express animosity toward the very people they have voted for. They try to limit their terms. They talk as if they wished their vote to put a person into office were simultaneously a vote to remove him or her. We spent decades opposing Communism by trying to introduce free elections around the world -- only to tell ourselves that our elections do not matter.
Not orderly rule but violent overthrow is the fantasy haunting the minds of some of Reagan's heirs. Rush Limbaugh, expressing sympathy for the militias, said: "The second violent American revolution is just about -- I got my fingers about a fourth of an inch apart -- is just about that far away. Because these people are sick and tired of a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington driving into town and telling them what they can and can't do." Representative John Boehner of Ohio called OSHA regulators the "Gestapo of the Federal Government."
It may be objected that all this is "just rhetoric" -- an odd thing for any Reaganite to say. It was his rhetoric about an Evil Empire that helped destroy one system. Why should we take any less seriously his rhetoric about the evils of our Government? Oliver North did not. The Freemen of Montana do not. The airwaves are filled with citizens' vituperation of the representatives they have themselves chosen. Though Reagan was too courtly and well mannered to use the caustic insults orchestrated on talk radio, he made the world safe for Rush Limbaugh. And Limbaugh, down through the ranks of his ever less contained fellows (Oliver North, G. Gordon Liddy, Bob Grant), has made the world safe for the militias, the Freemen, the bombers of the Federal building in Oklahoma City. If the Government is the enemy, these people will fight it, with guns if necessary; and feel that they work under the aegis of the man who most effectively taught them that Government is the enemy. One Evil Empire down, one to go.
DESPITE REAGAN'S LOVE for a raptly imagined future, he never lost his love for an equally imaginary past. His optimism was able to rise above the worry over (or even awareness of) present discontents because he saw us so clearly poised between the Good Old Days and the Brave New World. We pass from one perfection to another, through an interspace it were best not to advert to. Even Vietnam, once it was passed, had slipped into that roseate glow that surrounds all other "noble causes" in our history. Reagan's view of the past was largely shaped by the movies he saw or made, with their celebratory approach to American exceptionalism. As Jules Feiffer once said, when dealing with Reagan's defense of religious creationism: "If Reagan had played Darwin in a movie, he would believe in evolution."
Reagan's religion emphasized that God has given the American people a special role in history. He liked biblical prophecies because they personalized issues. He even brought his room-half-full-of-manure approach to prophecies about the end of the world. After all, Armageddon is just the signal for "the second coming of Christ." Oliver North was telling lies, as usual, but was not very far from Reagan's thinking when he told representatives of the Ayatollah Khomeini:
We inside our Government had an enormous debate, a very angry debate inside our Government whether or not my President should authorize me to say "We accept the Islamic Revolution of Iran as a fact. . . . " He went off one whole weekend and prayed about what the answer should be and he came back almost a year ago with that passage I gave you that he wrote in front of the Bible I gave you. And he said to me: "This is a promise that God gave to Abraham. Who am I to say that we should not do this?"
It was also Reaganish to accompany the gift of a Bible with a sugary cake. (The TOW missiles were a different matter.)
REAGAN WAS A GREAT COMMUNICATOR because he was a great storyteller. That is why he preferred the Bible's story of creation to Darwin's lineup of fossil charts. That is why he liked prophecies and astrological assurances. Somebody up there likes us. The stories about our past were always better than any evidence about it. This explains the mysterious fact that our Government, which can do nothing good now, could do nothing bad in the past. It screws up OSHA, but it was benign in its wars with Indians and Mexicans. His heir in this reverence to the past is Lynne Cheney, who thinks any critical look at our history is mere "political correctness." The authority of the past is, like that of the Bible, a matter of faith. To question anything about America that occurred before our lifetime is like an attack on God -- since He was its guide. (In our lifetime, of course, you can beat up on government all you like.)
This strange world view -- strange, yet familiar -- was articulated most dramatically by Reagan. For him, we were suspended between two glowing myths: the religious past and the technological future. Whatever trouble afflicts us now is caused only by doubters of our double myths -- and Reagan had no gift for doubt. He did not invent this mythic complex. It speaks to very American attitudes toward past, present and future, toward religious stability and technological change. But he gave the contradictory things a kind of magic absolution by combining them so easily in his performance at the peak of world power and public exposure. It was a bravura performance, one people are still stunned by and want to share. They hope for another Reagan. But who else could fuse so much of America's past, as celebrated on movie screens and radio waves, with the present of celebrity politics and nostalgic opportunism?
And who else has Reagan's personal qualities -- self-assurance without a hectoring dogmatism, pride without arrogance, humility without creepiness, ambition without ruthlessness, accommodation without mushiness? How can you beat that? Jules Feiffer ruefully discovered that you can't. Back in the 1970's, when vacationing at Malibu, Feiffer took a lonely walk at dawn along the beach. Only one other figure was out -- the soon-to-be-ex-Governor of California (not yet a candidate for President). Feiffer resolved to be ostentatiously nonchalant, to prove he was not star-struck. He would walk by with a distant nod, if he could not prevent himself from any acknowledgment. But, just as they were about to pass each other, Reagan loosed one of his melt-an-iceberg grins, and Feiffer came apart. "I was waving like an idiot," Feiffer says. Reagan had a stealth charm, even for his critics. He flew under our radar.

HEADLINE: Riding Two Highways: Information and Real

BYLINE: By WAYNE CURTIS; WAYNE CURTIS is the author of the forthcoming "Frommer's Northern New England," to be published on paper.

 BODY:
ON my two-month excursion from Maine to New Mexico, I decided to live by the Internet. Equipped with an Apple Powerbook and credit-card-sized modem, I'd be a wildcatter on the information frontier, sinking wells into the electronic reservoir as I went along. I'd tap the wisdom of locals, cranky adventurers and fellow travelers on the World Wide Web, turning up obscure but superb restaurants and offbeat attractions along the way. I'd cast off the chains of outdated guidebooks. I'd ignore those weird hardcover glossy magazines, found in upscale hotel rooms, pasted with stern warnings against theft. I had been successful using the Internet planning for shorter trips from home, why wouldn't it work on the road? Jack Kerouac, meet Bill Gates!
Of course I'd face some obstacles -- what adventurer doesn't? Chief among them would be access to phone lines. I planned to camp most nights at state or county parks, far from the convenience of in-room phones. A cell phone was a possibility, although I'd heard these could be notoriously balky in transferring data, and large cell phone bills would bring financial ruin. Instead, I would be economical, using pay phones to connect with Earthlink, my Internet provider. (I signed up with Earthlink in part because the salesman called me "dude" and "big guy," which I found oddly flattering.) After paying a modest monthly fee, I could link up for the cost of a local call through any one of dozens of phone numbers the service maintains around the country, or through a toll-free line (at $5 an hour extra) on those days I was out of range. 
 Thus equipped, I adjusted my rear-view mirror and set out on the information superhighway. First unfortunate discovery: very few pay phones offer dataports for plugging in a modem. I could occasionally find one off the lobby at a hotel that did a brisk business trade, but mostly not. So I purchased something called an acoustic coupler, an archaic device that attaches to a pay phone handset with the clever employment of a Velcro strap. But staticky phone service prevented clean connections in many areas, and the failures to connect far outweighed the successes. When it did work, I often attracted unwelcome attention, which made for poor surfing. Standing at a campground pay phone late one night in Arkansas, bathed in the cool blue glow of my screen and no doubt looking like a fugitive from the "X-Files," I was confronted by an elderly campground manager who menaced me with a harsh flashlight beam. His suspicions that I was perpetrating an elaborate fraud on the local phone company could not be assuaged. So I ended up checking into motel rooms every few days, drawn by the beacon of free local calls, to cruise the Web in search of travel advice and to plan further adventures.
The Web, for all its ease in producing a gusher of data, spews forth plenty of sludge. One typical evening in a motel just outside Oklahoma City, I ventured into cyberspace to track down a place to eat. I first went to one of the popular search engines and typed in "Oklahoma City" and "restaurant." This led me to the World Wide Restaurant Guide, but that listed only two restaurants far on the other side of the city. (Even more irksome, there was no indication if these were independent reviews or paid advertising.) I clicked onward to a collection of restaurant reviews, but could find nothing within several hundred miles. I then turned up an extensive if austere listing of local restaurants, featuring addresses and phone numbers and little else -- less information than I could have dredged up from the Yellow Pages.
Next I made the discovery that no fewer than three Pizza Huts were nearby, after which I came across something called Diana's Travel Page, which took far too long to download, so I pressed on. I skipped over the restaurant listings on a couple of "official" Web pages -- the vacuous on-line version of chamber of commerce brochures -- and then happened upon a quirky home page created by a student at the nearby University of Oklahoma. He recommended a local brewpub for tasty meals and hearty beer, and I was nearly on my way out the door when I scrolled just a bit farther to learn that this student also espoused several nutty causes, including the elimination of speed limits nationwide. Why would I think his judgment about food was any better than his ideas on public policy? It was at this point that I grew perilously faint with hunger and summoned all my reserves to blunder to the Taco Bell next door.
Other times the search was rewarding but the results disappointing. Before heading into Kansas City, I scanned the Web for information about campgrounds on the city outskirts. I turned up a listing of places with surprising ease, and set off for a county park southwest of the city that sounded like a winner: a sizable lake, acres of forest, an observation tower with a fine view, all sorts of amenities. I arrived late in the afternoon and found the place even exceeded the description -- lush, bucolic, beautifully landscaped. In fact, it was lacking in only one thing: a campground.
FOR the most part, I got far more useful information from casual comments from other travelers than I did on the Web. Which isn't to say the Web wasn't without some minor triumphs. It was great for local weather forecasts. And one night in Madison, Wis., I learned from a local Web site that a small bar was featuring a noted Chicago blues band that night. I even typed in the bar's address at Mapquest, a handy Web site that plotted my route from motel to club. Granted, it took about 12 minutes to accomplish something I could have done with a 12-second phone call to the front desk, but it was uniquely satisfying nonetheless.
And I did make one happy discovery about the Internet and travel. It makes a fine conduit to home. I received E-mail from friends and relatives all along the way -- short, gossipy notes that would have been unworthy of a letter or a long-distance call. I so looked forward to these little missives that my motel habits changed. I used to enter a guest room and make directly for the toiletries basket to survey the booty. Now, even before the door had swung shut, I'd be down on my hands and knees under the desk, inspecting phone jacks and scrambling for a connection.
I was also lulled by the lazy comfort of lying on a motel bed, the warm laptop purring on my belly, as I aimlessly paged through the on-line versions of my daily and weekly hometown papers. I found inexplicable comfort in knowing what films were playing at home, what local politicians were in trouble and what bands were appearing at the clubs. Looking around my motel room after a typical session, I would be plagued with a vaguely unsettling sensation of not having any idea of where I was.
Despite the disappointments, I still don't subscribe to the neo-Luddite refrain about the utter uselessness of computers. (For one thing, the Luddites are wrong when they say no one will read an on-line newspaper in the bathroom. I did.) But for travel, I would have gotten a lot more out of my single battered copy of Jane and Michael Stern's 10-year-old "Roadfood and Goodfood," a book I regretted leaving at home. In fact, for the price of my high-tech rig I could have purchased roughly 175 old-fashioned guidebooks. For now, at least, that seems the way to go.

HEADLINE: Meeting the Girl in the Picture

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF is Tokyo bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
FOR four years I had been writing to the Bongbonga family, who live in the middle of the jungle on an island in the Philippines. It was somewhat eerie to walk down a narrow dirt path and finally arrive at their thatch-roofed bungalow beside a banana tree. "Joy," my escort called out. "Joy Bongbonga! Your foster father is here!"
The door opened, and Joy appeared: an 11-year-old girl with thick black hair, light brown skin and bright black eyes. She looked just as she did in the pictures that I had received periodically from Childreach, through which I sponsored her as a "foster parent" -- except, of course, in real life, scampering around barefoot, she was cuter. 
 Like more than 1.1 million other Americans I had sponsored a needy child abroad through contributions to a relief agency; in my case this involved sending $22 a month and exchanging letters with the family. When my work took me to the Philippines, I decided to make a side trip to visit.
A dozen years before in the Sudan, I had visited another foster child, Aziza Ali, sponsored by my parents. At the time I was studying Arabic in Egypt, and made a 10-day trip to the Blue Nile Valley where Aziza lived. I was so impressed with the foster parent program and the way it was improving the villagers' health and economic opportunities, that when I got a job and became solvent I sponsored a child in Haiti.
I was never able to visit that boy, Yves Jean-Baptiste; letters describing life in his remote village and pictures showing him as a frail teen-ager in neatly pressed clothes had to suffice. After he reached 18 and graduated from the program, I sponsored George Bongbonga, Joy's elder brother, and when George left home to go to a city school, I was assigned to Joy. We exchanged letters several times a year in English about our lives and families, her schoolwork and my job, and the customs in our countries for Christmas or Valentine's Day.
Childreach encourages sponsors to make these visits, and about 200 to 300 do so each year. The woman who answered the organization's phone in Warwick, R.I., was most accommodating when I explained what I wanted to do. She sent me information about visiting a sponsored child and gave me the phone number of a Philippine branch office of Plan International, the organization of which Childreach is the American member.
I called the local Plan office, in the Philippine city of Calapan, and set a date to visit. The Calapan office gets only three or four visits a year from foster parents, and the staff seemed delighted that I wanted to see the child I sponsored.
So one day at the end of March I set off from Manila at 4:30 A.M. in a car that I had rented with a driver to take me three hours south to the city of Batangas. There I took a hydrofoil for an hour to the island of Mindoro, and when I walked down the gangplank I saw a couple of men holding a sign with my name. It always surprises me when things work out as planned in the Third World, but the whole day went like clockwork.
My escorts, Restie Consigo and Rene Pineda, both Plan employees on Mindoro, loaded me into the cab of a pickup truck, and we began bouncing our way to the Bongbongas' village. It was a three-hour drive on terrible roads, consisting of potholes interspersed with pavement at first, then disintegrating into dirt; where one bridge had washed out we had to drive through a wide creek with rushing water about a foot deep.
Mindoro is a beautiful tropical island of rice paddies and jungle, its verdant greens interspersed with the brown trunks of palm trees, the deep blue of a vast lake, the dark gray of a few somber water buffalo. We occasionally passed other vehicles, mostly private minibuses decorated with chrome and uplifting words -- Peace Be With You -- as they roared down the roads with less inspiring manners. Restie and Rene kept the pickup's cassette player filled with Philippine love songs and Julio Iglesias, because Iglesias is also a foster parent of a child on Mindoro. He sends letters regularly, Rene said, as well as gifts of his music, but has not visited yet.
We stopped the pickup at a small Plan outpost near Joy's village, and about 15 local volunteers were there to welcome me. The volunteers are central to the programs, doing much of the work at the local level: interviewing sponsored families; taking photographs; writing progress reports to foster parents; distributing letters and money, and planning community projects.
The volunteers all piled in the back of the pickup, and we bounced on up the road to Joy's village. Finally we parked the truck by the side of the road and trudged down a dirt path for a third of a mile to reach the Bongbongas' house.
Teresita Bongbonga, Joy's mother, opened the door, beaming, and a moment later Joy and two younger children appeared. None of us really knew how to behave. They had the idea that Americans are terribly demonstrative, so they seemed ready to plaster me with hugs and kisses, while I had the notion that Filipinos are a bit restrained, so I was ready to shake hands. But the volunteers began laughing and telling Joy to "give a kiss to your second father," and she gave me a peck on the cheek. I thought that Mrs. Bongbonga -- her husband, Danilo, was away, working near Manila as a security guard and sending money home -- would be offended by the references to me as a foster parent and second father, but she welcomed me in.
I sat down, and Joy sat down next to me, while Restie interpreted. Actually, Joy understood most of my questions -- she's a top student in the local elementary school -- but she said I was the first foreigner she had ever met, and she was nervous. She said that her favorite subject at school was English and that she wanted to be a teacher. She also showed me around the house, which, it turned out, I had helped to build.
ALTHOUGH sponsors send monthly checks, Plan International does not relay this money directly to families. Instead, the sponsors' money is used in various projects. The Bongbongas' house, for example, was built three years ago when Plan offered materials valued at $400 if the family would put in labor and supplies worth $160. Made of concrete blocks with a roof partly tin and partly thatch, the house has four tiny rooms with doors and linoleum floors. Although it does not have electricity or glass windows, it is a huge improvement over the family's previous hut.
Plan also provided a water pump, on the condition that the family provide the labor to install it, so that now the Bongbongas have a 40-foot well and a reliable source of potable water. The organization provided a toilet that would prevent contamination of ground water; the Bongbongas built the outhouse around it. Likewise, Plan provides immunizations for Joy's younger brother and sister, Kris and Nikki, as well as family planning counseling to the parents and money to help Joy buy schoolclothes and scholarships to keep her siblings in school as long as possible.
This day, though, I felt that it was the Bongbongas who were sponsoring me. They treated me to a feast that Joy had helped prepare: bananas from their tree, coconut salad from their coconut palm, fish from a nearby river, rice and a delicious fruit called star apple. The food was wonderful, although I did pause to collect myself when I took a bite of the fruit and found half a worm wriggling in protest.
Afterward, Joy showed me around the village, taking particular pride in displaying the family's pig. She pointed out the radishes, tomatoes and various vegetables in the family's garden, and she tolerated my insistence at taking photos from every angle.
Finally, after two and a half hours, it was time to go. I first distributed presents: two blouses, a hair clasp and a stamp picture book for Joy, a toy truck apiece for Kris and Nikki, a dress for Mrs. Bongbonga and a shirt for her husband. Plan had recommended not giving expensive gifts, and everybody seemed delighted -- and immediately changed clothes. Later I left a modest cash gift for Plan to relay back to the family.
Joy and her mother walked me back down the path to the pickup, and we said our goodbyes. The volunteers egged Joy on and she gave me another farewell peck and an embarrassed hug.
Now, when I get letters from Joy, she is not just a face in a photograph, but a vivid, smiling child showing off her pump and outhouse and pig. She is my window into a different world; when I write to her, I can conjure that bungalow beside a banana tree, and I now know I helped build it.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Virginia Beach

BYLINE: By JOSEPH COSCO; JOSEPH COSCO lives in Norfolk, Va.

 BODY:
To see Virginia Beach as a resort city is to miss much of its attraction. It is perhaps best known for its two-mile-long boardwalk and oceanfront strip. But Virginia Beach comes in other incarnations: half of its vast geographic area (a product of its merger with Princess Anne County) remains rural, and historic and timeless places still survive.
It was here, in 1607, that colonists under Capt. John Smith first set foot in North America before moving up the James River to establish the permanent settlement at Jamestown. And it was off Cape Henry, during the Revolutionary War, that the French fleet under Adm. Francois Joseph Paul, compte de Grasse, defeated the British, making possible the decisive victory at Yorktown. 
 Tourism began in the 19th century, when the railroad linked Virginia Beach to the nearby port city of Norfolk, but it wasn't until the 1920's that the city took off, with the addition of the boardwalk and the Cavalier Hotel -- both of which are still here. In 1963, the city merged with surrounding Princess Anne County, allowing it to stretch 310 square miles from Chesapeake Bay to the North Carolina border.
The city has been working hard to stay competitive in the resort market. It has spruced up the resort strip some, made a major addition to its already popular Virginia Marine Science Museum and built an amphitheater that is attracting bigger acts to the area since it opened in May.
Late summer and early fall are good times to visit. The crowds are gone and many hotel rates drop after Labor Day. Temperatures are mild (the ocean waters average 72 degrees in September), and there's still plenty to do.
The area code for phone numbers in Virginia Beach is being changed to 757 from 804. The change is not expected to be completed until early next year.

 
 
Events
 Special events and festivals, a staple of summer beach life, continue through September. The granddaddy is the Neptune Festival, (804) 498-0215, now in its 23d year. It runs from Sept. 15 to 29, and on the concluding weekend, Sept. 27 to 29, will feature entertainment, arts and crafts shows, a sand-castle competition, among other activities, all centered along the oceanfront.
The East Coast Surfing Championships, (800) 861-7873, have been held here for more than 30 years. Pros and amateurs compete Aug. 22 to 25, and there will also be beach volleyball, a five-kilometer race and entertainment. Admission is free.
The American Music Festival, (804) 491-7866, is scheduled for Aug. 30 to Sept. 2. Headliners -- performing under the stars at several stages along the beach -- include Willie Nelson, Huey Lewis and the News, the Temptations and the Four Tops. Admission is $10 for featured entertainers, free for other acts.
Some of the biggest happenings are at the new Virginia Beach Amphitheater, 3550 Cellar Door Way, (804) 671-8100. Performers scheduled at the 20,000-seat theater include James Taylor on Friday; Melissa Etheridge, Aug. 28; Blues Traveler, Lenny Kravitz and Rusted Root, Aug. 30. Ticket prices vary.
The Virginia Beach Center for the Arts, 2200 Parks Avenue, (804) 425-0000, has three companion exhibits that focus on vessels (the kind used as containers) from different points of view and in different media. Highlighting the shows, which run through Sept. 8, is "John Ruppert: Natural Forces/Urban Context," which features giant chain-link vessels by Mr. Ruppert, a Baltimore sculptor. The museum's permanent collection showcases 20th century art. It is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 A.M. to 5:30, Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., and Sunday from noon to 4 P.M. Free.

 
 
Sightseeing
 Virginia Beach boasts 38 miles of shoreline, 28 of which are accessible to the public. There are 10 beaches, including ocean and bay, boardwalk and beach community, bustling and quiet. The action is along the resort strip, a crowded, noisy jumble of hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops and honky-tonk attractions that runs along the Atlantic for more than two miles from Rudee Inlet to 40th Street. For more solitude, there's the North End beyond 40th Street, the beach at Fort Story (open to the public only during the week) and Little Island Park at Sandbridge, a barrier-island beach community beyond the rural Pungo section.
Besides salt-and freshwater fishing and other water sports, Virginia Beach offers hiking, biking and bird-watching in peaceful natural preserves. First Landing-Seashore State Park, 2500 Shore Drive, (804) 481-2131, offers 2,700 acres of beach, sand dunes and 500 species of plants, including cypress, live oak and Spanish moss. Open from 8 A.M. to dusk; the visitor's center is open from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission is $2 a car on weekdays, and $3 on weekends and holidays.
Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, 4005 Sandpiper Road, (804) 721-2412, and adjacent False Cape State Park, 4001 Sandpiper Road, (804) 426-7128, are remote refuges for migratory birds and other wildlife. Back Bay has dunes, marsh and woodlands. It is open from sunrise to sunset, with the visitor center open Monday through Friday from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., and Saturday and Sunday 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $4 a car, $2 for those biking or walking. False Cape, a barrier spit separating Back Bay and the ocean, has six miles of undisturbed beach and maritime forest. It is accessible by hiking or biking through five miles of the Back Bay refuge.
The area's natural resources are brought together in the Virginia Marine Science Museum, 717 General Booth Boulevard, (804) 437-4949. Most of the $35 million expansion is open, tripling the size and adding a 300,000-gallon deep-sea aquarium with sharks, a salt marsh preserve and an IMAX theater showing "Into the Deep." The museum is open 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. daily through Labor Day, until 5 P.M. thereafter. Combination admission to the museum and theater is $10.95, $9.95 for children.
Fort Story, an Army base on historic Cape Henry, features the First Landing Cross, a granite memorial to the cross erected by the Jamestown settlers when they first made landfall on April 26, 1607. Nearby is also a monument to the Battle of the Capes, a naval battle that helped end the Revolutionary War. Also in Fort Story is the 1791 Old Cape Henry Lighthouse, (804) 422-9421. Open daily 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. through October. Admission $2, $1 for children.
Historic homes in the area include the Adam Thoroughgood House, 1636 Parrish Road, (804) 664-6283. Built around 1636, the four-room farmhouse is one of the oldest brick homes in the country. The house and grounds have been restored with 17th-century furnishings and landscaping. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., and Sunday, noon to 5 P.M.; cost is $3, $1.50 for students.

 
 
Where to Stay
 Ambassador Suites, 2315 Atlantic Avenue, (804) 428-1111, fax (804) 437-1854, has 54 two-room oceanfront suites with full kitchens in the heart of the strip. There's a heated pool on the fourth-floor sun deck. Doubles are $135 to $149 in August, $169 for Labor Day weekend and $69 to $89 in September.
Also in the middle of the action is the Breakers Resort Inn, on the oceanfront at 16th Street; (800) 237-7532, fax (804) 422-9602. Its 56 rooms include two-room suites, and all rooms have balconies overlooking the ocean. Rates of $120 to $165 through Labor Day weekend and $75 to $115 in September include use of bicycles.
Budget: The Best Western Beach Quarters Inn, 300 Atlantic Avenue, (804) 437-1200, fax (804) 437-1981, features 52 newly renovated rooms and efficiencies at the south end of the oceanfront, near Rudee Inlet and not far from Croatan Beach. Doubles are $65 to $99 through Labor Day weekend, $30 to $65 after.
Idlewhyle, 2705 Atlantic Avenue, (800) 348-7263, fax (804) 425-5355, is a small, economical 46-room hotel that says it is in the European tradition -- meaning cozy, private and economical. Doubles run $80 to $90, increase slightly for Labor Day weekend, then drop to $55 to $65.
Luxury: For something different, with a bit of history and local color, you may want to try the Cavalier on the Hill, on the oceanfront at 42d Street; (800) 446-8199, fax (804) 428-7957, the grand old lady of Virginia Beach hotels. Built in 1927, it has played host to guests such as F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Bob Hope and Richard Nixon. It has indoor and outdoor pools and a private beach. Doubles run $99 to $189 through Sept. 9, and then drop to $69 to $99. The Cavalier also operates a newer hotel, just across the street on the beach. Rates are $165 to $185, then $95 to $115. All 400 rooms in both hotels include full buffet breakfast.
The Ramada Plaza Resort, at 57th Street, (800) 365-3032, fax (804) 428-2921, is in the quiet North End of the oceanfront. Some of its 215 rooms have a microwave and refrigerator, and amenities include an indoor-outdoor pool, exercise room and swim-up bar. Weekend rates for doubles run from $150 to $175 through Labor Day weekend, with weekday rates about $40 less. Post-Labor Day rates are $100 to $110.

 
 
Where to Eat
 A taste of old Virginia Beach can be found at Steinhilber's Thalia Acres Inn, off the beaten track at 653 Thalia Road, (804) 340-1156. Run by the same family since 1939, Steiny's is a mix of rustic summer-camp ambiance, white-jacketed waiters and excellent fish and seafood. Indoor and outdoor dining offer views of the Lynnhaven River. A dinner for two of jumbo fried shrimp and crabcake, with wine, runs about $55.
Pasta e Pani, not far from the oceanfront at 1069 Laskin Road, (804) 428-2299, has eclectic Italian fare -- mostly pasta, with some veal dishes -- prepared by a Neapolitan family. Specialties include a lemon and basil pasta with shrimp, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes and a black-pepper pasta with Italian bacon, mushrooms and shallots over a bed of steamed spinach. Those two entrees, with wine, cost about $40.
Ocean Eddie's Pier House Seafood, (804) 425-7742, on the Virginia Beach Fishing Pier at 15th Street, has been a beach institution for 46 years. The extensive menu offers mostly seafood. Large broiled mushrooms stuffed with crab, shrimp and scallops and a platter of the fresh catch, clams, mussels, crab and shrimp, plus frozen daiquiris, runs about $40.
Tautogs Restaurant, 205 23d Street, (804) 422-0081, is housed in a beach cottage built in 1926. Its casual atmosphere and fish and seafood have made it a popular spot since it opened a year ago.

HEADLINE: The View From: Waterbury;
Pride in State and Family, Trying for a Sound Economic Base

BYLINE: By PEGGY McCARTHY 

 BODY:
WHEN he was a boy, Henry R. (Hank) Paine had a babysitter who was also the switchboard operator in his family's business, the Howland-Hughes department store in downtown Waterbury. He sat next to her while his grandfather and father ran the business and he learned to operate the switchboard.
Mr. Paine's first job in the store at age 16 was as a packer in the toy department. He was promoted to elevator operator. Then, he worked in the business office auditing sales receipts. 
 He eventually took over the place in 1990 at the age of 39 after his father, Morris Paine, died. It was a tough time for downtown department stores. Many had already shut their doors for good. But Mr. Paine, with his family legacy to uphold, did all he could think of to keep the store open. He added new lines of merchandise to attract a younger crowd, renovated the third floor for a housewares section modeled after Macy's Cellar, changed lighting, advertised heavily, sent buses to Southbury to transport customers. He also opened a second store in Torrington. But it failed.
"We were getting beaten up big time. There was nothing we hadn't tried," said Mr. Paine, who is known as Hank.
This year, Mr. Paine sold off the inventory of Howland-Hughes, which has been in business for 106 years. But, he didn't close the store. He couldn't. His grandfather and father, he explained, "put their lives into this place."
"I may blow it," he said, "but we're just not going to roll over dead, either."
So he tried a new strategy. Howland-Hughes is now only selling products that are manufactured in Connecticut. Grandfather clocks. Mattresses. Shaker-style and wrought-iron furniture. Window shades. Dolls and doll houses. Virgin wool blankets. Cotton sweaters. Neckties. Gold-plated buttons and collectors' items like Civil War uniform buttons. Wood-carved birds. Painted, wooden shapes of Connecticut buildings. Books by Connecticut authors and Connecticut publishers. Paintings by Connecticut artists. Pewter and glass giftware. American flags. Wiffle balls and bats. Pez candy. Chocolate. Among other things. More than 110 Connecticut manufacturers, authors and artists are represented.
Mr. Paine said he took this tack because he sees tremendous potential. "The economic possibilities of 'Made in Connecticut' are enormous. Simply enormous," he said, explaining that Connecticut residents spend more than $30 billion a year on consumer goods. He said if he gets a small fraction of it, it helps him and Connecticut manufacturers by creating a demand for their goods and helping to keep jobs in the state. "You create the best economic development package imaginable," he said.
The store now goes by three names: Howland-Hughes, The Connecticut Store and Made in Connecticut. Mr. Paine uses them interchangeably or sometimes in combination. The Waterbury folks know the old name. But to attract new customers, he uses one of the new handles.
Mr. Paine still has problems. His store remains in the same location. If he had trouble getting people to his big department store, it has been more difficult getting customers for his specialty store. "The number of people walking through the doors is less than it was a year ago," he admitted.
The encouraging news, he said, is that people who do shop there usually buy something. Mr. Paine said his challenge is to get them to return and to attract more of them.
He is trying. He conducts events like book signings, entertainment, demonstrations, art shows and exhibitions, hoping to introduce people to the store and get them hooked so they will come back.
Meanwhile, Mr. Paine has reopened the store restaurant on the basement level. It's a soup and sandwich place with stools at a counter.
He is renting out the rest of the basement, the former boys' department, to an antiquarian book store.
He originally opened a Connecticut department in his store about four years ago. He recalled that the first products he offered were brass napkin rings for $29.99 a pair that he asked a local manufacturer to make. He offered them first to Howland-Hughes charge customers and had an employee personally deliver the first pair that was ordered. The customer liked them so much, she immediately bought another four pairs.
Then, Mr. Paine discovered that many American flags being sold were made in Korea. He got a Connecticut manufacturer to make them.
Mr. Paine doesn't want to get caught in an embarrassing position. He makes sure that all his inventory is, indeed, made in Connecticut. He visits factories of companies he isn't familiar with. He admitted that the "clock works" in his grandfather clocks are made overseas because, he said, they aren't made in the United States at all anymore. But more than 50 percent of each clock -- their cases, glass and bases -- are made in Farmington by the New England Clock Company.
He keeps up the search for products from the state that he hasn't heard of. Sometimes, he's had to go across state lines to obtain Connecticut products. One of his buyers made a deal with a Waterbury company at a Las Vegas trade show. He learned about another Connecticut company at a Chicago trade show.
The store has a museum look about it, with items neatly displayed in categories in glass cases, on tables and along walls. A museum was once part of the plan for Howland-Hughes. Mr. Paine entered a contest conducted by the State Department of Economic Development three years ago offering state bonding for innovative products. His plan was a "Smithsonian-like" museum featuring Connecticut manufacturing. He won the competition.
He dismantled the furniture department on the store's second floor to make way for the museum and started renovations, spending $174,312, he said. But state budget cuts thwarted his plan. He never received any state money. The museum project was aborted.
Mr. Paine keeps plugging. "There's one guy I answer to. That's my Dad. One day, I'm going to meet him. He's going to be standing next to my Granddad. I want that to be a happy reunion," he said.

If Robby the Robot Had Little Brothers . . .

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
IN 1981, Matthew Wyse, then a 42-year-old book dealer, came across a wind-up tin robot from the 1950's at a collectibles show. He was so transfixed by the vivid green and orange toy robot, which looked like a blank-eyed Martian, that he willingly paid $12 for it. "The price seemed high to me at the time," he said. "So I didn't tell my wife, Karen, what I'd paid for it." He quickly discovered that the robot, called the Interplanetary Explorer Spaceman, was worth about $1,000.
Over the next 15 years, buying at toy fairs and collectibles shows as well as from dealers, Mr. Wyse specialized in the kind of tin robots, most of them six to eight inches tall, that were made in the 50's and 60's. But recently, he decided that he had gone about as far as he could go with robots and turned his attention to rare books. "There were about six important pieces I didn't have," he said of the robots. "And in the last few years, no dealer could produce them. That caused me to lose interest. It was time to sell." 
 As a result, he sent his collection of 250 robots to Sotheby's in Manhattan, where it comes up for bidding on Nov. 7; the auction is expected to total $350,000 to $500,000, said Mark Bergin, who is in charge of the sale. Mr. Bergin, a toy dealer in Peterborough, N.H., had sold Mr. Wyse many of his most important robots.
"As a boy I had collected toy soldiers but never toy robots; they didn't exist yet," Mr. Wyse, 57, said. "When the Japanese started production in 1955, I was 17 and past the age for toys. But I read science fiction and was a fan of such films."
The word robot was coined by the Czech writer Karel Capek, in his 1920 satirical play "R. U. R." (which stands for "Rossum's Universal Robots") and is derived from robota, the Czech word for forced labor. But it was the Japanese who led the way in transforming robots into mass-produced toys. And no wonder: they resembled Shogun warriors, recalled the fire-eating monster Godzilla and were the sort of complex gadgets at which the Japanese excelled. There was also an economic incentive. "Japanese manufacturers needed something to export that would bring them dollars," said W. H. Bailey, a former dealer who stocked the 1950's toy robots at his Manhattan shop Mythology when the current wave of collecting began in the 1970's.
"The Japanese made them with the Heinz 57 variety tin cans they picked up off the street that had been left during the American Occupation," he added. "They cut them up, reassembled them by hand and worked out a way to stamp them and spray-paint them. Robots were an export item. Nobody in Japan could afford them."
But recently, Mr. Wyse said, dealers and collectors had identified robots that were made exclusively for the Japanese. The one he acquired was a walking robot with sparkling eyes and a cone-shaped head. He paid only $3,000 for it, in part, because it came without its original box. With the box, as with most such toys, the robot would probably have cost twice as much.
These days, collectors are paying some of the highest prices for five giant robots that are known collectively in the trade as the Gang of Five. Made for export by Masudaya in the 1950's, they are about 15 inches tall and are depicted wearing long robes. Each had its own name imprinted either on the box or the figure itself: Target Robot, Giant Sonic Robot, Radicon, Lavender Robot and Machine Man.
The rarest of these toys, Machine Man, first attracted collectors in the late 1980's. Only one was known at the time, but since then several others have come to light, including one Mr. Wyse bought last year. While he refused to say how much he paid for it, he said it was the most expensive robot he had ever bought. Mr. Bergin, who sold it to Mr. Wyse, said he knew of several private sales of robots for more than $20,000 each. Sotheby's expects Mr. Wyse's Machine Man, the first ever auctioned, will bring $30,000 to $50,000.
The record for a toy robot was set at Christie's in New York in 1989, when the first large collection was auctioned. In that sale, a 1950's Thunder Robot, which looks like Mr. Potato Head with a propeller on top of its huge head, brought $9,020. Because parts have been repainted and repaired, the one in Mr. Wyse's collection is not in mint condition. Sotheby's expects it will bring, at most, $2,500.
Mr. Wyse had always felt his Thunder Robot was one of his most attractive and was surprised to learn that it had been altered. "I was amazed to discover how much secret restoration goes on in this field," he said.
MOST OF HIS COLLECTING took place while he was still active in the book businesses he had founded in the San Francisco Bay Area: the Pegasus-Pendragon chain of bookstores and Western Book Distributors. He sold both in the 1990's and now buys and sells rare books. "I'm going to miss these robots," Mr. Wyse said. "I used to line them up on the mantelpiece, 8 inches deep, 18 feet across, marching. Our guests were totally knocked out by the robots."

HEADLINE: Bond Issue Could Send Millions To Island

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
IN 1990 New Yorkers rejected a $1.9 billion environmental bond act in a move that suggested that voters had limits to what they would pay for environmental programs, particularly in a recession.
Now, in an improved if not vibrant economy, Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed a $1.75 billion bond act that would provide hundreds of millions of dollars for Long Island. 
 Environmental and civic groups are lining up to support the bond issue, along with other groups in the state.
Mindful of the defeat in 1990, some groups have agreed on a $2 million campaign to promote the bond act, which will appear as on the ballot as a proposition for the Clean Water, Clean Air Bond Act.
If the bonds are approved, it would be the first time that voters have endorsed major borrowing for environmental projects since 1986.
Backers said they would make special efforts upstate, where opposition doomed the 1990 referendum, despite approval on Long Island and in New York City. The act's emphasis on governmental acquisition of land in the Adirondacks and elsewhere proved unpopular upstate.
In November, as in 1990, strong support for environmental initiatives on Long Island will be pivotal. Backers said the new proposal was carefully balanced, specific and directed at water and air programs that are likely to meet less opposition elsewhere than the proposal that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo offered in 1990.
But few people predict victory.
"This one has a better chance, but it's still not going to be easy," the president of the Long Island Association, Matthew T. Crosson, said. "People's instinctive reaction is to vote against a bond act because they don't want to spend the money."
The executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, Richard L. Amper Jr., said the chances may be enhanced because it was Mr. Pataki who had proposed the bond issue. "The Governor wisely points out that he is a fiscal conservative and may be better trusted by the voters than was Mario Cuomo," said Mr. Amper.
Education was essential to have voters approve the bonds, he added, saying, "Less than 40 percent of voters who vote in a general election vote on a proposition at all, because they don't know the issues."
The bonds would include $200 million to help clean up Long Island Sound, $30 million to be divided between the Peconic and South Shore estuaries for planning and cleanup and $150 million to acquire land statewide to protect drinking water or provide access to water. Part of that money would be available to buy land in the Long Island pine barrens, the largest reserve of drinking water in the region.
The Island would also share in $100 million for parks and historic preservation; $355 million to upgrade water supplies and assist local governments in meeting water standards; $230 million for work on the air that would include $125 million for activities like replacing coal-fired boilers in schools and $50 million for recycling programs.
The state would appropriate $200 million for so-called brownfields projects that recycle abandoned industrial sites.
The organizations backing the plan include the Nature Conservancy, the Pine Barrens Society, the Group for the South Fork and the New York League of Conservation Voters.
The Long Island Association, and builders' groups, including the Association for a Better Long Island and the Long Island Builders Institute, are also supporters.
Other backers include the Suffolk County Water Authority, the largest supplier of ground water in the county, and the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
"It means an awful lot of work for us," the president of the council, John M. Kennedy, said.
Advocates of the bond issue plan to emphasize that coastal cleanups, sewage-plant upgrades, pine barrens protection and rural preservation are vital to economic well-being and have to be carried out before costs rise.
"This bond act is the only practical way to address the most significant environmental issues that the state confronts," Mr. Crosson said. "To maintain the quality of life here is important to the economy."
"This is funding not just for open space, but for cleaning up water and taking care of solid waste," the president of the Group for the South Fork, Robert S. DeLuca, said. "That means jobs and a lot of traditional economic reasons for supporting this. What's good about a bond act is that you can get public support behind it, and it bodes well for a lot of other environmental issues around the state. It will help people to focus on the environment."
"This is a wonderful opportunity to do a lot of cleanup and land preservation," said Stuart R. Lowrie of the Nature Conservancy, who is also director of the Peconic Bioreserve. Mr. Lowrie said that the reserve, in a national estuary program like Long Island Sound, could use its proceeds from the bonds for a plan to protect the bays. He said the money could also pay to acquire land in the Peconic River headwaters.
The chairman of the citizens' advisory council of the South Shore Estuary Reserve Council, Jeffrey D. Fullmer, said bond money could be used to ease the runoff of storm water and other problems that pollute South Shore Bays. Moriches, Shinnecock and Great South Bay are in the estuary. Mr. Fullmer said contaminants could be reduced by sending runoff into recharge basins.
Mr. Fullmer, who is also program director for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said that group was campaigning to promote awareness of the bond proposal.
A large part of the $200,000 earmarked for Long Island Sound would be used to upgrade sewage plants.
A nine-year study by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and New York and Connecticut found that the most serious threat to marine life and water quality was hypoxia, or a low level of dissolved oxygen, caused by excessive nitrates. The nitrates, from treated sewage, stimulate algal growth. When algae decompose they consume oxygen, killing off or repelling other marine life.
The executive director of the Long Island Sound Office of the E.P.A. in Stamford, Conn., Carolyn J. Hughes, said the $200 million would be a down payment of New York's share of a 15-year $5.5 billion cleanup of the Sound that the study had recommended. "It would go a long way toward helping New York meet its obligations," said Ms. Hughes.
The head of the E.P.A., Carol Browner, and the Governors of New York and Connecticut signed an agreement in 1994 to carry out the plan.
Ms. Hughes said that part of the money could be used to restore damaged wetlands and that such work had been accomplished in Connecticut.
Some political leaders withheld support.
Alan F. Eysen a spokesman for the Republican leader in Suffolk, John Powell, said Mr. Powell was analyzing the proposal to see if it provided adequately for pine barrens preservation. Mr. Eysen said Mr. Powell was "generally supportive of the concept," but would not give his endorsement until his questions on the pine barrens had been answered.
Mr. Amper said the proposal assured that the state would meet a pledge to continue spending $10 million a year to acquire land and conduct other measures to protect the area. Last week the society gave Mr. Pataki an award for "his actions on the pine barrens and for the bond act proposal," Mr. Amper said.
In Nassau County, David A. Vieser, a spokesman for County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, said Mr. Gulotta was studying the proposal.
The plan reflects compromises between Mr. Pataki, a Republican, and the Assembly, which the Democrats control.
In Suffolk, where voters have supported spending for farm land, open space, pine barrens and other environmental programs for 25 years, the proposal will share the ballot with other propositions.
County voters will decide whether they agree with the Pine Barrens Society and other groups that an anticipated $55 million surplus in a protection program be used exclusively for acquisition and protection in the region.
The proposition is the first by citizens' groups under the county's initiative and referendum law. The sponsors have contended that the Republican majority in the County Legislature and Mr. Gaffney, also a Republican, had raided the program by transferring $25 million to the general fund.
The citizens' groups said that when voters overwhelmingly approved the program in referendums in 1987 and 1988 they never intended that large amounts of money be used for property-tax relief. The program, which ends in the year 2000, is financed by revenues from a county sales tax.
County legislators who supported the property-tax relief said voters in western Suffolk would not have backed the referendums if they did not include tax relief and financing for environmental programs in the four western towns. The barrens are in Brookhaven, Southampton and Riverhead in eastern Suffolk.
A competing proposition, billed as a compromise by its supporters in the County Legislature and signed by Mr. Gaffney, would stipulate that $32 million of the anticipated $55 million be used for acquisitions in the barrens. It would earmark $19 million to buy land and run environmental programs in Islip, Babylon, Huntington, Smithtown and Shelter Island, the six towns that have received the least from the sales-tax revenues. The remaining $4 million would be to maintain county parks.
Mr. Gaffney vetoed a resolution that would have placed a third proposition on the ballot. The plan would have designated the entire $55 million surplus for property-tax relief.
"The thought was that by giving the voters a Chinese menu we would get some kind of definitive statement from them about how the money should be allocated," the counsel to the Legislature, Paul Sabatino, said. "With the veto, you are not going to get a true measure of public opinion."
The sponsor of the third proposition, Legislator Michael D'Andre, Republican of Smithtown, said the veto had shocked and surprised him, but could not summon the 14 votes to override it. "It denies people a choice," Mr. D'Andre said. "It would be an opportunity for them to vote on how their money is spent. I would live with whatever the people say."
"The people have already expressed their choice, twice," Mr. Amper said, referring to the 1987 and 1988 votes. He added that a minimum of $40 million of the surplus was needed to protect the pine barrens. "Everybody agreed that if they could guarantee $40 million we could all back a legislative referendum," he said. "But the County Executive has not done that. So we are all proceeding to win approval for the citizens' referendum."
Environmental questions will also be on the ballot in three East End towns. In Southampton, voters will decide on a $5 million bond act that would have $3 million to buy open space and $2 million to preserve farmland.
In East Hampton a $5 million bond proposal would finance the buying of wetlands, open space and water-protection areas. The money could also buy development rights to preserve farmland. A $2 million bond to buy farmland development rights will also be on the ballot in the Town of Southold. Riverhead plans a similar $2 million bond proposal.

A New Time For Mexico
By Carlos Fuentes.
Translated by Marina Gutman Castaneda and the author.
216 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22.
Carlos Fuentes is many things: a diplomat and self-described "transopolitan" who wears Savile Row suits and didn't live in Mexico until he was 16; a "leftist" who was banned from entry into the United States under the McCarran-Walter Act during the 1960's but who, inside Mexico, is regularly derided for his gringo mentality; an accomplished novelist who is perennially nominated for the Nobel Prize; and, finally, an interpreter of Mexico to the United States and of the United States to Mexico. 
 "A New Time for Mexico," Mr. Fuentes's latest collection of essays, reveals the author in interpreter mode, and even though it contains several chapters that leave the impression of having been included only to pad out a thin manuscript, it is, at its heart, an insightful and often brilliant reflection on Mexican governance and the daunting problems the nation faces today.
Mr. Fuentes argues that Mexico's strength lies in its racial and cultural diversity, but adds that this diversity was suppressed until the 1910 Revolution. During the Revolution, the Government not only distributed land to Mexico's poor and eliminated the institutions of caste, but also allowed the country to acknowledge, for the first time, the complexity of its Indian, black and Spanish heritage.
Still, Mr. Fuentes continues, a centralizing, authoritarian legacy bequeathed by both the Aztecs and the Spanish existed in opposition to the liberating effects of the Revolution. This legacy was magnified over the centuries by a tradition of governing according to the tenets of scholasticism -- a school of thought associated with Thomas Aquinas -- which postulates the idea that the common good is greater and more important than the rights of individuals. Although this autocratic philosophy was part of the world rejected by the Revolution, Mr. Fuentes contends that between 1920 and 1940, when the Revolution consolidated itself into the present ruling party -- the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI -- it essentially adapted Mexico's Thomist traditions for its own ends.
The postrevolutionary Government was, according to Mr. Fuentes, a regime that managed to be at once authoritarian and progressive. Presidents were granted autocratic powers, but only for six-year terms, and the Government itself became a kind of Thomist hierarchy through which people fulfilled themselves.
This system worked well as long as the Government lived up to its implicit pact with the Mexican people to guarantee peace, stability and a broad-based prosperity. But after the presidency of Lazaro Cardenas (1934-40), and more particularly after the Mexican Government's massacre of students in Tlatelolco Square during the Olympic year of 1968, the ruling party became, in Mr. Fuentes's opinion, increasingly self-serving. A series of incompetent, greedy and corrupt presidents led Mexico to its current financial straits.
At the present time, however, Mr. Fuentes is concerned about what he sees as a greater problem. During the hundred years or so after independence from Spain and before the Revolution, Mexico, he argues, went through a period when its leadership developed an "extralogical" obsession with French, British and American forms of government. Particularly during the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz, this outlook enabled the Mexican Government to dismiss its Thomist sense of obligation to its citizenry and allowed the ruling clique to enrich itself at the expense of the general population. Mr. Fuentes sees this dynamic echoed in Mexico's present leadership, many of whom, he notes, are graduates of Ivy League and Eastern colleges who have "centered their lives on the New York Stock Exchange." He is not particularly fond of the new President, Ernesto Zedillo, whose "lean and hungry look" he associates with the "trenchant consistency of the Anglo-American conservatives." The previous President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, does not fare much better. While Mr. Fuentes concedes that Mr. Salinas tamed inflation and managed the debt, he alludes to Mr. Salinas's economic policies as "archaic, savage capitalism, concentrating wealth in a minority and waiting for the impossible miracle of trickle-down."
Although Mr. Fuentes approves of the North American Free Trade Agreement in theory, because he feels it is important for Mexico to open up to the world, he disapproves of the specifics, which he says are rooted in the "gospel preached . . . by Reagan and Thatcher." Nafta, Mr. Fuentes declares, is collapsing the Mexican economy without creating the conditions for new investment, and he fears that United States loans to Mexico will be used as a means of compromising Mexico's sovereignty.
Mr. Fuentes's solutions run to the social democratic. He speaks of the need for an open government, for checks and balances, for redesigning loans so that foreign money has to stay in Mexico and can be invested productively. It's hard to fault Mr. Fuentes for any of these eminently sensible ideas, but it's also hard to take them too seriously. Mr. Fuentes is like a good dinner guest. He is articulate, charming, erudite and clever, but his proposed solution to everything seems to be to convene men of good will. The question is, can this approach address the depth of Mexico's problems today?
Mr. Fuentes hints darkly that Luis Donaldo Colosio, the assassinated PRI presidential candidate (with whom the author reveals himself to have been quite close), was killed by what he calls the dinosaur wing of the PRI because he was outspokenly intent on reforming a Government whose interests extended to wide-scale drug trafficking and money laundering. Yet nowhere, beyond a "Jurassic Park" joke or two, does Mr. Fuentes address the critical issue of the effects of the drug trade on Mexican politics.
Mr. Fuentes includes, in this collection, the diaries he kept during the traumatic years of 1994 and 1995. Toward the middle of 1994, he mentions an invitation he received from the guerrilla leader Subcommander Marcos to take part in Mr. Marcos's "National Democratic Convention." It is briefly amusing to hear Mr. Marcos and Mr. Fuentes trading oracular pronouncements as if they were on an episode of "Star Trek." But after a while you want Mr. Fuentes to get on with it, to go to the convention and tell us what it's like. He never does.

These books illustrate what deserves to be called the Buchanan strain in American foreign policy. Not Pat Buchanan, but Tom and Daisy, F. Scott Fitzgerald's careless couple who "smashed up things and then retreated back into their money . . . and let other people clean up the mess they had made." For upward of four decades, the United States fought covertly or overtly against Communists and their clients around the globe, often arming anomalous partners in the name of freedom. When the cold war ended, America declared victory and pleaded new priorities, leaving the mess in Asia, Africa and Central America for others to deal with. 
 A famous proxy victory was won in Afghanistan, the rugged, remote and fractious country that the Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to rescue an imperiled Marxist ally. In February 1989 the last Russian left, thereby ending a catastrophic war that claimed a million lives and displaced a third of the population. Nevertheless, seven years after the Russian withdrawal, fighting continues in Afghanistan among a dozen factions using weapons supplied by former foreign patrons.
In Washington, meantime, passionate engagement has yielded to baffled fatalism. The "freedom fighters" who were once lauded by three Presidents and a near-unanimous Congress are now discovered to be infected by Ancient Hatreds, that vague, useful and unthreatening adversary that has supplanted the Evil Empire. Three recent books expose the inadequacy, to use the mildest term, of that shameless denial.
Diego Cordovez, an Ecuadorean, was the principal United Nations negotiator of the Geneva accords that brought about the Soviet withdrawal. His collaborator on "Out of Afghanistan" is Selig S. Harrison, a Washington-based specialist in Asian politics. The authors take the story forward in alternating chapters, with unavoidable repetitions and, in Mr. Cordovez's case, a bit too much tittle-tattle about diplomatic wining and dining. Yet their narrative is an invaluable complement to "The Fragmentation of Afghanistan" and its sequel, "The Search for Peace in Afghanistan," by Barnett R. Rubin, an American scholar who worked in the field as a human rights monitor.
Mr. Rubin is excellent in sketching the peculiarities of Afghan history. Unlike India or the nearby Islamic emirates in Russian Turkestan, Afghanistan avoided colonial rule in the 19th century. Its unwelcoming mountains and passes were guarded by fierce tribal peoples whose rivalries ceased when meddling foreigners appeared. Victorian Britain twice invaded Afghanistan, and twice found it could not hold and rule Kabul. The pragmatic result was a modus vivendi in which Britain and czarist Russia agreed to treat Afghanistan as a nonaligned buffer state. This arrangement held under Stalin, who maintained correct relations with the Afghan king, even sparing him from a Moscow-inspired Communist Party. Not until 1965, when the Soviets moved aggressively toward the third world, was an Afghan party founded.
Mr. Rubin's thesis, which seems to me plausible, is that in preserving its independence during the imperial era, Afghanistan also preserved a traditionalist tribal society that might have otherwise been modified by a centralizing colonial government. But the coming of the cold war, combined with the emergence in 1947 of an independent India and Pakistan, undermined the old equilibrium. Everybody seemed to have claims and interests in Afghanistan. Moscow, Washington and other donors, notably Iran and gulf Arabs, financed roads, arms sales and schools, so that foreign aid soon accounted for 40 percent of the national budget. In 1973, Afghan Communists joined with left-wing officers to oust the king and found a republic. This was followed in five years by a Communist coup led by the fanatic Khalq faction, whose leader, Hafizullah Amin, duly engaged in mass arrests, purges and torture on a scale equaled only by the cruelest emirs in centuries past.
The result was widespread resistance and a disintegrating army. In Moscow, Kremlin hard-liners like Mikhail Suslov argued that the collapse of the Afghan revolution would imperil Communist regimes everywhere. On Dec. 24, 1979, the first Soviet airborne forces landed in Kabul. Three days later, the Soviets executed Amin, replacing him as party leader with Babrak Karmal, a Brezhnev favorite who returned from exile with the invaders. An operation so brazen, in a country so hostile and xenophobic, was doomed from the outset.
In Washington, Jimmy Carter found overwhelming support in Congress for covert aid to seven resistance groups based in Pakistan, their politics ranging from secular democratic to Islamic fundamentalist. But in order to preserve deniability, this covert aid was distributed by the military intelligence service of Pakistan, whose leadership had its own Afghan agenda. It thus developed that the single biggest beneficiary of American help was the group led by Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, a violent Islamic extremist of a type generically described as "bearded engineers": university trained, supremely intolerant and viscerally anti-American. On the evidence of these books, Mr. Hikmatyar was also a drug smuggler, counterfeiter, murderer and unscrupulous intriguer.
This was our man in Afghanistan because Pakistan wanted an Islamic fundamentalist regime in Kabul. As the United Nations negotiator, Mr. Cordovez found that Pakistan was the biggest obstacle to peace after Mikhail Gorbachev began signaling his wish for a Soviet pullout. Mr. Cordovez pressed vainly for the creation of a transition regime headed by the deposed Afghan monarch, Zahir Shah, then living in exile in Rome. The King was willing, and a poll taken by the respected Afghan writer and poet Sayd Majrooh showed that Afghan refugees in Pakistan overwhelmingly preferred Zahir Shah to any resistance leader. After he published this survey in February 1988, Majrooh was assassinated with American-supplied weapons at the orders, so Mr. Rubin and others generally believe, of Mr. Hikmatyar.
But the greater moral and political failure lay in Washington, not Islamabad. On the evidence of these volumes, Islamic fundamentalists were not taken seriously by the Reagan White House. Speaking to Mr. Harrison, Caspar W. Weinberger, Mr. Reagan's Secretary of Defense, admitted that "we knew they were not very nice people," but "we had this terrible problem of making choices." It is the immemorial voice of Tom and Daisy Buchanan.
Washington believed that once the Russians withdrew, everything would fall swiftly into place. Hence the opposition to any transition regime. And hence, worst of all, the American decision to move the goalposts at Geneva in 1988.
Before the peace conference, Washington had agreed to stop sending arms if the Russians went home. But at Geneva, sniffing a deal and Mr. Gorbachev's desperation, American negotiators switched from "negative" to "positive symmetry," that is, letting all sides continue to arm their respective allies. Belatedly, by that time the Bush Administration had decreed that no weapons paid for with its funds would go to Mr. Hikmatyar. But it made no difference. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia continued to shower arms on the fundamentalists.
Viewing the melancholy wreckage, Mr. Rubin remarks that if the United States and its allies won the cold war, no ally paid more for this goal than the people of Afghanistan: "The maneuvers of party leaders may inspire cynicism or repulsion, but millions of unknown people sacrificed their homes, their land, their cattle, their health, their families and their lives, with barely a hope of success or reward, at least in this world." If any member of Congress in the large mujahedeen cheerleading brigade has raised his or her voice in favor of generous economic assistance and a vigorous peacemaking diplomacy in behalf of the Afghan people, it has escaped notice.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/'97 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP vs. '96 Ford Taurus SHO;
Have Muscle, Will Travel: 2 New Ways to Play With Power

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich.

 BODY:
MY first moments behind the wheel of a 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP were on my frequently traveled route to the video store and dry cleaners. After a long wait at a congested intersection, I spotted a slight opening in the steady stream of cars, punched the gas pedal and quickly made a left turn.
The tires squealed wildly for what seemed an eternity. Feeling embarrassed and irresponsible with my two young children in the sedan, I looked around to see if any bystanders had noticed. 
 I hadn't meant to burn rubber.
Arriving in dealerships now, the GTP is among the first of Pontiac's redesigned Grand Prix models to reach the market. The new Pontiacs -- both coupes and sedans -- are the first of General Motors' new midsize cars to go on sale for 1997.
Having been roundly criticized in the past for its look-alike cars, G.M. has now attempted to give each of its midsize models a distinctive look and personality. The Grand Prix, with its muscular, athletic physique, is intended to appeal to driving enthusiasts who want spirited performance and notice-me styling, but who need a roomy interior for family or friends.
Although the Grand Prix name has been worn on a variety of models, both sporting and boring, its glory days were the muscle-car era of the 1960's, when Pontiac basked in its "wide track" image. That image was born with the 1959 model year, when Pontiac widened the track of its cars by nearly five inches to distinguish them from their G.M. counterparts. The cars were a hit, and the advertising theme stuck for many years.
Now it has been resurrected for 1997. The new track of the Grand Prix is two inches wider than the previous model, making it 61.7 inches wide. The car's appearance is aggressive and powerful. And Pontiac may have yet another hit on its hands.
The screaming-red '97 GTP shared my driveway with a burgundy '96 Ford Taurus SHO that I was also test-driving, and the boys on in-line skates in my neighborhood unanimously picked the Pontiac as the coolest of the two. They were not alone. During a week at the wheels of both cars, the GTP got second looks and thumbs-up from boys of all ages, while the SHO earned only an occasional sideways glance.
And looks proved not to be deceiving. Acceleration from the 240-horsepower supercharged version of G.M.'s venerable 3.8-liter V6 engine, which comes with the GTP package, is every bit as quick as the car's sleek styling suggests. It takes fewer than seven seconds to roar from 0 to 60 miles an hour. (A nonsupercharged version of the same 3.8-liter V6, producing 195 horsepower, is standard on up-level GT models and available on the family-style SE sedan. A 3.1-liter V6, available beginning in January, will serve as the base engine.)
Braking, often a complaint I have with G.M. cars, was extremely good. While handling was acceptable, my main complaint with the Grand Prix was that the rear of the car readily twitched sideways when driven fast over rough pavement.
The message that the Grand Prix is a vehicle for driving enthusiasts is carried over to the interior, which has a cockpit-style layout. A heads-up display projects the car's rate of speed and other information like a hologram suspended in space outside the windshield, reinforcing the jet-fighter image. A driver information center on the upper part of the center dash features a boost gauge for the supercharger. In addition to the usual information provided on these centers, like average fuel economy and driving range, or doors or trunk ajar, it also tells the driver if the tire pressure is low, and specifically in which tire.
Pontiac, however, should add a dead pedal where the driver can rest the left foot, a feature that would be appropriate in a sporty car like the Grand Prix. Pontiac might also consider a different seat material. Tiny threads poking through the perforations of the leather seats, like the stubble of 5 o'clock shadow, gave the seats a cheap look. Bolts protruding too far out from the wheels likewise gave the GTP an unfinished appearance.
Even though this is a car for driving enthusiasts, the enthusiasts' families have not been ignored. The seat belts have color-coded straps and latches to insure that child-safety seats are installed properly. A built-in child seat is optional for the middle of the back seat. Otherwise, the spot features a pull-down console with cup holders and a pass-through to the surprisingly roomy trunk.
Grand Prix prices start at $19,129 with destination charges; the GTP opens at $22,142. The tested model, fully loaded with the GTP package; an equipment group that included the heads-up display, and individual options like leather seats, premium sound system and a theft alarm totaled $24,526. For driving around town at normal speeds, I concluded that the Grand Prix GTP was a better deal than the V8-powered SHO, which was priced at nearly $30,000.
On the last day of my test of the GTP, I cruised down Wide Track Drive, a thoroughfare here in the car's namesake city. With "Little GTO" blasting from the speakers, I nailed the accelerator, laid a patch of rubber and smiled.
I just had to do it.

INSIDE TRACK: No wolf in sheep's clothing, the GTP is pure wolf.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The interior of the Grand Prix GTP has a cockpit-style layout and a heads-up display that reinforce a jet-fighter image.; The interior of the SHO, like that of every new Taurus, is light and airy. An oval center panel has widely spaced buttons. (Photographs by Peter Yates for The New York Times)

Jazz Enters Litchfield

BYLINE: BY SUSAN PEARSALL 

 BODY:
MENTION the Northwest Hills and most Connecticut residents think of stately Colonial mansions, winding country roads and quaint villages. But jazz? Well yes. Next weekend, the first Litchfield Jazz Festival will take place at White Memorial Conservation Center, a 4,000-acre nature preserve off Route 202.
The festival, sponsored by Litchfield Performing Arts, will include legends like the pianist Ahmad Jamal and the trombonist J. J. Johnson as well as newcomers like the vocalist and pianist Diana Krall and the bassist Christian McBride. Peter McEachern of Goshen and Mario Pavone of New Haven will open the festival on Saturday at 1 P.M. with their sextet's performance. 
 Rounding out the festival's performing groups are the TanaReid Quintet, the Larry Goldings Trio and Terence Blanchard.
Since 1981 the arts group's calendar has generally followed the school year. Last fall, the group's executive director, Vita Muir, said she saw more evidence the time was right for a summer music festival.
"We live in an area that's the second-largest tourist attraction in the state of Connecticut, and it's a summer place," Mrs. Muir said. (Mystic is the state's No. 1 draw.)
Because Litchfield Performing Arts is best known for its classical performance series, Mrs. Muir said, she researched current jazz trends before booking the festival line-up. "I wanted fairly mainstream jazz with a nice edge to it," she said. "I was looking for a balance between icons and up-and-comers." Since agreeing to appear in Litchfield, Mr. McBride has signed to tour with Chick Corea, and Ms. Krall has performed at Carnegie Hall and the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan. Her latest album, "Only for You," has hit the top 10 on the jazz charts. "Krall is a phenomenon," Mrs. Muir said. "Half the people calling are asking what day is she playing." (The answer is Sunday).
The festival will be held rain or shine under a large tent surrounded by extensive lawn seating. "I would hope to attract 3,000 people a day -- 2,000 on the lawn and 1,000 in the tent," Mrs. Muir said. The gates open at 11 A.M. each day. Concerts will begin at 1 P.M. and continue until dusk.
What's the potential for Litchfield to become known for jazz? "I think this is a major festival," said Mr. McEachern, the trombonist who lives in Goshen. "The buzz out there is that it's going to be well attended."
"There's a resurgence in interest in jazz among young people," Mrs. Muir said. "I see it in my own kids. They're playing instruments and listening to jazz records and starting their own jazz bands."
The festival is expected to cost about $100,000. Some $32,000 has been provided by the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, the tourism division of the State Department of Economic Development and corporate sponsors. Ticket sales are expected to make up the difference, Mrs. Muir said.
Saturday's performers include the McEachern/Pavone Sextet, Tana Reid Quintet, Terence Blanchard and Ahmad Jamal.
The sextet's music is similar to that on Mr. Pavone's latest recording, "Song for Septet," named to at least one reviewer's top 10 list for 1994. TanaReid features the drummer Akira Tana and the bassist Rufus Reid, who also plays with J. J. Johnson's Quintet. Movie fans may know Terence Blanchard's trumpet sound from the films "Backbeat" and "Primal Fear." Ahmad Jamal's "But Not for Me" and "Poinciana" are longtime classics.
On Sunday, the organist Larry Goldings will open the festival, followed by Ms. Krall, Mr. Johnson and Mr. McBride.
During the festival, the artist Frank Federico of Goshen will show 20 paintings ranging from near-portrait likenesses to abstract representations of rhythms in jazz. The festival poster is also by him.
Tickets range from $17 for lawn seats to $30-$35 for tent seats. The numbers to call for information are 800-4-PROTIX or 800-593-4446.

HEADLINE: Taking a Hard Look At Filling a Stadium

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
WHEN the Connecticut Tennis Center opened near the Yale Bowl in New Haven five years ago, many residents of the nearby Westville section expressed concern about noise before, during and after projected concerts in the 15,000-seat stadium.
The consensus in the quiet upscale neighborhood on the city's southern tip seemed to be that residents could tolerate a weeklong professional tennis tournament -- which tends to attract a more sedate crowd -- but not the booming beats and raucous crowds at a rock concert. 
 As it turns out, their fears so far have been unfounded. That is because the Connecticut Tennis Center has not had a concert since 1994. Indeed, in the opinion of some, the center is a white elephant that has benefited a tennis promoter but hardly anyone else.
Though it was projected as a multipurpose center when built (with state funds raised in a bond issue) at a cost of $21 million, the stadium essentially sits empty for 51 weeks of the year, an arena that this year will be used for only one event: the $1.5 million Pilot Pen International tennis tournament beginning tomorrow in the stadium and on some adjacent 22 hard courts at the Yale sports complex.
The underutilization along with the nagging questions as to whether New Haven and the state even benefit from that tournament are causes for concern among many. Tax revenues have been far less than anticipated -- mainly because of the absence of concerts -- as have revenues at restaurants and other businesses.
Indeed, the only major beneficiaries of the tennis center appear to have been the players (the winner receives $150,000), and the promoter, Jewell Productions Ltd. (with virtually exclusive rights to staging events at the center), which is owned by a nonprofit organization known as the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut and receives the bulk of ticket sale and concession revenues.
Far less of a beneficiary is Yale University, on whose property the stadium sits, although its tennis complex adjacent to the stadium has been expanded and upgraded at no cost to the university.
Staging a big-money tennis tournament in a publicly financed stadium in one of the nation's poorest cities seems incongruous to many. In a recent article in Economic Development Quarterly the authors say "There is no evidence that construction of the tennis facility has attracted new business to New Haven" and the stadium project may have "generated more negative effects, politically and socially, than beneficial ones."
For all of the second-guessing, however, there is no denying that the tournament itself has been a success. Crowds, attracted by the world's leading players, have been good. After sponsoring the tournament at four different sites since 1973, Volvo withdrew after last year's event, whereupon Pilot Pen of Trumbull agreed to back the tournament for at least five years. The tournament itself is owned by James E. Westhall, who has been associated with it since 1971.
The one-week tournament is a year-round job for Mr. Westhall and a fulltime staff of 20, which is augmented considerably as the event nears. A onetime radio reporter who has developed a good rapport with many leading players and their agents, Mr. Westhall runs the tournament from an office suite at Long Wharf.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Westhall is disappointed that more events, in particular concerts, have not been held at the stadium, since his company expected to derive considerable financial benefits from ancillary promotions when he agreed to move his tournament to New Haven. "We thought that concerts would work," said Mr. Westhall who had projected that as many as 12 a year might be held. "We did not foresee what happened to the north of us."
That was a reference to the new 30,000-seat Meadows Musical Theater in Hartford that opened last year, along with the modernization of the Oakdale Theater in Wallingford, now open all year. Last year, his company, Jewell Productions, presented eight concerts in conjunction with the owners of the Oakdale Theater. "We lost money," he said.
Far more successful were two exhibition women's tennis tournaments starring Martina Navratilova.
This year, the only events at the Connecticut Tennis Center have been a walk against hunger and a road race, both fund-raising affairs intended to attract participants more than spectators.
Largely because its revenues have been far less than anticipated, the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut has been granted rebates of state admission tax revenues for the last three years, a subsidy of more than $300,000, according to the authors of the Economic Development Quarterly article.
Still, most political and civic leaders express the conviction that the tennis tournament itself produces benefits for New Haven.
A tangible one has been a street festival in downtown New Haven. The festival, which features live music and a wide array of foods, has attracted thousands of people nightly during the tournament.
"The tournament has been a tremendous success," said New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr., who was the first executive director of the Tennis Foundation. "It's helped contribute to the community in many intangible ways. Sure, we expected to have had more events. But I think the tournament has become one of our defining characteristics."
Paul Johnson, the first president of the Tennis Foundation and still a board member, agreed. "The tournament puts New Haven in the spotlight, at least for a while, and there's a real advantage as far as economic development is concerned," said Mr. Johnson, president and chief executive officer of the Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford. "It's one of the most successful weeks of the year in New Haven for restaurants, merchants and many others."
Mr. Johnson conceded that "If we thought that the stadium would turn out to be for tennis only, we would have given substantial pause."
"Still," he added, "the stadium situation is not out of sync with things in the 1990's when stadiums are built for football teams that may only use them 10 or 12 times a year." And as for the tennis tournament, "We still think it's good for New Haven."

A Shy, Protected Salamander Frustrates Developers

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
A SHY nocturnal amphibian not much longer than a dollar bill is costing the developer of a Riverhead shopping center millions of dollars in potential rent revenues because one of its breeding ponds is on the 85-acre property.
The Eastern tiger salamander, though fairly plentiful in some southern coastal states, is on New York State's endangered species list and as such is given state protection whenever development is proposed on or near its habitat. 
 At last count, 30 adults and about 110 babies of the species live on the Riverhead site at the juncture of Route 58 and Exit 73 of the Long Island Expressway. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers of Greensboro, N.C., is building a 450,000-square-foot outlet center on the property, extending an existing 287,000-square-foot center on an adjoining site that opened in 1994.
When the 737,000-square-foot complex is completed, probably by next year, it will be the largest outlet center in the world. Its almost 200 stores are expected to draw 10.5 million shoppers annually.
Those shoppers will share the site with the secretive salamanders, because the developers have set aside a 32.5-acre central portion of the property, which contains the pond, as a protected preserve.
The amphibians, which shoppers are unlikely to ever see, have brown bodies with yellow specks and grow from 8 to 10 inches in length. They live in subterranean tunnels, coming out one month a year to lay their eggs, but only at night.
Although the land was purchased with the knowledge that it contained tiger salamanders, "we donated more to a preserve than we anticipated," said Steven B. Tanger, the Tanger company's president.
The 32.5 acres, worth $3.5 million to $4 million, would have allowed him to build an additional 325,000 square feet, he said, "so you're talking about an awful lot of money in lost cash flow."
The Riverhead property is one of about 100 surviving tiger salamander breeding sites on Long Island, the only area in New York State where tiger salamanders, which prefer a moderate climate, live.
State guidelines call for protecting 50 percent of the land within a 1,000-foot radius of a breeding pond unless a study of the sitee shows that the salamanders there do not range that far afield, said Ray Cowen, regional director of the state's Department of Environmental Conservation.
Such a study was conducted for Tanger by Dru Associates of Glen Cove, an environmental consulting firm.
As part of the study the salamanders were trapped when they came out of the ground to breed in the spring of 1995 and again this spring. Before they were released, tiny transmitters were planted under their skins so that their movements could be monitored, said Ronald W. Abrams, one of the Dru principals. The most recent count of adults and babies was completed this year, he said.
Dru calculated that 23 acres were sufficient to secure the site's salamander population, but environmental groups objected, saying that was not enough.
THE property not only contains salamanders but also has a coastal plains community of rare fauna and flora, two pairs of great horned owls and other assorted and important plants and wildlife, said Andrew E. Sabin, a precious-metals dealer and an amateur naturalist. He said his special hobby was wildlife preservation generally and saving the tiger salamander in particular.
Mr. Sabin works as a state-licensed volunteer identifying tiger salamander habitats on the South Fork. He estimated that only 500 adult tiger salamanders still existed east of the Shinnecock Canal.
The compromise worked out between Tanger and the Department of Environmental Conservation, under which the 32.5 acres are being preserved, "is a good example of how you can have sustainable development and still preserve an endangered species," Mr. Sabin said.
"Tanger will make a nice profit and the salamander will exist there, hopefully forever," he added.
The preserve will be surrounded by a parking lot, but Tanger will secure it with a high fence to keep people out, and with a 12-inch-high, 18-inch-deep concrete curb to keep any wandering salamanders in.
The preserve will eventually be deeded to a not-yet-selected nonprofit environmental group for management and to guarantee that the land will never be developed even if state regulations concerning salamanders are changed. The preserve will be opened to school groups and to scientists for study.
State officials say that developers, and they included Tanger, usually cooperate with efforts to save endangered wildlife once they realize the importance of such projects and the potential benefits to them.
"Developers seem to recognize that people consider having an endangered species on a property as kind of neat," said Stephen P. Lorence, regional manager for the Freshwater Wetlands Unit at the Department of Environmental Conservation.
Most of the remaining tiger salamander-breeding ponds on Long Island are in the Bridgehampton and Manorville areas, Mr. Lorence said. In Nassau, where they were once plentiful, development has destroyed most of the habitats, but a 90-acre tract in the Town of Oyster Bay, on which a subdivision is planned, still harbors one, he said. A management plan for that site is currently being developed.
Residential subdivisions in general can co-exist with wildlife habitats quite easily because developers usually are eager to take advantage of a state law that permits the clustering of houses. The idea is to save open space. Developers benefit because they also save development costs.
Safeguarding a habitat "is an opportunity no different from preserving a vista or a walking trail or a steep slope or a significant tree," said Tom G. Julius, a partner with David Schonberger of the Legacy Group, a land developer in Harrison, N.Y.
THE developer recently received approvals for an 86-acre, 20-lot subdivision on Brick Hill Road in Bridgehampton where one- to three-acre lots will be sold in bulk to one or more builders. They have set aside 17 acres around a salamander pond as a nature preserve.
The lots all abut the preserved land "so people will have the benefit of more land without having to pay taxes on it," Mr. Julius said.
"My tactic is to look at the preserve as an opportunity and to market it accordingly," he added.
But Donald G. Partrick, an Islandia developer, said that protecting a tiger salamander habitat had not worked out so favorably for him because it had delayed a proposed 200,000-square-foot office project for more than a year and so far had cost him at least $100,000 in interest expenses and other fees.
Because a tiger salamander pond is on state property adjoining his land on the southeast corner of Exit 69 of the Long Island Expressway, state officials asked him to redesign the site plan for the six buildings that he will erect on his Manorville Corporate Center.
The first phase of the development, a 25,000-square-foot building for which he has had a "triple-A tenant waiting to move in for over a year," still has not started construction, Mr. Patrick said. Two hundred people could already be working there, he added.
"They call the tiger salamander an endangered species, but it's not endangered," he said. "Up here it's simply living on its outer limits. The state and local planners are trapped by overzealous environmentalists and all we developers can do is accommodate them."
But environmentalists say there are many important reasons, including economic ones, for preserving endangered plants and animals, no matter what or where they are. "We have to protect biological diversity if we want to protect the richness of our lives," said Sara Davis, executive director of the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy. "No species lives in a vacuum."

HEADLINE: Chelsea Piers: The Fight to Stay Afloat

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
EVEN a short description of Chelsea Piers sounds like the breathless spiel of a tour guide. The new sports and entertainment complex fills four reclaimed Hudson River piers (each as long as the Met Life Building is tall) and includes -- perhaps "boasts" is the verb here -- a 70-slip marina, 200-yard golf driving range, quarter-mile indoor track, 50-foot-high rock-climbing wall, two indoor skating rinks, two outdoor roller rinks, a field house, six sound stages, seven photo studios, three restaurants, five sports shops and a mile-long waterfront esplanade. Plus three cruise liners at anchor. And did we mention bowling lanes may be added?
Simply said, Chelsea Piers is bigger than most people imagined it could be. 
 Including, it turns out, the developers.
"Everything was exponentially different than what we had talked about," said Roland W. Betts, chairman of Chelsea Piers Management, which built and runs the 1.7 million-square-foot complex on property leased from New York State. "Right from the first contract, we knew we had a problem."
Budgeted at $25 million when it was announced in 1992 and $60 million when work began in 1994, the development wound up costing $75 million, said Tom A. Bernstein, president of Chelsea Piers. (Subtenants have also made $25 million worth of improvements, which is why the project is commonly given a $100 million price tag.)
Now Chelsea Piers hopes to refinance $55 million of short-term, high-interest debt with longer-term, lower-interest borrowing. To do that, the developers said they need a longer lease than 20 years on the piers. "If we don't get a lease extension, we will not be able to get refinancing," David A. Tewksbury, executive vice president of Chelsea Piers, told a City Council hearing in late July.
It is almost axiomatic in real estate circles that the waterfront's allure is treacherously siren-like. The expense, complication and risk of shoreline development have dissuaded any number of builders from undertaking new construction. Yet to be seen is whether an ambitious renovation -- effectively subsidized by the state through generous lease terms but otherwise privately financed -- can succeed in the long run. And if it does succeed, will it augur further privatization and commercialization of the Hudson riverfront?
Chelsea Piers Management is negotiating a 29-year lease extension that would allow the developers to defer payment of two-thirds of the rent for the next three years. Charles A. Gargano, the state Commissioner of Economic Development and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said he hoped the closing "will happen quickly so they can move forward and refinance."
Mr. Gargano said he and Gov. George E. Pataki were "very pleased" with Chelsea Piers Management. "They did not come to the public side for any kind of assistance," he said. "They did it all with private money. We see this as an ideal type of partnership. This is a project the community is interested in; not just the West Side, but the entire city.
"We're trying to insure that this is successful and will not have to be abandoned," Mr. Gargano said.
To look at Chelsea Piers today, abandonment seems a far-fetched possibility. But these piers have known many vicissitudes in their nine decades.
Completed in 1910 to serve trans-Atlantic ocean liners, the comb-like array of pier sheds was linked by a headhouse paralleling the riverfront. In 1963 the piers were renovated for use as a cargo terminal, but that period was short-lived. They were to have been demolished as part of the Westway project, which was canceled in 1985. A new conceptual plan drawn up by the West Side Waterfront Panel in 1990 showed the Chelsea Piers as a potential development site, with about 720,000 square feet of residential space and 110,000 square feet of commercial space.
While awaiting the day that such ambitious development would be feasible, the state Transportation Department set out in 1992 to find an interim tenant for the piers. The Circle Line, which already operated World Yachts from Pier 62, submitted a bid. So did Abraham Hirschfeld, a developer and one-time candidate for lieutenant governor.
AT first glance, the least likely bidder was Chelsea Piers L.P. While Mr. Tewksbury was a director of Cushman & Wakefield, Mr. Betts and Mr. Bernstein were strangers to the real estate scene. They were partners in Silver Screen Management, which raises money for movies, and part owners of the Texas Rangers baseball team. What brought the three entrepreneurs to Chelsea Piers in the first place was simply a search for a new home for Sky Rink, the ice-skating facility of which Mr. Betts and Mr. Tewksbury were board members, which was then at 450 West 33d Street.
The developers themselves credit their naivete as much they blame it. Had they understood the realities better, they might have concluded that Chelsea Piers was impossible.
Since they did not realize that, they went ahead and built it.
"Inadvertence and innocence got us down this road," said Mr. Bernstein. "It's very capital-intensive. Not only the cost of building it out but the investment in starting all new businesses. These things do not make sense on a short-term basis."
Mr. Betts recalls the chairman of the Board of Standards and Appeals remarking that the proposal involved the most comprehensive series of zoning changes in the history of the city. "If we had known that beforehand, maybe we would have stuck to making movies," Mr. Betts said.
The lease ran 10 years, to 2004, with one 10-year extension. The base rent, $2.4 million, was subject to adjustment after two years based on the Consumer Price Index.
As construction began in 1994, the budget was $60 million. To finance it, $17 million was raised from a few friends and family members. Mr. Betts said he and Mr. Bernstein put up $11.7 million themselves.
Chelsea Piers borrowed another $45 million, in the form of first mortgage notes, bearing a 12.5 percent fixed interest rate, plus a contingent interest payment designed to return over 15 percent. Like any mortgagor, the note holders have a secured claim on the property in the event of bankruptcy.
"In the course of the project, everything proved more expensive than anticipated," Mr. Betts said. It turned out, for example, that the floors of the pier sheds were almost imperceptibly sloped, enough to have significant structural implications. "Do you level all of it?" Mr. Betts asked. "Portions of it? Do you have step-downs?"
Then there are the lacy, open trusses that serve as an architectural signature of Sky Rink on Pier 61 and the Sports Center on Pier 60. They are handsome to behold but they flex, Mr. Betts said, "so you can't tie walls to them because the walls would fall apart."
Even details assumed a colossal scale, like the two-inch electrical conduit used in Sky Rink, , for example. Twenty-eight miles of it were needed. Mr. Betts said that $25 million to $30 million was spent on infrastructure: electrical service, plumbing, water and sewer lines, sprinklers, fire alarms and emergency lighting -- never mind rinks and pools and rock-climbing walls.
The Chelsea Piers partners carried a 5 percent contingency. It was not until the project was completed that Mr. Betts received this vital advice from Bruce Ratner, president of the Forest City Ratner development concern: "Whenever you do a renovation, carry a 30 percent contingency."
Mr. Betts said the current gross operating revenues were between $20 million and $25 million, including the turnstile receipts from the various sports venues and the rent paid by subtenants. While operating expenses are running roughly equal to that, he said, Chelsea Piers would end up close to $5 million in the red for its first year.
THAT is because revenues are going to pay construction cost overruns and to meet other new needs, like additional electrical service to handle the high power demand, particularly from the studios. There are also new problems, like the deterioration of pilings under the end of Pier 60, where the pool was built. The slightest shift of that pier, even a quarter of an inch, could crack the pool.
"There was a time last fall when we ran out of money," Mr. Bernstein said. At that point, an additional $13 million was raised, primarily from new investors, bringing the equity stake in the project to $30 million. The outstanding indebtedness on the first mortgage notes now amounts roughly to $55 million, Mr. Betts said, and the first interest payments are due in December.
It was on Oct. 26 that Mr. Betts brought the problem directly to the attention of Governor Pataki, during the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the field house and skating rinks and golf driving range.
"I asked how receptive he'd be to a longer lease, because we were feeling the burden," Mr. Betts recalled. He said Mr. Pataki replied that the developers had done a "fantastic job" and that he would be "delighted" to entertain the possibility. (Mr. Gargano confirmed the account.)
Lease negotiations involved City Hall, the state Transportation Department and the Hudson River Park Conservancy, an affiliate of the Mr. Gargano's Empire State Development Corporation that is charged with planning and constructing a waterfront park from the Battery to 59th Street.
But they did not involve any other public officials or local leaders.
To address this and other issues, Councilman Thomas K. Duane, Democrat of Manhattan, convened an oversight hearing on July 24. He said he was "shocked that Chelsea Piers started negotiations for a longer lease without including the community."
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who sits on the conservancy's advisory board, said he first learned of the negotiations at a May 30 meeting when the 49-year lease was "casually mentioned" by Peter K. Keogh, the conservancy president. Mr. Gottfried deplored the deal as having been "negotiated entirely in secret."
"The reason for the extension is simply so that Chelsea Piers Management can make more money," Mr. Gottfried said at the hearing. "The interim use of this land is being converted into a virtual sale of this land. I don't think this should be tolerated."
"They said they raised $60 million and spent $75 million," he said. "A 25 percent increase in costs doesn't seem wildly out of control. These folks went into the deal with their eyes open. Now they're trying to get out of this deal with a bailout."
Mr. Duane said the lease should not be extended until several outstanding issues had been resolved. One involves a proposed bikeway-walkway that would run between the headhouse and the reconstructed West Side Highway, known as Route 9A. Originally, this path was to be 36 feet wide. Now, to make room for an widened service road for Chelsea Piers, it is to shrink to 34.5 feet.
Another issue involves the future of Pier 62, which Mr. Duane and others want incorporated into a public park known as the Chelsea Waterside Park, which is to straddle Route 9A, bounded by 22d and 24th Streets.
"The renovation is a terrific job," Mr. Duane said. "It's beautiful. It's breathtaking. But it's not free. And it's not cheap. So along with it should come a beautiful park and a bikeway and walkway that really works to bring people to the waterfront."
But Mr. Gargano said the lease was not subject to that kind of public review since it pertained to an existing project. He said a 49-year lease was simply designed to make the project "viable and sustainable" by giving the Chelsea Piers partners "the ability to get better financing and lower their debt costs." (The choice of 49 years as the term of the lease was not arbitrary -- any longer period would be treated as a sale for tax purposes.)
Beginning in the 21st year, the state would receive the greater of an escalating rent or participation in gross revenues. The rent would rise with the Consumer Price Index, but no more than 3.5 percent annually. Alternately, the state would receive 3 percent of annual gross revenues over $60 million, 3.5 percent over $90 million and 4 percent over $100 million.
FOR 1996-97, 75 percent of the rent would be deferred; for 1997-98, 75 percent would be deferred and for 1998-99, 50 percent would be deferred. The deferred rent would have to be repaid in one lump sum by July 2001, or in monthly installments over 10 years, with 5 percent interest accruing.
Chelsea Piers would also be responsible for a payment in lieu of taxes ("pilot") to New York City, beginning in the 21st year. Mr. Gargano said he did not know the terms of that payment and referred a reporter to Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter. Calls placed to the Deputy Mayor seeking comment were not returned.
The bustle on the piers belies their financial straits. There are between 8,000 and 10,000 visits a day, Mr. Betts said, a figure that includes 1,200 to 1,500 full- and part-time employees. Six summer day-camp programs -- sports, gymnastics, ice hockey, figure skating, roller hockey and golf -- attracted 1,350 youngsters this year, he said. In any one season, between 2,700 and 5,000 players will be found on Chelsea Piers teams -- ice hockey, roller hockey, field hockey, indoor soccer and lacrosse, basketball and volleyball. The field house is the setting for as many as 40 children's birthday parties every weekend, Mr. Bernstein said, and 2,000 people have joined the Sports Center.
In the head house, the new ABC comedy "Spin City," with Michael J. Fox, is taking up residence on two sound stages, while NBC's "Law and Order" enters its seventh season on three others. Two feature movies -- "The Preacher's Wife," with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston, and "Devil's Own," with Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt -- have recently been filmed there.
"By the crowds down here and the usage, there is no question that this is going to be successful," Mr. Betts said. "We want to be a landmark in the city in the way the Statue of Liberty is a landmark." Reminded that the sponsors of that project had trouble raising money 111 years ago, Mr. Betts said, "Everybody has trouble."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Free of Debt, Flush With Savings, and Ready to Diversify

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
WITH a master's degree in finance from Johns Hopkins University, Pam Williams thought she was well prepared to invest the savings that she and her husband, Andrew, were accumulating. She was in for a shock.
Last October, counting on the auspicious history of technology stocks and bold water-cooler tales of success, Mrs. Williams invested 40 percent of the money in her employee retirement plan in two volatile Fidelity funds -- Select Developing Communications and Select Computers -- and waited for a big return. 
 "Everyone was in tech stocks and they were doing great, and we just jumped on the bandwagon," said Mrs. Williams, 30. Then she received her first quarterly statement. "You see a negative return," she said. "You wonder if you are doing the right thing."
The realization was a bit unnerving for Mrs. Williams, a meticulous sort who is director of finance and international business for the School of Continuing Studies at Johns Hopkins. "It made us realize we needed more diversity," she said. "Plus, we were out of debt so we really needed to look at the big picture -- insurance, investing, everything."
Being clear of debt attests to Mrs. Williams's financial discipline. When she and her husband were married almost two years ago, four years after meeting at a party for her swim team, the couple were saddled with about $10,000 in credit-card debt, mostly his.
"When I was in between jobs, I got into that credit-card crunch," said Mr. Williams, 32, a job recruiter since 1992 and a marketing manager before that. "For about two years I wasn't real smart about how I handled it."
After they married, Mrs. Williams took their finances in hand. They scrimped where possible and reduced debt, paying off the cards with the highest interest rates first, then throwing them away. At the bottom of the real estate market, with the help of Mr. Williams's parents, the couple bought a $143,000 house with a view of a marina in the downtown Baltimore neighborhood of Canton. Cash not devoted to reducing credit-card debt went toward basic home furnishings.
Now, in just two years, the house is stocked, the credit-card debt gone and the couple's earning power has jumped. Mrs. Williams's salary at Johns Hopkins has leapt from $35,000 to $49,000. And Mr. Williams's salary as a self-employed corporate headhunter -- now under contract to find computer professionals for Lockheed Martin -- climbed from $40,000 to $60,000. "After we got out of the hole, we realized, man, we should be able to save a lot of money," Mr. Williams said.
And save they did. Mrs. Williams invests primarily through the Johns Hopkins 403(b) plan -- basically, a 401(k) for nonprofit companies -- in which she can contribute up to $9,500 a year, according to the university's human resources representative. To participate in the plan, she must contribute at least 6 percent of the portion of her salary over $30,000. Then the university will contribute an additional 6 percent of her total salary, which would be $2,940. Currently, Mrs. Williams is investing about $6,500 a year in equity funds through the plan. Mr. Williams has put about $2,600 into a retirement fund, "mostly for the current tax advantage."
On top of that, the pair has amassed $12,000 in a bank savings account, earning 2.5 percent interest, and $2,000 in checking, and they believed they could save $1,500 to $2,000 a month.
Mrs. Williams continues to watch expenses and is an inveterate discount shopper.
"I am very lucky," Mr. Williams said. "You hear these horror stories about wives who buy out the stores, but Pam's spending is very conservative. Except for shoes."
THE couple acknowledges two other weaknesses: One is dining out at the numerous neighborhood restaurants, for which they budget $2,000 yearly, and the other is vacations. "We are into cheap vacations," Mr. Williams said. "We will probably just drive down to the Outer Banks for a week, and that will cost about $1,000."
Mrs. Williams replied, "We can do it for $600."
They plan to spend $5,000 a year for vacations and other recreation, which includes membership at a swim club where Mrs. Williams trains for the annual 4.4-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Swim. Mr. Williams, a basketball devotee, has recently taken up swimming with his wife.
For the big-picture planning, the Williamses visited Horan & Associates, certified financial planners in Glen Arm, Md. The couple's goals are to start a family in the next two to three years and to lay the groundwork for Mrs. Williams to retire at age 55 and for Mr. Williams to retire at 65.
Patrick J. Horan and Damian J. Gallina, two financial planners at the firm, started by suggesting that the couple be fully insured. Predictably, the couple's health plan, a Blue Cross-Blue Shield family plan, was through Johns Hopkins, and the planners advised the Williamses to stay with it. But the couple lacked disability insurance.
"Your ability to save money each month is without question your single greatest asset," the planners wrote in their analysis. "You would have difficulty meeting living expenses in disability on just one income." The university will soon offer Mrs. Williams disability insurance of 60 percent of basic income through age 65, but Mr. Williams needed his own policy, so the planners recommended one from the Paul Revere Life Insurance Company. It would provide up to $3,400 a month until Mr. Williams reached 65, at a cost of $1,108.78 a year.
Horan & Associates also suggested that the couple take out life insurance, but only a term policy for 20 years, by which time they should have saved enough not to need insurance.
Because Mr. and Mrs. Williams are in their early 30's, they can invest in riskier funds -- much as Mrs. Williams did initially. "Investors who maintain a long-term investment horizon can be more aggressive and are generally rewarded for their patience," said the Horan report, which suggested that the couple take $2,000 from savings to invest in a mutual fund, then make regular monthly investments together.
The planners suggested that the Williamses choose a risk level they will be comfortable with -- aggressive growth, growth or moderate growth -- and then pick one or both of the two funds the planners recommended for that level. For aggressive growth, the Horan firm liked the Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund and PBHG Growth. For growth, the planners suggested Mutual Discovery and Oakmark, and for moderate growth, Mutual Qualified and T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth.
Horan noted that some of the couple's current investments were weak and should be moved into the recommended mutual funds. One of these is Mr. Williams's I.R.A. of $2,600, invested in two fixed annuities earning 5 percent. The surrender charge for cashing out of the annuity would be offset by the expected higher gains from rolling over the retirement money into stock fund investments. Mrs. Williams has $4,300 in an I.R.A. invested in the CGM Mutual fund, a conservative balanced fund, which Horan said should also go into the more aggressive mutual funds.
For her 403(b) investment, which allows Mrs. Williams to choose from a number of funds from Fidelity, Vanguard, Twentieth Century and several other groups, the planners recommended that she get out of the two technology funds whose volatility unnerved her, as well as the Fidelity Asset Manager Growth fund that made up the rest of her original 403(b) investment. She should maximize her contribution, they said, and, as with the couple's other investments, stress growth.
They suggested putting 40 percent in Fidelity Magellan because they like the new management; 40 percent in the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock fund because it is a value fund, and 20 percent in Fidelity Overseas, creating a pool of money that would be insulated from a severe decline in the domestic market. If there is such a plunge, cash could be taken from the foreign fund to buy undervalued United States stocks.
FINALLY, the couple's reserves are completely in cash, earning 2.5 percent interest. The Williamses want three months' worth of expenses -- $22,000, including their taxes -- for emergencies. But Horan suggested keeping no more than $12,000 in cash because the mutual funds could be sold quickly if needed. The $12,000 cash, for immediate needs like a car down payment or home repair, should be moved from the bank savings account into a money market fund to earn about 4.8 percent, Horan said.
Although the suggested program leans completely on equities, the Williamses say they will adopt it because it achieves the diversification they want. "We are in mutuals, not single stocks, so I feel protected," Mrs. Williams said. "And we are young enough that it would be foolish not to be aggressive."
From here, the couple plan to invest and hold, and hope that their investing will, like their courtship, go swimmingly.

Chart: "Putting Savings to Work"
With growing savings, Pam and Andrew williams wanted diversity in their investments and, because they were young, they were willing to assume some risk. The financial planners Horan & Associates suggested that the couple redistribute their assets and future savings. They recommended three portfolios of mutual funds based on how much risk the couple wanted to take.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
From Regional Brokers, Bets on Local Businesses

BYLINE: By JON HILSENRATH 

 BODY:
PEOPLE have long searched their own neighborhoods for investment ideas that have yet to show up on the radars of Wall Street analysts. A new coffee bar or a child's favorite store can be a most promising stock tip. But searching someone else's backyard for such ideas -- now that's a neat trick.
One way to do it is through regional brokerage firms. Like small investors, many regional firms scour their areas for up-and-coming companies to recommend to clients. And these brokers often know things about local businesses that an office far away on Wall Street doesn't. 
 "I certainly think for individual investors that is a smart way to go," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. "But you have to find good brokers who know what they are doing."
The concept has been given a vote of confidence by mutual funds and pension funds, which have looked to regional firms for investing ideas off the beaten path. Regional brokers have "a special relationship with some of the smaller and mid-cap companies in their region," said Robert Haber, director of research at Fidelity Investments, the fund giant in Boston. "Not only will they cover them, but they will have good relationships and access to managements of these companies."
For example, Michael Cleary, chairman of the brokerage firm of Cleary Gull Reiland & McDevitt, rode his Harley to Canada last week with many suppliers of Harley Davidson, which like Cleary Gull is based in Milwaukee. Also along for the ride was Richard Teerlink, Harley's president. Cleary Gull recommended investing in Harley in 1987, when only Dean Witter Reynolds, the stock's underwriter, was tracking the company. Since then, Harley's stock price has risen more than twentyfold, impressive even in a raging bull market.
Partly because mutual funds and pension funds have made it a practice to find investment ideas missed by big Wall Street firms, finding undiscovered stocks is not easy. But individuals may have more flexibility in what they buy than the funds do.
Good stock ideas from regional brokerage firms are not always snapped up by the big guys. Companies with a low stock price, a small market capitalization or an unusual corporate structure might be passed up by funds, whose charters sometimes limit them to bigger stocks or those that meet certain other criteria.
When diving in, individual investors should keep in mind that small-capitalization stocks without a broad following are considered one of the riskiest areas of investing, in part because less information is available about them. Thus, small-cap stocks are better suited for turbocharging a portfolio than for replacing its engine block.
What constitutes an overlooked stock? Mr. Markese said his association considered a stock underfollowed if fewer than 10 analysts tracked it and if institutions like mutual funds and pension funds owned no more than 15 percent of the company.
A good example is the Central Parking Corporation, which operates 1,200 parking lots in the United States, Britain and Mexico. J. C. Bradford, a brokerage firm based in Nashville, took the company, which is across town from it, public in October. While Central Parking's stock has performed well, it is followed by just five analysts, and institutions own less than 11 percent. The company's stock has risen 58 percent since its offering, its return on equity for 1995 was an impressive 27 percent and its earnings have nearly doubled in the last two years.
"This is the kind of company that does not fall into wider categories that institutions can watch," said John Diffendal, director of research at Bradford. "It is a pretty small niche. There are very few parking companies, and they are not well followed by Wall Street."
Standard & Poor's publishes a list of underfollowed stocks in a weekly newsletter called The Outlook. In a June issue, it discussed 57 stocks, each followed by no more than five analysts and each anointed a high star rating for expected performance.
The American Association of Individual Investors compiles its own list of stocks that are out of the Wall Street spotlight, calling them "shadow stocks." Its latest list, published in February, contains 322 names and focuses on companies with market capitalizations of $20 million to $100 million. The list looks at institutional ownership and expects companies to have at least two years of positive earnings.
Among companies on the association's latest list is Equity Marketing Inc., of Beverly Hills, Calif., which makes toys for movie promotions, like the characters from "The Lion King" that were distributed by Burger King restaurants. Crowell, Weedon & Company, a brokerage firm in Los Angeles, puts the company on its aggressive growth list of recommended stocks. Only five analysts follow the company, and institutions own only 15.5 percent of its stock. The company boasts a 36 percent return on equity and four consecutive years of both sales growth and positive earnings.
Morgan Keegan, a Memphis brokerage firm, recommends another company with a link to fast food, U.S. Restaurant Properties Master Limited Partnership. The partnership has been aggressively acquiring real estate that is leased to franchisees running 264 restaurants, including Burger King, Dairy Queen and Hardees outlets.
Because U.S. Restaurant is a partnership, many institutions cannot own it, said Stephen Laffey, director of research at Morgan Keegan. The company is on track, however, to converting to a real estate investment trust next year, which should attract big investors. "I think it is a great opportunity for retail investors to own this thing before institutions," Mr. Laffey said.
One way to select a regional brokerage firm is to choose an industry, which will probably lead to a particular part of the country. Midwest brokerage firms, for example, tend to specialize in manufacturing companies. J. C. Bradford tracks many health care companies. And Robinson Humphrey of Atlanta has expertise in airlines.
Investors may also want to look at regions that are expected to produce the most economic growth. Regional Financial Associates, a research firm based in Philadelphia, predicts Nevada will lead the nation in economic growth in 1996 and 1997, at 7.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. Other high-growth states are New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, Colorado, Tennessee, Florida and Georgia.
Firms that are based outside big financial centers, however, don't necessarily specialize in home-grown companies. Neither Raymond James & Associates of St. Petersburg, Fla., nor A. G. Edwards in St. Louis takes a regional approach to picking stocks. While national brokerage firms with large sales forces have many offices outside big metropolitan areas, they tend to emphasize attracting new customer accounts, providing personal service and selling the stocks recommended by the firm's Wall Street staff.
Finally, investors are advised to be wary of brokerage firms that seem to have started overnight or have an apparent devotion to penny stocks -- low-priced issues often packaged with warrants good for additional shares.
Once you find an appropriate firm, opening an account tends to be easy. Regional firms may not have minimum account sizes, and the commission for a stock transaction usually begins at about $50.
 Avner Arbel, a finance professor at Cornell University, has changed his approach to investing in underfollowed stocks since he wrote a book on the subject in the 1980's. Like the public at large, he prefers to put most of his money in mutual funds these days. "If one can diversify a lot, then you don't have to check for risk and for other things like growth," Mr. Arbel said. He also said mutual funds had the benefit of professional management.
Among the mutual funds specializing in underfollowed stocks are Royce Low-Priced Stock, Babson Shadow Stock and Strong Opportunity.
Mr. Arbel said his favorite is Vanguard's Extended Market fund, which invests in companies not in the Standard and Poor's 500. "As a rule, the S.& P. 500 stocks are more widely followed than any other stock," he said. "If you exclude them, you have a very large portfolio of neglected companies."

Please Raise Your Tray Tables. You Won't Be Needing Them.

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WHEN Trica Jean-Baptiste flew from Newark to New Orleans in April on business, she fended off hunger during her five-hour trip with a hot dog and bag of chips she bought at the Cincinnati airport before boarding her connecting flight. "Otherwise I would have been famished," said Ms. Jean-Baptiste, the director of public relations for the Parker Meridien hotel in Manhattan, "because food wasn't served on either one of the flights."
Welcome to flying in 1996, a year marked not only by increasing passenger loads but by the incredible shrinking airline meal. And as food becomes harder to find on flights, hungry travelers may add its availability to their list of concerns when choosing an airline or route -- right up there with fares, safety and frequent-flier miles. 
 Some airline passengers have been on forced diets since 1992, when the industry lost a record $4.79 billion and began reducing food costs. But the cutbacks are becoming more noticeable.
United Airlines, for example, last year extended to 501 miles from 251 miles the length of a flight before passengers are offered a snack, and lengthened to 701 from 501 the miles required for a hot meal. Moreover, that policy is only for flights during meal hours. Otherwise, only a beverage is served on flights up to 899 miles (roughly the distance from New York to St. Louis) and only a snack, like a sandwich or fruit plate, for longer distances.
While the average airline trip is just under 1,000 miles, which would qualify passengers for a hot meal on most airlines, many flights connect at hub airports, breaking that 1,000-mile trip into two or more legs. Often, neither of those flights is long enough to qualify for a meal, so it is not uncommon for passengers to spend the better part of a day on a plane and in a terminal without being given much to eat. Passengers flying USAir from Boston to San Francisco, with stops in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, for example, will travel about 11 hours, through breakfast, lunch and dinner hours. But they will be served only lunch, on the second leg of the trip.
Whatever the airlines' revamped meal policies have done to shrink passengers' waistlines, they have had a perceptible impact on the carriers' bottom lines. Last year, the industry's food bill of $2.261 billion was $368 million less than in 1992, according to the Air Transport Association, and food costs fell to 3.4 percent of operating expenses last year, from 4 percent in 1992. Airlines spent roughly $4.45 on meals per passenger in 1995, down from about $5.60 in 1992. Not only have many carriers cut back on the frequency of meals, they have also saved money by serving chicken, pasta, sandwiches or salads, instead of former mainstays like steak or fish.
"A $368 million savings might not sound like a lot," said David Swierenga, the chief economist for the Air Transport Association, "but after losing more than $13 billion through 1994, the industry was desperate to cut costs." Last year, industry net profits totaled $2.376 billion.
While many passengers are resigned to flights without food, particularly since the proliferation of no-frills carriers, some travelers are still disappointed that major carriers offer less than a full meal. On a recent flight from Atlanta to New York, Rick Bubenhoffer, director of marketing for Studio Plus hotels in Lexington, Ky., had to make do with a sandwich and chips. "I can remember," he lamented, "when an airplane meal was really a meal."
Airlines, however, say that they hear relatively few complaints and that passengers are more concerned about lower fares or on-time performance. "The big airlines all learned from Southwest, which never made any pretext of serving anything but peanuts or cookies," said Lee Howard, president of Airline Economics, a consulting company in Big Canoe, Ga. "They've been forced to compete at an increasingly faster rate because of all the start-up airlines. But it sure has taken the fun out of flying."
Some passengers have not taken the changes lightly. Greg Davidowitch, a flight attendant with United for eight years, said: "It amazes me that passengers don't complain more to the airline, but they sure complain to us. I don't blame them. Where they used to have a choice of three hot entrees, now they're lucky to get a roll with a slice of ham or turkey."
Crew members often eat what the passengers are served -- when there is time -- so they feel the cutbacks, too. At some airlines, the food issue is addressed in union contracts. At United, flight attendants who work at least nine hours are entitled to a meal. But crew members often bring their own food, Mr. Davidowitch said. "With the airlines cutting back on the quality, quantity and frequency of meals aboard, we often do brown-bag it," he said.
 In June, after passenger complaints about a lack of food on morning flights, Delta Air Lines increased the number that would offer breakfast. More generally, it switched to serving meals based on flight mileage (at least 725) instead of duration (at least three and a half hours). Delta said the change would qualify more flights for meal service.
While first- and business-class passengers are not immune from cutbacks, the hours and flight distances required for them to receive meals tend to be more flexible. On Trans World Airlines, first-class passengers qualify for a snack on flights as short as 400 miles, compared with a minimum 740 miles in economy class, and the passengers are often served a hot entree when a cold meal is served in economy.
On some flights, airlines have even abandoned the traditional style of meal service. At about two dozen airports, American Airlines gives its passengers bags containing a snack as they board the airplane. During breakfast flights, the bags typically contain cereal and fruit; at lunch, they contain a sandwich, chips and a brownie. For Northwest Airlines flights between Chicago and Minneapolis, passengers at either airport choose snacks or make sandwiches from a buffet table near the gate.
Carriers rarely stint on food on highly-competitive routes, no matter the distance. Thus Northwest and United serve meals on the 80-minute flight between Chicago and Minneapolis and American will begin serving meals on Sept 1. T.W.A. and USAir serve meals between St. Louis and Washington, although at 700 miles, the trip would not otherwise qualify for even a snack. And meal hours are usually ignored on flights between New York and Chicago, where competition for business travelers just about assures passengers a meal.
Some carriers are considering selling sandwiches and snacks aloft, as did the defunct People Express, but others dismiss the idea because passengers can readily buy food at restaurants and food carts throughout the terminal before they board. (The popularity of these businesses, in the view of Mr. Davidowitch, the flight attendant, is proof that passengers care more about in-flight food than carriers contend.)
And the airport fare isn't always just fast food. "Our customers are always in a hurry, always having to catch the next plane, but they're eager to try something new," said Carlotta Flores, whose family-owned El Chorro restaurant has three locations at Tucson International Airport.
"It has helped us that the airlines have cut back on serving food," she said. "And I have to smile when I think of our carne seca, tacos and tostados filling the planes with the aroma of garlic and hot sauce."

HEADLINE: Defenseless Economy Needs People Mover

 BODY:
Those of us who have lived on Long Island for the last 30 years have witnessed the rise and fall of our economy. As we move toward the 21st century we read about the Long Island Association's looking to attract new industry ["Expansions Help Ease Downsizing Vacancies," June 2] to fill the economic void of what has become a defenseless economy. All of the reports that I have read fail to get to the root of the problem, and that is the infrastructure of Long Island and the entire metropolitan area.
There is no industry that would move to Long Island when they face the traffic problems which ultimately prohibit industry from moving about the Island. The only answer to our problem is to build a people-moving system that is second to none in this world. We must immediately begin to build a monorail system that will move people to and from various key points on Long Island and Manhattan. Furthermore, this system must include stops at the various sports arenas that house our New York sports teams. The Long Island Rail Road should be used strictly as a freight line, moving products through its many spurs that exist on our beautiful island. Failure to build this super people mover will bring total disaster to our economic plight in the 21st century. Politicians and associations that think they will attract industry to Long Island without improving our infrastructure are just in dreamland. Building this new infrastructure will also create new jobs at a greater pay scale than currently exists in the new jobs that are being created by the massive shopping center that is being constructed in Westbury. 
 The defenseless economy will become a modern technological economy that will bring high-paying jobs to this area. Long Island will again become the wonderful place to live and work that it was in past decades. It will truly be both a winter and summer wonderland that will be affordable to all walks of life.

HEADLINE: Neighborhood Report: CLINTON;
What's Down the Road for 8th Ave.?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
With the redevelopment of Times Square proceeding feverishly, Eighth Avenue is the next frontier.
The City Planning Department expects to disclose its blueprint for reshaping the avenue from 42d Street to 59th Street next month. In interviews with officials of the department, Community Board 4, the Municipal Art Society, a private group of planners and architects, and the Times Square Business Improvement District, a consensus seemed to be emerging about the need to allow owners of landmarked theaters greater freedom to sell their unused development rights. But whether community groups will support the city on expected new proposals to increase maximum building heights is open to question. 
 A seedy strip of vacant lots, porn businesses and undistinguished retail stores, Eighth Avenue links Times Square, the Theater District and Columbus Circle, which is also set for major development. In November, pornographic theaters and bookstores are to relocate under new zoning rules, and the avenue is expected to become more attractive to developers.
But the avenue presents one of the hardest cases in the city for planners: unlike all other avenues in Manhattan, it is zoned to permit taller buildings on one side than on the other. Structures 12 times as tall as the lot size -- a figure known as floor-area ratio, or F.A.R. -- are allowed on the west side. On the east side, developers may build to 14 times their lot size.
Many theaters east of the avenue are landmarked, and their owners cannot build over them. The Planning Department is expected to propose that the owners be allowed to sell the rights to develop some 3 million square feet to anyone within the Theater District. Some revenue from such sales would help to maintain and repair current theaters and, perhaps, to build new ones .
But Community Board 4 is worried about how liberally these development rights could be used on the western side of Eighth Avenue, up to 150 feet west of the sidewalk.
The department wants to allow buildings up to 14 times their lot size on both sides of the avenue, while Board 4 and others prefer a more lopsided ratio, say 12 and 18, so that the taller buildings remain only to the east.
"We're not a Times Square, we don't need flash and glitter," said Jo Ann Macy, chairwoman of Board 4. "We don't think the F.A.R. should increase at all on the western side." The head of the Planning Department's Manhattan office, Richard Barth, acknowledged the community's concerns but declined to be specific about the plan, which is nearing completion. "What we don't want to see is Sixth Avenue," he said. "We want a variety of buildings. We do not want a wall of tall buildings, filled with cement and dead space." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
In the City That Loves Ambition

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
"IT'S my ambition," Thelma Golden said, "to be on 'Charlie Rose' every night."
The feisty and petite Ms. Golden, 30, was at the Whitney Museum on July 31, where she is an associate curator, to celebrate the exhibition, "NYNY: City of Ambition. 
 "What else can you be but ambitious in this city?" she said, eyeing an ambitious crowd that included Mark Morris, David Byrne, Isaac Mizrahi and Tibor Kalman, who designed the exhibition, which was organized by Elisabeth Sussman and John G. Hanhardt.
"Everyone I know is ambitious," Ms. Golden said. "At least everyone under 35. It's the best way to ward off a mid-life crisis." In addition to her other ambitions, Ms. Golden, who was the curator of the Whitney's "Black Male" exhibition in 1994, has an interest in seating.
"It's my ambition to always get a booth at the Odeon," she said. "And there are only two."
David Weinberg, an ambitious young lawyer, corrected her. "At the Odeon," he said, "it's better to get a good window table."
Ms. Golden had no time to argue. Charlie Rose was passing by. She told him that she wanted to be on his show every night. "Do you want to be on TV every night," he asked, "or only on my show?"
On his show, Ms. Golden said. "I don't want a guest chair, either," she continued. "I want my own table. I want to be co-host."
A concerned look crossed his face. " 'Co-host,' " he finally said, "is not a word I understand."
The following night, Paul Sorvino and his daughter Mira sponsored a historically ambitious play reading at the TriBeCa Film Center. The play was "The Trouble With Cali" by Amanda Sorvino, 22, Mr. Sorvino's younger daughter.
"I'm thrilled that this many people are interested in Amanda's work," said Mr. Sorvino, who was in the cast.
Oh, but they were, especially after he enlisted a powerful publicity firm to generate a flurry of advance press that added to the list of producers and agents who wanted to come.
"Ambition isn't important," Mr. Sorvino said, standing in a crowd of 350 people including Christie Brinkley, Armand Assante, F. Murray Abraham and Bob Weinstein of Miramax. "The only important thing you can do as an artist is seek the truth."
Ms. Sorvino, a soft-spoken Oberlin graduate with sunglasses balanced on her head, didn't consider the hoopla over her earnest script (which in other circumstances might be called a good learning experience and left at that) a big deal. She didn't think her peers should be jealous, given what she feels is the modesty of her plans. "I already got a movie offer for this script," she said, "but I turned it down because I want it done off Broadway." After a long first act, a few producers left. Most stuck around. Some even asked Ms. Sorvino to come in for meetings.
"I'm so happy," she said, "when people get this play."

HEADLINE: Sweet and Salty and Short on Brass: The Modest Marinas of New York

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

 BODY:
MOST of the year, Cathy Schneck lives a modest, landlocked life in Forest Hills, Queens. She shares a small co-op apartment with her husband. She takes pride in, and worries about, her daughter, Roseanne, a college student. She works as a school secretary for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn.
But come warm weather, Mrs. Schneck heads down to the Barren Island Marina at the southern tip of Brooklyn and to her beloved sailboat, the Cathy Rose. There she has all the comforts of home: a shower, a kitchen, a television set, good books. She has the sweet, rusty smell of the ocean and all the fresh fish and crabs she can catch. And she has friends, some very good friends, among the dozens of others who also spend their summers at the marina. For Mrs. Schneck it is very much like a neighborhood, a community of people who love the water, love their boats and love looking out for one another. 
 "This is my backyard," she said. "This is my way of life."
Mrs. Schneck is one of New York's boat people, one of thousands of city residents who take to the water every day that summer sun shines, and a few when it doesn't. While others head off to the Hamptons or the Catskills, these New Yorkers prefer to spend long days and nights navigating the local waterways.
There is a lively and thriving recreational boating community in New York, a city that is, after all, water-bound. New York City is two islands, the tip of a third and a peninsula, all surrounded by rivers, sounds, bays and, ultimately, the Atlantic Ocean.
"We have a fantastic coastline that so few people are aware of," said Ed Rudetsky, a retired college professor and boater in Brooklyn. "It's a wonderful feeling when you're moving through the water."
New York boaters don't just utilize their waterways; they revel in them, gushing about a run up the Hudson to West Point or a sunset sail around Manhattan the way other sailors might describe a cruise across the blue-green waters of the Caribbean. They see an escape to the sea as the perfect way to combat the pressures of life in the urban jungle.
New York City is dotted with more than 200 marinas, boat clubs, yacht clubs and other sites where urban dwellers can launch their boats.
"They represent a very large part of the economy," said John Boldt, a longtime promoter of New York City's waterways and a self-described boat bum. "But it's not readily apparent because they're all scattered around. It's not like G.M.: all in one place."
Mr. Boldt is the motivating force behind the newly opened Dyckman Street Pier and Marina on the Hudson River in the Inwood section of Manhattan. The modest, working-class boat yard has a concrete fishing pier that juts out into the river and a marina that is still under construction.
Barren Island typifies the largely blue-collar marinas scattered around New York's outer boroughs. At the end of Flatbush Avenue across the street from Floyd Bennett Field, the marina has no restaurant, no ship store and precious few other amenities. Its piers are weathered and slightly battered. The large umbrellas for the picnic tables went missing long ago.
But to the 250 or so boat owners who use the marina, Barren Island is not only as good as fancier marinas; it is better. It has deep water for larger boats, a lovely view and direct access to the Atlantic. Fishermen love the lively waters of Rockaway Inlet. People who own power water skis love the easy access to the Hudson River. Sailors bask in the wind patterns that allow them to sail from the marina directly into the ocean without ever cranking up their motors, and without passing beneath any bridges.
Raymond Santa Maria, who has moored his 25-foot powerboat at the marina for more than 15 years, said, "It's beautiful to see the sea, to look out at the panoramic vision."
His cousin Anthony Santa Maria said, "It's a way of life for us, a second home."
Hamed Ramirez, 25, said he has kept his power skis at the marina for about a year and found most people unfailingly polite. He likes to cruise up the Hudson River to Manhattan, a 40-minute ride, jumping the waves left by barges and big ships.
Mrs. Schneck and her husband, Harold, have had their boat at the marina for more years than they can remember. The boat, a 35-foot Island Packet, is a combination of leisure activity center, vacation home and major investment.
It is large enough to sleep seven with comfort, not including Mac, the Schnecks' large but friendly Rottweiler. There is a hand-held shower in the snug bathroom, or head, and a galley -- with refrigerator, oven and sink -- that Mrs. Schneck says is only slightly smaller than the one at home. The master bedroom rests under the stern and adjoins the bathroom. The main cabin area has a bar, a table, bookshelves, a television set and pelican knickknacks.
She is a bit defensive about the image of boat owners as rich people with too much discretionary income.
"People say boaters have fat bellies," she said. "But we work hard for this. I live in a small co-op. I don't have a big house. I limited my family to one child so we could afford to put her through school."
The boat serves not only as a vacation home, but also as an entertainment center for their daughter, Roseanne, 19, who sometimes takes her college friends to the boat for summer cookouts.
"We can't do that at home," Mrs. Schneck said. "We don't have the room."
To the bewilderment of the marina users, the National Park Service, which oversees the Gateway National Recreation Area, including Barren Island, has announced plans to close the marina in December. The park service said that bringing it up to standard would cost nearly $4 million, a sum that would have to be paid by the private contractor hired to run the marina.
Greg Haraiam said he would probably sell his boat if the marina closed. At 77, he said, he is too old to search for another marina. The proximity of Barren Island makes it easy for him to sail five or six hours a day and still get home to South Ozone Park, Queens, in time for dinner with his wife.
Kenneth Atlas jokingly threatened to sink his 21-foot powerboat. Checking for crabs in the trap he keeps tied to the pier near his boat, Mr. Atlas said he would miss Barren Island if he were forced to leave.
Mr. Rudetsky, the retired professor, who began sailing after watching the boats from his classroom at Kingsborough Community College, said, "If this marina were not here, I would not have gone as gung-ho for sailing as I did."
Mrs. Schneck said she was not sure what she would do. Selling the boat is unthinkable. But so is leaving Barren Island.
"This is home for me," she said, standing on a pier at Barren Island looking out over the water. "This is my summer home, and I feel like I'm being evicted."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
The Hit Quiz Show For Those Who Owe

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
BONITA MILLER came to repay a $7,680 car loan. Tracy King had hopes of erasing $23,000 in student loans and a $200 phone bill. Tom Hertz wanted to pay off $8,234 in credit card bills for living expenses, including a cross-country move, some new clothes and two TV's.
Only one of them would succeed, though, on the set of "Debt" -- Lifetime Television's new game show -- where financial miracles seldom take more than an hour. By answering a few trivia questions correctly, the winning contestant -- instead of flying to a beach in Tahiti -- can walk away free and clear of debt. 
 Jeff Nimoy, a 30-year-old actor, is typical of the winners. His take? $16,224. "I spent 12 years racking up that amount of debt," Mr. Nimoy said. "I got rid of it in a half hour."
Dispensing with years of bills in such short order is many an American's fantasy. And it has helped make "Debt," which made its debut in June, one of the most popular shows on Lifetime, a cable channel known mostly for its movies. The show may make a leap from its cult-like following, now about 750,000 households each weeknight, to a much broader audience. ABC -- looking to cash in on a possible hit -- has an option to move "Debt" into its prime-time lineup as early as next year. With the backing of the network, the stakes could be even higher for contestants, who might be able to pay off not just credit cards and such, but perhaps their mortgages, too.
America's cadre of spenders provide a steady stream of eager contestants as is. The number of applications has swelled from about 25 a week in June to about 250. At a recent taping, many were recent college graduates trying to pay off school loans or credit card bills from living beyond their means.
Much of the show's strength comes not from its competitive edge (questions ring more of People magazine than of "Jeopardy"), but from its philosophy. Some of the most popular game shows of the 1950's or 60's -- like "Let's Make a Deal" and "The Price Is Right" -- awarded prizes so that the contestants would go home feeling prosperous. Most families would have spent months saving to buy that washer or to take that European vacation. The creators of the new show make that format sound quaint.
"When we were looking at a game show to develop, we figured that by the way Americans were spending money, most of them had already bought their prizes," said Andrew Golder, 35, the senior producer of "Debt" and one of its creators. "What most people needed instead," he said, "was a way to pay all those bills."
The numbers buttress his point. Having spent freely during the recent economic expansion, Americans now owe a record $1.1 trillion in debt other than home loans. Even accounting for population growth, nonmortgage debt has nearly doubled the last 10 years to about $12,000 a household. The load has clearly become taxing. The portion of people who have fallen behind on their credit card bills is at its highest level in 15 years.
Once something that people might be ashamed of, mounds of credit card bills now prompt easy television confessionals. To be uninhibited in the 1960's meant a visit to the "Newlywed Game" or the "Dating Game," which routinely quizzed contestants on their sex lives. "Debt" takes voyeurism out of the bedroom and puts it in the living room, requiring contestants to divulge how they dug themselves into the hole.
Student loans are the No. 1 complaint, the show's producers say. Credit card spending is another common culprit. Susan Brightbill, an aspiring Hollywood actress and a recent contestant, says her last computer purchase took her credit card balance to $7,900. Aran Eisenstat, an earnest-looking lad from Los Angeles, says he racked up $18,000 on credit cards but is at a loss to say where the money really went, though he mentioned groceries, gasoline and car repairs.
"People like to hear other people talk about money the same way they like to hear them talk about sex," said Dr. David W. Krueger, a Houston psychoanalyst. "Either they get a feeling of connection -- 'Good. Someone else has a lot of debt, too' -- or they feel superior. Either way, it's a good feeling for the viewer."
"Debt" hinges on the notion that financial blunders are commonplace. The show's 150 audience members -- older adults one day, a crew of Marines the next -- seem to empathize with the three contestants, each out to purge financial sins.
The contestants begin each game with a negative total that reflects their combined average debt -- the limit is $10,000 each. With a correct answer, they pare that debt on the way to zero. For the first two rounds, they answer questions on pop culture. Whoever whittles away the most debt progresses to a speed round of questions. No matter how much money has been won at this point, if the final contestant answers 10 questions correctly in this round, he gets a check equivalent to his personal debt (again, up to $10,000).
Then comes the final temptation. The host, Wink Martindale, a veteran of the game-show circuit, asks the winner if he would like to wager all his money. If the contestant bites, he will either double his money or go home empty-handed. The potential pot: $20,000 (before taxes, of course, so there might be little left for fun after the bills are paid and the Government takes its share).
The producers of "Debt" hope that even the financially prudent will get a chuckle from the show. Unlike "Jeopardy" -- which is geared toward armchair highbrows -- "Debt" appeals to hip, young Americans.
Gregg Sherman, the show's 33-year-old head writer, said: "To do well here someone has to be a pop-culture junkie. In a way, you could say 'Debt' is one of the first shows geared toward Generation X, since they know a lot of what's going on in film and music."
The early reaction to the show has been encouraging for Lifetime, a division of Buena Vista Television, a development company for its parent, the Walt Disney Company. "Debt" has corralled a prime spending audience of 20- to 49-year-olds, and with them, advertisers as disparate as MCI, J. C. Penney and Pennzoil.
"While we'll have to wait and see if 'Debt' moves to prime time, it's much more likely that it can be sold into syndication," said Mort Marcus, president of Buena Vista. "We've just now begun to sell the international rights to the show."
Buena Vista would not say whether the show was a money maker, but if "Debt" moves into syndication, it will be sold for a profit to local television stations nationwide. If ABC, also owned by Disney, picks up the show, the network's prime-time audience will generate even heftier advertising revenue.
When the show was first broadcast, potential contestants simply phoned in their names and phone numbers. Now they fill out formal applications, and the wait is anything from several weeks to a year.
The first hurdle is perhaps the highest. The show's producers seem to favor people in their 20's, 30's and 40's, and those with a good tale of how they got into debt.
Joseph Kuhr, a 30-year-old Los Angeles screen writer, landed a spot on "Debt" last month after the recent decline in technology stocks depleted his portfolio by $12,000. (He won $7,100.) Kameron White-Holmes, a Pasadena, Calif., homemaker, appeared on the show when she was five months' pregnant and carrying $20,000 on her credit cards. (She lost.) But the most interesting contestant so far has to be Rob Steinberg, 36, who wanted to pay off $8,893 in travel expenses from attending a year-long tour of Grateful Dead concerts. (He took home $17,786.)

EOPLE who pass the application process take a written test. Each person has 15 minutes to whip through 36 questions about pop culture, covering trivia from foreign films to Cher's songs. Most questions are fairly straightforward. "I was high on the water tower in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and just plain high in 'The Basketball Diaries.' " Who am I? The answer: Leonardo Di Caprio. Prospects who get at least 31 of the 36 questions right are grouped in threes for a mock show, in which producers look for excitement and quick reflexes.
Some television critics have ravaged "Debt," saying it makes its questions too easy.
"I've been doing game shows for years," said Mr. Martindale, the host, "and this is the first one that has so many young people on it. And most know their trivia. Sometimes I won't know anything, but we'll get some kid who'll rip through the questions like Grant through Richmond."
While most contestants know their trivia, don't expect them to know the interest rates on their credit cards or their monthly account balances, if a recent sampling of contestants is any indication.
What many of these contestants did say, however, was that their financial troubles were not their fault. The debt is just the price of their life style, which by their definition is Spartan.
Take Mr. Hertz, a handsome 34-year-old stand-up comic who faults his wife, Susan, for much of his $8,234 debt. She buys too much "girl stuff," he tells the television audience. The truth is that Mr. Hertz likes his share of "stuff," including brews with the boys and dinners on the town, as he reveals after the show.
 "It's one thing to make a nice salary," Mr. Hertz said later, "but even then, why shouldn't my wife and I go out to dinner? You have to buy that new computer for your recipes. Put them in a wooden box, and you'd be run out of the neighborhood. Of course, you have to run up debt on your credit card. Life's expensive."
Winning clearly means more to some contestants than to others. Shortly after buying a car a year ago, Ms. Miller lost her job as a communications executive and has struggled ever since to repay the $7,680 loan. During the first game of a recent day's taping, she was matched against Mr. Hertz, a trivia wizard..
Before the show begins, both get a touch of Hollywood humiliation. Ms. Miller has forgotten to wear a dress with pockets and is forced to wear a microphone pack in her underwear. At 5 feet 9 inches, Mr. Hertz is deemed too short by a stage manager, who asks him to stand on a small wooden box.
They sweep through the first round, knocking off a third contestant, and square off in the second. There, they "one up" each other on how many questions they can answer on oblique topics like "They Call Me Tom," for famous Toms, or "North, South, East or West," pop-culture questions that have directions in their answers. Mr. Hertz wins and moves to the speed round -- questions about foreign films.
Ms. Miller gets the hook. "Well, Bonita, we're not going to pay your debt," intones an announcer, "but we will give you a plastic piggy bank and a $500 savings bond." Like other losers, she is escorted to the front row of the studio audience for the remainder of the show.
Off the wooden box, Mr. Hertz rips through the speed round on foreign films. For answering the questions correctly, he is awarded enough money to wipe out his entire debt, $8,234. Finally, Mr. Martindale asks him if he would like to bet his winnings and possibly double his take. Mr. Hertz refuses.
"I plan to pay off my credit card debt -- honest I do," he said after the taping. "But you know it's hard to get excited about it. Bonita needed the money more than I did."
As in life, few of the show's contestants ultimately polish off their debts. Out of work for a year, Ms. Miller says she has now decided to accept a job that pays $10,000 less than her old one.
"It comes down to how life is today," she said. "Downsizings happen all the time. You just hope they don't happen to you. In that circumstance, you may need those credit cards just to survive."
Ms. King, who got nowhere on the show and is still weighed down by $23,000 in student loans, has taken a job as an English teacher at a junior high school. She acknowledged that it would take her many years to make even a dent in the load.
Some losing contestants plan to try out for other game shows. Others seem content to make monthly payments, while still others aren't overly concerned about their financial craters.
Mr. Eisenstat, who owes $18,000 on several credit cards, said: "You can't let your debts take the joy out of your life. Right now I'm not willing to not enjoy myself to pay off debt. What good is being debt free, if you're not living your life to the fullest?"

HEADLINE: When Welfare Cases Land on State Playing Fields

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The inaccurate assumptions and misguided conclusions that form the basis of the applause from Mayor Steve Goldsmith of Indianapolis for the dismantling of the Federal welfare system (Op-Ed, Aug. 4) provide a frightening glimpse of the future facing low-income families who must now rely on the states' administration of programs that will replace Aid to Families With Dependent Children. 
 In arguing that Indiana's current system undermines family cohesiveness, Mr. Goldsmith wrongly claims that Indiana residents cannot receive A.F.D.C. unless they are unmarried and/or in a different home from their extended family. In fact, both married parents and young parents living with their own families can receive benefits to help support their children. And contrary to Mr. Goldsmith's assertion, Indiana mothers receiving welfare benefits can receive a portion of the child support collected from their children's fathers.
In arguing that private charities can now replace a so-called government monopoly on the business of helping people, Mr. Goldsmith ignores the fact that the charities now doing the most for people in his community, including Catholic Charities U.S.A. and the Salvation Army, have begged Congress and the President not to abandon the 60-year Federal safety net and have insisted that they and other private charities will be unable to mend the holes in that safety net once it is shredded.
Mr. Goldsmith's conclusion that greater "flexibility" and local autonomy will allow cities and other local government bodies to be more effective at reducing poverty is belied by the fact that his main prescriptions for reducing the welfare rolls do not address the ills of his own community's low-income population. For example, he places great emphasis on finding people jobs, but Indianapolis boasts of an economy where low-wage jobs often go wanting.
It appears that while recent legislation may have finally concluded the treatment of low-income families as political footballs at the national level, those families have been punted to the electoral playing fields of the 50 states.

DEJA VU VOODOO
Bob Dole, Tax Busting
Mr. Dole, sailing to the Republican nomination in San Diego but sinking in the polls, reached for the magic vitamin that has revived many a Republican campaign: tax cuts. And not a dinky one at that. He pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent and to spur economic growth to 3.5 percent. Naturally, this is all part of a plan to balance the budget. The old Bob Dole ridiculed tax cuts without spending cuts -- what he called "gain without pain" -- but now that he is a self-declared optimist, he plans to lop off all sorts of unspecified programs to "roll back the empire of liberal, big spending" government. For spice, he also compared the I.R.S. to the K.G.B.
 
BEYOND NO-FAULT
Cutting Car Insurance
While he's harpooning political points, the Republican candidate is also espousing a big change in auto insurance. The savings could be so immense to drivers -- upwards of $40 billion a year -- that the issue could well have legs politically. Trial lawyers are against it, so many politicians, especially Republicans, would see that as a plus. The plan would give drivers the option of buying no-frills coverage, omitting insurance for pain and suffering. That could save individuals hundreds of dollars a year in premiums.
 
FAMILY FORTUNES
A Micro Tax
Why wait for Washington to cut taxes when you can as good as abolish them now? J. R. Simplot, the potato magnate behind the volatile chip maker Micron Technologies, found a way for his family company to sell a lot of Micron stock without paying $39 million in capital gains taxes for six years. Tax avoidance of this sort is legal, but a source of consternation to the Clinton Administration. The maneuver also allows the family company to retain voting rights on most of the shares sold. Mr. Simplot, who is 87, long boasted that he had been a buyer of Micron, but never a seller, but since last fall the stock has tumbled, and he evidently decided to pull back. After the sale of 6 percent of Micron, the family apparently still owns 15 percent, worth $800 million.
 
THE OPEN MARKET
Nasdaq Under Duress
Nasdaq brokers fixed prices for years, the S.E.C. charged, and all the while the problem was ignored by the exchange's oversight body. The Securities and Exchange Commission censured the stock market and the self-regulatory National Association of Securities Dealers, and one commissioner said the anticompetitive practices might have resulted in tens of millions of dollars of overcharges. Nasdaq is the second-largest exchange in the world in the dollar value of stocks traded, after the New York Stock Exchange, and has climbed to prominence with a roster of leading technology companies like Intel and Microsoft. The Government did not charge any individual brokerage firms criminally, at least yet, but required the N.A.S.D. to spend $100 million to improve monitoring to prevent abuses. The exchange, which essentially is a computer system that links brokers who then trade by phone, accepted the censure without admitting or denying the charges. But many Nasdaq traders are outraged by rules the S.E.C. is proposing to guarantee that investors get the best possible price in trading, saying they would devastate brokerage profits.
 
LOGGING OFF
A Day Off in Cyberspace
The lights went out at America Online, leaving its six million customers out of commission for most of a day. In the process, small-business and home-office workers discovered just how much they depend on E-mail, and some were irate. "This is a great way to burn customer loyalty," said Gary Arlen, the head of a market research firm. But crashes have long been part of the on-line world, and others approached the disruption more calmly. David Gardner, who with his brother founded the personal financial site Motley Fool on America Online, said: "I've come to accept that from time to time computers break down. But if it goes on more than a day, I'll be very upset." Steve Case, the company's chairman, issued a mea culpa to customers but also saw a silver lining. A decade ago, on-line services were the turf of computer hobbyists. Now they are so much a part of everyday life that a day without A.O.L. "is disorienting and downright frustrating."
 
MERGER MANIA, CONTINUED
Buying Spree, Episode 238
A slow week on the merger front, just $5 billion or so. In the managed care department, Pacificare of Orange County agreed to buy the neighboring FHP International. The price is $2.1 billion. GE Capital is getting the First Colony life insurer, at $1.8 billion. And the fertilizer company Freeport-McMoran is taking over Arcadian, for $1 billion or so in stock.
 
SEMICONDUCTOR SAGA
Trade Skirmishes Morph
True, Washington and Tokyo concluded another chip deal, but it didn't seem to mean nearly as much as the original one, 10 years ago. "We're fighting the last trade war," said one American semiconductor executive, who added that today, Japan is a relatively open market, while China, a newcomer to the industry, is a graver problem.
 
MARKET INDICATORS
Investors Ante Up Less
Investors gulped during July, adding a measly $3.5 billion to stock mutual funds. That was by far the least of any month of the last year and could mark an ominous turn for the market. For the week, the Dow Jones average ended up 1.48 points, at 5,681.31. In his job for one month, the head of Fidelity's Magellan fund surprised Wall Street by sticking with the investments he inherited when he took over the giant fund. Robert E. Stansky kept the mountain of government bonds that dragged down the performance of his predecessor, Jeffrey N. Vinik. Mr. Stansky chose to keep his head down, in Fidelity's words, "pending full review of various opportunities."

Monday
 
The Conference Board is to report the leading indicators for June, and an increase of two-tenths of one percentage point is expected. An increase would be the fifth in a row, a streak that has not occurred in two years. The index rose three-tenths of a point in May.
 
Tuesday
 
The American Petroleum Institute issues its weekly report on petroleum stocks, production and imports.
 
Wednesday
 
The Federal Reserve issues its so-called beige book, which details business conditions in each of its 12 districts. It will help prepare the Fed for its policy-making meeting on Aug. 20.
 
The Fed is also expected to report consumer installment debt for June; an increase of $7.5 billion is predicted, a jump from May's $4.7 billion.
 
Thursday
 
Earnings reports are expected from America Online, Clorox and Procter & Gamble.
 
Friday
 
Producer prices are due out for July, and the Labor Department is likely to report an increase in prices for finished goods of two-tenths of a point. The core index, stripping out energy and food, is likely to be up by the same amount, forecasters say. The rise would mirror June's increase.

HEADLINE: When Parties Go to Extremes;
It's Hard Running Up the Middle

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE of the abiding rules of Presidential politics is this: Crawl too far out on a limb, to the left or to the right, and you will fall off. "Extremism in the pursuit of liberty" or any other virtue, to borrow Barry Goldwater's phrase, may be no vice -- but it costs elections. Few tags will doom a Presidential campaign as quickly as "extremist."
Recent history is full of examples. Mr. Goldwater himself is the most vivid one; nominated in 1964 as the darling of the resurgent conservatives, at a convention where Nelson Rockefeller was booed and other Republican moderates were either scorned or ignored, he carried only six states as Lyndon B. Johnson took 61 percent of the popular vote, the largest share in American history. 
 Mr. Goldwater had demonstrated his command over the ideologically committed activists who vote in primaries and attend party meetings only to discover that the general electorate is an entirely different political animal.
Eight years later, the same fate befell George McGovern, a man, like Goldwater, restrained in personal demeanor but far from restrained on the key issues. Opponents of the Vietnam war captured the Democratic convention and mounted a campaign full of left-wing zeal, but Richard M. Nixon took 49 states (all but Massachusetts), the largest number ever captured by a Presidential nominee.
Now nobody has ever accused Bob Dole of being an extremist; he is in fact a classic Plains conservative, suspicious of isms and movements, given to compromise and tolerant of the other guy in the way legislative leaders tend to be. His choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate Friday was classic Dole. He chose a man with whom his personal and professional relations have been rocky in an effort to demonstrate his willingness to embrace the pro-growth wing of the party.
But it is not only the man who matters; it is also the kind of message that he sends or that is sent on his behalf, and that is a danger that faces Mr. Dole on the eve of his nomination this week in San Diego. Such was the case with George Bush in 1992; no firebrand himself, indeed diffident to the point that he sometimes seemed offended by the crudities of political life, he was nominated by a convention that sent signals of exclusion, especially on abortion and especially to women.
Two-party politics, almost by definition, is the politics of inclusion, and Mr. Bush paid a price for his party's exclusionism, running far behind the Republican norm in affluent suburbs and among women generally. That helped Bill Clinton beat him.
Once in the White House, Mr. Clinton forgot for a time that he had won (albeit only by a plurality) as a New Democrat, the self-anointed champion of the middle class, less obligated than most of his recent Democratic predecessors to labor unions, minorities and other interest groups. On such issues as gays in the military and health-care reform, he got out ahead of the public, lost the support of those in the vital center and suffered in the polls. The 1994 Republican "revolution" followed.

 
 
Malleable
 Now he has morphed back into his 1992 self -- and then some, adopting as his own such hoary Republican themes as lower taxes and smaller government. He has not really reformed welfare but abandoned it in favor of a risky experiment.
Likewise Mr. Dole. He has shown himself no less malleable than his opponent, promising voters early in the campaign year, "I'll be another Reagan if you want." This some seem to want, so he has transformed himself, for the moment at least, from deficit hawk into tax-cutter, jettisoning a lifetime of preoccupation with balancing the government's books (and an abiding skepticism of Ronald Reagan's economic policies). The choice of Mr. Kemp, a supply-side tax-cutter from way back, gives him a bit more credibility in his new role.
Washington is anathema to voters these days, so Mr. Dole sought early on to symbolically shed decades of personal history by resigning from the Senate to campaign as a plain Joe from Kansas.
Mr. Dole has done what he could to see to it that this year's Republican convention avoids the pitfalls of the 1992 gathering in Houston. Before settling on Mr. Kemp, he sought in vain to persuade General Colin Powell, perhaps the best man to guarantee the ticket an image of good sense and balance, to become his running mate.
He also sought language in the platform that would explicitly express the party's tolerance of those in its ranks who back abortion rights (for "tolerance" read "inclusion" or "non-extremism"). But the opponents of abortion, especially Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, had done their work well, electing delegates in state after state who were determined not to yield on what they deem to be a profound moral issue.
The best the former Senator could manage on that score was a tolerant appendix, which will no doubt be even less read or heeded than the platform it accompanies. It was apparently enough to avoid a floor fight led by the Rockefellers of 1996, like Governors William Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. But the platform as a whole constitutes a statement of party principles closer in its music, if not always in its words, to the unbridled nationalism and populism of Patrick J. Buchanan than to Mr. Dole's careful formulations.
"We could not be more pleased," said Angela (Bay) Buchanan, Mr. Buchanan's sister, with a document that will include many of the themes from the Buchanan campaign: opposition to American troops serving under foreign commanders in United Nations peacekeeping forces, opposition to same-sex marriages, opposition to public assistance for children born to illegal aliens while in the United States.
It is uncertain how the platform and the convention speeches about it will play with the voters; a prominent moderate Republican in Pennsylvania said last week that voters in suburban Philadelphia, one of the pivotal areas where the hot Houston rhetoric hurt Mr. Bush in 1992, would be listening to every word.
If they are offended once more, if they sense that the Republican Party has been radicalized like the Democratic Party of the 1970's, Mr. Clinton will be waiting to greet them with open arms. His own convention later this month will be scripted to send nothing but signals of harmony and moderation, in sharp contrast to the scenes of combat, both physical and metaphysical, that emanated from Chicago in 1968.
Ross Perot will be waiting, too, as the presumptive nominee of his Reform Party at its curiously bifurcated convention, beginning in Long Beach, Calif., before the Republican gathering down the coast and ending after it in Valley Forge, Pa. Third parties in America have traditionally been havens for those who found the major parties too moderate, not too extreme, but Mr. Perot likes to think he is in sync with the Jaundiced Majority that considers all mainstream politics a joke, particularly a mainstream politics whose leading lights so readily jettison principles to woo voters. But in the end the joke may be on Mr. Perot, too, since he has his own problems with political constancy.

 
 
The Hard Line's Victories
 The most pressing problem for Mr. Dole, as he himself has no doubt concluded, is the hard-line conservatives within his party, who have also triumphed in a number of important primaries in recent months. In Kansas, Representative Sam Brownback, one of Newt Gingrich's foot soldiers, defeated the establishment Senator appointed in Mr. Dole's place, Sheila Frahm, and other outspoken foes of abortion won in such diverse states as Georgia, Michigan and Illinois. They are all expected to face trouble in November, local politicians say, in appealing to moderates of both parties.
So may Mr. Dole. For two decades, from 1968, when Richard Nixon discovered how to appeal to what he called the Silent Majority, through 1988, it was the Republicans who seemed like the natural party of government, in tune with the national Zeitgeist, and the Democrats who seemed the party of cranks and have-nots. Those roles may now be reversing, with profound political consequences.

For Your F.B.I. File, Take a Number (15,001)

BYLINE: By DAVID WALLIS; David Wallis is a writer in New York.

 BODY:
NEXT time the Clinton Administration trumpets declining unemployment figures, they may owe some thanks to Craig Livingstone.
Mr. Livingstone, the former White House director of personnel security, resigned under pressure in June after improperly acquiring confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation files on nearly 900 people, including many prominent Republicans. While Mr. Livingstone's departure reduced the nation's labor force by one, his legacy may be the creation of 350 jobs at the F.B.I. 
 Since news broke of the file fiasco, the F.B.I. has been swamped with requests from citizens asking to review their own files under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts, the laws establishing the statutory rights to obtain Government documents. In response the Senate committee responsible for funding the bureau voted unanimously this month to beef up the F.B.I. department that processes those requests.
There are 9.6 million F.B.I. files on individuals, alive and dead, plus organizations and criminal investigations. If the empty 9-by-11 1/2-inch white folders were empty and stacked one on top of another, the paper tower would rise about 20 miles into the sky. But the files are not empty. They are full of "raw" information -- uncorroborated rumors often spread by anonymous sources, including paid informants, about marital infidelities, sexual orientation, drug use, political leanings and mental stability. Imagine a federally financed version of the National Enquirer with J. Edgar Hoover as its editor-in-chief.
Investigative files existed before Hoover joined the Bureau in 1917, but they multiplied exponentially during his reign as director from 1924 until his death in 1972. He maintained dossiers on Government officials, artists, writers, activists and celebrities ranging from Edward R. Murrow to Liberace. And he would often share morsels of gossip with the White House to titillate, and sometimes threaten, the presidents he served. During the Hoover years, publicly criticizing the F.B.I. or signing a petition protesting the Vietnam War was enough to spur an F.B.I. surveillance. No more.

 
 
Mastercard Knows More
 "Two types of files now exist," explained James M. Fox, former chief of the F.B.I.'s New York office. 'The first type is for people who have committed crimes or been the subject of a criminal investigation. The second is for someone nominated for a high position that requires a background check."
"You just can't collect stuff like you used to," Mr. Fox said. "In some cases the F.B.I. can collect far less information than your local credit bureau."
Most Americans don't have a file, Mr. Fox said. But those who do can expect to wait between two and four years to get the scuttlebutt. "Don't expect to get a quick answer to your request, when you've got 15,000 people in line ahead of you," said F.B.I. spokesman Bill Carter.
Why the wait? Several exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act enable agencies to censor information. In recent testimony before the House, J. Kevin O'Brien, chief of the F.B.I.'s Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts Section, blamed much of the backlog on the considerable time and resources the F.B.I spends to decide what information can be released "without harming national security, revealing confidential sources, invading personal privacy, interfering with ongoing investigations, disclosing specialized investigative techniques or revealing other sensitive information."
Critics contend that the F.B.I.'s laborious "line by line" editing erodes the Freedom of Information Act's effectiveness. "It's basically been a downhill run for the act since it was signed into law," lamented Ramsey Clark, who helped write the law when he was Attorney General under Lyndon B. Johnson."The exemptions carved into the act are overwhelmingly unwarranted."
Carl Stern, chief spokesman for the Justice Department, faults overzealous requesters. "Better than 95 percent of requests the Justice Department gets are these 'give me all you got' requests." He recalls one that included a list of questions that ran 11 typed pages, single spaced. "It would take a number of F.B.I. employees a number of years just to process that one request," he said.
Jack Greenberg, the former director of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, is intimately familiar with the F.B.I.'s Orwellian interpretation of the laws. In 1991 he received a predominantly censored file. He appealed to the bureau to reverse its decision, only to be informed that the Privacy Act also protected the confidential sources that supplied the skinny on Mr. Greenberg. So, Mr. Greenberg sued the F.B.I. in 1993. The District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Mr. Greenberg's favor, awarding him plenty of reading material as well as $18,000 in legal fees.
The full file included an assessment of Mr. Greenberg as "not subversive," transcripts of wiretapped telephone conversations between him and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a report saying he was the target of two assassination plots. "I knew about one assassination attempt, but the F.B.I. never told me of the other," said Mr. Greenberg. He still cannot fathom the bureau's stubbornness in releasing it.

 
 
High Stakes
 The Freedom of Information Act has few friends at the F.B.I. Mr. Fox recalls "going through pages and pages and pages of stuff deciding what could be excluded and what had to be released." He added, "I did not join the F.B.I. to do this. I joined the F.B.I. to catch bad guys."
The agency is trying to streamline its operations. Previously, it processed requests on a first-come-first-serve basis, but now, requests of under 100 pages are put in a separate queue. And the White House and Congress are pitching in too. To reduce file-glut, the White House requested an additional $3.3 million to hire 129 more analysts, a figure that's likely to be approved by the full Senate in September. The House offered more, nearly $14 million, to hire 350 new F.B.I. employees. But its generosity comes with a condition: the people whose files were acquired by the White House get to leapfrog to the front of the line.
Harry Hammitt, publisher of Access Reports, a newsletter that tracks the implementation of the law, suggests that Livingstone's prey should not hold their breath. "To change the F.B.I. from a very closed agency to a very open one will take a considerable amount of time," he said. "They rejected releasing Jimmy Hoffa's file because they said it's a case still under investigation. I don't think the F.B.I. will ever change its spots."

HEADLINE: Poor Losers;
Class Warfare? The Rich Win by Default.

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
YOUR chance of running into a low-income delegate among the Republicans gathering in San Diego this week is 50 to 1, only a bit higher than the chances that the next time Congress considers legislation affecting poor people, it will hear much from any of them. The Democratic National Convention will offer better odds of finding a delegate with a family income under $25,000: they'll be just 14 to 1.
It was only 10 days ago that the Senate completed action on welfare legislation whose critics said would push at least a million children into poverty. The corridors outside the chamber, usually an obstacle course of lobbyists, were deserted. Senators and Representatives, who were deluged by lobbyists and constituents two years ago when health care was the issue, heard little from the roughly 13 million people on the rolls for Aid to Families with Dependent Children. 
 More important, they heard little from them, or from poor Americans in general, at the polls in 1994. Nor do they have reason to fear them on Election Day 1996. For voting among lower-income Americans has been declining while voting among those with higher incomes has been rising.
And those trends affect political agendas for an age-old reason: Politicians get re-elected by looking after the voters who elected them the time before. So as long as turnout among poor people declines while participation among the higher income groups increases, government is unlikely to focus on issues -- or solutions -- that appeal to low-income people.
Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, argues that in 1990, 13.8 percent of the voters came from families with incomes under $15,000. In 1992, they declined to 11.0 percent. And in 1994 they were just 7.7 percent.
Why? "The basic cause is essentially that neither party is speaking to the interests of the lower-income brackets of Americans," he says. "The Democratic Party has become, in its message, studiously geared to the middle class and the Republican Party has never made any pretense of speaking to lower-income people."
It's not that the parties are altogether failing to discuss the plight of the poor. The Republican welfare bill, which President Clinton has said he will sign, is intended to encourage work and end dependency. And the Republican party platform pledges to help the poor with tax cuts and reduced regulations intended to spur economic growth.
But it's clear that the platform is aimed at middle and upper-middle class voters -- like those with $2,000 in extra cash to put in an Individual Retirement Account for a spouse without a paying job. With 2 percent of the delegates surveyed by The New York Times/CBS News Poll reporting family incomes of $25,000 or less, the average somewhere around $75,000 and 11 percent over $200,000, there is little in the economic section of the platform to bother the delegates themselves.
Even so, the Republicans say how they will help "the poor." The Democratic platform that was recommended Monday in Pittsburgh avoids the word desperately. It appears in a list of Republican sins, what it calls "their wrong-headed and mean-spirited efforts to punish the poor." The Democrats say good things about the Earned Income Tax Credit and raising the minimum wage, but they never whisper the word "poor" to identify the beneficiaries of those programs -- who at least have jobs.
That hesitancy, which was seen last year when some Democratic Senators were briefly reluctant to support such a bedrock party issue as raising the minimum wage, may contribute to the declining turnout -- which, in a vicious circle, may then contribute to more avoidance of those issues.

 
 
High Stakes
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson attributed the recent decline to a lack of "candidates who inspire hope." But he said that in about 50 House districts this fall, he planned to emphasize the importance of voting, and the hope of wresting Congress from the Republicans: "The stakes are very high, and much higher than the Presidential campaign."
Black leaders are not the only ones to worry about declining interest among poor voters. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York was eloquent last September, when the first version of the welfare bill was passed, asking the Senate: "Why do we not see the endless parade of petitioners, the lobbyists, the pretend citizen groups, the real citizen groups? None are here."
Last week, he said a major reason for the decline was an intellectual disdain many Democratic reformers of the 1970's held for "the political views of working class, low-income voters, which were at odds with the patrician left." That disdain, he said, led them to curb the role of low-income voters in party politics.
The welfare bill actually may not be a particularly salient example of the effect of lower voting rates among blacks. Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here, said that over 30 years, "attitudes toward welfare have almost inexorably led to a bill like this."
"If there had been a Democratic majority in the Congress, it would have been somewhat softer," he said. "But there still would have been time limits and mandatory work. Maybe the poor don't vote. Maybe that made it worse. But you have this underlying tide."
Another cautionary voice is that of Ruy A. Teixeira of the Economic Policy Institute. He said turnout differences had less to do with the political agenda than with hostility toward government among the rest of the electorate. "The poor," he said, "have always been at the mercy of the views and opinions of the middle-class voter."
Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the longest-serving black in Congress, said he was dismayed at a turnout of only 17 percent in Detroit in last week's primary, about two-thirds of the normal level.
"I'll tell you what surprised me," he said. "I have never heard any more complaints about the government's insensitivity to what people need in this country than there have been under the Gingrich leadership. Yet at the same time, instead of that translating into a remarkable turnout, an angry protest at the polls, it turns into a whimper."

HEADLINE: Russia Reopens Its Cosmopolitan Door to the Pacific

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia

 BODY:
One day this spring, Canadian Navy sailors climbed a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean and put marble headstones over graves of American and Canadian soldiers who died here while fighting against the Bolsheviks in 1918. Down the hill, workmen are restoring the Beaux Arts terminal of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Nearby, work is to start on another turn-of-the-century tourist attraction -- a mansion that the Communists expropriated from the family of Yul Brynner, the actor.
As if awakening from a decades-old deep sleep, this Pacific port is slowly reassuming the character that once made it one of Russia's most cosmopolitan cities. A free port in Czarist days, Vladivostok virtually dropped off Westerners' maps after the Communists took control here in 1922. 
 In 1948, Stalin closed the American Consulate here and shut the entire city, where the Soviet fleet was based, to outsiders. When Vladivostok finally reopened in 1992, foreign euphoria easily matched local euphoria.
With a deep-water harbor and a rail link to Moscow, Vladivostok is a natural gateway to Russia's Far East, a region rich in mineral resources and timber. Already Vladivostok and its sister port, Nakhodka, handle a quarter of Russia's foreign trade.
But almost five years after the opening, Vladivostok's landscape, like much of Russia's, is littered with failed American enterprises. After $10 million in investments, a Giant supermarket complex stands like a 90,000-square-foot beached whale after the American backers pulled out in May.
American companies leaving this year include I.B.M., Deloitte & Touche, and an experienced guide to American investors, the Pacific Law Center.
"It's impossible to do business honestly in Russia because of the taxes," an American businessman said last week in the hushed privacy of Nostalgia, a restaurant with red velour walls hung with oil portraits of Czar Nicholas II.
In addition to taxes that eat up profits, bribes and bureaucracy have taken the bloom off the city's coming-out party.
"The fishing companies complain that the only way to get the quotas is to go to Moscow with suitcases full of money," said Deborah Turnbull, associate editor of Russian Far East Update, a based business monthly based in Seattle.
But for every step taken backward, this tough sailor's town seems to lurch forward two steps.
"There is so much potential here that the greatest Slavic control freak in the world can't keep his hands on it," said Vladimir Berzonsky Jr., an American lawyer of Russian origin who opened his law office here in October.
Indeed, despite setbacks, this city has not seen such a strong American presence since 1918, the year the Brooklyn dropped anchor here with the first doughboys of the American expeditionary forces.
A seven-story American Consulate has opened on Pushkin Street, where it enjoys a commanding view of the long-secret harbor. As trans-Pacific contacts mushroom, the consulate now stamps out visas at the rate of 10,000 a year.
In a city where local residents were taught only five years ago to denounce all foreigners to the K.G.B., there is now a biweekly English-language newspaper, Vladivostok News, and daily CNN programming on a local television channel. This fall, an American-style international school is to open here, the first since the 1920's.
Once a cold-war flash point where American spy planes were shot down while testing Soviet anti-aircraft defenses, military tensions are now at their lowest levels in memory.
In a sign of waning xenophobia, the first foreigner, Andrew M. Fox of Britain, was elected in April to the board of the private company that runs Vladivostok's port.
Western institutions are taking root again after a long absence. The Vladivostok Rotary Club now has so many members that it will spin off a new club next month. Swelling the membership are officers of Coca-Cola, which started bottling here in May.
Russian Orthodox churches have opened, although the cathedral was destroyed by Soviet troops in 1937. High on one of the roller-coaster hills, Roman Catholic Mass once again resonates within the red-brick walls of Most Holy Mother of God Church, a sanctuary that until three years ago was a state archive. Later this year, the army is to remove cannons and war exhibits from a military museum. This crumbling neo-Gothic building is to be restored to its original owner, the Lutheran Church.
But, on the business front, most foreign investors have looked Vladivostok's taxes and bureaucracy in the eye -- and have decided to wait.
"The problems we have here are the same to all of Russia," said Pavel Morozov, international director of Acfes, a Russian conglomerate based here. "The rules are always changing. You sit down to play poker -- and then discover that you are playing baccarat."
Shaun Going, a Canadian who was hired last fall to build housing here for American diplomats, is still waiting for permits while an entire construction season slips by.
Commuting between here and Albania, where he also builds houses, he said, "It's easier to do business in Albania."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CITY;
Heady Times for 'New' San Diego

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
To most Americans, this city in the country's sunny southwestern corner is perhaps best known for its Navy base, its zoo, its 12-meter racing yachts and, icon of icons, that red-roofed wooden pile called the Hotel Del Coronado.
But that was the old San Diego. 
 The new San Diego, the oh-so-Republican city and surrounding county chosen as the site of the 1996 Republican National Convention, has all of those things -- and then some.
In recent years, particularly since Southern California was laid economically low by the national recession and the reductions of the armed forces and the aerospace industry, San Diego has begun to transform itself from a pleasant but somewhat bland town of sailors, tourists, retirees and military industrial workers into one of the nation's leading high-tech centers, a cyber comer on the Pacific Rim.
Within the metropolitan area -- San Diego County is home to 2.7 million people, with 1.8 million of them in the city, the nation's sixth-largest -- there are more than 350 software producers, more than 200 telecommunications companies and at least that many biotechnology and medical concerns.
These days, San Diegans like to brag that their city is the next Silicon Valley, an upscale, heavily suburban, families-not-glitz place of unfettered all-American inventiveness, ingenuity and capitalism.
What better setting for a gathering of the Grand Old Party?
"We've turned it around and we're off and running in a new direction," boasts Mayor Susan Golding, a Republican who, like most San Diego leaders, endlessly preaches slow, steady, clean urban growth -- lest blighted sprawl bedevil smokestackless San Diego as it bedevils Los Angeles, that glitzy Democratic behemoth up the coast that San Diegans so love to hate.
Thanks to the high-tech revolution, the San Diego unemployment rate, which jumped close to 10 percent in the depths of the recession, was down to 5.2 percent in June, the latest month for which complete figures are available. That was a notch better than the national average of 5.3 percent and almost a full two percentage points better than the overall California average of 7.1 percent.
Just in the past year, more than 20,000 new jobs have been created here -- 65,000 were lost in the recession -- and city statisticians say that now, for the first time in the better part of a decade, more people are moving in than out.
Most telling of all, here and there on sunny inland hilltops with views of the distant Mediterranean-like Pacific Coast, there can now be seen that rarest of post-recession California sights: construction of new houses, office parks and shopping malls.

Lingering Problems In the Comeback
On a discordant note, San Diego, even as it bounces back and moves into high tech, still faces some serious problems.
It badly needs a larger airport, more container-ship docks, improved rail connections, a better water supply and a safe place to store low-grade radioactive waste. There are too many high school dropouts and too few low-income housing units and too many underemployed people.
"Life can be so pleasant in San Diego that we sometimes tend to forget or gloss over that we're not in heaven, not yet," said Neil Morgan, who has been writing newspaper columns and books about San Diego and the West since migrating here 50 years ago from North Carolina. "There are still people hurting. There is still pressing work to do."
Most pressing, at least in the short term, is the problem of illegal immigration.
San Diego, whose environs stretch south to the Mexican border and teeming Tijuana, is struggling with the most serious increase of undocumented immigrants anywhere in the country, an illegal influx the Federal Government has thus far been unable to slow very much.
It is an increase that has weakened ties between many whites, who make up about two-thirds of the population, and the Hispanic residents, who account for nearly 25 percent.
It is also an increase that threatens to divide the city into haves and have-nots, and that is casting doubt on proud assertions at City Hall that San Diego will not only be the next Silicon Valley but will also be the "first great city of the 21st century."
Finally, it is an invasion that has soured some San Diegans on the need for stronger social and economic ties with its sibling Tijuana, though officials in both cities continue to press for more ties, particularly since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
A common nightly sight along the border is patrol agents in hot pursuit of ragged clutches of people desperately trying to sneak into the land of opportunity, hoping to find work, here and elsewhere, not as highly paid high-technology engineers and scientists but as faceless, undocumented day laborers, dishwashers, maids and gardeners.
Without knowing it, the Republican conventioneers will be mixing with some of these people as, festooned with elephant-shaped badges and funny red-white-and-blue hats, they partake of the tourist delights of San Diego's rejuvenated downtown business district, hard by a harbor with hulking gray warships and graceful white pleasure yachts.
Then, just before leaving town, the conventioneers will probably adopt a platform plank that reiterates their party's longstanding call for tougher controls on immigration.
"All this focus in recent years on immigration has caused serious deterioration in relations between our white and Latino communities," said Juan Vargas, the City Council member who represents the city's heavily Hispanic, heavily Democratic Eighth District. "There's more and more tension. It's true that San Diego is making a comeback. But my people are not getting their fair share. We still have a 40 percent high school dropout rate, and we still are a community of house renters, not buyers, and we're still underemployed and underpaid."

Booming Growth In High-Tech Jobs
Still, the biggest nonpolitical news as the Republicans gather here concerns not immigration but high technology.
San Diego continues to be heavily dependent on the Navy, tourism and a steady influx of well-to-do retirees to maintain its quiet (this is not Surf City), comfortable (average household income: $65,400), mainstream Republican (fiscally conservative, socially moderate) style in a climate that just might be the most consistently pleasant in the United States (sunny 70 percent of the time, with an average temperature of 62.3 degrees Fahrenheit).
But of late, in the aftermath of a great recession, San Diego is also a city where white-frocked bioscientists have settled and begun making big money by developing new drugs and health treatments, where electronic innovators are coming up with wizard ways to communicate and where flocks of computer experts are producing cutting-edge software that can compete with anything coming out of the Silicon Valley.
Just about all of California is now well along the road to economic recovery (with polls indicating that one of the biggest political beneficiaries is Bill Clinton, not Bob Dole). But the recovery here is striking.
"We're not yet growing like we were in the Roaring 80's, but when your unemployment rate is better than both the state and national averages, you've got something important to talk about," said Mike Madigan of Pardee Construction, one of the region's largest developers.
Many of the new high-tech companies employ fewer than 50 workers. The ambitious entrepreneurs who run them often labor side by side with recently hired workers.
Such business compactness is one of the universal hallmarks of California's comeback this time around. But the proliferation of small companies in the San Diego area is particularly notable, especially in the valleys lying east of the idyllic coastal cliffs neighborhood of La Jolla.
A few of the new concerns here have even managed to grow recently to 500 or more employees. Given the history of high-tech growth, they could have 5,000 or more employees in another year or so.
"There's just the right critical mass for tremendous high-tech growth in San Diego," said Jim Madsen, an engineer who in the depths of the recession helped establish Next Wave, a company that specializes in digital wireless communication and recently hired its 200th employee.
"The universities in the area and the defense and aerospace companies helped get things started by providing a lot of the initial research and development brain power and expertise," Mr. Madsen said. "Then individual scientists and engineers began to break off and start their own operations, particularly after defense and aerospace began to downsize. Then some of those operations began to spin off entrepreneurs.
"It just goes on and on. You throw in the great quality of life that we have down here, and what you have is another great American success story."

Contrasting Views Of City's Future
There are voices of caution.
Steve Erie, a political scientist on the San Diego campus of the University of California and a close student of Southern California, holds that the city will never be one of the great metropolises of the Pacific Rim unless it moves to improve its transportation system and services.
"There's a lot of boastful talk by the Mayor and others," he said, "but realistically, San Diego is going to march in place until it improves on such basics as the airport, rails, water, waste dumps. It can go high-tech -- and still not go anywhere."
The San Diego airport has one runway and cannot handle fully loaded jumbo jets. Few flights are nonstops, and many San Diego passengers use the Los Angeles airport, about 100 miles away.
Similarly, the city's commercial piers are so few and small that most sea shipments must pass through the Long Beach-Los Angeles port, hauled to and from San Diego by trucks fighting heavy freeway traffic or by trains on rail lines that are little better than a spur.
Much of San Diego's water comes from Los Angeles, though the city recently took action to lighten that dependence by negotiating to purchase some supplies from agriculture interests in the Imperial Valley. But that agreement may be challenged in court.
"We've got ourselves a city run by people afraid to rock the boat," Mr. Erie said. "They've been talking about a new airport and all these other things for years and years. This is a phantom city, not the 'first great city of the 21st century.' "
Mayor Golding is having none of that. "What the people who come to this convention will see," the Mayor said, "is a strong city, a city on the move. We have the basics, and we're going to grow even stronger. With our new high-tech underpinning and our increasingly important cross-border trade and our terrific location on the Pacific Rim, we're bound for greatness."

HEADLINE: Defying U.S., Turkey to Sign Gas Deal in Iran

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Defying a new United States law that imposes sanctions on major investments in Libya and Iran, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey arrived here today and said he hopes to sign a $20 billion natural gas agreement.
But Mr. Erbakan said his visit here, which is schedule to last three days, was not intended as a challenge to the United States, which accuses Iran and Libya of sponsoring international terrorism. 
 "Our visit has no aims against the United States, which is also our friend and ally," he said after arriving today at Teheran's airport, where he was greeted by an honor guard.
Mr. Erbakan, who leads Turkey's Islamic party, added that, "We shall open a new era in our relations with our Muslim brother, Iran."
When asked if he would sign the gas accord, Mr. Erbakan said, "I'm here to sign many agreements and improve ties." He is expected to meet several times with President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
The visit, Mr. Erbakan's first official trip abroad since taking office in June, has been viewed with a wary eye by officials in Washington, and the gas accord would be the first to fall under the new sanctions law.
The United States and the West have also expressed concerns over the rise of Mr. Erbakan's coalition in Turkey, the country's first Islamic-leaning Government since the state was founded after World War I. Turkey's own military, guardians of the country's secular tradition, has also viewed Mr. Erbakan with suspicion.
President Clinton signed the sanctions law on Monday. It would punishforeign companies making new investments of more than $40 million a year in the oil and gas sectors of Iran and Libya. The legislation has been widely criticized by the European Union and Russia, which have said they will not abide by it.
Since taking office, Mr. Erbakan has sought to expand ties with Muslim countries while trying not to alarm Turkey's Western allies.
Iran's clerical Muslim leaders, who disdain the separation of religion and politics, see Mr. Erbakan as one of their own. And Iran's state-controlled newspapers have portrayed the Turkish leader's visit as evidence of the failure of American efforts to isolate Iran.
Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, said on Thursday that the gas accord would be signed during Mr. Erbakan's visit. The 22-year agreement would allow Iran to sell 140 billion cubic feet of gas a year to Turkey beginning in 1998, and to build pipelines in Iran and Turkey.
Trade between the two countries totaled nearly $1 billion last year. Still, they have had their differences.
Turkey has been suspicious that Iran may be behind various terrorist attacks in Turkey that have been blamed on Muslim militants. It has also accused Iran of backing rebel Kurds fighting for autonomy in the south. In June, Iran accused Turkey of a cross-border attack in which six Iranians were killed.
But Iran has expressed hope that Mr. Erbakan's Islamic political leanings will provide a new start to relations.

THE CAMPAIGNS FOR CONGRESS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:

North Carolina
Helms Is Showing A Warmer Side
A touchy-feely Jesse Helms? Who would have thought it? 
 Certainly no one who saw the first television commercial of Senator Helms's re-election campaign, broadcast in April, would have called the Senator huggable.
In the style of Senator Helms, Republican of North Carolina, the commercial was a blunt-edged attack on the two Democrats who were competing to oppose him this fall. Its main points were that both supported "racial preferences in hiring" and "extending health insurance to homosexual partners."
It harkened back to Mr. Helms's last contest, in 1990, when he defeated a black Democrat, Harvey Gantt, in a bitter contest that was notable in part because of Mr. Helms's subtle emphasis on race. Mr. Gantt is back for a second try, having won the Democratic primary in April. And now, voters are seeing the softer side of Mr. Helms.
His latest television advertisement, on crime, opens with a manacled prisoner being unshackled as a narrator recalls how violent criminals used to be released from jail early. The prisoner is distinctly Caucasian. The commercial ends with a little girl ambling safely down a country road.
For years, Mr. Helms has been among the most adamant opponents of abortion in Congress, saying in 1990 that he "will never sit idly by while people say it's just a choice." But last week, Mr. Helms told The Associated Press that he understood the position of abortion rights backers; they also dislike abortion, but "it's the choice part that they're talking about."
In 1990, Mr. Helms answered journalists' questions only by fax. In 1996, he is available for interviews "as often as time permits," said his spokeswoman, Julie Wilkie. Ms. Wilkie says Mr. Helms's abortion statement is not a softening of his views. The Gantt camp says the new Mr. Helms "is a lot like the old Jesse."
Others wonder, noting that Mr. Helms has dumped his old red-meat campaign strategists, from the Congressional Club, and hired a Texas media adviser, Scott Howell, who is renowned for his heartstring-plucking commercials.
"The guy's been born again," said Ted Arrington, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. "This is an enormous change."
But Professor Arrington adds that Mr. Helms comfortably leads Mr. Gantt in the latest polls. "The real test of a candidate's intentions," he said, "is what he does when he's slightly behind."

Kentucky
Riding to Hounds For a Republican
First there was Chicken George, the Democrat in a chicken suit who followed President George Bush in 1992 to spread the accusation that Mr. Bush was afraid to debate Bill Clinton. Then came Butt Man, the filter-tipped Democrat who trailed Bob Dole this summer after Mr. Dole questioned whether nicotine was addictive.
Now meet their linear descendant, a nattily attired fellow working for the re-election campaign of Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.
Hunt Man, as the McConnell campaign calls him, sports the red velvet coat, jodhpurs, black riding boots and black helmet of a patrician fox hunter. In the last week, he has begun to show up at campaign appearances by Mr. McConnell's Democratic challenger, Steve Beshear.
Mr. Beshear, a former Lieutenant Governor who is now a lawyer in Lexington, depicts Mr. McConnell as a Newt Gingrich-style Republican who is bent on slashing benefits to ordinary folk, and says his values more closely reflect the tenor of the state.
Mr. McConnell disagrees. As evidence, he notes that Mr. Beshear belonged to an exclusive fox-hunting club in Lexington's horse country even as he carried nearly $80,000 in unpaid debts to supporters from a failed 1987 campaign for governor.
To underscore that point, Hunt Man is pounding the Beshear campaign trail with a sign reading "Fox Hunters for Beshear" and yelling "Tally ho!" at inopportune moments.
Mr. McConnell's campaign manager, Kyle Simmons, said Hunt Man was doing an excellent job. "I wouldn't be surprised if he shows up throughout the remaining days of the campaign," Mr. Simmons said.

Wyoming
Democratic Chance In Senate Race?
Alan Simpson is leaving the Senate at year's end, and the departure of the eclectic Republican is leaving a hole in the Wyoming political scene as big as -- well, as big as Wyoming.
For the first time in 26 years, a Democrat may have a chance to fill it.
Wyoming voters will choose nominees to Mr. Simpson's Senate seat on Aug. 20, and nine Republicans are fighting for the job. While polls are scant in a state of only 450,000 people and no major news markets, the race appears to have narrowed to a Casper surgeon and television personality, Dr. John Barrasso, and State Senator Mike Enzi, a former Mayor of Gillette, a mining boomtown. Both are more conservative than Mr. Simpson.
Whoever wins will face a well-liked Democrat: Kathy Karpan, a coal-miner's daughter who became Wyoming's Secretary of State and now practices law in Cheyenne. Ms. Karpan has a record of budget-cutting in state government. Like Mr. Simpson, she is for abortion rights and against gun control. And even Republicans admire her campaign skills.
"She's smart," said Mike Meenan, the brother and campaign manager of one of the Republican candidates, Kevin Meenan, "a heck of a stump speaker; a very good politician."
Whether that will get her to the Senate is another matter. Ms. Karpan has already lost one statewide race, for governor in 1994, when she was buried with other Democrats in that fall's national Republican landslide.
"Her numbers are pretty good," said Stuart Rothenberg, a political handicapper. "The problem comes when the question is, 'Do they want to send Kathy Karpan or any Democrat to Washington?' I think she has a shot, but that's about it."
Bob Beck, a University of Wyoming instructor and news director of the state's public radio network, said he believed that Ms. Karpan could overcome Wyoming's suspicion of Washington Democrats. One reason, Mr. Beck said, is that the national backlash against the Republican Congress is as fierce in Wyoming as in most other states.
Her real problem, he said, is that the most revered politician in Wyoming history is likely to be stumping for her Republican opponent, whoever he may be.
"She'll be running against Al Simpson, whether she likes it or not," Mr. Beck said. "If she can overcome that, I think she's got an excellent shot at winning."
Ms. Karpan faces her own battle in the Wyoming Senate primary, but nobody expects her to lose. Her opponent is Mickey Kalinay, a 43-year-old student who maintains a home page on the World Wide Web. Mr. Kalinay proposes to create jobs and bolster the economy by building a 22,000-mile tower for future space exploration. MICHAEL WINES

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING;
All Eyes Are on Maxis At Hawaii Regatta

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
What do you do with two giant maxi-yachts that needed to be transported to Hawaii for racing this week in the Kenwood Cup regatta? Since there wasn't enough time to sail them there, the owners booked them a flight.
"We had only 46 inches to spare," said Peter Wilson about loading the pair of 80-foot maxis end-to-end on a huge Russian cargo plane, an Antonov AN124-100 RUSLAN. "I was sweating it a bit. We put them in the cargo hold bow-to-bow so that we could overlap them. Then we had to fit in two keels, two masts and two boat cradles. At the end of the day, the airplane was the most economical way to do it." 
 The trip, coordinated by Wilson's company, Marine Construction Management of Newport, R.I., cost about $225,000. The maxi-yachts Boomerang and Sagamore were flown from Quonset, a military air base in Rhode Island. The two sailboats made it in time for the start last Monday of the Kenwood Cup, a biennial nine-race regatta that continues off Honolulu through this Friday.
Among the five maxi-yachts racing in the 45-boat fleet, the leader as of yesterday was Sayonara, a Farr 78 being steered by Chris Dickson of New Zealand. Over all, the competition, which includes yachts as small as 35 feet, is turning out to be intense.
"The quality of the fleet is the most competitive in the event's 18-year history," said Ken Morrison, race director. "There are no dogs out there. The oldest boat in the fleet is four or five years old, and 90 percent of the boats were built within the last two years."
The racing roster includes nine sailboats in a highly competitive Mumm 36 Class, and 14 cruiser-racers sailing under the International Measurement System handicap rule. Ten of those boats are taking advantage of a new change in the rule that gives them a 1 percent handicap allowance over grand prix racing boats.
Still, all eyes are on the maxis, those multimillion-dollar, high-tech leviathans of the sea that maneuver like dolphins. Within that elite pack, at the outset of racing last week, it looked to be a fight between two of the newest maxis and their eager owners, both of whom are computer software moguls.
Hasso Plattner of Germany, chief executive officer of SAP, the German applications software company, owns Fancourt's Morning Glory, a new Reichel/Pugh 80; and Larry Ellison, chief executive officer of the Oracle Corporation, an international software company based in Redwood Shores, Calif., owns Sayonara.
Plattner had enlisted Russell Coutts of New Zealand to steer Fancourt's Morning Glory; Ellison hired Dickson, who, like Coutts, is a top New Zealand sailor and America's Cup veteran.
But in racing last Tuesday, Morning Glory lost its mast in a 20-knot breeze. In the day's first race, a steady trade wind blew off Diamond Head near Oahu as Sayonara crossed the finish line 33 seconds ahead of the black-hulled Morning Glory.
By afternoon, big Pacific sea swells rolled across the windward-leeward course. At the beginning of the second race, both maxis came up to the start line too early, and crossed prematurely. Their penalty -- to return and round again -- gave Plattner's boat the advantage over Sayonara.
But not for long.
On its approach to the first windward mark, Fancourt's Morning Glory snapped its carbon fiber mast. None of the crew was hurt, but the incident put the anxious team and disabled yacht out of further competition.
Sayonara was first; in second was Falcon 2000, a new Nelson/Marek 78 owned by Donald Smith of Oklahoma City. The boat, being steered by Ed Baird, is a training yacht for PACT 2000, the 1999-2000 America's Cup challenge team sponsored by the New York Yacht Club.
"We're really disappointed they can't sail anymore with us," Baird said Friday. "Five of these big maxis sailing around together is just awesome."
Boomerang, a Frers 80 owned by George Coumantaros of New York, was third. The yacht's tactician is Paul Cayard, skipper for the 1999-2000 America's Cup challenge from the St. Francis Yacht Club of San Francisco. In fourth was Sagamore, a Sparkman & Stephens 82 owned by James Dolan of Oyster Bay, L.I.
In the 150-mile overnight Molokai Race Wednesday and Thursday, Sayonara finished first among the maxis.
 
MAKING WAVES
The ever-growing One Design 48 sailing fleet is planning on adding a sixth member to its fledgling ranks Friday when the group gathers for the Verve Cup in Chicago. The newest of the 48-foot sloops -- not as yet named --is being chartered by DEAN TANK of Chicago. The other five ID48's competing are: Leading Edge; Windquest; Indulgence Corum Watches; Abracadabra, and Australia Challenge 2000.

HEADLINE: For Sale: Zambia's Rich Copper Mines, All of Them

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia

 BODY:
It's easy to tell where the real money in Zambia is. Just look underfoot.
The carpet runners in the dingy halls of the Ministry of Finance are made of scuffed plastic. But in the lovely open-atrium headquarters of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the runners are custom woven with the company logo: the roan antelope that back in 1902 was shot by a prospector who found its body lying atop a rich vein of green ore. 
 The national copper company produces 90 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange. It employs nearly 50,000 people. In a country where the average income is about $350 a year, it owns guest houses where visitors gaze across lakes into Zaire while dining off ivy-patterned china. Its hospital in Kitwe has the country's only CAT scanner. Its Mpelembe High School for miners' children has a pass rate on national exams of nearly 100 percent.
And it is all up for sale.
The company (universally referred to by its initials, Z.C.C.M.) is the crown jewel in Zambia's aggressive privatization program, which is converting 27 years of command-economy socialism under former President Kenneth D. Kaunda into what may be Africa's freest economy.
Since Frederick Chiluba came to power in 1991 in Zambia's first multiparty elections, he has moved to reverse Mr. Kaunda's policies and to Westernize the economy with a combination of help and arm-twisting from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the lead lenders for the $6.3 billion in external debt the country is carrying.
All exchange controls, tariff barriers and food subsidies have been dropped in the shock-treatment switch-over to rampant capitalism.
Virtually everything the state owned is for sale, from the national concrete industry to corner grocery stores to antique steam trains to leases on camps in the national parks. In the last two years, 140 enterprises have been sold, said Valentine Chitalu, chief executive of the Zambian Privatization Agency.
"We had to liberalize quickly," Mr. Chitalu said. "For years, Zambia was 80 percent state-owned, and the worst-run country in Africa. There were no goods in the shops, and you could wait five hours for a bus. So the political outrage that could create a climate for privatization was there. Now it's just a matter of keeping our nerve."
Mr. Chitalu, who is 34, commands enormous respect from the Western bankers and diplomats with whom he works. Last year, in a study of Zambia's work so far, the private research institute S.R.I. International, in Menlo Park, Calif., praised the privatization program, saying that if it kept up its momentum, it would be "a model for the African continent." Its momentum has since increased.
Foreign buyers, particularly South African and British ones, are snapping up the economy. Tate & Lyle, the British food company, bought the national sugar industry for $63 million. "Now it's their lowest-cost producer," Mr. Chitalu said.
Lonrho, another British conglomerate, bought the cotton industry. South African Breweries bought one of two national breweries; Shoprite of South Africa absorbed state stores into its grocery chain.
Last month, it was announced that the biggest prize, the copper company, would be offered for sale, probably in four packages: three mine-smelter combinations and a power company. Its lesser assets, from its private airline to cobalt-rich furnace slag, may be sold separately.
As in all its other sales, the Zambian Government has outside help. The privatization agency has five Wall Street investment bankers on staff, their salaries paid by the United States Agency for International Development. The copper deal is so big that the World Bank brought in the investment bank N. M. Rothschild & Sons and the London law firm Clifford Chance as consultants.
None of this is to say that the copper company is thriving. For 20 years, Mr. Kaunda's Government drained off the foreign exchange it earned, refusing to plow back enough to buy new machinery. Annual production fell from a peak of 700,000 tons in 1969 to fewer than 300,000 last year. And copper prices have been in a slump since the 1970's. The company lost about $40 million in the first quarter of this year.
Huge investments are needed. The Nchanga open-pit mine, the company's most productive, needs $150 million in new equipment, one expert estimated. Right now, the cash crunch is so bad that it cannot buy a simple gravel crusher to harden the pit's roads during the rainy season.
But, despite the problems, big mining companies like South Africa's Anglovaal and America's Phelps Dodge are showing interest. The company is setting up an office at each mine where geological, metallurgical and financial information will be concentrated for the stream of investors it hopes are coming.
And a tour 3,000 feet down into the Konkola mine shows the huge potential -- and huge potential costs -- that investors face. Konkola is the wettest mine in the world, shedding 50 tons of water for every ton of ore extracted. Where aquifers are being drained to make new shafts possible, miners and visitors wade through tunnels thigh-deep in water.
John Kalubai, who runs a cavernous underground pumping station, seems remarkably calm for a man who, in a power failure, has 20 minutes to restart his pumps or drown. "It's worked pretty smoothly for 23 years," he said. "But it's getting harder to afford spare parts."
Once the underground lake is empty, miners can begin sinking much deeper shafts to get at a huge formation that is 3.8 percent copper -- three times as rich as many mines in the Americas -- and big enough to last 100 years. But the cost of the digging has been estimated at $600 million.
Of great concern to the ordinary miner is whether the new buyers will keep the mine schools, hospitals, housing tracts and pension plans that have made being a copper miner in Zambia a more dignified experience than being a gold miner in South Africa, despite the lower pay.
"The Government seems desperate to sell, so they might let the schools go," said a decidedly pessimistic Michael Tandeo, an administrator of the mine schools, 70 percent of whose operating expenses are paid by the company. "If I were a businessman, my heart would be in the shafts, the copper, in making a profit. It's a decision I'd probably take."
The Government has no clear stand on the issue. It is not requiring buyers to agree to retain the social services.
Edwin Koloko, head of the company's privatization effort, said buyers may choose to jettison them. "But they may find that it's in their best interests to keep them," he added.
The schools, for example, were created so that British mine managers would agree to move their families from Welsh coal fields to the Zambian copper belt. Now the student body is 97 percent Zambian, but the school is an important part of keeping managers, whether local or expatriate, happy.
Similarly, a mine hospital has more interest in saving an injured miner, if only to get him back underground, than a Government hospital.
The Mineworkers' Union of Zambia wants to keep all the social services, but the Government recently removed its president, Ernest Mutale, from the company's board, so he is no longer privy to information about bids.
"We'll negotiate with whoever is buying to make sure we still have access to these facilities we sweated for," he warned. "We do say to investors: Zambia is not for sale. If you plan to make things worse than you found them, then take your money and go away."
All those factors will be taken into consideration in whatever deal is struck.
"We've moved away from just looking at price," said Mr. Chitalu, of the privatization agency. "We look at the whole package -- whether the buyer agrees to set up training programs, or start up other industries, or introduce employee-ownership schemes."
"We need to send a message," he added, summing up the privatization effort as he was leaving for Asia to search for new investors. "Profit can be made in Africa, and southern Africa isn't just South Africa."

Kemp's Vision for Americans And for a Dole Presidency

 BODY:
Following are remarks made by Jack F. Kemp yesterday in Russell, Kan., where he was introduced by Bob Dole as his Vice-Presidential running mate, as transcribed by The New York Times:
Bob, thank you so very, very much for that wonderful introduction and that great welcome to Russell, Kansas, for Joanne and me. We just happened to be in the neighborhood. 
 To those who have heard me speak before it may be somewhat of a disappointment. I understand this is going to be a short Jack Kemp speech. I kind of got a feeling it was going to be short at lunch today with Elizabeth and Robin.
I turned today and I said, "Bob, how long would you like me to speak?" He said: "Kemp you can speak as long as you want. But we're only going to be here for five more minutes, or until it rains, right?"
It is no secret that I believe this is the most exciting time in the most eventful century in human history. Here on the eve of the third century, the 21st century and the third millennium, American ideals and American ideas grip the imagination of men and women in every corner of the globe.
In every country in which we travel you hear the echoes of 1776, the words of our Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal. The history of our nation has become the central feature of the history of the world. There is no more challenging nor exhilarating time in history to help shape America's leadership and America's future.
And let me say from the bottom of my heart to Bob and Elizabeth, to their daughter, Robin, with my wife at my side, I don't believe there's a higher honor than the one that Bob Dole has bestowed upon me and my dear family and my wife, Joanne.
It will be with a keen sense of determination as well as confidence in our ultimate victory that I accept the challenge and trust of running on Bob Dole's ticket for Vice President of the United States of America. It is within our grasp to renew America's promise, its possibilities and most of all its potential.
Bob Dole has formally accepted that challenge. He has unfurled our banner of growth and opportunity and hope and cultural renewal. He has proposed to fundamentally reorganize and finally change and reform the way Government does business. He wants to expand equality of opportunity for all our people. That's made the Republican Party the Lincoln party. It's now the Lincoln-Reagan-Dole reform party for America.
When he proposed major tax cuts, when Bob Dole and his team proposed major tax cuts to get America growing again, the Clinton White House immediately came out with a million reasons why it just couldn't be done.
But it forgot the real lives of millions of our fellow Americans, parents who lay awake at night because they can't pay their taxes or their bills; workers in the permanent recession of stagnant wages; the children of poverty in America's inner cities who have never seen a business open in their life.
They face despair instead of opportunity and a shot at the American dream. Tell them that the status quo is good enough. Tell them we can't do better, and grow faster. Tell them that inflation is caused by too much economic growth.
I am especially excited about Bob's bold proposal because our final goal is even bolder. This is just the beginning. This is just a down payment on true reform, reorganization and renewal.
Bob Dole's vision, Bob's vision is to start with a blank slate, create a fairer, flatter, simpler tax code that will carry us into the next century and into unimagined prosperity in our children's future.
Bob Dole knows it's time to release the pent-up and the great potential of human freedom and the free men and women of our free society.
It's a hopeful agenda. It's an inclusive agenda. And it's one that Bob has described that is not just limited to taxes. It extends to welfare and education, crime, drugs, breaking the destructive monopoly of Federal power, giving authority and resources and responsibility to states and families.
In every area, Republicans today are testing and confronting the frontiers of true ambitious reform. This is the place for the people of America who want to reform this great nation and our Government.
On one side the Clinton Administration seems satisfied with a kind of stagnation. On the other side Bob Dole is pursuing the high road begun by Ronald Reagan in 1980, a positive, specific agenda of restoring hope, cultural renewal and growth.
An election should be about most of all, the big things that touch our lives. I can't wait to make that case. I can't wait to make that case for Bob Dole in every community and every neighborhood of the United States of America.
This above all is a great nation. And we have a great mission and a great cause. The entire world is looking to America for inspiration and leadership. More than ever, we are the bright signal in an otherwise dark night. And our country needs a leader whose stature is equal to that calling. And it's Bob Dole.
We need someone who will fight for his principles, who loves America, knows what it means to sacrifice for others, to sacrifice for his nation, to demonstrate courage under fire, a leader who has throughout his career brought together men and women of all parties and all backgrounds and all colors in a common cause. Bob Dole is that man.
Let me close by suggesting that in recent years it has been a Presidential practice when delivering a State of the Union address to turn and introduce the heroes in the balcony. Next year when Bob Dole delivers the State of the Union address there will be a hero at the podium.
He'll be able to, if you let me finish my speech. Let me take a moment to put our opponents on notice. Bob and I are going to be asking for the support of every single American from the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California.
The appeal of growth and opportunity crosses every boundary of geography and climate and race. Reaching these voters, shaking hands and touching hearts is our foremost goal. We may not get every vote. But we're going to make it unambiguously clear, in word and in our actions, that we want to and intend to represent the whole American family. That no one will be left behind and no one will be turned away. That's the Bob Dole mission for America.
One other thought: the great purpose of a great party is not to defeat the other party. The purpose of a great party is to provide superior leadership and great ideas and to motivate, inspire and take this country up, not divide us.
Our goal is not just to win, but to be worthy of winning. Bob and I are asking Americans to believe again in the promise of the American dream. To reach once more for the distant stars.
We ask for your hands. We ask for your hearts and prayers. We want you to stand by us in this battle. and together with God's help we can achieve a better life for each and every American. Dr. King said, "I don't know what the future holds, but I do know who holds the future."
God bless you. God bless America.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
KEMP FISCAL VIEWS WIN PARTY'S HEART

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
It was Jack F. Kemp's long and passionate advocacy of tax cutting as the best way to stimulate greater prosperity for both rich and poor that brought him to the Republican Presidential ticket alongside Bob Dole.
But Mr. Kemp's economic philosophy goes well beyond the tax-cutting proposals Mr. Dole unveiled on Monday, and it runs counter in many ways to the conservative Republican orthodoxy of the past few years. 
 Mr. Dole's plan, which he is counting on to reinvigorate his campaign, is based on the notion that it is possible to slash taxes by $548 billion over the next six years and still balance the budget by 2002. Mr. Kemp, while not opposed to fiscal austerity, has always argued that balancing the budget should not be the "be-all and end-all" of Republican economic policy.
While Mr. Dole's plan assumes deep cuts in spending across nearly all areas of the Federal Government except the Pentagon, Mr. Kemp maintains that it would be a mistake for Republicans to dismantle social welfare programs in the name of deficit reduction.
Mr. Dole has issued a somewhat vague pledge to overhaul the tax system, but Mr. Kemp has strong views about specific steps that should be taken, including the adoption of a single-rate flat tax, a proposal that Mr. Dole criticized when it was pushed by Steve Forbes, one of his challengers during the Republican primaries.
And while Mr. Dole has never been known for a love of detailed economic policy proposals, Mr. Kemp loves to hold forth at length on the arcane details of topics like the need to restore the nation to a gold standard.
"To Republicans, I humbly suggest that we make it possible for Democrats to give up their quest for redistribution of income and wealth by our acceptance of an appropriate role for government in financing those public goods and services necessary to secure a social safety net below which no American would be allowed to fall," Mr. Kemp wrote in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal in June.
"The huge government bureaucracy we now confront was created over the last 60 years with good intentions, but with a redistributionist philosophy that led to counterproductive results," Mr. Kemp said. "In the face of this reality, we Republicans make a serious mistake when we try to economize first on social programs. It allows us to be characterized as putting the 'cart' of fiscal austerity before the 'horse' of rapid economic growth."
Among Republicans, Mr. Kemp has been one of the few who has tried to draw a clear line dividing taxes and other economic policies from the prosperity not just of the middle class and the wealthy, but of the urban poor as well.
One of his pet projects in recent months has been speaking out in favor of a proposal by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting Congressional delegate for the District of Columbia, to drop the Federal income tax in Washington to a flat rate of 15 percent, from a current top rate of 39.6 percent, to attract affluent residents into the financially reeling district.
As Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Bush Administration, Mr. Kemp championed a proposal to allow residents of public housing to use rental vouchers to move to privately owned houses in other neighborhoods.
In some ways, Mr. Kemp is a classic advocate of free market policies. He favors free trade and supported such policies as the renewal of China's trading status with the United States and ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But he also says government policy can play a role in some situations. He has long advocated enterprise zones, where tax breaks and other incentives are used to lure businesses to poor neighborhoods.
At the core of Mr. Kemp's philosophy is the idea that more economic growth would benefit those at the bottom of the economic ladder as much as those at the top. Only through the increased tax revenues that faster growth would bring can the deficit be ended, Mr. Kemp says.
"Taxes on capital, taxes on labor, inflation, bureaucratic regulation, minimum wage laws, are all -- to different degrees -- unnecessary slices of the wedge that stand between an individual's effort and reward for that effort," Mr. Kemp wrote in 1981."
Even before Mr. Dole began considering him as a Vice-Presidential choice, Mr. Kemp was celebrating something of a victory in seeing tax cutting take center stage after several years in which his supply-side approach had taken a back seat to his party's deficit-reduction wing.
Mr. Kemp proved himself effective, if somewhat clumsy, at keeping his economic views on the Republican agenda over the last few months, when it seemed that Mr. Dole's victory in the primaries had ended any chance of the party's supply-side wing playing an influential role in the election. His clout was particularly evident at a Capitol Hill forum last month when he instigated a public endorsement of sweeping tax cuts by nearly all the Republican leadership of Congress, raising the pressure on Mr. Dole to go down the same path.
The forum had its roots in a meeting Mr. Kemp held earlier this summer with three of his best friends from the House: Speaker Newt Gingrich; Trent Lott of Mississippi, now the Senate majority leader, and Senator Connie Mack of Florida. At the meeting, Mr. Kemp, one participant said, attacked Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Lott for not doing more to pursue the supply-side agenda, and they . agreed to do something to invigorate the "pro-growth" debate. They settled on the public forum as the best way to start.
Some people in the Dole campaign were annoyed by Mr. Kemp's maneuver, but Mr. Kemp said: "I was not there to upstage the Dole campaign. I was there to get Newt and Trent and Connie to elevate the issue again because balancing the budget is not the be-all and end-all of the American economy."

Bob Dole on Jack Kemp
Mr. Dole criticizing Mr. Kemp and his policies during the 1988 campaign for the Republicans Presidential nomination:
 
"The good news is that a busload of supply-side economists just drove off the mountainside. The bad news is that three seats were empty."
 
"Kemp is for tax reform because he is counting on a tax break on hair spray."
 
"Look at some of the pro-labor votes Jack Kemp has cast. They'll curl your hair."
 
Jack Kemp on Bob Dole
Mr. Kemp criticizing Mr. Dole while campaigning for the nomination:
 
"Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike. When Bob Dole talks about leadership for the future, he's the man who led the fight for five major tax increases in the past five years."
 
"I am convinced that Senator Dole has a secret plan to raise taxes on the American people. That would totally frustrate the Republican message that we are the low-tax party. (Dole) is 'Hey, this is not my tax increase. This is the commission's tax increase.' That is what he did on the Social Security Commission."

Dole Hails Kemp as Partner in Run for White House

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: RUSSELL, Kan., Aug. 10

 BODY:
Bob Dole returned today to the spot where he began his political career more than 40 years ago, to present to his hometown, his party and the nation the man he hopes will help him finally win the White House, Jack F. Kemp.
After rainy, leaden skies cleared in time for their appearance, Mr. Dole stood before an enormous American flag, with an ebullient Mr. Kemp and proclaimed what the rest of the world already knew: that he had chosen the 61-year-old former Congressman from Buffalo and sometime rival as his running mate. 
 To a crowd of about 2,000 people gathered here outside the courthouse, where Mr. Dole started his first political campaign in 1951 and then started his own unsuccessful Vice-Presidential run 20 years ago, Mr. Dole pronounced Mr. Kemp "a man of unlimited talent, energy and vision, an American original."
He added: "I've been saying for weeks, I wanted a running mate who rates a 10. Someone who believes in the same values I believe in. Someone who is ready to fight the battles I will fight. Someone who has courage, integrity and character. I was looking for a 10, and I found a No. 15, which is the number Jack wore while playing for the Buffalo Bills."
Mr. Kemp called Mr. Dole a "hero" with "stature" and called his agenda "hopeful" and "inclusive." He said Mr. Dole was "someone who will fight for his principles, who loves America and knows what it means to sacrifice for others."
Both stressed that the Dole/Kemp ticket would press for tax cuts while "not leaving anyone behind." Mr. Dole said, "Jack and I are going to work side by side with the Republican Congress to restore the American dream to every citizen."
Mr. Kemp, whose longtime concern about racial matters made him appealing to a campaign trying to broaden its base, quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the almost exclusively white crowd and talked about an expansive party that would lift people up. "No one will be left behind, and no one will be turned away," he promised. "Our goal is not to win but to be worthy of winning."
The appearance, complete with a balloon release, waving placards, band music and cheering crowds, was intended as a crisp and upbeat send-off before the two men go on Sunday to San Diego, where the Republican National Convention convenes on Monday to formally endorse them as the party's ticket.
There was an awkward moment or two when the habitually verbose Mr. Kemp went on about twice as long as the five minutes he promised he would speak -- and four minutes longer than his senior partner -- leaving Mr. Dole smiling gamely and fidgeting on the stage behind him.
Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, said Mr. Kemp, co-director of Empower America, a conservative policy group, was chosen because he was "on the leading edge of Republican ideas and policies," because his California roots could help win that important state and because he was a "leader in tax-cutting ideas." That would mean he could be an avid salesman for Mr. Dole's economic plan, which involves 15 percent across-the-board tax cuts.
Mr. Kemp's championing of tax cuts has been one of the chief ways in which he has parted company with Mr. Dole, who built his reputation by emphasizing a balanced budget.
There was considerable talk here this morning about how the two would reconcile their many differences, which over the years have included disputes over policy issues -- including welfare, immigration and affirmative action, not to mention tax cuts and balancing the budget -- as well as a prickly personal relationship.
Several years ago, in a spat over tax cuts, Mr. Dole said the finely coiffed Mr. Kemp, wanted "a business deduction for hair spray."
Mr. Kemp, who once boasted of having 1,600 books in his Maryland house, responded that Mr. Dole's library had burned down and "both books were lost -- and he hadn't even finished coloring one of them."
But aides to both men took pains today to suggest this was ancient history. "Politics is about the future," Mr. Reed said. He said that Mr. Dole was obviously aware of their differences, "but that doesn't bother him."
"The bottom line," said Charles Black, a strategist for Mr. Kemp in 1988 and now a senior adviser to him, "is whatever Bob Dole is for, Jack Kemp is for."
Pressed as to whether Mr. Kemp understood that the Vice-Presidential slot was 'No. 2" on the ticket, Mr. Reed said that the former quarterback "told me he understands, he told the Senator he understands, and I think what you'll see today is a lot of understanding."
When Mr. Dole called Mr. Kemp from Kansas on Friday night at 10:06 to tell him he wanted him on the ticket, he related a story about his own experience as President Gerald Ford's running mate 20 years ago. He said that one day in Minnesota he said Mr. Ford would raise price supports for farmers. When Mr. Ford got wind of it, he came down hard and quickly on Mr. Dole.
Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's campaign spokesman, added, "Jack Kemp got the message loud and clear."
During the ceremony today, Mr. Kemp joked about one aspect of their differences -- Mr. Dole's spartan use of language compared with Mr. Kemp's legendary verbosity.
He said he had asked Mr. Dole how long he wanted him to speak at today's rally. He said that Mr. Dole replied, "Jack, you can speak as long as you want, but we're only going to be here for five more minutes."
After hearing Mr. Kemp, Elmer Steinle, a 73-year-old lifelong Russell resident, who had been silent throughout both speeches, said: "He's long-winded, isn't he?"
But Dole aides said they hoped Mr. Kemp would add needed zest to the campaign.
Mr. Reed, a longtime aide to Mr. Kemp in the 1980's, said that the campaign did not seek detailed financial information from Mr. Kemp until Thursday. He said Mr. Kemp had not moved into the "top tier" of candidates, winnowed down from an initial 25 in April, until Friday.
Roderick DeArment, a Dole aide who helped in the vetting process, said that Mr. Kemp's previous runs for Congress and for the Presidency in 1988 had served as the "supreme kind of vetting."
On Friday, Mr. Reed called seven other contenders to tell them they had not made the cut. But when Mr. DeArment left Washington Friday afternoon to meet the Vice-Presidential candidate, he did not know where he was going. Mr. Reed said he called Mr. Kemp by phone on Friday afternoon to find out where he was going to be and "to see how his head was, and it was great."
Eventually, Mr. DeArment was directed to Dallas, where he and Sheila Burke, Mr. Dole's longtime chief of staff when he was in the Senate, met Mr. Kemp, who had been delayed by a flight from Orlando. The entourage left in a private jet for Kansas and spent the night at a Holiday Inn in Great Bend, 38 miles south of Russell, before being whisked into Russell this morning.
Even as the news of the selection had been out for several hours, Mr. Dole, who enjoys surprises, had told Mr. Kemp on the phone, "We're going to figure out if we can sneak you in through the back door of our little house here."
"As Bob Dole generally does, he got his way," Mr. Warfield said after the two men and their wives, Elizabeth Hanford Dole and Joanne Kemp, had emerged from the Doles' home here, providing the first official glimpse of the new ticket.
Mr. Reed said that some of Mr. Kemp's staff would be "integrated" into the campaign staff.
At the end of the week, the two men plan to visit Mr. Kemp's hometowns in California and then Buffalo, where he quarterbacked the Bills to two American Football League championships and which he represented in Congress from 1971 to 1988.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE QUARTERBACK;
Buffalo Region Embraces Its Favorite Football Son

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: HAMBURG, N.Y., Aug. 10

 BODY:
In the sleepy suburbs, one-stoplight hamlets and rolling farm land south of Buffalo, football has long been an elixir against the harsh winters, a chronically weak economy and the bum national reputation many residents feel they have suffered for too many years.
So it is not surprising that Jack F. Kemp is first remembered here as the fair-haired quarterback with the winning attitude and a pretty-good arm who led the Buffalo Bills to two American Football League championships in the 1960's. That he later became their Congressman, a Cabinet member and a leading spokesman for the Republican Party's tax-cutting wing is just fine, too, his fans say, if not quite as important. 
 But Mr. Kemp's 26 years in western New York, eight as a football star and 18 more as the Representative of what was then New York's 31st Congressional District, played a significant role in shaping the political ideas and public persona that he has now brought to national prominence as Bob Dole's running mate, according to his friends here. In that time, he developed many of the attitudes about tax cuts, affirmative action and immigration that have given him appeal across not only party lines, but also racial and class lines.
"His political ideals were forged here in Buffalo, by his experiences not only in Congress but on the football field," said Edward J. Rutkowski, who played football with Mr. Kemp and later worked in his district office.
Not quite Midwestern but not quite Northeastern either, the Buffalo area has long viewed itself as something of a political and cultural hybrid, and Mr. Kemp's Congressional district was as diverse as they came. From the steel mills and Polish neighborhoods of Buffalo, it streteched south along Lake Erie through affluent suburbs into rural dairy farms and cornfields. And though it was heavily blue-collar and pro-union but it was far from liberal, becoming a bastion of Reagan Democrats in the 1980's.
But it was perhaps the plight of Buffalo's dying factories that most affected Mr. Kemp. Mr. Rutkowski recalled how they would leave practice together in the early 1960's and inevitably encounter traffic jams outside the Bethleham Steel plant as shifts were changing. As the years passed, the traffic grew thinner as the company laid off workers and eventually shuttered its building.
"To see that place go from bustling to a ghost town had a profound impact on his thinking," Mr. Rutkowski said. "It made him care more about economic development, about cutting taxes and creating jobs, about rescuing inner cities."
As a football player, Mr. Kemp became close to people who, as he was fond of noting, most Republicans never associated with. And he was a co-founder and president of the American Football League's Players Association from 1965 to 1970, which gave him cachet with Buffalo's powerful union leaders.
As a Congressional candidate, Mr. Kemp was able to espouse tax-cutting, laissez-faire policies while enjoying powerful support from unionized workers, which never ceased to infuriate local Democrats.
But paradoxically, while Mr. Kemp's football fame clearly made him a household name in the region, it was also seen as something of a liability by his handlers during his first campaign for Congress, in 1970.
"There were a lot of people who thought they couldn't vote for a football player, sort of that dumb-jock thing," said Marie Richardson, a former Erie County legislator who worked on Mr. Kemp's first campaign. "They didn't know he was a history buff, that he devoured books. I'd say, 'Just come have coffee with him.' That's all it took -- one coffee."
Mr. Kemp narrowly won that race, taking a seat that had long been held by the Democrats. He was re-elected eight times, defeating challengers by increasingly lopsided margins of never less than 70 percent. Throughout that time, he made his home in Hamburg, a semi-rural town 15 miles south of Buffalo, until 1988, when President-elect George Bush named him Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and he moved his family to the Washington area.
In recent years Mr. Kemp has made only sporadic visits to western New York. But many residents here have remained in touch with his career, viewing his high national profile as a source of pride for themselves and a just dessert for a hometown hero. To his many fans, he should have become a senator, governor or even President, but always confounded and disappointed them by dropping out of the race.
"I always thought he had the capability to do more, there was so much potential in him," said Virginia Bates, a bank branch supervisor, who was Mr. Kemp's neighbor in Hamburg.
To be sure, not many people interviewed could recall details of his work in the House or as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, though most seemed aware of his strong advocacy of tax cuts. What they remembered was his guy-next-door demeanor, garrulous speech-making, can-do optimism and, most of all, his Number 15 jersey.
"Football around here is people's lives," said Richard Dollard, a research chemist from West Senaca.
Previously undecided and unenthusiastic about the Presidential race, Mr. Dollard -- like many others interviewed -- said he now plans to vote for the Dole-Kemp ticket.
Indeed, politics was not much on the minds of the people attending the Erie County fair on Friday night when they were asked about Mr. Kemp. They simply wanted to celebrate the news that for the first time in decades, a western New Yorker -- even a lapsed western New Yorker -- had a shot at the White House.
"You don't get a lot of celebrities from around here," said Curt Young, an automobile painter from Angola. "It kind of helps the image."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CONVENTION;
Wilson and Weld, Citing Restrictions, Say They Won't Speak at Event

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
In a last-minute snag that spotlighted Republican efforts for tight control of the proceedings at their convention here, two Governors, Pete Wilson of California and William F. Weld of Massachusetts, have told convention organizers that they will not speak at the event rather then accede to conditions for their participation.
Aides to both men said today that they believed that convention organizers had set out to prevent them from speaking because they had been at the forefront of an unsuccessful effort to force the Republican Party to moderate the anti-abortion plank in its platform. 
 But convention organizers said they believed that Mr. Wilson and Mr. Weld were trying to shore up their credentials at home, and were showboating at the expense of party unity and Bob Dole's candidacy.
The dispute raises the possibility that the convention may open here Monday without a greeting from the Governor of the host state, Mr. Wilson, who is also a former mayor here. And it underscored the lengths to which the organizers have gone to control the agenda here, seeking to avoid the air of intolerance that permeated the Republicans' 1992 convention in Houston and to insure what the party chairman, Haley Barbour, called a "fast-paced, multi-media-oriented approach conveying easy-to-understand messages."
As the dispute unfolded today, Republican officials produced an array of internal Republican National Committee memorandums, dictating exactly what the candidates could say and even what they could wear. Mr. Barbour, in a note to Mr. Wilson explaining the party's intention, said:
"Accordingly, we look forward to working closely with you on the nature of your remarks in order to ensure each presentation enhances the objective of the convention. A commitment by you to this new approach, initial drafting responsibility, advance speech review, final editorial control, and rehearsals are simply a must if program participants are to contribute to a successful convention."
Many Republicans blamed lax vetting of convention speakers' remarks for the tone of the 1992 convention, when phrases like Patrick J. Buchanan's declaration of a "religious war" slipped by convention organizers, whose only concern was whether Mr. Buchanan was unequivocally endorsing President George Bush, and out onto live television.
This year, the organizers are not stopping at only the content of speeches. Another document, titled "Guidelines for Podium Speakers," included wardrobe suggestions: "Dark, blue or black are always the better suit colors. Pale, blue, gray and tan do not show well. Checks or plaids are not recommended." It also said jewelry should be avoided.
Mr. Weld was informed that he had two segments -- one of 90 seconds and one of 60 seconds -- to introduce two videos that would be shown. One video featured remarks by Morry Taylor, the quirky tire manufacturer and one of the more unsuccessful Republican candidates for President this year.
Mr. Weld was also told exactly what he would say. He would discuss "his leadership in bringing about economic renewal and success in Massachusetts," and that "he shares Bob Dole's economic philosophy and believes that a Dole Presidency will be good for job creation."
The problem was that Mr. Weld also wanted to talk about abortion rights, which he favors. A senior Republican organizer involved in the vetting of speakers said today that the party would have allowed him to speak about abortion. Aides to Bob Dole said they thought that Mr. Weld was just trying to highlight his abortion rights position to win advantage in his race against Senator John F. Kerry in Massachusetts.
Mr. Weld's campaign manager, Ginny Buckingham, denied the accusation of political motivation and insisted that he had been told that abortion was off limits.
"Had the convention managers said the governor could give the speech he wanted to give, he would have spoken," Ms. Buckingham said.
Mr. Wilson's situation was more complicated. Mr. Wilson said he had originally been invited to speak -- for five minutes -- in a prime-time slot on Monday. Then, shortly after his Op-Ed article appeared in The New York Times on Aug. 1 urging that his party adopt a moderate course on abortion, he was told that his role would be joining -- silently -- the Mayor of San Diego, Susan Golding, on stage in welcoming the convention delegates, on Monday morning.
Mr. Wilson's aides immediately rejected that offer. But they left little question that they saw the handling of the Governor as something of a snub, and distributed copies of correspondence from Republican officials.
"It seems a little strange," Mr. Wilson said. "But frankly, it isn't going to stand in my way of enjoying a convention that I am proud to have in my hometown and in this state, which is crucial to electing a Republican ticket."
Mr. Barbour said he had no knowledge of the letter that had been sent out under his name inviting him to speak Monday night. At a news conference, he asked a reporter to show him a copy of the letter, studied the document, and then pronounced himself vindicated.
"It says 'participate,' " Mr. Barbour said. "It doesn't say, 'speak at the podium.' I mean, I'm just telling you what it says here."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REACTION;
Move Is Hailed as a Sign of Party Unity

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Republicans today hailed Bob Dole's selection of Jack F. Kemp as his running mate, saying they hoped the former Buffalo Congressman would enliven their party's convention here next week and spur voters to take a second look at Mr. Dole.
While the two men have had a sometimes strained relationship for years, several Republicans applauded the choice of Mr. Kemp, an ebullient onetime professional football player, as a move that would help the ticket and show that Mr. Dole was willing to reach out to a longtime foe. 
 Republicans played down the fact that Mr. Kemp, though popular among many Republicans, has long been at odds with many in the party, including Mr. Dole, who disagree with his championing of supply-side economics and his refusal to endorse tough restrictions on immigration. And they argued that despite Mr. Kemp's tendency to talk too much sometimes, he would be a formidable competitor in a debate with Vice President Al Gore.
"Jack is life and buoyancy and optimism," said William J. Bennett, the conservative Republican author who was himself on Mr. Dole's Vice-Presidential list but told the Dole campaign on Saturday that he was not interested. "People have been saying this campaign doesn't talk enough, doesn't have ideas, doesn't have vision, and here comes Kemp. He has all three."
Ron Schmidt, a delegate from South Dakota attending party meetings here before the convention, said: "Dole is a very stiff candidate, which is why Kemp is an asset to the campaign. He is a very warm and articulate person."
Jude Wanniski, a political economist who is close to Mr. Kemp and has been publicly promoting the choice for months, was more blunt when he referred to Mr. Dole's inability thus far to catch up to President Clinton in the polls. "Dole looked like a corpse," he said, "and Jack is coming in as a rescuer."
The Republicans who said they had reservations about Mr. Kemp did not cite his qualifications, but rather his reputation as not being a team player. In fact, even after it was a foregone conclusion earlier this year that Mr. Dole would win the nomination, Mr. Kemp refused entreaties to be a loyal Republican and instead endorsed his protege, the billionaire magazine publisher Steve Forbes. That episode led many Dole advisers to believe that Mr. Kemp would never get the nod.
Today, Mr. Forbes greeted the improbable alliance with delight, He emphasized that Mr. Kemp and Mr. Dole did not have to be "bosom buddies" to make a winning team.
Gov. Pete Wilson of California noted that Mr. Kemp disagreed with Mr. Dole on affirmative action and immigration control measures. "Perhaps in the fullness of time," Mr. Wilson said, "Mr. Kemp wil have to come to modify his views to reflect those of his running mate. Obviously it seems to me he has to do that or he can not in good conscience accept a spot on Mr. Dole's ticket."
As the convention approached, a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in late July and early August showed that 7 percent of the delegates preferred Mr. Kemp to be the running mate; the only candidates who fared better were Colin L. Powell, with 13 percent, and Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, with 8 percent. In January 1995, when CBS News asked Republicans whom they wanted as the party's Presidential nominee, Mr. Kemp was the choice of 9 percent of those polled, while Mr. Dole was the winner, with 24 percent.
In another survey, a December 1994 Times Mirror poll conducted by Princeton Survey Associates, 43 percent of the voters polled nationally had very favorable or mostly favorable opinions of Mr. Kemp. Eighteen percent said their opinion was unfavorable; 9 percent said they had never heard of him, and 20 percent gave no answer.
Republican officials have been counting on the Vice-Presidential choice, combined with the convention next week, to give Mr. Dole a lift in the polls as the general election campaign gets under way in earnest.
Even before the choice was official, the White House and the Democratic Party were churning out news releases and compilations of Mr. Kemp's record that party leaders said demonstrated that he was out of touch with Americans, and with Mr. Dole.
In a press release today, the Clinton-Gore campaign said Mr. Kemp's selection illustrated how Mr. Dole had "completed his transformation from deficit hawk to economic gambler willing to bet our economic future on a reckless supply side theory."
"Bob Dole confirmed that women should not have the right to choose and anyone with an opposing view is not welcome in San Diego," it said.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party said that Mr. Kemp had been "the darling of the extreme right in this country for a number of years."
Carole Shields, president of People for the American Way, a liberal group, said, "Moderate and mainstream Republicans have got to wonder where to turn."
But the description of Mr. Kemp as a hard-edged conservative may fall flat; Mr. Kemp has clashed at times with Republicans for his support for affirmative action and for rebuilding the cities and for not being more vocal in his opposition to abortion.
In fact, representatives of minority groups generally cheered Mr. Kemp's selection, declaring that he has been one of the few voices within the Republican Party who have shown interest in the plight of blacks and Hispanics, and one of the few to have been a counterweight to the opposition to immigration that is sweeping the party.
"Part of the ability that Kemp has is to talk to groups of audiences from the inner city and people much more associated with the Democratic Party," said Linda Chavez, a head of the United States Civil Rights Commission in the Reagan Administration.
She said that was something the Republican Party had lacked, adding: "The Republican Party has been much more the party of middle America and has tended to be middle class, upper middle class and wealthy and much less attuned to the situation of African- Americans and Hispanics."
Indeed, in his speech in Russell, Kan., today, Mr. Kemp quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and said that one of his missions was to court a broad range of voters.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who remains coy about his Presidential endorsement, said he was "very enthusiastic" about Mr. Kemp's addition to the ticket, praising his mastery of domestic policy as a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
"He's also someone who understands cities, spent a great deal of time both as a member of Congress and as a Secretary helping cities in very new ways," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Kemp, who was born in California and once played for the San Diego Chargers, could also give Mr. Dole a lift in this electorally critical state, where Mr. Dole lags far behind Mr. Clinton in the polls. But Mr. Kemp infuriated many of this state's conservatives in 1994 when he opposed Proposition 187, which required teachers and clinic doctors to deny help to undocumented immigrants and to report them to the police. Mr. Kemp said the measure was so Draconian that it would be unconstitutional.
Edward J. Rollins Jr., who was an important aide to Mr. Kemp in the 1988 campaign, said that Scott Reed and John Buckley, former aides to Mr. Kemp who are now top officials of the Dole campaign, must have warned their former boss that he had better maintain cordial relations with Mr. Dole.
Mr. Rollins criticized Mr. Kemp as being something of a loose cannon. "He's so indefatigable that they're never going to keep him down unless you have an 800-pound gorilla flying around with him," he said.
But former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, who is close to Mr. Dole, said he was not worried about the two getting along. "There's been a lot of scuffling back and forth between Dole and Kemp," he said. "But that was then. This is now. We're locked in a tough race."
Describing the running-mate selection as "enormously important," Mr. Rudman added: "The campaign obviously will need added depth. Bob Dole himself will say he's not the greatest on the stump."
William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, said the pairing was a sound one, but he said there would inevitably be tensions between Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp. "In two weeks, we'll have stories with sources saying that Kemp's unhappy that Dole's not pushing the tax cut harder," he said.
But Republicans seem to be rallying around the selection. The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said Mr. Kemp was true to the beliefs of Ronald Reagan. "I know of no one who has been in more places in America preaching the concept of opportunity than Jack Kemp," Mr. Gingrich said.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
A Passion for Ideas: Jack French Kemp

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
After he decided not to run for President this year, Jack F. Kemp explained himself this way: "My passion for ideas is not matched with a passion for partisan or electoral politics."
His devotion to ideas, some of them unconventional, is what has set him apart all his adult life. 
 When other professional football players were reading playbooks on the road, Mr. Kemp studied politics, history and economics.
When other members of Congress spent their time and energy on committee work and constituent services, Mr. Kemp concentrated on developing bold and controversial tax legislation, outside the jurisdiction of any committee on which he served. He also implored his Republican colleagues to reach out to blacks and members of other minority groups.
When other members of President George Bush's Cabinet concentrated on reducing the size of the Federal Government, Mr. Kemp, as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, assembled and presented to the White House big plans for spending more money, creating more programs, rejuvenating the cities and making a greater commitment to helping the poor.
When other politicians routinely change their ideological clothing to fit the voters' fashions, Mr. Kemp, 61, resolutely sticks by his guns, even when his ideas are unpopular.
In late 1994, for instance, when he was still contemplating a race for the Presidency, Mr. Kemp gave a speech in California denouncing this state's Proposition 187, which denies schooling and other Government benefits to illegal immigrants. The proposition had just been approved by a 5-to-3 ratio, and surveys of voters showed that 80 percent of those who identified themselves as Republicans or conservatives voted for it. No matter to Mr. Kemp.
"In my view," he said in Yorba Linda that day, "that is not what America is all about. Don't ask me to defend something that is fundamentally flawed. I'm speaking from the heart, not politically."
This preference for ideas over politics, for principle over popularity, as much as it sets him apart from most other politicians, is one reason some of the people who know him best were surprised that Mr. Kemp was chosen by Bob Dole to be his running mate. Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said he was thrilled by the choice, but added: "I didn't expect that he would pick Jack Kemp because Jack can be a pretty independent guy. He is going to be his own person."
John Mueller, who was the economic counselor in Mr. Kemp's Congressional office, put it this way: "Precisely because he's always been so identified with policies and ideas, I don't know how well he could fit in with the traditional Vice-Presidential role of taking marching orders and carrying them out to the letter."
The most important idea Mr. Kemp brought to the political arena was supply-side economics -- the theory that deep cuts in taxes would lead to such an economic boom that much if not all of the revenue lost from lower taxes would be offset by the additional tax receipts that resulted from greater earnings by individuals and larger business profits.
Mr. Kemp's long record as a champion of low taxes is doubtless a main reason by Mr. Dole tapped him to run for Vice President.
The story, often told over the years, is that one morning in 1976, Jude Wanniski, then an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal and a devoted supply-sider, dropped by Mr. Kemp's Congressional office for an interview. Mr. Kemp was so impressed by Mr. Wanniski's economic views that the conversation lasted all day and ended at Mr. Kemp's home in Bethesda, Md., at midnight, by which time Mr. Kemp had been completely converted.
He began preaching the supply-side gospel far and wide, and in 1978, along with Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, Mr. Kemp introduced legislation to cut income taxes by about one-third. The measure became the basis of many Republicans' Congressional campaigns that year, and two years later, Ronald Reagan made it a centerpiece of his Presidential campaign.
In 1981, the first year of the Reagan Presidency, the essence of the Kemp-Roth bill became law: a 25 percent tax cut over three years. For Mr. Kemp, it was an extraordinary accomplishment. Congressional scholars had trouble recalling another instance when a lawmaker without a seat on the committee with jurisdiction had so much influence over such important legislation.
Although few economists today embrace the supply-side theory without reservations, Mr. Kemp has never lost his fervor.
Early this year, as chairman of a private commission on tax reform created by Republican leaders in Congress, Mr. Kemp issued a report that recommended that the wages and salaries of all Americans, from corporate magnates to manual laborers, be taxed at a single, low rate. Such a step, Mr. Kemp said, would double the rate of economic growth in the country.
Mr. Kemp has never thought a balanced budget was very important. Mr. Dole, while still advocating a balanced budget, embraced the idea of lower taxes for all in the economic plan he announced this week. Republican officials have made clear that this plan will be the foundation for the speeches at the Republican National Convention, which opens here on Monday.
For Jack French Kemp, the trip to California to accept the Vice-Presidential nomination will basically be a homecoming. he was born on July 13, 1935, in Los Angeles and first became known nationally when he was a quarterback for the San Diego Chargers professional football team in the early 1960's.
He was one of four sons of a solidly middle-class couple, Paul and Frances Kemp. His father owned a small trucking business. His mother was a social worker. They lived in a heavily Jewish section of West Los Angeles. His parents were both Christian Scientists, and he was raised in that faith.
As a teen-ager, Jack Kemp's life revolved around football. Too small at 6 feet and less than 200 pounds to be recruited by the major football schools, he was determined nonetheless to become a professional quarterback. He accepted a football scholarship at Occidental College, a small liberal arts school in Los Angeles, in part because its team used professional formations and plays.
At Occidental, where he was a physical education major, he met Joanne Main, who was a year behind him in school, and they were married after she graduated in 1958. Jack and Joanne have four children, now grown: Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith and James.
After his marriage, Mr. Kemp became a Presbyterian. He does not like to talk about his religion, although he says he has become a born-again Christian. He is a staunch opponent of legal abortions. But as a politician, he has always been more interested in economic issues than in the social issues like abortion that dominate the political thinking of organizations on the Christian right.
Mr. Kemp was drafted by the Detroit Lions after his college football career but did not make the team. He bounced around from one professional team to another, took a year off to serve as a private in the Army Reserves, tried his luck briefly in the Canadian Football League and finally landed in 1960 with the Los Angeles Chargers in the newly formed American Football League. The next year the team moved to San Diego, and by that time Mr. Kemp, if not a superstar, was solidly entrenched as a starting quarterback.
After the 1962 season, he was traded to the Buffalo Bills, and he led that team to league championships in 1964 and 1965. It was about this time that Mr. Kemp became involved in politics. Just as Ronald Reagan's first foray into politics was as president of the Screen Actors Guild, Mr. Kemp's was as a co-founder and the president of the A.F.L. Players Association, a position he held from 1965 to 1970.
He was a volunteer in Barry Goldwater's Presidential campaign in 1964 and Mr. Reagan's successful campaign for Governor of California in 1966. In the off-season in 1967, Mr. Kemp worked on Governor Reagan's staff in Sacramento.
By 1970, Mr. Kemp's football injuries, including several concussions, had taken their toll. Erie County Republicans drafted him to run for a Congressional seat in the Buffalo suburbs that had been held for six years by a Democrat who was running for the Senate. Mr. Kemp won his first election narrowly, but he won eight more terms in Congress by vote margins that never fell below 70 percent.
In his years in Congress he became an increasingly polished orator, his passion over issues overcoming a high, raspy voice. In addition to taxes, he was a fierce advocate of free trade, a staunch defender of anti-Communist forces in Central America, an important spokesman for civil rights legislation and the first lawmaker to popularize the notion of enterprise zones, which are poor neighborhoods where taxes are lowered or eliminated in order to attract business.
He called himself a "bleeding-heart conservative."
Among his closest allies in Congress were Newt Gingrich of Georgia, now Speaker of the House, and Trent Lott of Mississippi, then a Representative but now majority leader of the Senate.
Despite his preference for ideas over partisan politics, Mr. Kemp never made a secret of his political ambition.
He considered running for the Senate in 1980 but backed down rather than run against Senator Jacob K. Javits in the Republican primary. He was mentioned as a potential running mate for Mr. Reagan that year.
In 1988, Mr. Kemp announced he would not run for re-election to Congress and made a serious effort to win the Republican Presidential nomination. But his candidacy never took hold. He ended up winning only 39 delegates -- swamped not just by George Bush but by Mr. Dole and Pat Robertson as well.
Mr. Kemp had hopes of being the Vice-Presidential nominee that year. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle instead and made Mr. Kemp the Housing Secretary.
By almost any measure, Mr. Kemp was not successful as a Housing Secretary. He was never close to the inner circle of the Bush Administration. He battled constantly and fruitlessly for his ideas: enterprise zones, selling public housing to the poor, making welfare payments more generous. He often threatened to resign.
Moreover, he was so determined to avoid the scandals that characterized his department in the Reagan years that the housing bureaucracy became paralyzed. Local officials, developers and lenders complained regularly that plans to build or rehabilitate low-income housing were subject to long delays as the department debated its policies for awarding money.
Mr. Kemp also irritated many of his colleagues in the Cabinet with his personal manner, a problem he has faced often in public life. He was too impatient to sit quietly through Cabinet meetings, and he was always squirming, rolling his eyes and burying his head in his hands.
Asked about this after he had left the Government, Mr. Kemp told a reporter: "I mean, my body language is worse than anybody else's, you know. I can't hide my feelings."
But he has never relinquished his ideas, even when they have been mocked by others. Since he left the Government, he has spent most of his time writing and speaking and spreading the gospel about low taxes and much more.
To this day, he argues that the dollar should once again be based on the value of gold.
Until he left the Bush Administration, he held that welfare recipients should be allowed to keep 85 cents of every new dollar they earned without having their benefits reduced. And he did not relent even after Richard G. Darman, the budget director in those years, calculated that such a policy would mean that some people making $60,000 a year or more would still be collecting welfare.
He stood by his idea of selling public housing units to the tenants even when estimates of renovation and finance costs were reaching $100,000 a unit. Mr. Darman argued derisively that it would be cheaper to buy poor people new condominiums.
Mr. Kemp's main value to the Bush Administration was as a bridge to blacks. After the riots in Los Angeles in 1992, Mr. Kemp was probably the only senior official in the Administration who could move comfortably through black neighborhoods there and elsewhere and work well with black mayors.
Mr. Kemp often attributes his ability to work with blacks and his strong views on racial equality to the years he spent playing football with black teammates.
"This is my way of redeeming my existence on earth," he told a reporter a few years ago when asked where his passions about race relations and poverty came from. "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do."
Of course, it is one thing to shout out your opinions when you are your own man. It is another when you are running for Vice President.
Ed Rollins, a political consultant who worked for Mr. Kemp in his 1988 campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination, recalled in his new book, "Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms," (Broadway Books) that Mr. Kemp "was impossible to discipline and simply wouldn't listen."
"I call it the quarterback mentality," Mr. Rollins wrote. "Quarterbacks think they can always make the big play and resent being controlled by anyone."

IN HIS OWN WORDS: Jack Kemp and the Issues

 BODY:

On Abortion
In a December 1987 television interview when Mr. Kemp was seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, he was asked about what impact his wife's miscarriage had on his views:
 
"It's not something that I prefer to talk about; I don't think it's a part of the Presidential campaign. My wife had a miscarriage. We have rarely talked about it. It did make me more aware of the sanctity of human life, how precious every child is. . . . I believe, as Jefferson believed, that the whole American idea is predicated upon the idea that our rights come to use from our Creator -- not from Washington, D.C. . . .
My premise is that both the mother -- the woman -- and the child -- the unborn -- should have constitutional protections for life and freedom.
 
On Affirmative Action
From a position paper for Empower America, a public policy and advocacy organization that he co-founded in 1993:
"Affirmative action based on quotas is wrong -- wrong because it is antithetical to the genius of the American idea: individual liberty. Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates and even deepens the divisions between us, but race-based politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and women of civility and compassion."
 
On Race and Civil Rights
In a 1989 television interview while Secretary of Housing and Urban Development:
"I would like to make my mark as a Republican closer to the Lincoln tradition of the party as opposed to what I'd call the Hoover -- that's really unfair to Mr. Hoover. He wasn't a racist, but he made some clear mistakes in the late 1920's and 30's. But I want to be known as a civil rights Republican; somebody who is promoting what President Bush calls "an equal opportunity society."
 
On the Budget Deficit
In a policy paper for Empower America:
"The real malady is the anemic rate of growth in the economy and a political system that has lost the ability to set national priorities. It is not enough just to say that government is too big and that it overspends. The problem is that the economy isn't growing fast enough to accommodate the level of spending produced through the democratic process."
 
On the Minimum Wage
From his 1979 book, "An American Renaissance. A strategy for the 1980's." (Harper & Row):
"Of all the barriers to opportunity imposed by government, I can think of few more onerous than the minimum wage law, for it arrests the natural development of young people at a crucial stage."
 
On Trade and NAFTA
In a speech to an economic conference in Switzerland in 1995:
"It is time to establish a trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific free trade agreement that would unite the European common market with a North American and Pacific common market. We must then invite third-world and developing nations of both Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe to participate in a global free trade initiative to offset the growing protectionism of both the political right and the political left."
 
On Gay Teachers
In newspaper and television interviews in 1987:
"I believe in civil liberties for homosexuals. I guess I'd have to say I'd draw the line at letting them teach in the schools."
"I think a school board should have the right to choose what type of example we have for our children in public schools."
On Capital Gains
In a New York Times Op-Ed article in February 1996:
"Cutting and indexing capital gains tax rates would help low-income and high-risk entrepreneurial ventures get investors, fostering a more vibrant national economy and thereby expanding the tax base. The capital gains tax is less of a tax on the rich than it is a barrier to the success of lower-income people willing to take a risk."
 
On the Gold Standard
From a position paper for Empower America:
"The new President should instruct the Treasury secretary to stabilize the dollar value of the nation's gold reserves, say within a $30 band, as a critical first step toward restoring sound money to America. This action would reinstate the dollar/gold link that was broken in 1971, which led to the most severe run of inflation in our nation's history. . . . It has long been my belief that it will never be possible to balance the Federal budget without some kind of dollar/gold link.

HEADLINE: CITY LIFE;
Brighten a Wall? How About a Whole Block?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
The strip of Christopher Columbus Drive half a mile from the waterfront is easy to ignore. On either side are windows shuttered with rusted sheet metal, and desolate walls covered with grime and graffiti.
But come back in a year, and a full block of the blight should be covered with a montage of local and regional icons -- the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Pulaski Skyway, the Colgate clock -- in bright acrylic paint. 
 On Wednesday, state officials approved financing for an ambitious mural covering 10 buildings between Barrow and Grove Streets, stretching 350 feet long and reaching as high as 60 feet. Work on the 15,000-square-foot mural, to be painted by local artists and student interns, is to begin in September and be done by spring.
The mural, as yet untitled, would be one of the nation's largest, and the first of several planned around the city to eliminate eyesores and beautify neighborhoods. They could also be a form of low-cost municipal therapy, a psychological boost that city officials say could turn into an economic one.
"Would you go to a store by a wall that is all graffiti and uncared for, or will you stop by a store by a beautiful wall?" asked Tsipi Ben-Haim, executive director of City Arts Inc., a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that sponsors public art. "Murals have been proven to be educational, a crime stopper, pride builder, economic development builder. There's a sense of ownership, and pride that the community gets after being involved in the creative process."
The use of murals as a rallying point for civic pride and renewal goes back at least to the New Deal, when the Federal Works Progress Administration commissioned more than 2,500 murals, most notably those by the great Mexican artist Diego Rivera, to depict images of human triumph and industry. In New York, the 1975 mural depicting the Brooklyn Bridge is a centerpiece of the revivified South Street Seaport.
But the Jersey City mural will challenge some of those better-known ones, at least in terms of size. It will not be the nation's largest -- that distinction belongs to the 128,000-square-foot "Planet Ocean" in Long Beach, Calif. -- but it will be one of the largest on the East Coast, dwarfing the famous 9,000-square-foot abstract mural on the defunct Alexander's store in Paramus.
The mural will be painted on the backs of 10 buildings whose storefronts are on Newark Avenue, stores that include a Woolworth's, a pharmacy and a pizza parlor. All have worked with a group of local artists for the last year and a half to plan the mural.
The final design is based on proposals submitted by five local artists, along with suggestions from the public. It was assembled by Rupert Ravens, a 41-year-old Jersey City painter who regularly works on a large scale. The finished mural, to be painted by nine artists and nine interns, will cover the buildings' back walls, peaking in the center with a triumphant Pulaski Skyway. Other images include a pastiche of Jersey City emblems, including the Barrow Mansion, a local landmark; a pencil, representing the Dixon Mills pencil factory, a Jersey City institution until it moved to Delaware) and the violet, New Jersey's state flower.
"It hopefully gives the city a landmark, and more identity," said Franc Palaia, another painter, noting that city officials say 18,000 cars pass through Christopher Columbus Drive daily.
The project is to cost $227,000, mostly to cover labor, starting with two months of intense chemical cleaning. About $182,000 will come from the state's Urban Enterprise Zone Authority, which allocates money collected from a special lowered sales tax meant to attract shoppers to designated urban areas. About $17,000 will come from the Jersey City Economic Development Corporation, and the rest from donations raised by Pro Arts, an organization of professional visual artists in Jersey City.
When the work starts, Pro Arts will train a camera on it and transmit the images to its site on the Internet (http://members. aol.com/proarts111) so computer users can follow its progress.
Artists want to paint their next mural on an empty storage tank at Liberty State Park. In all, the city hopes to paint murals in each of its seven wards, said Gene Nelson, director of the Jersey City Urban Enterprise Zone program. No designs have yet been made for those murals, only suggestions that each mural capture the flavor of its neighborhood.
Some artists are uneasy about being involved in projects with such a strong focus on economic development. "The important thing is to get it done and that it should be a good piece," said Richard Haas, the New York artist who painted the South Street Seaport mural. "Then, maybe it takes on a life of its own which neither I nor you can predict."
But artists say the murals can at least inspire people to keep their neighborhoods cleaner. In Philadelphia, where public art flourished in the 1980's, less than 1 percent of the murals have been vandalized.
"We don't have illusions that one mural will transform this city," said Leon Yost, a Jersey City photographer who has been the project's coordinator. "But we hope that each piece forms part of the package that makes the place better."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Under the Republican Tent

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
LAST spring, when the Republican State Committee announced who would represent New Jersey at the party's national convention, there were few surprises. The delegation included the usual mix of legislators, fund-raisers and party officials, all of whom have pledged their loyalty to Bob Dole.
The 48 delegates, who were officially chosen in the June primary, include three Republicans from each of the state's 13 Congressional districts. Nine more delegates, including Governor Whitman, were elected statewide. Nineteen of the delegates are women, and four, including Secretary of State Lonna R. Hooks, are black. 
 About half of the New Jersey delegates in San Diego this week, from Mrs. Whitman on down to Dorothy Avallone, a member of the Freehold Township Committee, are elected officials. Bret Schundler, the Mayor of Jersey City, and James W. Treffinger, the Essex County Executive -- both former Democrats -- are delegates. So are Jack Collins, the Speaker of the Assembly, and Representative Marge Roukema of Ridgewood. The delegation also includes party officials like David Norcross of Moorestown, general counsel to the Republican National Committee.
Some delegates are more conservative than others, but apparently many agree on major issues. A recent survey by The Associated Press found that 20 out of 48 considered Mrs. Whitman the best choice for vice president. The survey also found that most New Jersey delegates support abortion rights and believe the economy should be foremost among campaign issues.
Here is a closer look at four New Jersey delegates who arrived in San Diego last week with differing perspectives on the convention and the Republican Party.

JUDITH STANLEY
'A Part of History'
If Judith Stanley does not meet personally with Mr. Dole this week, no matter. She already has five photographs of herself with the candidate, taken at various fund-raisers. As one of the two Republican National Committee members from New Jersey, she helps maintain ties between state and national officials. She is also among the most experienced delegates, having attended the conventions of 1984, 1988 and 1992.
"It's quite thrilling being a part of history," said Mrs. Stanley, 60, of Middletown. "You wander around the convention floor and see all these things going on, and you're caught up in the whole spectacle."
Mrs. Stanley said she was introduced to the political arena by her late husband, Robert Stanley, a mining executive who served as a Republican state committeeman for years. In 1980's, under Gov. Thomas H. Kean, she was chairwoman of the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operates the Garden State Parkway. She has been president of the Middletown Planning Board since 1981, and she also heads the Monmouth Conservation Foundation.
She says she spends most of her time raising money for various candidates and groups, often opening her home on the Navesink River for benefits. When she is not on the convention floor this week, she will be dropping into parties and hospitality suites, cheering on a candidate whom she calls "very charming, very witty."
"I actually liked Dole in 1988, even over George Bush," she said. "He's had a lot of experience, he knows how to compromise, he knows about foreign policy, and the age issue doesn't bother me."
Asked what the convention should achieve, Mrs. Stanley answered unhesitantly: Unity, unity, unity. "I just hope it's going to bring the party together," she said. "With a Republican Congress, you need a Republican president."

HAROLD EDWARDS AND KATHY SUMTER
Backing Powell and Jobs
Three of New Jersey's delegates live in Newark, which might well have fewer Republicans per square mile than any other part of the state. Two of them, Harold Edwards and Kathy Sumter, are husband and wife, both leaders among the state's relatively few black Republicans.
In 1984, Mr. Edwards founded Concerned Black Republicans of New Jersey, whose 40 paying members include many former Democrats. In the 1970's, Mr. Edwards himself was an aide to Sharpe James, now the Democratic Mayor of Newark and then a City Councilman. Before switching parties 12 years ago, he was also one of the city's Democratic district leaders.
"African-Americans have made a big mistake putting all their eggs in one basket," he said. "You should have folks on both side of the aisle to be productive and bring something back to your community."
Mr. Edwards's organization estimates that New Jersey has about 4,000 black Republicans, mostly in Newark and the surrounding suburbs. The highest-ranking black member of the Whitman administration is Ms. Hooks, and the only black Republican in the State Legislature is Assemblyman Thomas S. Smith of Asbury Park.
Mr. Edwards is vice chairman of the Essex County Republican Committee, and one of four blacks in New Jersey's Republican delegation. (The others are his wife, who owns a party supply shop in Newark; Hadren Simmons, the district chairman of Newark's Central Ward, and Ms. Hooks.)
"My No. 1 hope is that Colin Powell becomes the vice-presidential candidate," said Mr. Edwards, 47, who runs a public relations firm from his home near Weequa hic Park. "That would really assist with this so-called attempt for diversity in the party."
Beyond that, he thinks the convention should focus on economic issues.
"I'm concerned that we find platforms to make life better in our neighborhoods," said Mr. Edwards, who was also a delegate at the 1988 Republican convention in New Orleans. "We need to think about economic solutions that will bring jobs to cities like Newark."
In the months before the convention, Mr. Edwards was not afraid to criticize Mr. Dole. He said he was especially distressed when the candidate turned down an invitation to speak last month at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"This gentleman will have to visit Bosnia, Russia, Israel," Mr. Edwards said. "He should have gone to Charlotte, North Carolina, to talk to African-Americans."

CANDACE STRAIGHT
The Abortion Debate
No matter how hard Mr. Dole tries to keep the abortion issue out of the spotlight this week, delegates like Candace Straight will make sure it gets plenty of attention.
Ms. Straight, an investment banker from Bloomfield, says that if the candidate does not soften his stance on abortion rights, the party is headed for trouble.
"The Christian Coalition is forcing Bob Dole to run on a platform that doesn't reflect the views of most Republicans," said Ms. Straight, 48, a high-ranking member of the national Republican Coalition for Choice. "If he doesn't move somewhat to the center on this, it's going to hurt him in November."
This will be Ms. Straight's first experience as an official delegate, although she accompanied the New Jersey delegation to the 1992 convention in Houston. She developed Republican loyalties early in life, campaigning for her grandparents, who both served on the Bloomfield Council in the 1950's. Later, she supported Governor Kean, who appointed her to the board of the Public Employees' Retirement System.
But Ms. Straight has put most of her efforts into helping Republican women win elections. In 1990, she volunteered in Mrs. Whitman's nearly successful Senate campaign against Bill Bradley. Two years later, she founded WISH List (Women in the Senate and the House) to help elect more Republican women who support abortion rights. She is now the co-chairwoman of the National Women's Campaign Fund, a bipartisan political action committee that supported Mrs. Whitman's gubernatorial race, among others. This year, she said, WISH List is supporting Kathleen Donovan, a Republican from Bergen County who is running for Congress.
Ms. Straight had hoped that party leaders would open the convention floor for discussion of the abortion issue, allowing a minority plank to be voted on by all the delegates. Instead, they decided last week to publish the minority opinion on abortion as an appendix to the official platform. She said that Mrs. Whitman's speech on Tuesday night might help Mr. Dole's standing among moderate Republicans, but that it would not make up for an anti-abortion platform.
"Christie Whitman, Susan Molinari and Colin Powell are terrific people with a great message," she said. "But in the end, the only person whose message matters is Bob Dole. When voters walk into that booth on Nov. 5, they aren't going to remember that Christie Whitman gave a good speech at the convention."
 "But if the party remains unable or unwilling to change its ways, that could have disturbing implications for this election. Black turnout could determine who wins the New Jersey Senate race, as well as some close Congressional races. This November will not be a repeat of 1994's voter turnout, which favored the Republicans. I may not be able to change my aunt's mind, but I hope the Party of Lincoln will rid itself of its negative thinking so we emerge from San Diego not only united but diverse, a party that truly represents all Americans."
A picture caption last Sunday about New Jersey Republicans reversed the identity of two woman who were delegates to the Republican National Convention. Judith Stanley of Middletown was pictured packing her suitcase; Candace Straight of Bloomfield was pictured standing by an American flag.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 18, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an essay on this page last week about the relationship between blacks and the Republican Party omitted a passage that was intended to take account of the likelihood that Jack Kemp would be the party's Vice Presidential nominee. In the essay, by Sophia A. Nelson, a lawyer who won the Republican nomination for Congress from the First District this year but withdrew because of illness, the passage should have read as follows:
"Too much of the party's thinking is 'November-centric.' It focuses on the short term, not the future of the party. Although as this is written, Mr. Dole has not chosen a running mate, it has been heartening to hear the speculation that Jack Kemp, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is on his short list. Mr. Kemp -- who attended Mr. Mfume's swearing-in ceremony as N.A.A.C.P. president, by the way -- walks into urban centers and talks with the people. He takes the Republican message to blacks, and they love it.

HEADLINE: The European Vacation;
Beach Blanket Burghers and Other Oddities

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
IT'S August in Europe, and the serious business of vacations has begun.
Consider Germany. This summer, as it does every year, the Government has imposed a plan by which the country's 16 states begin their six-week-or-so school vacations at different times. This year schools in a patch of northern states stretching from Hamburg to Berlin closed June 20, reopening at the end of July. On June 27 a cluster of states in what was formerly East Germany, around Saxony and Thuringia, started their school vacations, and on July 4 schools in the big state of North Rhine-Westphalia, whose 17 million people make it roughly comparable to the state of New York, set their hordes free. By last week, when children in Hamburg and Berlin were returning to class, little Bavarians in the Alpine south were bidding their teachers auf Wiedersehen. 
 Imagine Washington ordering New England states to stagger their school vacations so that Vermont schoolchildren quit in mid-June, while Rhode Island children tough it out till early August. Why do the Germans do it?

 
 
The Big Exodus
 It's simple. In August, Europe shuts down. Not only do governments go into recess, as they do in Washington and American state capitals. Most Europeans get four to six weeks paid vacation and, unlike Americans, who might take a week or two here and there during the year, they take it all at once. In Germany, assembly lines at the big automobile plants fall mostly idle; the hallways of corporate headquarters go dark. In Italy hospitals slow down, and pregnant women try not to go into labor. Roman movie theaters and most restaurants close.
A huge exodus of Italians and French, Spaniards and Dutch begins, from cities and towns to the beaches and mountains.
Of course, not everyone goes very far. Tens of thousands of Italian and French families travel comparatively short distances from one part of the country to another. The Milanese brave the autostrada and bake for three or four weeks on the Italian Riviera. Romans drive the few miles to balmy Ostia and Fregene on the Mediterranean shore. Parisians set off for the windswept coasts of Normandy and Brittany.
The Italians and French so love their own land in August that only tiny numbers -- less than 10 percent of their populations -- travel outside their countries.
The Germans are different. Given the chilliness of of Germany's northern beaches, about 90 percent of Germans spend their summer holidays outside the country. So many of them flood Italy's Adriatic seacoast to roast under the sun each summer that those beaches have come to be known as the Teutonic Grill.
Germany's reunification in 1990 combined about 81 million people, or roughly one-third the American population, in an area slightly smaller than Montana. (West Germany, with 61 million people, was the size of Oregon.) Add to that Germany's 14 million Dutch neighbors, whose vacation habits resemble the Germans', and the problematic logistics of vacationing en masse emerge.
Staggered school vacations are not the only means to a better-organized summer. To assure bookings at favored resorts for the next season, many Germans and Dutch reserve at the end of this year's vacation for next year.

 
 
Traditions Eroding
 But European vacation traditions may be about to change, with even an economic powerhouse like Germany now preaching austerity as it copes with record unemployment and a wilting currency.
"The Germans, unlike, for example, the Italians, have already begun spreading their vacations out over the year," said Ralf Corsten, chairman of T.U.I., the German travel agency, whose 25 percent stake in the $135 billion German vacation market makes it the world's largest.
Old habits are dying in France and Italy, too, if more slowly. In 1988, 56 percent of Italians responded in a survey that they preferred those long, lazy August vacations; this year the number was 38 percent.
Not everyone is celebrating the trend. Massimo Masini, the Mayor of Riccione, a tinselly beach town on the Teutonic Grill, who moonlights summers as a disk jockey, lamented recently the absence of the Germans and the weakness of the mark, which has lost 30 percent of its value this year.
"Thank God the Russians are arriving," Mr. Masini said. "Their suits are lined with American dollars."

The Existential Tourist

BYLINE: By Douglas Brinkley; Douglas Brinkley is a professor of history at the University of New Orleans and the author of a forthcoming biography of Jimmy Carter.

 BODY:
I teach an experimental course called "American Odyssey" in which college students spend a semester reading classic works while traveling around the country to visit historical sites and meet writers. The curriculum includes 50 books, ranging from "Leaves of Grass" to "The Color Purple" to "On the Road." Recently, I've added a new title: "America Day by Day," a forgotten gem by Simone de Beauvoir, long out of print.
Beauvoir journeyed to America in January 1947, armed with an effusive letter of introduction from her soul mate Jean-Paul Sartre, ecstatic about experiencing the sweeping vistas of more than 20 states in four whirlwind months. Although she did not intend to write a book, she kept a detailed diary of her observations, which was published in France in 1948 as "L'Amerique au Jour le Jour." At the time of her trip, two years before publication of "The Second Sex," Beauvoir was considered more of a cafe society curiosity than a feminist trailblazer. Even in 1952, when the book was translated and published in England as "America Day by Day," it generated few sales and little notice. But with the passage of time "America Day by Day" emerges as a supremely erudite American road book -- that distinctive subgenre based on flights of fancy rather than flights from economic hardship, as in John Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath." 
 Raised as a bourgeois Catholic schoolgirl in Paris following World War I, Beauvoir was an intuitive sociologist, although her more poetic passages show an unexpected empathy for those afflicted with loneliness. It's these flashes of authentic compassion for the common people she meets that make "America Day by Day" so endearing. Although she regularly mounts her soapbox to denounce everything from atomic weapons to bad food, she exudes maternal kindness to everyone she meets, regardless of his or her narrow politics or jingoistic world view. Although cynical about the hegemonic intent of the United States Government, she displays a keen appreciation of "American dynamism" and the G.I.'s who had liberated France from the Nazis. Leaving all her preconceptions back in Montparnasse, the indefatigable explorer made the trans-Atlantic journey ready to embrace America with her "hands, eyes, mouth."
Beauvoir's story begins with her "gentle flight" from Paris to Newfoundland to New York's La Guardia Airport. Embraced upon arrival by the Conde Nast set at a gaggle of cocktail parties, cheered on at Vassar College, where she took part in a symposium called "Women's Role in Contemporary Society," gossiped about as the "prettiest existentialist" by Janet Flanner in The New Yorker's "Talk of the Town," Beauvoir made a significant splash. The New York Times Magazine even commissioned an article from her -- "An Existentialist Looks at Americans" -- which appeared on May 25, 1947. Although much of her itinerary revolved around her well-arranged lecture schedule, she allowed plenty of free days for aimless explorations and journalistic pulse taking. Beauvoir, like an anxious literary traveler, wanted to pinpoint the intellectual fountainhead of the nation that produced the likes of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Dos Passos.
The first chapters of "America Day by Day" take place in prosperous postwar Manhattan, where Beauvoir was overwhelmed by the cult of American consumerism, disturbed by our national attraction to luxury cars and Madison Avenue come-ons, and angered at the anti-Communist groupthink mentality she encountered wherever she went. She perfectly captures the alienated sensation of being a stranger in Gotham: "Between these houses that have existed for years without me are streets laid out for thousands of people to whom I do not, and never did, belong. But now I am walking, going down Broadway. It's me all right. I walk in streets that were not built for me, and where my life has not yet left its tracks; here is no perfume of the past. No one knows my presence; I am still a ghost, and I glide through the city without disturbing anyone. And yet henceforth my life would conform to the layout of the streets and houses; New York would belong to me, and I to it."
A reader is struck not only by the meticulous descriptive passages on American history and geography but also by Beauvoir's ability to encapsulate our national psyche ("optimism is necessary for the peace of society and the prosperity of the country") and to comment so deftly on our shortcomings ("they refuse -- even people of good will -- to visualize the actual conflict between justice and liberty, and the necessity for inventing a compromise between these concepts; they prefer to deny justice and the lack of freedom").
Just because Beauvoir is a refined tourist in an America that stood, in Winston Churchill's words, "at the summit of the world" does not mean her adventure is a tame one. There is an indisputable truth to her matter-of-fact observation that "as in all great cities, they drug a lot in New York." Her attempt to get high on a marijuana cigarette in the Plaza Hotel with a shaggy cabal of Greenwich Village idlers is a hilarious misadventure. Her radical-chic ability to embrace all aspects of shadowy bohemia without a tinge of guilt or paranoia sparkles throughout. Sexually liberated, she meets men on the road -- including, in Chicago, a thinly disguised Nelson Algren, who becomes her lover -- and alcohol consumption is a prominent part of her travels.
Clearly a voyeur of America's transient underbelly, Beauvoir is able, like George Orwell in "Down and Out in Paris and London," to penetrate the haze and blue smoke of our nation's tenderloin districts deeply enough to offer detached insights into desolation row. In Chicago, with Algren as her guide, she learns firsthand about the world of morphine addicts and petty thieves, murderous gangsters and midnight cops. "America is one big box of surprises," she writes, intoxicated by her walks on the wild side.
As one would expect, feminism is discussed openly. Although she often compares the American women she encounters with European women, what Beauvoir finds most peculiar about feminism in America is that women disdain others of their sex, that sisterhood is just a slogan bandied about rhetorically by the enlightened few. As she explores everything from our national horror of prostitutes to mass frigidity, she sounds more like a precursor to Camille Paglia than Betty Friedan: "Woman is less at ease in this masculine world, where only recently has she been admitted on equal footing," she writes. "Their inability to prove themselves irritates them to a degree, and they vent their spleen quite freely on their men."
Beauvoir's peripatetic journey by automobile, train and Greyhound bus took her from coast to coast and back, and illuminating sections of the memoir are devoted to Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, Reno, New Orleans, Las Vegas and San Antonio. Always amused and exhilarated by the lap-dog friendliness of urban and rural folk alike, she is also flabbergasted that these same good-natured people embody the volatile, schizophrenic mixture of "strictness and hypocritical laxity." An eternal rebel, she has an uncanny eye for the shallow extravagances of American culture and an abolitionist's rage at the evil of segregation south of the Mason-Dixon line. While San Francisco and Chicago are celebrated in "America Day by Day," other cities get scorched: "Williamsburg is one of the saddest hoaxes of which I was ever the victim," or "I only hoped that fate would never lead me to live in Rochester."
A mix of literary and sociological references and perspicacious musings, "America Day by Day" brims with philosophical speculation and memorable aphorisms. After attending a Louis Armstrong concert at Carnegie Hall, Beauvoir writes, "Americans have more or less murdered jazz, but they love it still." Traveling through the Mojave Desert for a hundred miles past curio shops and jackalope stands, she observes: "Tourism in America is something privileged, it does not cut you off from the country it would show you. On the contrary, it is a means of access." And, at last, in a line that could serve as a motto for the whole Beat Generation ethic: "All these people whose destiny is mass-produced are haunted by dreams of escape."
For women, and men, who want to experience vicariously Jack Kerouac's open road with less macho romanticism and more existential savvy, "America Day by Day," hidden from us for nearly 50 years, comes to the reader like a dusty bottle of vintage French cognac, asking only to be uncorked.

HEADLINE: Europe's Shrinking Coffers Impact Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 6 front-page article "Rising Health Costs Threaten Generous Benefits in Europe" ("The Health Squeeze," a special report) is informative and raises concerns about changes in how medical care in Europe is financed and delivered.
Expanding on your article, I would like to make three additional points: 
 The problem in the health care systems of many European countries is less the rapid rise in costs and more the impact of the economy on revenues to pay for health care.
Since all of the countries you discuss rely on personal income-based mechanisms to finance their health care systems, poor economic performance and higher unemployment have limited the available funds.
Rather than suggesting that the European health care system is bloated, we might better characterize the problem as one of shrinking coffers.
Additionally, while pharmaceutical costs may be rising and need to be controlled, there is another side to that issue.
In many countries, the use of drugs as part of an emphasis on community-based medical treatment helps reduce the need to treat people in hospitals, where more expensive interventions would be required.
Thus, there may be some risk of increasing hospital costs if limits are put on the amount of prescribing.
Finally, while managed care and increased competition are intuitively appealing, there is little proof, even here in the United States, that they will reap much cost savings.
The risks of reducing needed care and of creating distrust between patients and their physicians may be more real than any reductions in health care spending.
This is particularly so in European countries, where there are already health care spending caps and other explicit ways of containing costs.
Managed care may be an American export with more glamour than real utility to other health care systems.

HEADLINE: Election Rehearsal in Mostar

 BODY:
Concerted, high-level diplomatic pressure by the United States and the European Union, including the intervention of President Clinton, has prevented a breakdown of peace efforts in the Bosnian city of Mostar.
The lesson to be learned from the furor over recent elections in Mostar is that the major powers supervising next month's national voting in Bosnia must do more than monitor campaign and voting arrangements. They must be prepared to lean on the region's power brokers with aggressive diplomacy and the threat of economic punishments to insure that all parties comply with election results. 
 The voting in Mostar was Bosnia's first since the end of the war. The bitter wrangling it set off between two supposedly allied ethnic groups offers a grim preview of similar battles likely to break out after Bosnia's national elections.
Mostar, where Bosnians from different ethnic groups once lived in harmony, was brutally divided by the war. Croats and Muslims, allies against the Serbs, fought each other there in 1993 and 1994. Bosnian Croat artillery destroyed the city's famous 400-year-old stone bridge. Most Muslims living west of the river were uprooted and forced to move to the eastern side. Croats were relocated in the opposite direction. After the fighting, the European Union took over direct administration of Mostar, with the goal of reunifying it and turning over control to a newly elected city government this year.
The June 30 election, in which many Muslims and Croats crossed the river for the first time since the fighting to cast votes in their old neighborhoods, produced a council with 21 Muslim members and 16 Croats. But the dominant Bosnian Croat party refused to accept the results, contending that 26 absentee ballots had been unfairly counted.
Europe and Washington responded with a commendable sense of urgency. Carl Bildt, the international community's chief civilian representative in Bosnia, insisted that the Croats recognize the election results. The European Union threatened to pull out its administration unless the election controversy was resolved. President Clinton, in a White House meeting with Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, demanded that the Bosnian Croats end their boycott of the new Mostar council.
Even these strenuous diplomatic exertions produced only a modest compromise. The elected Bosnian Croat members will attend an opening session of the council and then the dispute over absentee ballots will be passed on to Bosnia's courts for adjudication. Meanwhile, the Croats have been promised that Mostar's new mayor will be a Croat.
Next month's elections are likely to produce similar ethnic divisions as Serbs, Muslims and Croats cast most of their votes for ethnic nationalist parties. The United States and other Western countries should see to it that the nationwide institutions specified in the Dayton peace agreement -- parliament, presidency and judiciary -- actually begin functioning. That is the best way to sustain whatever hope Bosnia still has of eventual reconciliation and reunification.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Dole's Kemp Strategy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
Introducing Jack Kemp on his way to the Republican convention, Bob Dole unabashedly adopted John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign theme: "Let's get America moving again."
Dole revealed to reporters that this pocketbook-first approach has been in his head for six weeks. It explains his decision to base his campaign on tax cuts and productivity, and to choose as running mate the architect of Reagan-era stimulus. 
 But isn't America moving briskly already? Not for most; as Kemp tirelessly points out, middle-class "family income, which grew at an average annual rate of 1.7 percent during the Reagan expansion years, has not grown at all during Mr. Clinton's tenure as President."
That's the nub of it: rising taxes and stagnant wages make claims of prosperity ring hollow for most of the middle class.
That central fact was befogged recently by preliminary estimates of an upward blip of economic growth. But early figures are usually inflated and soon come down with a thud. And wage-earners know when they are on what Kemp calls "a treadmill economy," running hard to stay in place.
Not for nothing did Dole label his plan "restoring the American Dream." That dream is a steadily rising standard of living for all, with each generation better off than the last. It happened in the Reagan 80's; it's not happening now.
Clinton's initial response has been to point to the deficits of the Reagan prosperity and claim they were caused by tax reduction. As the Washington Post's David Broder points out, this "running against Reagan" is the same blunder Clinton committed in 1994, pooh-poohing the G.O.P.'s Contract With America. The Reagan era of permeating prosperity is not seen by most people as a nightmare, but rightly as the time of the Dream.
The deficits that burden us now did not come from Reagan tax cuts -- revenues rose with growth -- but mainly from a Democratic Congress's refusal to slow the growth of spending.
Now the poll-driven Clinton is posing as a deficit-cutter, a death-bed conservative demanding to know where Dole will "cut" to offset his tax relief. Dole would be a sucker to specify what everybody knows is needed -- a modest reduction in the rate of growth of entitlements -- because the demagogue in Clinton has shown in his budget vetoes he would go "aha!" and mislabel such necessary restraint as heartless "cuts" turning the elderly out into the snow.
Instead of giving Democrats that opportunity, and instead of buying the liberal notion that real tax relief is merely pandering to the greed of the voters, Dole and Kemp will press the strength of the rest of their plan: to lift the dead hand of overregulation from job-creating businesses, and to save the consumers billions now going to the trial-lawyer lobby that bought control of Clinton policy. Result: tax relief and deficit reduction by a time certain, with a rise in the average family's buying power.
The argument (minus the I.R.S.-bashing) is sound. The Dole plan is infinitely more realistic than the Clinton plan, which is to promise lesser tax cuts at election time, and to pretend that recession will never come to drive up deficits. A cyclical downturn will come no matter who is elected; the way to break the addiction to debilitating debt is to slow down Federal spending increases, not to slow down the nation's natural growth.
That's why the San Diego convention's central message deserves attention.
Set aside the grab bag of grousing that preoccupied exclusionary ideologues: "I'm not bound by the platform," Dole asserted yesterday, gladdening libertarian hearts in what we will be reminded is the party of Lincoln.
Eschew the world-weariness of commentary that denigrates 1996's political message -- even as we protest the speech-sanitizing discipline of a party overcompensating for the 1992 convention's laxity.
Pass up the gotcha game of finding policy differences between former rivals Dole and Kemp -- when the philosophical dispute between Dole-Kemp and Clinton-Gore is fundamental.
We can tune in to a candidate who has found his theme and share the wonder of scientists who discovered life in a down-to-Earth political party.

Give Me Your Rich . . .

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
The Republican Party has a problem. Too many Americans see it as uncaring, intolerant, mean.
The early doings here in San Diego have highlighted the danger of that image. In the platform run-up to the convention Republicans have projected all the compassion of Almira Gulch, who took Toto away from Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" and later turned up as the Wicked Witch of the West. 
 "We've carried this 'Give me your tired, your poor' to an extreme under Democrat leadership," Betty Fine Collins, a delegate from Alabama, told the platform committee. The committee wrote into the platform calls for stern new immigration restrictions, including exclusion of illegal immigrants' children from public schools and summary procedures when someone like Fauziya Kasinga, the 19-year-old woman who fled Togo to escape genital mutilation, seeks asylum in this country.
Another plank demands repeal of the 14th Amendment's guarantee that every person born in the United States shall be a citizen. Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, who sponsored that proposal, said women were "coming across the border just to have babies."
The anti-abortion plank would require women to complete pregnancies even when their lives were at risk; it calls for the appointment of judges who would overrule the decision in Roe v. Wade.
Bob Dole's choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate was generally seen as designed to underline his conversion to the economics of cutting taxes and wishing the deficit away. But it was something more: an attempt to soften the image of the Republican Party.
Mr. Kemp is a compassionate politician. He has spent much of his political life trying to find ways of helping the poor and uplifting urban ghettos. He favors affirmative action. He opposed California's anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994. He is for banning assault weapons.
There are plenty of Republican politicians who show that there is such a thing as caring conservatism. Conservatism with a human face, you might say.
Senator John McCain of Arizona is an outstanding example, a model of integrity and human concern who despite years of torment as a prisoner in North Vietnam does not seem to have a mean or resentful bone in his body. He was another Vice-Presidential possibility; he may have lost out because, unlike Mr. Kemp, he is pro-choice.
Senator Dole himself, despite his lapses into bitterness and anger, is a man who understands human distress and the need for government to help. He voted for civil rights legislation years ago, and he was a leading supporter of food stamps.
The trouble is that the sharp rightward movement of recent years, and the rise of conservative religious influence, has made the party more harshly ideological. It is imbued with an unrelenting Social Darwinism, the belief that the poor get what they deserve and government must not interfere in the struggle for survival of the fittest. Republicans of that ilk attached drastic cuts in food stamps to the welfare bill that has just passed.
The delegates to the San Diego convention are mostly new-model Republicans. They do not share Jack Kemp's compassion.
In a New York Times survey of 1,310 delegates, 60 percent said civil rights laws to protect racial minorities from job discrimination were no longer necessary. A majority opposed the present legal ban on assault weapons, although a survey of registered Republicans nationally showed 56 percent in favor of it. In the national poll, Republicans favored banning illegal immigrants' children from public schools by just 48 to 46 percent; in the poll of delegates the margin was 58 to 26.
What Bob Dole can do about the image of heartlessness is limited. His party does not really believe in government responsibility for the weak and the unlucky. And his own tax plan would require enormous cuts in government spending -- none of them in defense or middle-class entitlements.
That leaves the already frayed safety net as the inevitable target. Almira Gulch would be smiling.

HEADLINE: With a Push Toward Work, Florida Gets a Jump on Welfare Overhaul

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Aug. 11

 BODY:
This month, Sophia de Jesus will start training at the Mount Sinai Medical Center here for a low-paying job, but one that the hospital has reserved for welfare recipients like her. The 36-year-old single mother dreams of becoming a nurse one day.
"I'm looking ahead," said Ms. de Jesus, who has been on and off the welfare rolls for 19 years. "I'm thinking: long-term, future." 
 The pursuit of the ideal of self-sufficiency for the poor embodied in the welfare overhaul approved by Congress last month is already under way in states like Florida, one of the first to experiment with time limits on welfare benefits and to push recipients to get jobs. The state has already passed legislation to begin implementing permanent welfare changes, and it is well ahead of the July 1997 deadline imposed by Congress for states to submit their new welfare plans to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.
But the transition from a system of guaranteed Federal cash assistance to one that leaves states with lump sums -- and decisions to make about whom to assist and how -- is fraught with anxiety and uncertainties even in well-prepared states like Florida. While Florida officials deal with the huge undertaking of transforming welfare offices into job placement centers, recruiting employers and appointing oversight boards, community agencies are holding public forums and emergency meetings to deal with the thousands of impoverished single mothers, legal immigrants and others who now face a cutoff of benefits or new requirements to find work.
A main concern for Florida is the roughly 129,000 legal immigrants who will become ineligible for food stamps and Supplemental Security Income. Agencies that deal with this population are rushing to qualify as many as possible for citizenship while bracing for the unknown.
"Certainly the elderly, those who cannot work, who have not passed citizenship exams, they're going to lose everything they have in the way of support," said Ariela Rodriguez, director of health and social services for the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Center in Miami.
As the welfare overhaul kicks in, states are deciding whether they want to continue to finance some benefits. The Federal law, for example, allows but does not require states to cut off cash assistance, Medicaid and social services for legal immigrants who now receive these benefits. Don Winstead, welfare reform administrator for Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, said the state had already chosen to continue the cash assistance.
But state law can be even stricter than the new Federal law. For instance, Congress set the lifetime limit for benefits at five years, but Florida set it at four in legislation passed in May.
Initially, states like Florida will have breathing room financially because their block grants are based on welfare rolls that have since shrunk. Florida is also looking at a healthy economy and job growth. But, warns State Representative Mary Brennan, one of the sponsors of Florida's overhaul, "there are things beyond our control."
"If Florida goes into a recession," she said, "all bets on welfare reform are off."
The new Federal law ends the guarantee of cash assistance under Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the major welfare program, and instead imposes time limits and work requirements on welfare benefits, allowing for the eventual cutoff of aid even if recipients have no jobs. Some groups, like legal immigrants, will become ineligible for most benefits and social services financed by the Federal Government, while others, like disabled children, must meet strict new standards to keep their grants.
In Florida, officials hope that at least a quarter of the 160,000 adults among the families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children will be working within two years.
Florida is offering incentives to employers to hire and retain workers, like tax exemptions on equipment purchases. Officials with the state's Department of Labor and Employment Security say that more than 1,000 businesses have enrolled since July to hire participants in the new welfare program.
The labor department and the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services are combining functions into "one-stop" centers where public assistance applicants and recipients can be screened to determine their skill and educational levels, and then be matched with jobs.
Two years ago Florida began pilot programs in two counties to test a two-year time limits on benefits, the first state to do so. Researchers who have studied those pilot programs say they are too new to yield many insights. There is no research yet on what happened to those who could not find or keep a job by the time they exhausted their benefits, for instance. Another unknown is whether those who find work will retain it for the long run and stay off welfare.
David Butler, assistant director of operations for the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit social policy research organization that studied the Florida programs under a state contract, said architects of work programs realized that some welfare recipients would not be able to work or to find jobs. He said it was up to states to decide who will be granted extensions or exemptions from requirements and who will be cut off. The challenge, he said, will be to do so in an equitable way if resources are also limited.
Ms. Brennan, noting that there is not enough money to meet the state's child-care needs, said she dreaded a worst-case scenario five years from now of increased homelessness and "bands of kids roaming the streets." Valory Greenfield, a staff lawyer with Florida Legal Services, worries about mothers being forced to leave their children home alone to go to work and then risking losing them to the state for child neglect.
"Implementation is a lot different than putting the law on paper," she said. "The devil is in the details."
Child care concerns Ms. de Jesus, who was off welfare for two years before going back on it last fall. She has been told that her subsidized rent will go up, but as she begins full-time employment she does not know what will happen to the $378 in food stamps and the $309 in Aid to Families with Dependent Children that she receives each month.
More important, she has yet to find out if she can count on child care for her two daughters, ages 9 and 12, and her 14-year-old son while she works nights at the hospital.
But in a recent interview in her spartan two-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach, she pushed every negative thought away and talked excitedly about the future. She is due to start training in the kitchen or the stockroom, but her sights are set higher. She wants to pursue nursing studies and a career.
"I want a profession," she said. "I don't want just a job."

HEADLINE: In America;
Supply-Side Seducer

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
Jack Kemp always seems to be there, whispering his wacky economic notions into the ear of some President or near-President, and the next thing you know some President or near-President is buying Mr. Kemp's brand of madness hook, line and sinker.
The press tends to portray Mr. Kemp as a friend of sorts to the cities, which is funny. If you take his economics into account, Mr. Kemp is a friend to cities in the same way that Lawrence Taylor was a friend to quarterbacks. 
 Mr. Kemp was there in the early 1980's, funneling his faith in huge tax cuts and supply-side nirvana to David Stockman, Ronald Reagan et al. The idea was that tax cuts would generate so much economic growth we would all be awash in money. The rich first, of course, but then it would rain down on the rest of us. Ronald Reagan took to it like a child to candy.
We all know what happened. The rich got richer and richer and richer. A study released last year by the Twentieth Century Fund found that by 1989 the inequality in the distribution of wealth in the United States had reached a 60-year high.
According to the fund, "The sharp increase in inequality since the late 1970's has made the distribution of wealth in this country more unequal than in what used to be perceived as the class-ridden societies of northwest Europe. Today the United States is the most unequal of any industrialized country in terms of income and, more importantly, wealth."
The most telling finding, the report said, was that the share of marketable net worth held by the top 1 percent, which had fallen by 10 percentage points between 1945 and 1976, increased from 34 percent in 1983 to 39 percent in 1989. At the same time, the report said, "the share of wealth held by the bottom 80 percent fell by more than a fifth, from 19 percent to 15 percent."
The report said: "These trends are mirrored in financial net worth, which is distributed even more unequally than total household wealth. In 1989, the top 1 percent of families as ranked by financial wealth owned 48 percent of the total." The top 20 percent of Americans "accounted for 94 percent of total financial wealth."
Welcome to the wonderful world of Jack Kemp economics. Both George Bush and Bob Dole were contemptuous of the supply-siders. But Mr. Kemp never wavered. What is ironic is that he has gotten a great deal of credit for his supposedly enlightened views concerning black Americans and the nation's cities. That credit was misplaced. Urban dwellers in general and blacks in particular have suffered dreadfully from the economic policies Jack Kemp has so relentlessly espoused.
While Mr. Kemp was mouthing pretty words about civil rights and promoting urban enterprise zones, the transfer of wealth from the bottom up meant that enormous numbers of black children were sinking ever deeper into poverty. The Twentieth Century Fund reported that in 1989 "thirty-five percent of nonwhite families reported zero or negative net worth."
Inner-city poverty was made especially hideous by the virulently anti-urban policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Starved for funds, the cities themselves sank into a miasma of crime, homelessness, hopelessness and physical decay.
Jack Kemp talks a good game about the black and the poor, but the real-world effect of his tax-cutting mission has always been to radically increase the wealth of the powerful and the privileged. Steve Forbes understands that. He and Mr. Kemp are soul mates on the tax issue.
Like Mr. Forbes, the rest of us should take it with a grain of salt when Mr. Kemp speaks, as he did Saturday, of "parents who lay awake at night because they can't pay their taxes or their bills," and "workers in the permanent recession of stagnant wages," and "the children of poverty in America's inner cities who have never seen a business open in their life."
Take it with a grain of salt because Mr. Kemp's mission, if he becomes Vice President, will be to push Bob Dole into cutting taxes as quickly and as radically as he can. We know the implications of that as well as Mr. Forbes does. We know who will pay for those tax cuts. And who will reap the rewards.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reaches Airline Accord On Venezuela

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The United States and Venezuela have agreed to allow continued air service between their two countries for 30 days as Venezuela tries to meet international safety standards.
The agreement calls for Venezuela's Transportation Ministry to intensify its oversight of Venezuelan aircraft flying to the United States from Venezuela, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 
 In addition, Venezuela agreed to develop a detailed plan for meeting international safety rules and to forbid flights to the United States by any Venezuelan aircraft found by Venezuelan or American inspectors to have safety problems. Caracas must meet these requirements by Sept. 9.
The F.A.A. had previously lowered Venezuela's rating to Category 2, meaning it found that the country's civil aviation safety criteria did not meet all international standards.
The American Transportation Secretary, Federico F. Pena, and Transport Minister Moises Orozco Graterol of Venezuela reached agreement on Saturday, the F.A.A. said.
American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, and the UAL Corporation's United Airlines have resumed flights to Venezuela. American operates three flights daily from Caracas to Miami and one daily to New York. All were suspended on Thursday after Venezuelan authorities said the carriers' jets did not meet safety standards and prevented their departure with passengers. The move, which stranded hundreds of travelers, was seen as retaliation for the downgrading by the F.A.A..
Concern about the safety of Venezuela's airlines mounted in the last two years as an economic crisis prompted the Government to enact foreign-exchange regulations, limiting access to dollars. Venezuelan carriers could not buy parts, forcing them to ground many jets. Exchange regulations were lifted on April 22.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: TELEVISION;
On Small Screen, Tone Will Be Reagan Redux

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Almost everything that television viewers will see during the 1996 Republican National Convention defies convention, from its five-minute speechettes to its live broadcasts from remote sites. Almost, but not quite.
For the theme of the show, party leaders say, will be the Republican vision of opportunity and optimism for mainstream America -- the theme that won two terms in office for Ronald Reagan. 
 And that should come as no surprise, because some of Mr. Reagan's most valued aides wrote much of the script.
"All the old hands of Republican image-making are there -- Deaver, Duberstein, Tutwiler," a television producer said, referring to Michael K. Deaver, Mr. Reagan's right-hand adviser; Kenneth M. Duberstein, who had been Mr. Reagan's chief of staff, and Margaret D. Tutwiler, the strategist and aide to another chief of staff, James A. Baker.
Another image professional from the Reagan era, William Greener, has overseen the nuts-and-bolts assembly of the Republican show.
Mr. Greener was deputy political director of the Republican National Committee in the 1980's.
Their notion is to wipe away the sour image of the party as a radical, intolerant organization that some voters have accepted since the 1992 convention and the Republicans' seizure of Congress in 1994, when hard-line conservatives took control over many policy decisions.
And so in many ways, what viewers do not see will be as important as what they do. And what they will not see is any hint of the war between centrists and the right, over issues from abortion to foreign policy, that has split the party and dominated the convention preliminaries last week.
No, this will be a happy convention, scripted to run nightly between 9 P.M. and 11 P.M. Eastern time (with the best events in the last hour, when most sets are turned on) and wrapping up in time for the local news.
Scripted or not, every convention takes on its own video personality by the time the balloons come down on nomination night.
As this one unfolds, here are a few things to mull over:
 
The Big Shots
Monday is theme-setting night, when the party pulls out its biggest guns to set the tone for what is to follow.
The party will roll out its howitzer: Colin L. Powell, the retired Army general, self-proclaimed moderate Republican and much-touted choice for President, someday. Expect a somewhat longer-than-normal speech from Mr. Powell, heavy on patriotism and laced with an exploration of the Republican principles that drew him into the party. (A tidbit: the Republican who most insistently called for Mr. Powell to seek the Presidency this year was Jack F. Kemp, Bob Dole's running mate.)
 
Spotlight on Gingrich
The most unpopular national politician in the country, Speaker Newt Gingrich, also happens to be the permanent chairman of the convention, a job that traditionally includes a speech. Mr. Gingrich's is set for Tuesday.
How will the Dole camp handle a prime-time appearance by the man Democrats call a symbol of Republican radicalism? (Hint: Expect Mr. Gingrich to speak from somewhere outside the convention hall.)
 
Everything in Moderation
Representative Susan Molinari of New York, the moderate supporter of abortion rights chosen by Mr. Dole as the keynote speaker, will address the convention on Tuesday. Will she address the abortion battle that is splintering the party? Or will she talk about her admission this month, reversing an earlier denial, that she smoked marijuana in her youth?
Although the party platform wound up echoing the beliefs of Patrick J. Buchanan as much as those of Mr. Dole, the man who beat him for the nomination, Mr. Buchanan will not speak at the convention. Instead, viewers will see a disproportionate stream of centrists at the podium: Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, who supports abortion rights; Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey; Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and President Reagan's pragmatic adviser, Mr. Baker, among them.
Mr. Buchanan, an old hand at manipulating the media, will surely devise a way to seize the cameras, however briefly, during the convention.
 
The Orators
Mr. Dole delivers the convention's final speech on Thursday. Can he rouse a crowd, or will he revert to senatorial style, mumbling clipped sentences about obscure issues? Will he be overshadowed by his Vice-Presidential nominee, who speaks immediately before him? Can Representative John Kasich of Ohio, the hyperbolic exponent of the Republican message, limit himself to five minutes at a microphone on Tuesday?
 
Over the Top
Mr. Dole's big moment comes Wednesday night, when the one convention tradition that the script writers saved -- the roll call of the states -- delivers him the Presidential nomination. Past conventions exploited that climactic event with wide-angle shots of cheering throngs and cascades of balloons drifting down form the ceiling. But San Diego's hall is too small for a real throng, and the ceiling is too low for many balloons. The Republican solution to those problems could be interesting to watch.
 
 The Hall of Presidents
Opening night in San Diego will feature the roll out of all three living Republican Presidents -- Gerald Ford, George Bush and Ronald Reagan, who will appear only in a filmed tribute.
Will memories of Mr. Ford and Mr. Bush, both of whom lost re-election battles in large part because of hard economic times, wear well with viewers? And will the soaring tribute to Mr. Reagan, who has Alzheimer's disease, rend viewers' heartstrings as it has at past conventions? Or will it seem like a rerun? Part of the answer may lie with Mr. Reagan's wife Nancy, who will deliver an emotion-packed speech after the film.
 
For Something Different
Finally, viewers who tire of sober-sided convention fare might tune into the cable channel Comedy Central, which will again be covering the Republican and Democratic conventions in its own peculiar way.
How peculiar? Well, the correspondents are led by Al Franken, the liberal veteran of "Saturday Night Live" and author of "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot," and Arianna Huffington, the new-wave conservative political strategist, columnist and all-around celebrity from California.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS -- AN AMERICAN PLACE: Watching From Afar;
Kemp Brings Sense of Relief And Hope for Ohio's G.O.P.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 11

 BODY:
From Bill Ovecka, a salesman who had just finished 18 holes at the Bob-O-Link golf course, and Harold Ebert, a tree surgeon carrying a new shovel out the front door of Frye Servistar Hardware, to Norman Dick, polishing off his usual Sunday morning coffee and glazed at the Donut Kettle, and Dale Holwick Jr., an usher at the United Methodist church where President William McKinley used to worship, Republicans here had nothing but hopeful things to say about the choice of Jack Kemp as their Vice-Presidential candidate.
At times, they shouted, they were so worked up. On Saturday, as Representative Ralph Regula, the Republican Congressman from the area, marched through nearby Alliance in the annual Carnation City Festival parade, people yelled, "Yo!" "Ralph!" "Kemp!" and gave the thumbs-up sign. 
 But in their praise, the Republicans also revealed their fears about Bob Dole's candidacy for President. Mr. Ebert, like so many interviewed, was happy to have a younger man on the ticket. "Dole's age may be agin him," he said. And Mr. Ovecka was excited about adding someone he called so "Reaganesque." Mr. Dick was relieved to have a candidate he thought was impressive on television. "CNN and all of those guys seem to like Kemp," he said. And Mr. Holwick said the selection of Mr. Kemp was a welcome break after the "problems in the party," meaning abortion.
Furthermore, if the men getting their hair cut at Brunner's, a barbershop on South Market Street with a black clientele, are any indication, Mr. Kemp's supposed appeal in minority neighborhoods has not registered. "Kemp? He won't get my vote," said Raphiel Carter, who works two jobs that pay little more than minimum wage to make ends meet. "Republicans are the ones who create $4.95-an-hour factory jobs."
Here in Stark County, a place that mirrors national voting trends, the selection of Mr. Kemp appears to be a good one for Republicans. They have plainly been energized by his choice. Virtually every one of the three dozen interviewed from both parties recognized his name, and no one had anything bad to say about him personally. There are even Democrats, like Chris James, a union leader and a Clinton supporter, with nice things to say. "Jack Kemp's a good person and he gets across to more people," said Mr. James, vice president of a union local at Republic Engineered Steels.
While none of them said Mr. Kemp would prompt them to cross party lines, a few Republicans, like Claire-Marie Brown, a retired teacher who is leaning toward President Clinton, now say they will take a second look at the Republicans. "I'm not terrified of Dole's age, but it is a factor," Ms. Brown said. "Right now, I'd still go for Clinton, but I like that Kemp's not as stodgy as Dole, and I'm going to research him."
The national commentators have made much of the past policy differences between the two top Republicans, but many here see it as a sign of strength that Mr. Dole would pick someone who disagrees with him on some matters. As Representative Regula said, "If John Kennedy could pick Johnson, anything can work."
Jim Leath, a computer salesman and a Republican, said that the choice of Mr. Kemp had given him faith that the 15 percent cut in Federal income taxes promised by Mr. Dole would actually happen. He admires Mr. Kemp for holding to ideas, like supply-side economics, when they grew unpopular. "Kemp sticks with things," he said. "Clinton talks about things, shallow things that satisfy for the moment."
The Stark party leaders -- including Representative Regula; Charles Brown, the party chairman, and W. R. Timken Jr., chairman of the Timken bearing and steel company -- all said they were pleased that Mr. Kemp was the choice instead of the three men most often mentioned last week, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, Senator Connie Mack of Florida and former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina.
Mr. Ovecka agreed. "Kemp's a national figure -- he's not like the Mayor of South Carolina or Governor or whatever," he said.
In the course of a 15-minute telephone interview from San Diego, Mr. Timken, a Dole delegate to the convention, referred to Mr. Kemp as "Mr. Honesty," "Mr. Integrity" and "Mr. Outreach."
But whether Mr. Outreach will help Mr. Dole with two constituencies he desperately needs to attract -- women and minorities -- is not a sure thing. A poll of the county by The New York Times in the spring indicated that both groups were leaning strongly toward Mr. Clinton.
In interviews, Republican women like Judy Vaughn sounded less enthusiastic than their husbands about Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp.
"I will vote for Mr. Dole," said Charles Vaughn, who owns a business.
"Dole? Yes, I guess," said Mrs. Vaughn, a stockbroker's assistant.
Beverly White, a county social service worker who worshiped this morning at the United Methodist Church of the Savior, had thought she would vote Republican this time, but now plans to vote for Mr. Clinton. "Kemp? she said. "I hardly know him beyond his name."
Representative Regula pointed out that he and Mr. Kemp had served together on the Federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Day as a national holiday. And Mr. Regula had a major role in bringing in Representative J. C. Watts, a black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, as the featured speaker for the Stark County party's annual McKinley dinner in May. But it was striking that of the 300 Republicans who attended that night, Representative Watts was the only black person.
At Brunner's barbershop this morning, Mr. Kemp inspired little interest among the black middle- and working-class men getting their haircuts. "As a football player, he was O.K.," said the barber, Delbert Brunner Jr., "but as a government official, no."
Even Emmit Jones, a pipefitter for East Ohio Gas who was the most positive about Mr. Kemp among those in the barbershop -- saying he was willing to listen because of his concern about cutting welfare rolls, crime and taxes, all popular Republican positions -- said it would take a drastic change in the Republicans to get him to switch from Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Carter, who lost a union job at an auto plant when the company, the Dyneer Corporation, moved south, said that he was angry he had to hold down two jobs just to keep up, and that he, like most people, would vote his pocketbook this time. "Republicans never did anything for a poor man," he said.
Indeed, as people from Stark County drove home from the barber and church and the doughnut shop this afternoon, the news announcer on WHBC, the local radio station, was saying that a new state report indicates that the personal income of the average Ohio resident was lagging because of job losses in the high-paying manufacturing sector.
 
An American Place
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. As the November election approaches, this is the 21st article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REFORM PARTY;
Reform Party, Full of Fervor, Opens Session

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., Aug. 11

 BODY:
Former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado, who is challenging Ross Perot for the Reform Party's Presidential nomination, opened the first stage of its bicoastal convention here tonight with the charge that the major parties "are recklessly driving this country into bankruptcy."
Mr. Perot, the billionaire businessman from Texas, who has often pictured himself as a reluctant politician, said when his turn to speak came later, "I want to be your President." 
 He told 1,500-odd fervent, placard-waving party supporters, mostly Californians and predominantly middle-aged, at the Terrace Theater of the Long Beach Convention Center, "We've got to continue to organize, we have to win in '96 for this country, and we can win." He called for an end to "negative, mean-spirited, mud-slinging politics."
Short on brass bands and bunting, long on condemnation of the political status quo, the meeting was televised on CNN and C-SPAN and watched by other party backers at home or in larger groups in motels or restaurants across the country.
Russell Verney, the party coordinator, said that 1,113,000 ballots bearing Mr. Lamm's and Mr. Perot's names had been mailed to people who signed Reform petitions in recent months. They will be able to vote by mail, through an Internet Web site or by phone, if they did not do so in person at the hall, and the results will be tallied under the supervision of Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
The outcome will be disclosed next Saturday evening or Sunday morning, party officials said, and the winner will accept the nomination at a second convention session next Sunday afternoon at Valley Forge, Pa., outside Philadelphia. Few doubt it will be Mr. Perot, who created and largely financed the new party.
Judging from campaign signs and the volume and duration of applause, the Texan had the support of about two-thirds of those in the audience.
In his speech, Mr. Lamm, who has long advocated sharp reductions in the size of government, backed a balanced-budget amendment and reductions in Federal spending on Social Security. Above all, he said, "we must quit using tax cuts as election-year gimmicks to buy votes." Both President Clinton and Bob Dole, the prospective Republican Presidential nominee, have proposed tax reductions.
Mr. Lamm said in the earnest tones of a political science professor, without oratorical flourishes, what neither Republican nor Democratic candidates have been willing to say in recent years -- that the American public would have "to make reasonable sacrifices" if they wished to achieve what he described as "a more stable and optimistic America." He has often been attacked in the past by political opponents for practicing what was once called "root-canal politics."
A former Democrat, Mr. Lamm advocated curbs on immigration, asserting that 83 percent of Americans believe that too many immigrants are now admitted.
"We are no longer an empty continent that can absorb all the world's 'huddled masses,' " he said. "We must place as a first priority our own 'huddled masses.' We must understand that the Statue of Liberty stands for liberty, not for unlimited immigration."
Like Patrick J. Buchanan, one of the unsuccessful contenders for the Republican nomination, Mr. Lamm, 61 years old and out of office for a decade, pictured the United States as a nation rapidly losing its economic pre-eminence.
"We've transformed an economically powerful nation into the world's largest debtor nation," he said. "And we do this to maintain a life style which we have not earned for ourselves.
"My generation inherited a strong, united country and we are on the verge of leaving a weakened and dangerously divided America."
The Lamm forces continued to complain that they had been unfairly treated by the Perot forces right up to the opening of the convention. His press secretary, Eric Anderson, who said the former Governor had raised only about $130,000 so far, complained that he still had not been able to gain access to computer listings of the party's membership that are controlled by party headquarters in Dallas.
But each candidate praised the other, and they briefly joined each other on the stage at the end, shaking the hands of people in the audience.
Mr. Lamm last week chose a Republican, Ed Zschau, a northern California businessman and former Representative, as his running mate. Mr. Perot is to name his choice, aides said, only if he is confirmed as the nominee next weekend.
Seeking to differentiate himself from Mr. Perot, Mr. Lamm said that he and Mr. Zschau "bring the type of new leadership to the reform movement which is needed if our party is to grow, mature and become a significant influence in American politics."
He and his running mate, Mr. Lamm said, "bring the experience of having served in public office as well as the passion to see that our Government is fundamentally reformed."
A naval officer before entering the computer-service business, Mr. Perot has never been public office.
He was his usual feisty self tonight, lecturing his listeners about the problems with the American political system, boasting about his experience in working on "complex systems," using charts to illustrate his points and repeatedly telling them to "think about it." For the most part, he stuck close to the set speech he has made for years.
He castigated American trade negotiators, suggesting that they had struck deals unfavorable to the United States because of the corrupting effect of lobbyists' campaign contributions. He said that only the United States managed to run deficits with China, charged that Europe had made a fair more equitable deal on trade with Japan than the United States and accused Mexico of waging "chemical warfare against our children" in the form of drugs sent into the United States.
"These are the jobs that could revitalize our inner cities," Mr. Perot said. "What do we do? We send them overseas, to people in sweatshops."
All through his speech, Mr. Perot vilified politics and politicians. He described American Government as now constituted as "a blend of magic acts, acting and delusion." He mocked Mr. Dole's plans to cut taxes when Government revenues were already inadequate to meet expenses. He insisted that George Washington could never be elected in a system that is "all play-acting and no substance."
"War has rules, mud-wrestling has rules but politics has no rules," he said. "This must be corrected."
Although each was theoretically allotted the same amount of time, Mr. Perot spoke almost twice as long as Mr. Lamm -- just under an hour.
The session opened with a slickly produced video extolling the virtues of the new party, an outgrowth of Mr. Perot's United We Stand America, which was created after Mr. Perot's independent run for President in 1992. He took 18.9 percent of the popular vote. Recent polls suggest that he would draw about the same in a three-way contest this November with Mr. Clinton and former Senator Dole.
Against soft-focus pictures of clouds, waves, mountains, deserts, sunsets and babbling brooks, over patriotic anthems, a narrator said the new party was "founded on integrity, searching for a way to make America proud again." Its goal, he said, was a nation "where a simple handshake is as good as your word."
Recorded interviews with rank-and-file members of the party appeared on large television screens in the wings above the stage. And an official of Ernst & Young appeared, to explain the voting process.
With few exceptions, the speakers were political amateurs and unaccustomed to speaking to large audiences, which gave the proceedings a homey quality that differed sharply from the tightly scripted speeches by professionals that predominate at the major-party conventions. Many of those who spoke for Mr. Perot were people whom Mr. Perot had helped when relatives were sick or otherwise in trouble.
Mr. Verney, who was master of ceremonies, said the two Reform Party meetings, plus two mailings related to the balloting, would cost about $6.4 million -- a pittance, he said, compared with the tens of millions being spent on the Republican National Convention, which opens Monday just two hours' drive down the Pacific Coast in San Diego.
That meeting, he predicted, will be just "a four-day TV commercial."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
DOLE, IN SAN DIEGO, QUICKLY ZEROES IN ON THE PRESIDENT

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
With a colorful spectacle of boats, afternoon fireworks and partisan politics, Bob Dole arrived today for his long-awaited convention with his new running mate, Jack Kemp, and a rousing pitch for his centerpiece plan to cut taxes.
As buoyant supporters chanted "Dole-Kemp, Dole-Kemp" at a rally in a sunny park jutting into the San Diego Bay, Mr. Dole immediately went on the attack against President Clinton in a speech that signaled a bruising fall campaign in which the Republicans will appeal to the anxiety of middle-class voters. 
 "If Bill Clinton opposed tax cuts, he obviously didn't mean it when he said the era of big Government was over," said Mr. Dole in a punchy dry run for his Presidential nomination acceptance speech on Thursday. "I think what's happening, the era of Bill Clinton is about over. And that is going to happen sooner than you think."
After a primary campaign that was notable for his stark appeals to conservatives, Mr. Dole, who told The San Diego Union-Tribune that he had not even read the party's starkly conservative platform [Article, page B5], also sought today to strike a more broadly appealing, confident tone. He repeatedly invoked Ronald Reagan, the last Republican who rode to the White House on a promise of tax cuts.
"It's time to lift up America," Mr. Dole said. "Lift up America. Lift up our economy. Lift up our schools. Lift up our families. Lift up our values. And, most of all, lift up our expectations. And that's exactly what Jack Kemp and I are going to do."
As the Republicans sought a harmonious pose, even Patrick J. Buchanan seemed to cooperate by halting his candidacy. At a rally tonight north of here in Escondido, Mr. Buchanan proclaimed a "truce of San Diego." But in suggesting he would not torment Mr. Dole "for the next 10 weeks," Mr. Buchanan stopped short of a formal endorsement and barely uttered Mr. Dole's name.
Rather than praise Mr. Dole, Mr. Buchanan devoted his speech to ridiculing Mr. Clinton.
And in his new subordinate role, Mr. Kemp also took aim Mr. Clinton, accusing the White House of "kibitzing and criticism" of Mr. Dole's blueprint to cut taxes and balance the budget. "The President has said he is unalterably opposed," said the former Congressman. "His advisers have said it can't be done. They don't know Bob Dole and they don't know Jack Kemp either."
Saying that "everything before has been a warm-up lap, a trial heat," Mr. Dole was seeking a fresh start for his campaign as thousands of Republicans poured into this clean and breezy city for the convention that opens on Monday and will nominate him to be President of the United States -- a moment for which Mr. Dole has longed for since his shattering loss in the 1988 primaries to George Bush.
Republicans are counting on their four-day, made-for-television extravaganza to help Mr. Dole close Mr. Clinton's months-long lead in the polls -- and to dress up the image of a party that many Americans blame for shutting down the Government last year.
Besides Mr. Buchanan rally, there were more political dealings up the coast, in Long Beach. In a gathering that could spell more trouble for the Republicans in the fall, the Reform Party, established by Ross Perot, opened its convention, with Mr. Perot and former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado vying for the nomination.
In his speech today, Mr. Dole did his best to pre-empt the competition. "As of now, the President and his party are the party of the status quo," Mr. Dole said. "We are the reform party." He added, "We have all the ideas, and they have all the excuses."
But in presenting the new ticket as oriented to the future, Mr. Dole turned to the past. From the opening line, when he asserted, "We're going to win one for the Gipper," his speech was salted with references to carrying the banner of Ronald Reagan -- through a proposal that he claims would cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time.
"One man, Ronald Reagan, really did start it all," he said. "And we're thinking of him today, and God bless Ronald Reagan today. Now it's up to us to finish the job, and win the Reagan revolution once and for all. And we're going to get it done. Make no mistake about it. And that's why we're going to cut taxes, tax rates across the board for every working person in this country."
Mr. Dole was apparently attempting to goad Democrats into making the same mistake they made in 1994, when they sought to identify Republican Congressional candidates with Mr. Reagan's economic policies. The effort backfired because Democrats failed to appreciate Mr. Reagan's enduring popularity with American public.
Beyond the oratory, the symbols throughout Mr. Dole's showy entrance were unusual for his campaign -- and reminiscent of the well-polished campaigns of Mr. Reagan. It was no accident that several of Mr. Reagan's image-makers, including Michael K. Deaver, have important roles at the convention.
After flying here from Mr. Dole's hometown of Russell, Kan., where Mr. Dole announced on Saturday that he had selected Mr. Kemp as his running man, the two men and their wives, Elizabeth Hanford Dole and Joanne Kemp, arrived at the rally on a tour boat, waving from the deck, surrounded by sailboats, steam boats and a smattering of yachts. As the rally ended, a huge blue curtain behind the candidates dropped, revealing a depiction of the facade of the White House that rose from beneath the stage. It was not lost on some in the audience that the White House tilted to the left. All the while, the blue sky was crowded with sky divers and vintage airplanes.
The rally also marked the second major appearance of the new ticket. And in introducing Mr. Dole, Mr. Kemp sought to dispel speculation that he would be an uncooperative No. 2, given his independent streak and his years of tense relations with Mr. Dole.
Still, the loquacious Mr. Kemp also came close to upstaging the leading candidate on the ticket: he spoke for only three minutes less than Mr. Dole.
But Mr. Dole -- not his running mate -- was more aggressive today in attacking the President -- a role that the No. 2 on the ticket usually plays but which Mr. Dole had pledged not to put on Mr. Kemp.
While he rarely strayed from economic themes, Mr. Dole ridiculed Mr. Clinton on foreign policy and other issues. "Bill Clinton's weakness and vacillation have done for American leadership abroad what the Titanic did for sea cruises years ago," he said. And he revived his popular line from earlier this year about the United Nations, saying, "The last time I checked the Constitution, it said the President should be Commander in Chief, not Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations."
Mr. Dole and his aides seemed in particularly high spirits, not only because of the long-awaited convention but because their broke campaign is now due for an infusion of nearly $70 million in Federal money. On Monday, the campaign will roll out a television advertising blitz touting the economic plan.
Yet despite Mr. Dole's well-orchestrated entrance, there was evidence of the strains that Republicans hope to paper over amid the pomp this week. As Mr. Dole was speaking, a banner on one of the cabin cruisers circling the harbor objected to the anti-abortion language in the platform. It declared: "Yank the plank."

Excerpts From Remarks by Kemp and Dole on Arrival in San Diego

 BODY:
Excerpts from remarks by Jack Kemp and Bob Dole yesterday as they arrived in San Diego, as transcribed by The New York Times.
 
Jack Kemp 
 Bob and I have been talking about these great Olympic Games that made us all, as Americans, so very proud. I don't know and I've never had the honor of participating in the Olympics, and I don't know how it feels to win a silver medal, but let me say to all my friends in this audience, it really feels great to win a silver medal in Presidential politics 1997.
And let me tell you this from the bottom of my heart: With Bob Dole, America can win the gold. . . .
What a thrill it is to be here with Joanne, to be in San Diego, the gateway to the Pacific, the bridge to Latin America, the birthplace of California, to begin a campaign to help give America a new birth of freedom. And to elect a man with the integrity, the strength of character and the will to get the job done, the next President of the United States, Bob Dole. . . .
The media has reported that Bob Dole's going to have a problem, perhaps, choosing a quarterback for his running mate. Let me just tell you here today, unambiguously, Bob, you're the quarterback and I'm your blocker, and we're going all the way. I think you know that I didn't ask for the honor of being Bob Dole's running mate. I didn't pursue it. I didn't expect it. And I really admire all of the other great men and women that Bob Dole had to consider in our party. But I'll admit when Bob asked me to run on his ticket, I said yes faster than the Democrats can raise taxes.
Not only did I say yes, I've got to let you in on something, the real quarterback in the Kemp family, Joanne, said yes. Because we believe in Bob and Elizabeth Dole, we believe in the party of Lincoln, America needs his leadership to take us in a new direction for the new millennium. America needs more economic growth, more opportunity, more jobs with rising incomes at home and leadership and cultural renewal for America in the world. That's what America and the world needs and that's why we must elect Bob Dole the next President of the United States of America. . . .
Now, we've heard some kibitzing from the left, we've heard some rather choice comments from the Clinton White House about plans to both balance the budget -- now wait a minute, wait, wait, wait; no booing. I'm the quarterback, at least for the moment. No talking in the huddle -- There's been some kibitzing and criticism of our plans to both balance the budget and give long-overdue tax relief to the families and workers of America. The President has said he is unalterably opposed. His advisers have said it can't be done. They don't know Bob Dole, and they don't know Jack Kemp either. With a pro-growth Republican Congress, balancing the budget while cutting taxes is a matter of Presidential will. If you have it, you can do it. Bob Dole has the will. Bob Dole will do it. . . .
President Clinton's opposition to our tax cuts shows that he really doesn't believe the era of big government is over. He kind of believes that it's just kind of catching its breath, waiting for the results in November, he thinks, and getting ready to take over health care and to take another bite out of your wallet, your property and your life. We're here to say they're wrong. We're here to say they are wrong. It is over once and for all. Thanks to you, Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole.
Here's what a Bob Dole White House will mean to you and your families: more money in your pockets and your savings account. More jobs in your community. More hope for those who have been left behind. And more opportunity for people across this country. . . .
Ladies and gentlemen, we want a net of welfare and safety under which people should not be allowed to fall. But we are going to go to work on building a ladder of opportunity upon which every American can climb. . . .
With Bob Dole in the White House, it will mean safer streets and safer schools and a real drug war. Fewer regulations out of Washington, D.C. That's a future that all of us must work for. . . .
It is the greatest honor of my public life to join in this historic mission to restore the American dream and to give our nation that new birth of freedom.
 
Bob Dole
There's no better way to arrive in San Diego than with a former quarterback and captain of the Chargers. And Jack, we're happy to have you on board. I said I'd pick a Vice President who rates a 10. But I did even better. I picked one that had No. 15 on his jersey every day he played football. So I got a No. 15.
My friends, this is your Republican ticket. Come on up here Jack. And keep in mind, these are two four-letter words you can teach your children: Dole-Kemp. . . .
The American people have waited long enough. And now it's time to bring back growth and opportunity to this country, to restore the American dream and to give our nation a new birth of freedom, and that's what this campaign is going to be about, all over America. Everything before has been a warm-up lap, a trial heat. But here, in San Diego, the real race begins. . . .
We have an opportunity we haven't had for a long, long time. We've had a lot of years of the status quo and high taxes and high spending and high deficits and low expectations. When Ronald Reagan was in the White House, the Democrats in Congress wouldn't cut spending. Now we have a Republican Congress, but we have a President who's vetoed a balanced budget and submitted budgets with debt as far as the eye can see. But in 1996 we're going to turn things around. All we have to do is elect a Republican Congress and a Republican President, and we'll end the gridlock of the big spenders. . . .
And no doubt about it, one man, Ronald Reagan, really did start it all. And we're thinking of him today, and God bless Ronald Reagan today. Now it's up to us to finish the job, and win the Reagan revolution once and for all. And we're going to get it done. Make no mistake about it. And that's why we're going to cut taxes, tax rates across the board for every working person in this country. Nothing very complicated about it at all. If you pay taxes under my plan you pay less. That's not too complicated. You pay 15 percent less. That's not too complicated. There's that number 15 again, 15 percent less. . . .
In a lot of two-income families one spouse works full time to support the family, while the other works full time to support the Government. It shouldn't have to be that way in the United States of America.
Now of course in our family, starting in January, I'll be the spouse working for the Government. But that's a sacrifice that I'm willing to make. But if both spouses in a family work, they should do it because they want to, not because they have to to pay higher taxes. And that's why we're going to balance the budget and cut taxes. And it can be done at the same time. . . .
Bill Clinton says that he and his party, and I use a quote, he said, we are unalterably opposed to our, to our tax relief program. Now frankly, I didn't think there was such a thing as a Clinton position that couldn't be altered. So this has to be a first. This has to be a first. Bill Clinton and his party say that balancing the budget while cutting taxes cannot be done. Well, let them speak for themselves, and we'll speak for the American people. . . .
So we have a chance to make history by remaking America. As of now, the President and his party are the party of the status quo. We are the reform party; Mr. Perot and all the others looking for a reform party, we are the reform party, the Republican Party is the reform party. We are the party of change. We have all the ideas, and they have all the excuses. We're going to create more jobs by cutting the taxes on capital gains in half, create jobs and opportunities all across America. . . .
It's time to lift up America. Lift up America. Lift up our economy. Lift up our schools. Lift up our families. Lift up our values. And, most of all, lift up our expectations. And that's exactly what Jack Kemp and I are going to do as President and Vice President of the United States.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CONVENTION;
Speeches Are Friendly But Crowd Is Partisan

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., Aug. 11

 BODY:
Were it not for the very public disputes between Ross Perot's aides and Richard D. Lamm's over the condition of the Reform Party Presidential playing field, tonight's convention speeches would suggest that the wealthy Texan and the former Governor of Colorado were card-carrying members of the same mutual admiration society.
When Mr. Lamm came on stage, he opened his speech with a tribute to Mr. Perot. He thanked Mr. Perot for founding the national Reform Party movement and underwriting the cost of getting it on the ballot nationwide. "Ross, we salute you," he said at the end of his tribute. 
 Later when Mr. Perot came out to give his speech, he praised his rival. "I would like to compliment Governor Lamm on an outstanding speech," Mr. Perot said.
The first part of the party's two-part national convention today drew 2,616 people, said Patricia Muth, a staff member of the national Reform Party. She said about 1,500 came with paper ballots.
Party supporters who did not need to sleep on the speeches and their evaluations of the candidates filled in and signed their ballots and deposited them in boxes on the way out of the auditorium this evening.
Both the Lamm and Perot camps predicted that most of the voting would go on in the first 24 hours or so after today's speeches.
Both Russell Verney, national director of efforts to get the party on the ballot and a Perot aide, and Tom D'Amore, a senior Lamm adviser, said they expected most of the voting to be conducted when the voters' impresssions were still fresh.
After Starr Sorensen deposited her paper ballot in one of the boxes on the floor here at the theater in the Long Beach Convention Center, she said she had voted for Mr. Lamm because he had "a fresh face, fresh ideas."
A resident of Manhattan Beach, not far from Los Angeles, she said she had voted for Mr. Perot in the 1992 Presidential election but now felt Mr. Lamm would be best to carry the Reform Party's agenda, which calls for reducing the Federal debt, the Federal deficit and campaign finance reform among other proposals. Prior to 1992, she said she generally had voted for Republicans.
Fereuza Gifford, a San Francisco resident, who deposited her ballot at almost the same time as Starr Sorensen said that she had cast her ballot for Mr. Perot. She said Mr. Perot's command of economic facts and figures and his success in the private sector led to her to back him over Mr. Lamm. In the 1992 Presidential election, she said he had voted for Mr. Perot.
Many of convention-goers said they had little sympathy for the Lamm campaign's tussles with the Perot camp over access to the list of 1.3 million Reform Party supporters and other misgivings the Lamm camp has about the fairness of the selection process. "All these Lamm people think they have something coming to them," Mrs. Downing said. Mr. Perot's aides, she said, "should throw him off the boat."
Of Mr. Perot, she added: "The man is such a true patriot. How could anybody equal his standards?"
Ever since Mr. Perot announced in July that he would be a candidate for the party's Presidential nomination, Mr. Verney and the Perot Reform Committee have maintained that there was no conflict among the committee's multiple roles: running the convention, getting the party on the ballot nationally and handling the campaign needs of Mr. Perot.
In keeping with this stance, Mr. Perot's aides had to remove two honeydew melons from two fruit trays today because the name of Mr. Perot had been carved into the melons.
Wherever Reform Party supporters gathered today and Saturday, they have carried on a lively debate about the merits of having either Mr. Perot or Mr. Lamm at the head of the ticket. Robert Reynolds, a '92 volunteer for Mr. Perot who used to vote for Republicans, wants the Texan at the top of the ticket.
"My fear is that you'd lose 10 to 12 points if we jump on the Lamm bandwagon," he said at a reception on Saturday night. "I don't think Mr. Lamm has a commitment to party-building. He's in the candidate-building mode."
Mr. Reynolds, a lawyer and certified public accountant from the Arlington, Tex., area, said he believed it would be foolhardy not to take advantage of the $30 million or so in Federal money Mr. Perot is eligible to spend in the fall based on his 1992 performance. If Mr. Lamm were to win the nomination, his chances of getting the Federal money transferred to his campaign are unknown.
Mr. Reynolds was one of many party members who attended a reception aboard the Queen Mary, the old Cunard ocean liner that has been moored here as a hotel and tourist attraction for many years.
Across the deck, Thomas Torrence said he hoped that Mr. Lamm would win the nomination during the balloting that will begin today and probably run through Saturday.
"I don't think Perot has the capacity to govern," said Mr. Torrence, who drove 16 hours and 1,140 miles from McMinnville, Ore. "I think he only has the capacity to criticize."

 Colin L. Powell, born in Harlem and reared in the South Bronx, retired from the Army after serving as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993. Mr. Powell then led a relatively quiet life until last fall with the publication of his autobiography, "My American Journey."
Mr. Powell, 59, began looming large in Presidential politics. He was widely believed to have considered a run for the Presidency, and then became a top prospect as a Vice-Presidential candidate on a Republican ticket.
 
 John Engler
Governor
Gov. John Engler of Michigan was first elected to the State House of Representa tives in 1970. He went on the serve in the State Senate, and later became its majority leader. He was elected Governor in 1990 and re-elected in 1994. Mr. Engler, 47, served as the chairman for the Republican Governors Association.
 
 Mary Fisher
AIDS Activist
Mary Fisher changed the way many Americans think about the AIDS virus with a poignant speech, at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, about her life since testing positive for HIV. Ms. Fisher, 48, had contracted the disease from her former husband. She has worked to bring attention to the disease through the Family AIDS Network, which she founded to promote care for people with AIDS. Ms. Fisher's speech will introduce a section called "Main Street Americans," which will highlight delegates involved in community organizations.
 
 Bill Paxon

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trading Is Lackluster As Activity Focuses on Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen and ended unchanged against the German mark yesterday, despite the mark's growing strength over doubts about the prospect of achieving European monetary union in 1999.
The mark's rise, particularly against the French franc, was the focus of currency trading yesterday. 
 "With no news or data from the U.S. to guide the dollar, U.S. currency was again at the whim" of trading among other currencies, said Tom O'Malley, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
In late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.4780 marks, unchanged from Friday. The dollar traded at 107.63 yen, down from 108.24 yen, and at 5.0580 French francs, up from 5.0550 francs. The British pound fell to $1.5515 from $1.5485.
In other currency trading, the French franc fell to its lowest level against the mark since March 26. Traders said the Bank of France had entered the market to defend the franc by selling marks.
The French currency has been particularly hurt by wrangling over the French budget, which is formally scheduled for mid-September. It calls for numerous cuts so France can meet budgetary deadlines for 1999, when most of Europe is to have one currency.
France is critical to the single-currency plan, and any doubts about French ability to participate in it have benefited the mark.
"The budget is going to be lacking in credibility," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an investment advisory firm in Essex, Conn.
The mark initially weakened after the head of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said he saw Germany and France meeting the criteria for a single currency on time.
Mr. Tietmeyer helped "calm the market and relieved pressure on weaker currencies such as the Italian lira and French franc," Mr. O'Malley of Technical Data said.
But the impact of Mr. Tietmeyer's comments were diluted by comments from Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist. He told Die Welt, a leading German newspaper, that further interest rate cuts would not solve Germany's economic problems. Lower rates would have made mark-denominated investments less attractive.

HEADLINE: After Mars Rock, a Revived Hunt for Otherworldly Organisms;
Mars and Its Meteorites Targets of New Research

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
A PIECE of rock no bigger than a potato has awakened a somnolent American space program and inspired planetary scientists, spacecraft designers and the NASA leadership with what may become a new sense of mission. Tantalizing clues in the meteorite have emboldened them to think that if they are clever and persistent, they may yet find on Mars the first evidence of extraterrestrial life.
Although NASA officials refrained from money talk when they announced the discovery of these sensational clues last week, they did nothing to discourage sweeping discussions about expanding and accelerating current plans for Mars exploration. Scientists think the only way to get definitive proof of some microbial forms of Martian life -- in the distant past or, just possibly, at present -- would be to drill for subsurface rock samples and bring them back to Earth. 
 Already on the books are 10 low-cost, unmanned flights that are designed to orbit and land on the planet over the next 10 years, with the first two launchings scheduled for November and December. The Russians are ready to launch in November a long-delayed mission to place two scientific stations on Mars, each with instruments to probe at least six feet beneath the cold, arid surface.
If successful, these would be the first visits to the Martian surface since two American spacecraft, Viking 1 and 2, landed there in 1976 and failed to find any unambiguous signs of life. It is too late to modify this year's missions in light of the meteorite findings. But scientists expect the American and Russian explorations to set the stage for an eventual robotic mission that would bring back samples to Earth.
"Certainly by 2001," said Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, "we may want to consider some very bold missions where we bore down real deep, and we bring back samples. This is the process we're going to talk about. And this is where the excitement comes in."
Dr. Donna Shirley, manager of the Mars exploration program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in an interview that engineers and mission planners were waiting for instructions on how to proceed with future flights.
"Everybody is real excited," she said. "One of our primary goals in the next decade has always been to search for evidence of past or present life on Mars."
The future pace and priority of Mars exploration will be foremost on the agenda at a meeting on space policy to be convened by the White House in November. NASA officials will be armed with a report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, completed this summer, saying that the current program for Mars exploration is severely underfinanced and especially hampered by insufficient support for the development of new technology for miniaturized scientific instruments. Any attempt to increase the budget for NASA significantly is, of course, likely to run into opposition.
Scientists, meanwhile, are stepping up their laboratory analysis of the meteorite, designated Allan Hills 84001, which almost certainly came from Mars and fell on Antarctica 13,000 years ago. The research team that reported "evidence of primitive life on early Mars" conceded that its findings were not definitive, though several members expressed confidence that in time they would be proved right. They must first meet the objections of many skeptics.
One of the leading skeptics, Dr. J. William Schopf, a paleobiologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the "burden of proof" was on those who claim that the organic compounds and fossil-like objects are biological in origin. Similar evidence that has been found in other meteorites and in Earth rocks has turned out to be produced by nonbiological processes.
Referring to the supposed microfossil objects in the meteorite, Dr. Schopf said, "We've got to look inside these things, see if they have cell walls, see if they are compartmentalized, see if they are cellular, see if they are composed of organic material."
The investigation will not be easy, but microfossils -- if that is what they are -- are tubular specks many times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Looking inside the specks for traces of cell walls may be beyond the ability of the best electron microscopes.
Dr. David S. McKay, the geochemist at the Johnson Space Center in Houston who led the team reporting the discovery, described plans to use an ultrasensitive transmission electron microscope to examine thin slices of the meteorite, seeking to magnify these fossil-like objects. He said, "We will be able to see inside and we will be able to see if there's a membrane -- perhaps."
Likewise, planetary scientists from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville intend to conduct new tests, beginning this week, to see if they can detect the same evidence suggesting fossil life. They are dubious, though, because in previous studies, reported last month in the journal Nature, two scientists, Dr. Ralph Harvey of Case Western and Dr. Harry Y. McSween Jr. of Tennessee, found a striking absence of water-bearing minerals in the meteorite, which would seem to contradict the findings and interpretation by Dr. McKay's group.
They detected very little calcium carbonate, material that is sometimes found in meteorites and that is sometimes associated with life processes. Dr. McKay's team found this in abundance. But Dr. Harvey and Dr. McSween reported instead an abundance of magnesium and iron carbonates, which are not usually associated with organic production. They proposed that these carbonates formed not as a result of microbial life but as a result of a pulse of carbon dioxide at 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, heated by an asteroid impact, that flushed through the ancient Martian crust.
Responding to this argument, Dr. Everett K. Gibson Jr. of the Johnson Space Center, another member of the discovery team, said the presence of certain oxygen isotopes, organic molecules and particular minerals indicated that the carbonates had formed at temperatures no higher than 180 degrees. If the identified organic molecules had been exposed to heat greater than 750 degrees, he said, they would have been degraded and would have fragmented.
"We see nice, clean spectra, which suggests there had been lower temperatures," Dr. Gibson contended.
Dr. Harvey, who led the Antarctic party of geologists that collected the rock in 1984, said the other 11 meteorites considered Martian were not likely to yield definitive answers because they were all much younger specimens. But he said he was comfortable with the analysis establishing that these meteorites are indeed pieces of Mars.
As for what it would take to confirm the report of Martian life, Dr. Harvey said in an interview: "If the McKay group were to analyze the microfossils and come up with something indisputably produced by organisms -- chlorophyll or DNA or proteins -- I'd shake their hands and say that's life. That's going to be difficult, and I don't know if we have the technology."
Dr. James W. Head, a planetary geologist at Brown University, said the new findings could do for Mars studies what the concept of plate tectonics had done for earth geophysics. "It will make us ask questions we never thought of before," he said.
In particular, Dr. Head said, the possibility of life on early Mars pointed up the critical need to map the chronology of Mars's climate changes, showing when the planet was warmer and wetter, when liquid water could have flowed on its surface and when conditions drastically changed, leaving Mars the cold, dry and forbidding place seen today.
Although the two Viking landers in 1976 did not detect life, orbital photographs by the Vikings and Mariner 9 showed evidence that water had once flowed on the Martian surface, leaving deep channels, river deltas and lake beds. Ever since then, scientists have been looking for ways to reconstruct early climatic conditions there and search for fossils of life that might have evolved in that watery past.
From what they know now, scientists think that the Martian crust solidified 4.5 billion years ago, soon after the planet formed. Heavy asteroid bombardment followed, as it did on all the planets. These impacts fractured the Martian surface, causing carbonate globules to form in the crevices. In these deposits, bacterial life might have thrived. The carbonate deposits found in the meteorite, which contained the indications of life, are thought to be 3.6 billion years old.
"At some point in Mars's history, things went bad," Dr. McKay said. "But it's some time after the time that we're talking about here when we think we see signs of life."
If liquid water was once abundant on Mars and may still be below the surface, scientists hope that the next round of flights to the planet will be able to chart its most likely repositories, as well as map the planet's geology, thus pointing the way to places where life may have existed -- or may still exist.
The first mission, called Mars Global Surveyor, is to be launched in November and go into orbit around the planet the following September. Its primary mission over two years -- a full Martian year -- will be to map surface geology and study the thin Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere.
A second spacecraft, Mars Pathfinder, is to be launched a few weeks later, but it will pass the Global Surveyor and land on Mars on July 4 next year. Dr. Shirley, the project manager, said the lander's destination could not be better for scientists looking for water on Mars or possible life. It is to set down at the mouth of an ancient water channel called Ares Vallis, just north of the Mars equator, where rocks have presumably come tumbling down from the highlands.
Pathfinder will also carry a 22-pound roving vehicle called Sojourner, which is to make short excursions beyond the lander to examine the chemistry of rocks with an alpha-proton-X-ray spectrometer, a version of the instrument that was sent to the Moon by unmanned spacecraft in preparation for the Apollo landings. The Pathfinder mission is considered an experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of such low-cost landers and mini-rovers.
Dr. Roger D. Bourke, a specialist in international space activities for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the Russian mission for 1996 "seems to be solidly on track for a launch in mid-November." The flight, originally planned for 1992, has been delayed by that country's economic and political problems. The mission will include an orbiter equipped with European remote-sensing instruments as well as the two landers with penetrators for probing the temperature, mineral composition and other properties of subterranean Mars.
In 1998, the United States is planning to fly two more spacecraft to Mars, one an orbiter and the other a lander. One objective will be to look for water in the layers of dust and ice near the south pole. In the same year, Japan expects to launch a Mars orbiter to study the upper atmosphere.
"It's wide open what we do in 2001," Dr. Shirley said. One possibility is to fly a gamma-ray spectrometer in orbit to survey the global chemical composition of the planet and use an infrared spectrometer to search for likely current water sources. Another part of this mission might include delivering a large Russian roving vehicle to the ancient highlands. Discussions with the Russians are under way.
Where the Mars program goes after 2001, Dr. Shirley said, will depend on decisions to be made in coming months and whether "people are going to want to add more money." Favorable launching opportunities come only every 26 months. Engineers are preparing ideas for a possible robotic sample-return flight as early as 2003, two years before it had been tentatively scheduled. Such a mission would be complicated and much more expensive than the Pathfinder and the Global Surveyors, which are costing only $250 million each.
At some point, said Mr. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, planners will have to decide whether robots will be able to perform the tasks and return the samples, "or do we have to send human beings, paleontologists and geologists, to do sampling." He added, "This is a discussion that we are going to have to have."
So unless serious flaws in the meteorite findings are exposed, planetary scientists and NASA officials could find themselves with the kind of clear sense of mission that has been lacking since the first Apollo Moon landings in 1969. Then the challenge came from the Soviet Union in a world divided by cold war politics. The challenge now is scientific and is pregnant with philosophical implications. After all, an answer just may be at hand to that haunting and enchanting question: Is Earth alone as an abode of life?

HEADLINE: Richard M. Goodwin, Economist, 83

 BODY:
Richard M. Goodwin, an economist who developed a technique to model economic activity, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Siena, Italy, where he had been vacationing. He was 83 and lived in Ashdon, England.
The cause was a heart ailment, his family said. 
 Dr. Goodwin, was born and reared in Indiana, was a mathematician who developed a three-dimensional model that traced the interaction of business cycles and economic growth in more complex ways than in the past. His writings were concerned mostly with the new model.
"He taught us all about economic dynamics," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate who studied with Dr. Goodwin at Harvard. "And he made high-brow research seem like fun."
Dr. Goodwin, who insisted on devoting as much time to painting and music as to economics, received his bachelor of arts and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard and taught there from 1942 until 1950. He moved on to Cambridge University after Harvard denied him tenure. He taught at Cambridge until 1979 and then at the University of Siena, until 1984.
Surviving is his wife, the former Jacqueline Wynmalen.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Case Roils Stocks, But Dow Rises

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks struggled past some bad news for the tobacco industry to post modest gains yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.67 points at 5,704.98. The Dow began the day weighed down by a sharp decline in Philip Morris that began late on Friday. Philip Morris, a Dow component, fell 14 5/8, to 90 7/8 on Friday, with much of that decline coming in after-hours trading. 
 But the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in Philip Morris stock at 102 on Friday. The stock opened yesterday morning at 93 7/8, and as a result the Dow reflected nearly all of Friday's full slide in Philip Morris. The difference between Friday's Big Board close of 102 and 93 7/8 translated into a loss of 24 points in the Dow even as Philip Morris shares staged a small recovery in composite trading, rising 2 3/4, to 93 5/8.
Shares of consumer goods and natural gas companies advanced yesterday. Excluding Philip Morris, the Dow measure would have gained nearly 50 points. Broad-market indexes were mostly higher after spending most of the session with narrow losses. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.67 points, to 665.77. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1 point, to 1,138.27.
But trading was mostly sluggish, with many investors holding to the sidelines while waiting for this week's economic data, worried that after Friday's yawn at another encouraging inflation number, there may be more downside risk than upside potential.
"This market is directionless and lacks conviction," said Brian Belski, a technical analyst with Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis, noting how Friday's damage award against Brown & Williamson Tobacco overshadowed a tame inflation report that sent interest rates lower in the bond market. "People are looking for a reason to sell and lock in that return." Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 6-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a sleepy 312.2 million shares, down from Friday's pace.
The session's early tone was set by late Friday's news of a $750,000 damage award to an addicted smoker by a Florida jury. The verdict could be overturned on appeal, but the potential crack in the cigarette industry's seemingly impenetrable armor against such suits prompted anxieties about other pending cases.
Among tobacco stocks, RJR Nabisco steadied after a 4 1/4-point plunge late Friday, slipping 1/8, to 27 7/8. But Brown & Williamson's parent, B.A.T Industries, and a rival cigarette maker, Loews, both slid again. Loews fell 5, to 77 1/2, and American depository receipts of B.A.T of Britain dropped 5/8, to 15. Each B.A.T. A.D.R. represents two shares.
Notably, the Dow's strongest issues were consumer stocks, indicating that some investors may have moved money from Philip Morris into other steady-demand situations, Mr. Belski of Dain Bosworth said. Merck rose 1 7/8, to 69 3/8; Disney rose 1 3/8, to 58 1/2; General Electric rose 1 1/4 to 85; Procter & Gamble rose 1, to 88 3/4, and Coca-Cola rose 1, to 49 3/4.
Utility stocks were bolsted by announcements of two big utility mergers: a $2.24 billion acquisition of Noram Energy by Houston Industries, and a $968 million combination between Delmarva Power and Light and Atlantic Energy. After the news, the Dow Jones utility average jumped 1.25 percent. Noram shares rose 2 7/8, to 14 1/2, and Atlantic Energy rose 7/8, to 18; both are traded on the Big Board. First Brands fell 2 5/8, to 22 3/8. Buckingham Research cut its rating of the stock to "hold" from "buy" on expected competition from Rubbermaid's entry into the consumer trash bag business. Rubbermaid rose 1/8, to 28 3/8.

HEADLINE: Clinton Unveils Plan to Halt Gold Mine Near Yellowstone

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo., Aug. 12

 BODY:
Declaring that "Yellowstone is more precious than gold," President Clinton came to a pristine corner of the country's oldest national park today to announce a halt to development of a nearby gold mine that environmentalists had warned would damage the park's waterways and wildlife.
With pine-covered Baronette Peak rising behind him, Mr. Clinton announced an agreement in principle with the Canadian owners of the New World Mine in which the Government will swap $65 million worth of Federal land in exchange for the company's dropping its claim to some $650 million worth of gold deposits upstream from the park's northeastern corner in Montana. The land to be swapped has not been specified. 
 "Yellowstone was entrusted into our care as a people, a whole people, more than 120 years ago now," Mr. Clinton told an audience that included the country singer John Denver and Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, whose family gave the Federal Government much of the land that forms Grand Teton National Park just south of here. "And today we are saying to the rest of the world, to the rest of the country and to future generations of America, we have been worthy of that trust and we are giving it on to our children and our children's children."
The proposed mine has been controversial for years, and Mr. Clinton first expressed his concern about it on his vacation here last year, when he flew over the site by helicopter. In the months since, his Administration undertook intensive negotiations with the mine owners and environmental groups that have sued to block its development, producing the swap agreement announced today.
On the opening day of the Republican National Convention, Mr. Clinton used the announcement to trumpet one of his best-selling political themes: that the environment and public health and safety can be protected without unduly burdening business -- and that Democrats are the best ones to do the protecting.
As part of the agreement, Crown Butte Mines, a subsidiary of the Canadian mining conglomerate Noranda Inc., agreed to put $22.5 million in an escrow account to cover the costs of cleaning up the waste from mining activity that occurred before it took over the site. Mr. Clinton called that "a very important part of this agreement" and said the company "deserves a lot of credit for it."
Environmental groups, led by the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an umbrella organization based in Bozeman, Mont., that has coordinated the fight against the mine, generally praised today's announcement. But they warned that many details remain to be worked out, including finding alternate land acceptable to Crown Butte and to environmentalists. If the company is not satisfied with the proposal, it can walk away from the agreement.
"This is just the beginning," said Robert Eakey, a spokesman for the coalition. "There's still a lot of negotiating to be done." He said the group would closely monitor the proposed alternate land, saying, "We are not going to transfer an environmental liability to another part of the country."
But Ian D. Bayer, chairman of Crown Butte, said after the announcement that he believed the hardest part was over. He declined to discuss where the alternate land might be, or whether the Government might swap mineral reserves instead. "In the end, the company wants assets that they can realize and liquidate to cover its losses," Mr. Bayer said.
Sounding a theme hammered home over and over again in recent months by his chief political strategist, Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton said the compromise on the mine epitomized both what Government could do, and what only citizens could do working together, to find common ground amid differences.
"We don't have to make a choice between the environment and the economy," Mr. Clinton said. "We don't have to have every single challenge we face drag on forever and ever and ever, into court suit after court suit after court suit, being fodder for politicians that campaign from rhetoric that divides us instead of unites us. All of you have proved that America can be better than that."
Mr. Clinton flew to the park by helicopter this morning from his vacation retreat in Jackson Hole, where he returned immediately after the announcement. Since he arrived on Friday with his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, he had gone out only to church and for pizza and the late show of "A Time to Kill" at a movie house on Sunday night.
The President also looks unusually trim. Aides said he had told them he was down to 207 pounds -- 10 pounds below past confessed levels -- and aiming for 200. One secret of his success may be an unusually low-fat diet: On Sunday, he had a whole wheat vegetarian pizza with no cheese and extra artichoke hearts, a far cry from his fattier favorites.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Steady In Advance Of New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were largely unchanged yesterday, as market participants awaited today's reports on consumer prices and retail sales before committing themselves to long positions.
The 30-year bond, the market's benchmark, finished the session at 10026/32 , unchanged from Friday; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, held to 6.69 percent, also unchanged. 
 Early in the session, some traders sold on "bearish" comments by Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In an interview with Market News Service, Mr. Parry was quoted as saying that some people have been overinterpreting signs of economic weakness.
In addition, some investors sold on the assumption that bond prices were as high as they are going to get, given the current market fundamentals.
Even the Fed's role yesterday as a buyer of various maturities from August 1998 to July 2001 failed to raise prices much, as traders remained at the sidelines, waiting for today's economic data.
As on Friday, the Fed yesterday executed so-called coupon passes, which from time to time are used to add permanent reserves to the banking system, offsetting seasonal liquidity shortages.
 "There was a growing feeling that the Fed would buy again," which helped give prices a slight lift early in the session, said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. But, by the time the Fed's buying took place, the effect on prices was negligible, he said.
 Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director of ASB Capital Management, a Washington firm with about $6 billion in bonds under management, said that the market's negative tone was a reaction to the Agriculture Department's estimate for corn crops. The department is predicting the fourth-largest corn crop in Amerian history, but the forecast still failed to meet the expectations of private grain analysts.
The department's forecast helped to cause the Commodity Research Bureau index to rise sharply and bondholders -- who often use the index as a barometer of inflationary pressures -- to sell, Mr. Carpenter said.
"We could rally to a yield of 6.60 percent this week, and perhaps 6 percent by year-end," Mr. Carpenter said. For this outcome, though, he said that the move in the Consumer Price Index for July would have to be two-tenths of 1 percent or less; that industrial production and retail sales for July would have to decline between one-tenth and four-tenths of 1 percent, and that the Philadelphia Fed index, which was at 38.6 in July, would have to fall to about 20.
Analysts said that the results of the Government's regular weekly bill auction held no surprises. Rates reflected the recent rally in the market and were four to five basis points lower than a week ago. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The average rate of 5.04 percent for a three-month maturity was the lowest since May 28, when the rate was 5.03 percent, while the rate of 5.08 percent for a six-month bill was the lowest since April 22, when six-month rates were 5.02 percent.
The following are the details of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.726	97.432	Discounted Rate	5.04%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.18%	5.29%	High Price	98.734	97.442	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.26%	Low Price	98.726	97.432	Discounted Rate	5.04%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.18%	5.29%	Accepted at low price	31%	58%	Total applied for	$52,260,593	$39,332,500	Accepted	$12,600,281	$12,529,620	Noncompetitive	$1,434,978	$1,297,352	
 
Both issues are dated Aug. 15, 1996. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 11, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 13, 1997.

HEADLINE: Turkey-Iran Gas Deal: A Test of U.S. Law on Terror?

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Turkey's new Prime Minister signed a $23-billion, 23-year agreement today to purchase natural gas from Iran, raising the awkward possibility of the United States' invoking sanctions against a NATO ally.
"We're disappointed that Turkey is pushing toward a broader and more active relationship with Iran," a White House official said today. "Iran's use of terror to try to erode support for the Mideast peace process is well known and documented. And we find it perplexing that Turkey, which has itself been a victim of terror, has taken these steps." 
 The deal could provoke a variety of American sanctions against the state-owned Turkish oil and gas company under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which gives the President the power to penalize foreign companies that invest $40 million or more a year in the oil and natural-gas sectors of either country. President Clinton signed the measure last week, over the objections of European allies.
Contracts already in effect were exempted, but possible sanctions for the new deal could include denial of loans from the Export-Import Bank, denial of licenses for exports to the United States, a prohibition on loans or credits from American financial institutions and a ban on imports from the United States.
American officials were reluctant to say today whether the agreement, the text of which they have not seen, violates the new American law, for which operating regulations have not yet been written. They noted that pipelines needed to be built and that gas would not flow until at least 1999, and they suggested that given Iran's economic problems, those grand plans may prove overly optimistic.
Retaliation would create sharp new strains between Washington and a vital NATO ally that bridges Europe and Central Asia, the Balkans and the Middle East. Washington is already alarmed over the installation last month of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, head of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party, who has called for closer Turkish ties to Iran, Iraq and Syria, and a reorientation of Turkey away from the West.
"Turkey remains a very important NATO ally in an extremely tough neighborhood, and it's on that basis that we've continued to consult with the Turkish Government on this issue," the White House official said. "Whether or not it is a violation of U.S. law, it is certainly bad policy."
With Mr. Clinton on vacation in Wyoming and Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveling, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff telephoned his Turkish counterpart today to express American concerns about the gas deal, officials said.
Turkish officials argued that the agreement did not break American law, because it is a trade agreement to purchase gas, not an investment in Iran, and each country will be responsible for its own infrastructure.
"The sanctions ban investments in Iran," a Turkish Cabinet minister, Abdullah Gul, said today in Teheran, where Mr. Erbakan signed the contract with the Iranian First Vice President, Hassan Habibi. "We're not going to invest in Iran. This is only a trade agreement. The two countries will build their own sides of the gas pipeline."
But the Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, hailed the agreement as a major triumph over American efforts to choke Iran's economy. And Mustafa Murathan, the director of the Turkish company, said Turkey might help cash-poor Iran build its part of the pipeline, from Tabriz to the border town of Teba, under a barter agreement.
Mr. Erbakan chose to go to Iran on his first official trip abroad as Prime Minister. He was met on Saturday with full state honors and told Turkish television in an interview, before leaving for Pakistan, "Turkey will not permit any third country to interfere in the growing trend of cooperation between Turkey and Iran."
Iraq and Libya are subject to United Nations sanctions, but the American effort to isolate Iran and Cuba has been sharply criticized by the European Union and other countries, like China, as an effort to apply "secondary boycotts" and bring foreign companies under American law. When Arab states tried to apply such secondary boycotts against American and other companies that did business with Israel, the United States objected, but now is applying the same principle to others, European diplomats argue.
Some nations, like Canada, have instructed their companies to ignore a separate law, the Helms-Burton Act, that punishes companies investing in formerly American-owned properties in Cuba.
In a public response, Glyn Davies, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said, "Our general reaction is that we believe that this deal's conclusion sends the wrong message to Iran." But the details of the contract will have to be studied before the United States can decide if sanctions should be applied, he said.
Top Turkish officials have told Washington that "this isn't an investment but a purchase of gas," Mr. Davies said, "and we'll see."
But he emphasized the strong relationship between the United States and Turkey and said, "We certainly don't expect that this will cause a major rift in our relationship."
Turkey plays a vital role in various American policies to broaden the "circle of peace" in the Middle East, to train and equip the Muslim-led Bosnian Army, to help the newly independent Muslim states of the Caucasus and Central Asia and to serve as a restraining buffer to Iran, Iraq and Syria.
Mr. Erbakan, while constrained by his coalition partner, the conservative former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, could undermine those policies if he tries to reorient Turkey in a serious fashion, as opposed to making merely symbolic gestures to his Islamist constituency, American officials say. It could also lead to a coup by the Turkish military, an embarrassing step away from democracy in a NATO that is looking to expand.
New strains between Turkey and Greece, first over tiny islands in the Aegean and now over last weekend's rioting on Cyprus between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, could be worsened by the nationalist Mr. Erbakan and lead to a new cycle of reaction and overreaction in Athens, the officials say.
So they are being careful to stress the longstanding ties between Turkey and the United States, while also indicating sharp displeasure at Turkey's new turn.
Under the agreement signed today, Iran will start supplying Turkey with 105 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year beginning in 1999, rising to 350 billion cubic feet in 2005.

Turkish Aides Visit Iraq
 BAGHDAD, Aug. 12 (AP) -- Turkish Cabinet officials visited Baghdad today, seeking to improve connections with Iraq, another adversary of the United States, so as to complete plans to reopen a pipeline to carry Iraqi oil through Turkey.
Justice Minister Sevket Kazan and Education Minister Mehmet Saglam drove across the desert from Jordan for talks, scheduled to begin Tuesday, about "everything concerning our relations with Iraq," Mr. Kazan said.
The pipeline is part of an agreement struck with the United Nations Security Council to allow Iraq to sell some oil, despite sanctions against the country.
Turkey has been seeking United States and United Nations agreement to buy 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day above the $2 billion Baghdad can sell every six months under a United Nations agreement that allows it to sell the oil to buy food and medicine for its people.

HEADLINE: Advertising;
Young & Rubicam executives aren't ruling out the possibility of an initial public offering

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE top executives of Young & Rubicam Inc., after selling a minority interest to outside investors for the first time in the 73-year history of the privately held agency company, are not ruling out further ownership changes that might include an initial public offering.
"It's certainly my perspective that we have to reserve the right to do whatever it takes to be the most valued partner for our clients," Peter A. Georgescu, chairman and chief executive of Y.& R., the world's sixth-largest agency company, said yesterday in an interview from his office in New York. 
 "We're going to continue to look at what is the best option for us at any given point in time."
As for some day offering Y.& R. stock to the public, Mr. Georgescu said, "It's not necessarily what the plan is at this point in time." However, he added, "I wouldn't want to rule it out, nor would I speculate" as to the likelihood of such a sale.
Y.& R., which offers services like advertising, public relations, corporate identity consulting, direct marketing and sales promotion, has billings of almost $10 billion from blue-chip clients including the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the Ford Motor Company and Sears, Roebuck & Company. Mr. Georgescu and other managers announced yesterday that as expected they had agreed in principle on a recapitalization of the agency company.
 
A principal feature of that large financial restructuring involves selling what is being described as a significant minority stake in Y.& R. to Hellman & Friedman, a private equity-investment firm in San Francisco. Terms of the transaction, which will involve Hellman & Friedman's gaining seats on the Y.& R. board, are not being disclosed.
"That's still one of the advantages of privacy," Mr. Georgescu said.
That response underscores how Y.& R. has fought to maintain its independence, until now zealously restricting ownership in its closely held shares to present and former executives. Leaders of Y.& R. sat out waves of stock market mania that hit Madison Avenue in the 1960's, the 1980's and again after the agency industry began recovering from a severe recession earlier this decade.
Indeed, top managers of Y.& R. had in the past touted its privately held status as a selling point, asserting that they could focus more on long-term performance issues than if Wall Street was exerting pressure for quarter-to-quarter earnings gains.
But advertising is undergoing a transformation that has required Y.& R. to rethink how it does business, Mr. Georgescu said; he succeeded Alex Kroll as chairman of Y.& R. at the end of 1994 and as chief executive a year before that.
For instance, "we're going to have to play in the new-media world," Mr. Georgescu said, "and make very client-driven strategic investments and acquisitions" in realms like data base marketing.
But the recapitalization raises the question of how long Y.& R. will continue to be privately held, particularly as its larger publicly traded competitors -- most notably the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Omnicom Group -- are growing faster, enjoying fatter profit margins and making more high-profile acquisitions.
"Once the genie is out of the bottle, he tends to stay out," said Alan J. Gottesman, who as managing director of West End Communications/ Consulting in New York follows the agency and communications industries.
Using the Richter scale that measures earthquakes, Mr. Gottesman assessed the impact of the recapitalization at "magnitude 6, which means the windows start to break," because "it means an outsider's in at Y.& R. for the first time."
That outsider, Hellman & Friedman, recently began actively to pursue buyouts in the media and related areas. The investment in Y.& R. is its initial foray into the agency industry. In April, Hellman & Friedman paid $237 million to acquire Advanstar Holdings, which owns business trade publications. And last year the firm helped Karl Eller, the out-of-home media entrepreneur, acquire Patrick Media, now Eller Media, for $518 million from the GE Capital unit of the General Electric Company.
"This may be the first in a series of investments by Hellman & Friedman" in agencies, said Lauren Rich Fine, an equity analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York who follows advertising, new media and publishing. She described the transaction, which she said "has the feel of a nice deal to me," as one that gives Y.& R. management "breathing room to improve margins and get them more to what people would look at" when considering investing in agencies.
Even so, she added: "I would not necessarily view this as a precursor to Y.& R. going public. People inside want liquidity. How do you get that? With an investment from a financial player."
Mr. Gottesman said he doubted that Hellman & Friedman was "going into the ad business." He described the firm as "a financial investor, buying an asset with the idea of selling it at a profit someday," rather than a strategic investor, as another agency company would be.
 
Mr. Georgescu listed three reasons for the recapitalization, which he said was expected to be completed by fall at the earliest and the first quarter of 1997 at the latest.
One was "to better align the ownership of the agency with the real drivers of this corporation," he said, and "to give the next generation of management a better stake in the future of the company." That will involve reducing stock ownership to several hundred people from about 1,000, he added.
A second reason is to finance "investments in acquiring superior knowledge" to help clients, Mr. Georgescu said, citing additional work on the Brand Asset Valuator, a system introduced by Y.& R. to provide detailed data about how brands are built and perceived. That work "will cost north of $10 million," he added.
And the third reason for the recapitalization, according to Mr. Georgescu, is "building a little war chest for acquisitions." Y.& R. has recently bought Waring & LaRosa, a New York agency, and the Media Edge, a media services agency owned by Adcom Investors Inc.
"And more are probably coming in the future," Mr. Georgescu said.
Mr. Georgescu declined to discuss details of the recapitalization, which include buying back a portion of Y.& R. shares and a reinvestment by senior managers of a substantial amount of their stock in the recapitalized company. He stressed that Y.& R. was "still a private company, the majority of the ownership is still in the hands of our employees and the management of the company is 100 percent in the hands" of those now running Y.& R.
Executives at Hellman & Friedman, which is run by Warren Hellman and Tully M. Friedman, were similarly circumspect. Mr. Hellman described the investment in Y.& R. as "our largest equity commitment to date," but would say no more. Requests for comment on the deal were referred to Mr. Georgescu.
Speculation about a recapitalization of Y.& R. began in the spring, when the agency company restructured $100 million in long-term debt in the institutional market. Bear, Stearns & Company, which Mr. Georgescu described as a "very, very valued counselor in this process," helped bring Y.& R. together with Hellman & Friedman.

HEADLINE: Mining Companies Increasingly Look Abroad

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 12

 BODY:
As President Clinton announced the cancellation of a $650 million gold mine in Montana, gold mining executives here recalled a presidential message more to their liking.
Six weeks ago, Islam A. Karimov, President of Uzbekistan, made a pilgrimage to Denver, the city with the largest concentration of American gold mining company headquarters. Noting that Uzbekistan had underground gold reserves estimated at $64 billion, the Central Asian leader invited participants at a mining conference to "come on over and see for yourselves." 
 Adding glitter to the President's invitation, a 29-pound bar of Uzbek gold was brandished before the conferees by Ronald Cambre, chairman of Newmont Mining Corporation, the largest gold producing company in the United States. Based in Denver, Newmont has invested $250 million in an Uzbek mine, which is expected to produce 340,000 ounces this year.
Today, while celebrating environmentalists danced to a bluegrass band in Cooke City, Mont., gold-mining executives said that the cancellation of the New World Mine reinforced a trend for investing in gold mines overseas.
The Clinton announcement "underscores the difficulty of permitting a mine of almost any kind in the United States today," said Michael Rounds, spokesman for the Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, the largest American-owned mining company. Based in Denver, this mining giant is investing about $800 million in gold production -- about half in Alaska, and the rest in Chile and in the Russian Far East.
When companies seek production permits in the Lower 48 States, "every nit that can be possibly found is used to delay or block a project," Mr. Rounds said.
Exploration licenses, which might take one month to obtain in Latin America, now take five years in the United States, according to research by Eul-Soo Pang, professor of international economics at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden. As a result, he says, Latin America is attracting more than half of the exploration dollars of United States mining companies.
Christopher Herald, president of Crown Resources Corporation, a Denver-based gold exploration company, said today that he spent 80 percent of his company's budget in Argentina and Peru.
"Until about three years ago, 100 percent of our exploration dollars were spent in the United States -- and then we got caught in unbelievable permitting delays," said Mr. Herald, adding that his company had waited five and a half years for Government permission to start production at a gold mine in Washington State.
"We are almost scared to find another gold deposit in the United States," he said.
The overseas trend for investments can be clearly seen at Newmont, which produces 70 percent of its gold from a Nevada mine. But that mine, at Carlin, opened in 1965. In 1993, Newmont started producing in Peru, in 1995 in Uzbekistan, and, this year, in Indonesia. The company is studying a new site in Indonesia and negotiating a second joint gold mining joint venture in Uzbekistan.
"We employ the same environmental standards worldwide, but we find the permitting process tends to take longer in the U.S.," Doug Hock, a spokesman for the company, said today. "There are a lot of other areas that are opening up for political reasons, such as Peru and the former Soviet Union."
If the current American regulatory climate remains unchanged, annual investment in gold mining in the United States will drop by one quarter over the next decade, according to a recent study by Michael Evans, an econometrician at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. American gold mining employment will contract by 9,500 jobs, according to the study, which is distributed by the the Gold Institute, a Washington-based producers group.
"We would have loved to have proved to the world that you can develop an environmentally responsible mine," Joseph J. Baylis, president of Crown Butte Resources, said today in a telephone interview from Toronto of his company's abandoned plans to develop the New World Mine site. "We could have met the requirements of U.S. law, and it would not have harmed Yellowstone. On the other hand, how long can you wait to prove it?"
American environmentalists bristle at miners' criticisms that they are throwing up "barbed wire" to block new mining projects.
"The U.S. is not a country that is driving out the mining industry," Philip M. Hocker, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a Washington-based group dedicated to increasing royalties paid by mining companies, said today.
"The U.S. is the largest producer of nonfuel minerals in the world," he said in a telephone interview from Montana. "We produce 13 percent of nonfuel minerals on 7 percent of the world's land area."
In the realm of public opinion, trends appear to favor Mr. Hocker.
In the last century, miners led the European colonization of the American West. Through the 1940's, Ananconda Mining Company was the single largest employer in Montana and owned most of the state's newspapers and utilities. In the State Legislature, the company wielded almost unbeatable power.
This year, the fight over the New World Mine has provided a gauge for changing attitudes.
Montana's Governor, Marc Racicot, a Republican, has kept a low profile on the controversy, saying that the environmental review process should run its course. Behind the Governor's ambivalence were polls showing that Montanans opposed the mine by almost 2 to 1.
"We have gone from where mining was the state's largest nonagricultural activity to where it is truly a tiny sliver of the economy," said Thomas M. Power, chairman of the economics department of the University of Montana. "It employs so few people and has such a toxic legacy that the mining industry has a hard time making its case."
Around the 12 Western states, metal mining on public lands now only accounts for one of every 2,500 jobs. In the West, about 40,000 people work in hard rock mining -- about half of the total jobs attributable to Colorado's ski industry.
In Wyoming, opponents to the New World Mine ranged from the commissioners of Park County, the county adjacent to the mine, to Craig Thomas, one of the state's Republican Senators, to Jim Geringer, the state's Republican Governor.
Crossing the partisan aisle, a Democratic Senator, Dale Bumpers, was author of a bill this spring to prohibit mining on land near Yellowstone National Park, including at the New World site.
Even in Denver, the nation's gold mining nerve center, The Denver Post printed an editorial last week supporting plans by the Clinton Administration to block the mine.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE SPONSORS;
A New Arena for Ads and Political Influence

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
United is the official airline, General Motors provides the official car and AT&T is the official long-distance provider, but this is not the Olympics.
Major American corporations have found a new arena to commercialize: the Republican and Democratic Party conventions. Changes to Federal election law in 1994 that diluted earlier restrictions have enabled corporations to pour money, goods and services into the conventions at the greatest clip since the post-Watergate regulations 20 years ago sought to limit the influence of private interests at the political gatherings. 
 Experts in campaign finance estimate that when the final accounting is completed later this year, corporations and private interests will have funneled more than $25 million in cash and goods into the two conventions and footed the tab for at least one-third of all the expenses. In 1992, the two parties raised less than half that amount -- almost $11 million -- from private sources to help defray their convention expenses.
"It has a corrosive effect," said Herbert E. Alexander, a political science professor at the University of Southern California and director of the Citizens' Research Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies political financing. "It shows that any limits on campaign fund raising are meaningless."
Convention officials disagreed.
"Our sponsors' motivations for contributing to the host committee are nonpolitical in nature," said Gerald L. Parsky, chairman of the San Diego Host Committee, the main fund-raising vehicle for the Republican convention. "Their primary focus is a combination of a desire to contribute to the community and a desire to showcase their company in a commercial way."
For the Republicans, the biggest expense is the construction in the convention hall, but the donations will also be used for everything from giving parties and golf outings to the trinkets given to the delegates.
This year's heavy reliance on corporate sponsors is possible only because of the 20-year erosion of restrictions on private sponsorship of the conventions that followed a scandal in the Nixon Administration in 1972. A lobbyist for the ITT Corporation had contributed $400,000 to the Republican convention at a time when the Administration was pursuing antitrust violations against the company.
The restrictions replaced private money with public financing. The old rules permitted local and retail business to give discounts to the conventions, but the rules were slowly relaxed, and in 1994, the Federal Election Commission permitted companies to provide their wares to the parties for "promotional considerations."
The two parties now receive $12.4 million each from the Federal Government, and each will also receive millions more in contributions from the cities of Chicago and San Diego, given to win the right to play host to the conventions.
Of the corporate sponsors, it is hardly surprising that the industries with the largest presence are those that have the most important issues before Congress and the executive branch. This year the biggest donors come from the energy, defense, finance and telecommunications industries.
Company executives say that they give money to be good corporate citizens, but acknowledge that the donations also serve their economic and political interests. Not only do companies gain important access to the nation's political leaders in Congress and the White House, but they also are able to market their goods before huge conventions and the nation's leading news organizations. Moreover, some executives said they gave money and goods because their competitors were doing it.
Typical of the companies that are giving is Anheuser-Busch. A company vice president, Stephen K. Lambright, said the company was a sponsor of the Democratic and Republican conventions "to help encourage public participation in the political system." But Mr. Lambright added that the company also intended to press delegates for a Congressional effort to roll back the 1991 increase in the Federal beer tax.
Other big companies giving to both the Democrats and the Republicans include Archer Daniels Midland, BankAmerica, Browning-Ferris Industries, Tenneco, the Chrysler Corporation and Abbott Laboratories. Philip Morris, the tobacco giant, is a major sponsor of the Republicans; its subsidiary, Kraft Foods, is a big giver to the Democrats.
"San Diego and Chicago are cities in which BankAmerica has a significant presence," said John Keane, director of public relations for the bank, which gave $150,000 to the Republicans and $100,000 to the Democrats. "We look at the conventions as community events and an opportunity to showcase ourselves. We feel it's important to support them."
Another big donor, AT&T, plans to provide $1.4 million in phone equipment and services at each convention, on top of $100,000 in cash contributions to both parties.
One of the biggest and most controversial donations to the Republicans has been by the Amway Corporation, the direct-sales company, which put up $1.3 million to help the Republicans broadcast the convention on The Family Channel, the cable television channel founded by Pat Robertson. This morning Haley Barbour, the chairman of the Republican Party, indicated at a news briefing that the party, not Amway, would pay for the broadcast, although Mr. Barbour insisted it would have been "perfectly legal and proper" for the company to have done so.
"We didn't want them to be entangled in some frivolous litigation," Mr. Barbour said.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Acts To Enhance Web Package

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Raising the competitive stakes to a rich new level in its World Wide Web browser war with the Netscape Communications Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation announced deals today providing for two of the Internet's most popular financial news and sports services to be bundled free into a new version of Microsoft's browsing software.
Even though Netscape's Web browser, Netscape Navigator, is used by more than 85 percent of computer users for viewing information on the World Wide Web, Microsoft is aiming to make its Internet Explorer software the market leader. 
 Today's deals and Microsoft's $7 billion in cash on hand, which generates more in interest than Netscape has in annual revenues, demonstrate just how formidable a competitor the world's largest software company can be.
Moreover, Microsoft's announcement today showed its ambitions to take Web-browser software beyond a navigational tool by building in a package of popular destinations.
The new software, Internet Explorer Version 3.0, which Microsoft planned to begin distributing free on the Internet at midnight tonight, will give users automatic and free access to the daily Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, which normally costs as much as $49 a year, and to the popular ESPNet Sportszone, which usually charges for its services a la carte.
"In some sense this is a volume deal," said Brad Chase, the Microsoft vice president in charge of Internet browsers. "We feel very excited about this giving us a better browser."
The new services, along with several similar packages also announced late today, put added pressure on Netscape, which intends to introduce a new version of its Navigator browser next Monday.
"The operative word in the Microsoft Internet strategy is 'free,' " said George Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc., a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "Microsoft is slashing and burning their way into this market."
Web site publishers have from the beginning seen such deals as an added source of revenue, to complement advertising and circulation.
"The software producers are now to some degree acting like on-line services," said Tom Baker, the business director of The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition.
Under the Journal deal, Internet Explorer customers will get The Journal Interactive Edition free through the end of the year. The Journal site, which has more than 40,000 subscribers, only began this month to charge new subscribers.
Executives at Dow Jones & Company, which owns The Journal, would not disclose how much Microsoft was paying to offer the service.
Mr. Baker said the deal lasts five months but could be extended.
In addition to the deals with The Journal and ESPNet, part of the ESPN unit of the Walt Disney Company, Microsoft has made agreements with operators of five other Web sites that Explorer users will be able to use free: Hollywood Online, a source for movie information; Investors' Edge, which publishes recommendations from financial analysts; MTV Online; Riddler.com, an Internet game site, and Microwarehouse, a catalogue shopping site.
The deals are a new avenue of attack on Netscape, reminiscent, several analysts said, of the strategy Microsoft used more than a decade ago in its effort to dominate PC software operating systems. That strategy involved adding more and more features to its basic MS-DOS and, later, Windows software.
"This ushers in a new era of content competition," said David Smith, an analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. "If you look at how Microsoft built their franchise in operating systems, it was by adding applications and locking people in. Now content is the application of the Internet."
To date in the Web-browser war, Microsoft and Netscape have battled over technology features, with each racing to be first with better ways for viewing information. In recent months, however, word has begun to trickle through the Internet community that Microsoft has been trying to buy market share by purchasing the allegiance of Web site operators with software-development support and deals like those today.
Both Netscape and Microsoft basically give away the versions of their browsers used by individuals. Netscape draws much of its revenue from the so-called server versions of Navigator used on computers that play host to Web sites or give users access to the Web.
But so far, Microsoft has been giving away the server software, too, relying on its vast wealth to wage a war of attrition.
Netscape's response to today's developments was to make over its home page with point-by-point performance comparisons that Netscape said showed that Navigator remained faster than the Microsoft offering and required less disk space and processing power.
Netscape executives said that despite Microsoft's highly visible deals, the company still trailed Netscape in several ways.
"We have more than 30,000 sites that are best viewed with Navigator," said Mike Homer, Netscape's vice president for marketing. He also said that Navigator offered more than $200 in free services.
Moreover, Mr. Homer said that Netscape was preparing to put Microsoft in catch-up mode once again next Monday, when Netscape plans to release Version 3.0 of Navigator. The new product will include a feature called Internet Mailbox that will permit service providers to mail complete multimedia mail messages -- including text, sound, images and video -- to other computer users.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER;
A Young Lawmaker Is Set for Her Moment in the Spotlight

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

 BODY:
Just before giving away his only daughter, Susan Molinari, at her first wedding, in 1988, Guy Molinari stopped on his way down the aisle to shake hands with Bob Dole.
But if the bride was thinking, "Where is Miss Manners when you need her?" she did not let on. As a third-generation politician in a family that has always married the personal and the political, Ms. Molinari has lately followed suit: she and her second husband, Bill Paxon, a fellow Congressional Republican, began a whirlwind extended honeymoon-campaign tour on behalf of their party soon after their marriage in 1994. Their daughter, 3-month-old Susan Ruby Paxon, has already become a fixture in television interviews with Ms. Molinari. 
 And even her detractors expect her to score points tonight, if not for Bob Dole then for Susan Molinari, when the Congresswoman from Staten Island, who holds a master's degree in political communication and was home-schooled in speechmaking from the age of 5, takes the podium to deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention.
A small blonde, 38, with possibly the best haircut in Congress and a smile that seems to overpower her face through the sheer force of her will, she is the swing voter her party covets: a moderate, suburban ("Staten Island is not the city; I'm very suburban"), ethnic working woman and new mom.
Yet her voting record is considerably more conservative than the image she cultivates. And after six years in Congress, she is better known for her camera-ready charisma than for her legislative record. Some colleagues, perhaps a bit enviously, refer to her as all show biz.
Still, she is what her candidate, Bob Dole, is not: young, telegenic, buoyant and up on her popular culture. She is what the party's 1992 keynoter, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, was not: a perceived centrist, telegenic and an advocate for abortion rights.
And she suggests, a tad disdainfully, that her speech will be a departure as well. In his address, Mr. Gramm repeatedly invoked a Mexia, Tex., everyman named Dickie Flatt. When asked who her Dickie Flatt might be, she said unequivocally, "There will be no Dickie Flatt speech."
At her Staten Island home on a recent morning, her bags were half-packed for San Diego, the bed was unmade, and every bureau drawer was open. ("Yesterday when I got Susan Ruby up, her diaper was off, so then I had to bathe her before I fed her," and that annoyed her, "so she pooped on the comforter, and we haven't really recouped from that.") But the speech, she said, was coming together so nicely that she had taken a couple of days off, to let it breathe.
"I know I'm not going to give a Cuomo-esque speech of sorts," she said, referring to the Democratic keynote that made Mario M. Cuomo, then Governor of New York, a national figure in 1984. "But I feel comfortable talking about Bob Dole."
The morning after Mr. Dole chose her last month for the keynoting job, at least in part on the recommendation of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Ms. Molinari, helped by a former speechwriter for George Bush, got to work. Then she started calling friends to run bits of the speech past them, asking, "How does this sound?" She said she planned to run the final draft past the Reagan White House speechwriter Peggy Noonan and Speaker Newt Gingrich.
The address will focus on the economy -- taxes, interest rates and a balanced budget -- as well as crime and drugs, she said, all in 10 minutes.
Her father, the Staten Island Borough President, predicted that she would punch up the proceedings in San Diego. "Bob Dole is Bob Dole," Mr. Molinari said. "We've seen him before, and what you see is what you get. He's not Ronald Reagan. I think I know why. Being from the Midwest, perhaps he does not project as passionately as we from New York -- as a Rudy Giuliani or a Susan Molinari."
Even Ann W. Richards -- who as Governor of Texas hit a keynote home run with her George Bush "born with a silver foot in his mouth" speech at the Democratic convention in 1988 -- was so nervous beforehand, according to a friend, that she needed two hands to steady a glass of water.
And the new level of scrutiny that comes along with being taken seriously has apparently surprised Ms. Molinari.
"It's just weird when you see your name in a headline," she said, referring to a recent article that polled several journalists on whether she was a good choice.
"All but one said I was," she told her press secretary, who asked who the dissenter was. Somebody from The Nation, she said. "I don't even know what that is," she went on, with no apparent snide intent. "Is that the thing they leave on your doorstep?"
In the past, Ms. Molinari had said, with a Zen-like openness to the future, that she might make a run for the Senate if Mr. D'Amato did not seek re-election, or quit politics altogether in a few years. Until Mr. Dole gave a boost to her profile, the toughest questions lobbed at her had typically been of the "Don't you hate it when they call you perky?" variety.
Then, several weeks ago, it was reported that she had smoked marijuana now and again in college. She confirmed it, and finessed the issue with a laugh line: "I'll take a drug test. I'm good at peeing in a cup, having just been through a pregnancy." But then a four-year-old taped interview showed her saying that she had never used marijuana. And some callers on conservative talk radio called her unfit.
Her friends insist that Ms. Molinari has remained relatively calm through this first taste of intense national attention. And those who have known her for years say her self-deprecating, slightly loopy personal style belies what has always been a remarkable focus.
By her own account, she was so determined to do well in school that her parents had to make her go out and play, telling her she could do her homework later.
As a student at the State University of New York at Albany, she says, she was told she would never make a journalist. But, as always, she did make a raft of friends, and wowed her teachers. She was hardly a voracious reader, but loved Ayn Rand. And at one point she wrote home to her father to say that she had come to support abortion rights. "I've known and had friends who've had to have abortions," she said by way of explanation the other day.
Years after college, she often bragged laughingly, one old friend says, about being chosen the best liar in a class in political communication.
But she does not laugh when asked about it now. "The class had to do with body communication and eye contact," she said. The group played a game in which one person would tell a true story and three others would change it and tell the class their version."The class would pick which one was telling the truth," she said. "And they always thought I was the one telling the truth."
Elected to the City Council at the age of 26, she ascended to the post of Council minority leader. As the body's lone Republican, "she was only leading herself," notes Ruth Messinger, a Democrat who served with her on the Council and is now Manhattan Borough President. But the position got her a hefty pay increase, a car and a driver.
"She was always sort of disingenuous about how she didn't know how she got there and had no political plans," Ms. Messinger said. "I wasn't sure if I believed her then, and in retrospect it's obvious that somebody had some plans and she's following through on them."
After five years in what Ms. Molinari describes as a "boring" job, she won a 1990 special election to fill the Congressional seat being vacated by her father.
Surely not even her old pals in political communication class would believe that she is not stretching things a bit with this account of a typical day now: She rises at 6 to take an early-morning walk with the dog, feeds and bathes Susan Ruby, throws a load of laundry into the wash, loads the dishwasher, then works a long day (usually until about 8:30), "maybe throwing some hot dogs on the grill" for dinner with Mr. Paxon and yet finds time to sleep seven or eight hours a night.
But no one can doubt that Ms. Molinari is a hard worker, and tougher than she is usually given credit for. She led a delegation to Bosnia when she was four months pregnant, and exactly a week after giving birth in May (12 hours of labor followed by a Caesarean section) was back at work, at a political event.
In her father's wood-paneled office for a series of interviews last week, Ms. Molinari fielded questions while dad looked on from behind his enormous desk in a kind of prideful rapture.
The former marine said he had always teased his daughter that she would never make a marine. But after Susan Ruby was born, he said emotionally, "everyone brought an expensive gift, and I brought a marine emblem."
"She knew what that meant," he said. "She's as tough as they come when she needs to be."
Ms. Molinari disappointed some supporters when she defended her father after he had said that the 1994 Democratic candidate for state attorney general, Karen Burstein, should not win the office because she is a lesbian.
More recently, she lost ground with abortion rights advocates by voting against "partial birth" abortions, financing for international family planning and using crime-bill money to beef up security at abortion clinics. In 1995 votes, she parted company with her party's official position only 9 percent of the time.
Before heading off to San Diego, she said she had been giving a lot of thought to "who I am for this audience."
If Ms. Molinari's political aspirations take her as far as many believe they could, that debate has only begun. But several acquaintances, all of whom meant it as a compliment, compared her to another precocious, extremely likable and arguably moderate politician.
"She comes off the way people describe the President, whom I've never met," said Chris Meyer, a staff lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, who met her at a reception. "She can look you in the eye, and you just like her."

HEADLINE: New York Stock Exchange Considers a Move, but Not From Manhattan

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Trying to accommodate strong growth in recent years, officials at the New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that they were thinking about relocating to expanded headquarters somewhere in Manhattan.
The stock exchange, one of New York City's prime economic engines and the leading symbol of its claim as a world financial capital, has not decided whether to move, or where, said a spokesman, Ray Pellecchia. But one decision has been made: the exchange will not move to New Jersey or elsewhere outside the city, Mr. Pellecchia and city officials said. 
 Consideration of a new home for the exchange, which was reported yesterday by The New York Post, is prompted by a need for larger and more modern quarters, according to several New York real estate executives. The exchange, founded in 1792, has been at Wall and Broad streets for 93 years and has long been a popular tourist attraction.
Officials at the exchange declined to discuss possible sites, but several real estate executives said the exchange would need a huge trading floor, perhaps as large as 120,000 square feet -- about three times the size of a floor in the Met Life Building next to Grand Central Terminal. That requirement, along with the need for considerable space for computers and auxiliary services, would rule out virtually all existing office buildings in lower Manhattan, the executives said.
An option under consideration is tearing down an old office building at 2 Broadway, near Battery Park, and constructing a new headquarters there, according to the real estate executives. Another possibility would be putting up a vast building at the eastern end of Wall Street, over the East River. The developer Donald J. Trump has proposed that site to the exchange, the real estate executives said.
The city, and not Mr. Trump, controls the waterfront there, just south of the South Street Seaport and two piers with indoor tennis courts.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has offered tax incentives to prevent other markets from moving, said yesterday that he met two weeks ago with Richard A. Grasso, the chairman and chief executive of the exchange, to discuss the possibility of a new home.
Mr. Grasso made it clear that the exchange was committed to New York City, Mr. Giuliani said, and would not seek to maximize tax breaks and other incentives from the city and state by pretending that it was considering a move to New Jersey or Connecticut.
The Mayor said Mr. Grasso had told him that the exchange wanted "a larger, more modern location."
Since then, city and exchange officials have discussed many possible sites, Mr. Giuliani said, adding that the talks would probably continue for at least three or four months.
"My most important objective is to keep the stock exchange in the city of New York," the Mayor said. "That is one of our anchors that makes us the financial capital of the world."
"I would prefer to see them in lower Manhattan," he said. "I think they would prefer to stay in lower Manhattan, but then they have to look at other options as well, and we have to give them the flexibility to do that."
The Giuliani administration, like its recent predecessors, has offered substantial tax abatements and other financial incentives to keep major employers in the city. Last year, the New York Cotton Exchange, which had decided to move to Jersey City, agreed to join the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in moving from their current home, in the World Trade Center, to a new building at Murray and Greenwich streets in TriBeCa. The city offered $98 million in incentives to both exchanges to remain in New York.
When asked at a news conference how much aid would be required to help the stock exchange relocate within the city, Mr. Giuliani said it was too soon to know. "We haven't made a deal yet, and I don't know what it's going to take to have them accomplish the facility that they need," he said.
The stock exchange has considered moving before. Three years ago, officials of the exchange considered a proposal to relocate across the street, said Louis Rudin, a developer who was part of the team of developers and consultants that devised the plan. Under the proposal, an office building at 23 Wall Street and a full block of neighboring buildings would have been razed, and a new trading floor and headquarters would have been built for the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
In the end, senior officials of the exchange decided to remain in their current building, according to Mr. Rudin, whose family real estate company owns a number of nearby office buildings.
"Our primary effort is to keep the stock exchange downtown in New York," he said, "and there is no reason, we think, to believe that they won't be there."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Of Knishes, Soulfulness and Kemp

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, when Jack F. Kemp quietly switched his official residence from New York to Maryland, it seemed a merciful end to what had become little more than a political pretense.
He had represented the Buffalo suburbs in upstate New York in the House of Representatives for 18 years, but over those years had spent increasingly less time in the state and more time making speeches on the road, building a national reputation. Born and raised in California, without the slightest trace of ethnic eccentricity, Jack Kemp was about as New York as Spam. 
 He was accused by one of his opponents of being a "carpetbagger," renting out his official home in suburban Hamburg. His hometown newspaper, The Buffalo News, ran a political cartoon in 1986 that showed him trying to remember which town he represented. "Buffalo, Buffalo," mused the caricature. "Rings a bell."
Local voters ignored the jibes, proud of their Congressman's national reputation.
Now, as he ascends a national political ticket, he is truly a man without a state, more foliage than roots. Californians, New Yorkers and now even Marylanders can claim a piece of him, but Mr. Kemp seems more a creature of ideas than geography. Even his strongest admirers don't suggest that New York's 33 electoral votes had anything to do with Bob Dole's choice of him as a Vice-Presidential candidate, because he is simply not enough of a New York politician to influence New York's Democratic majority.
Buffalo may have more in common with the Midwest than Midtown, but many people expect politicians from anywhere in the state who step onto the national stage to bear at least a few of the more noble downstate stereotypes. Like logos on a license plate, they remain memorable trademarks: the soulfulness of a Mario M. Cuomo, the compulsive drive of an Alfonse M. D'Amato or a Rudolph W. Giuliani, the twinkle of a Jacob Javits or an Al Smith.
Mr. Kemp, on the other hand, was an energetic straight arrow, best known first for his football prowess and later for a conservative economic theory that played better outside the state. His connection to an urban area like New York City was expressed less in his personal style than in an interest in the welfare of minorities and immigrants -- one not always shared by his fellow Republicans -- as well as a vigorous pro-Israel stance.
"He's not your hot-dog-eating, knish-munching street politician," said Roy M. Goodman, the Republican State Senator from Manhattan who is a friend of Mr. Kemp. "But his relationship with the black community and his concern for immigrants give him his New York credentials."
Mr. Kemp was born in Los Angeles and spent the first 27 years of his life in California. That he eventually became a New Yorker was as randomly determined as the fate of a wind-blown seed: the San Diego Chargers, for whom he played as a quarterback, traded him to the Buffalo Bills in 1962. He played there for eight seasons, leading the team to two league championships, and became enough of a local hero to win a Congressional seat in 1970.
Having bypassed the traditional ladder of state politics, Mr. Kemp was not the type of politician who could regularly be found alongside the state's other elected officials slapping backs in banquet halls like Antun's in Queens Village. Though he campaigned briefly for Mr. Giuliani in 1993, his relationship to New York City was fleeting.
"I think I only saw him at a fund-raiser maybe once, back in 1986 or something," said Fran Werner, a former Queens County Republican chairwoman. "He's not really a New Yorker, but you know they think he's God up in the western part of the state."
He seemed to sense that his repute was not spread evenly around the state, repeatedly declining to run for any office higher than representative and lower than President. New York Republicans tried to persuade him to run for governor in 1982, 1986 and 1990, and for senator in 1988. He toyed with the idea, but never agreed. The courtship ended in 1989 when he declared Bethesda, Md., as his home.
Mr. Kemp's residual popularity upstate is not to be entirely dismissed: as Gov. George E. Pataki's 1994 victory showed, politicians not identified with the city can win statewide elections. Several political experts said that while President Clinton is in absolutely no danger of losing New York, the Democrats may now have to devote a bit more effort to the state than they had expected.
"He's not an ethnic sort of person, but he has a great deal of empathy for those who are, and that has a lot of appeal," Richard Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman, said of Mr. Kemp. "With Jack in the race, I think Republicans at least have an opportunity in New York."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Convention Summary

 BODY:

WELCOMING EVERYONE, KEEPING SOME QUIET
Regardless of what its platform says, the Republican Party is striving for a warmer, fuzzier convention. It is determined to remake the impression left after the 1992 Republican gathering when Patrick J. Buchanan's talk of a "religious war" came off as harsh. On opening day, the image was decidedly soft as speakers exhorted from a close-to-the-people podium that contrasted sharply with the towering pulpits of most political conventions. And the message that there is enough room in the tent for everybody was convincingly delivered by the mere presence of Mr. Powell, who embodies the party's more inclusive side. In perhaps the ultimate display of togetherness, Mr. Buchanan yesterday said: "I endorse the Republican ticket of Dole-Kemp, and will work for a national Republican victory in November."
 
HIGHLIGHTING A FEW SPLINTER-PROOF PLANKS
Bob Dole says he has not read it, and some of the convention's star speakers take issue with it. It, of course, is the platform, a document that sets out what the Republican Party stands for. The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, moving to the right on social issues like immigration, welfare and gay rights and omitting the word "tolerance" in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter intraparty debate. But the party faithful chose to spotlight less divisive planks: economic opportunity, safer streets and better schools.
 
POLITICS AS USUAL SPREAD IN NEWER WAYS
Already tickled by their ability to mesh their program with television networks' schedules to create the first convention-as-infomercial, convention planners grasped a way to get out their message without any filter at all. They went on line. Yesterday, a senator, governor or member of Congress was to be on line continuously from 4 P.M. to midnight, chatting via on-line services and the World Wide Web.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE OVERVIEW;
G.O.P. Convention Begins With Display of Unity

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Republicans opened their 36th annual convention here today with a meticulously choreographed pageant of unity that evoked the glories of their party's past and sought to convince voters that they were sensitive enough to the nation's needs to be trusted not just with Congress but also with the White House.
To galvanize party loyalists, and promote Bob Dole's signature tax-cut plan, Republicans offered for the evening's emotional, prime-time highlight an optimistic and nostalgic video message from its ailing champion from the 1980's, former President Ronald Reagan. Then, looking to the future as it tries to unite, and to rally moderates who lost out on the pre-convention platform, the party turned to its most elusive and compelling figure, Gen. Colin L. Powell. 
 General Powell, who repeatedly stopped speaking to acknowledge an outpouring ovations, devoted only one sentence deep in his speech to directly address two simmering issues that set him apart from many party leaders: his support for abortion rights and affirmative action.
But mostly, General Powell, who captured the network cameras that had been turned off earlier when the party's rigidly conservative platform was discussed and adopted, offered a message of inclusion. It was aimed at voters who have been put off by what many feel have been the excesses of the Republican-controlled Congress.
"Let us never step back from compassion," he said. "The message we must convey to the American people is that we fight for welfare reform, we fight for health-care reform and other reforms not just to save money, because we believe there are better ways to take care of Americans in need than the exhausted programs of the past."
General Powell, whose commanding stature from the gulf war and status as the most prominent black Republican led many in his party to plead with him to run for President, paid tribute to Mr. Dole as a hero. "I know this man," he said. "In an era of too much salesmanship and too much smooth talking Bob Dole is a plain-spoken man. A man of strength, maturity and integrity. He is a man who can bring trust back to Government and bring Americans together again."
Adding to the feeling of harmony, Patrick J. Buchanan, whose no-frills, self-styled populist campaign was an irritant to Mr. Dole throughout the primaries, strode through the hall tonight to the cheers of well-wishers.
On Sunday, Mr. Buchanan called for a "truce of San Diego," with Mr. Dole, though he did not go as far as to actually endorse Mr. Dole. Today he finally capitulated, after getting a full run of headlines and televised sound bites for his insurgency and implied promise that he would be back as a candidate in the year 2000.
"The only realistic chance we have in 1996 to implement the agenda for which we campaigned for 18 months," he said in a written statement, "is to keep Congress Republican, and replace Clinton-Gore with a Republican Administration.
"Therefore," he continued, "I endorse the Republican ticket of Dole-Kemp, and will work for a national Republican victory in November."
But the star of the evening was General Powell, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff worked intimately with President Clinton in his first year in office. His speech capped an evening designed to stir new enthusiasm about Mr. Dole, and his running mate, Jack Kemp. The program was also intended to sow grave doubts about the leadership of Mr. Clinton and persuade Americans that Mr. Clinton's lead in the polls is not insurmountable.
Speaker after speaker, in fast-paced addresses that were restricted to less than five minutes in many cases, came with tributes to the 73-year-old Mr. Dole as an American hero. They depicted their party as the party of economic growth and the protector of middle-class households in which incomes have stagnated -- themes that the Republicans plan to highlight in the fall.
Former President George Bush made an indirect but searing attack on the man who defeated him four years ago. "It breaks my heart when the White House is demeaned, the Presidency itself diminished," he said. "Bob Dole, as President, will treat the White House with respect, his staff will be beyond even the appearance of impropriety; and, in the process, he will increase respect for the United States of America around the world."
Leaving no doubt he was drawing a critical comparison with Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Bush, in introducing his wife, Barbara, called her "a woman who unquestionably upheld the honor of the White House."
The nearly 4,000 delegates and alternates, in festive spirits as they sported newly produced "Dole/ Kemp" placards. Though the joyous program played well on television, the long and narrow hall was comparatively quiet and muffled, even when Elizabeth Dole was introduced.
The most sentimental moments of the evening were when, nearly crying, Nancy Reagan spoke of her husband -- and brought tears to many in the audience. Referring to his suffering with Alzheimer's disease, Mrs. Reagan said, "We've learned the terrible pain and loneliness." And she evoked one of her husband's most memorable phrases, saying, "I can tell you with certainty he still sees the shining city on the hill."
After Mrs. Reagan, former President Gerald R. Ford was on hand with Mr. Bush to recall past Republican triumphs.
Mr. Ford reminded the delegates that Mr. Dole was his running mate in 1976, and counseled them not to worry about Mr. Clinton's significant lead in the polls.
"Refresh your memories, recall when you read today's national polls," he said, "Ford and Dole came from 30 points behind that August to win 49.9 percent of the actual ballots cast. We lost a cliffhanger. The only poll that counts this year is still three months away."
The Republicans also sought to reach beyond partisan politics with appearances by ordinary Americans, and one not-so-ordinary man, Capt. Scott F. O'Grady, the Air Force F-16 pilot whose downing over Bosnia and dramatic rescue captivated the nation.
In a night that could have been titled, "Heroes," Captain O'Grady was introduced by another man known for bravery, Senator John McCain of Arizona. Mr. McCain, who was on the short-list to be Mr. Dole's running mate, was a prisoner of war for years in the Vietnam War.
Lost among the bunting and adulatory speeches in the cramped, low-slung San Diego Convention Center was the intramural brawling over abortion that has preoccupied the party for months. With no dissent and little notice, the convention ratified the starkly conservative, anti-abortion credo that it had labored over at platform hearings last week. The platform committee had rejected a move by Mr. Dole to include a plank expressing tolerance for the views of Republicans who favor abortion rights.
In fact, convention planners allowed for General Powell and other supporters of abortion rights to mention the issue just enough so the party could not be accused of stifling dissent. But any real sign of support for abortion rights was obscured by the red and blue placards that blossomed in the Oklahoma delegation right in front of the podium and proclaimed, "Life -- the first inalienable right." Republicans have been quick to say that they are more inclusive than Democrats who four years ago would not allow former Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania to address the convention about his stand against abortion.
When General Powell briefly mentioned abortion, there were scattered boos in the hall.
But then, he declared: "We are a big enough party -- and big enough people -- to disagree on individual issues."
While Mr. Dole, who will be formally nominated on Wednesday, watched tonight's proceedings from his hotel room, he ventured into this convention city earlier in the day. He interrupted a speech at a solar turbine plant to welcome Mr. Buchanan's belated endorsement. "Just received a bulletin here," he said. "Pat Buchanan has endorsed the Dole-Kemp ticket, and we're happy to have that."
After the speech, in which he delivered a fresh pitch for his economic plan, Mr. Dole said: "We'd like to leave here united. It appears we will. We certainly accept the endorsement." Reaching out to Mr. Buchanan's backers, he added, "He did have a message, when it came to job security and some of the trade areas."
The theme of unity and reaching out to all Americans was as apparent in the made-for-prime-time symbols tonight as in the oratory. In keeping with its "we are America" tableau, the party discarded the traditional fortress-like podium for a more open one, lower to the ground. The hall, in which the television network booths had a direct line of sight to the podium and the majority of delegates were hard-pressed to see the speaker's rostrum, was decorated with photographs of gauzy Americana.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Excerpts From Remarks Of Ford, Bush and Powell

BYLINE: The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks delivered yesterday at the Republican National Convention by former President Gerald R. Ford, former President George Bush and Colin L. Powell.
 
Remarks by President Ford
 What is it, in a very few words, that all Republicans really believe in?
We believe -- along with millions of Democrats and Independents -- that a government big enough to give you everything you want -- is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.
What we all want is an across-the-board change in Washington. Let's complete the fundamental Federal reform the American voters mandated for Congress two years ago.
Above all, we desperately need a leader of principled, proven integrity who believes as we do, an expert at building consensus, a commander-in-chief who has earned his salutes, a president who would rather tackle tough problems than talk and talk and talk -- and talk about them.
We want President Bob Dole and Vice President Jack Kemp.
Never forget, my friends, the primary purpose of a political party is to win. . . .
Ours is the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, who lived and died for the proposition that all Americans -- indeed all peoples -- are created equal, with unalienable God-given rights.
Ours is the Republican Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who reminded us that America is not good because she is great; but rather America is great because she is good.
Ours is the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, whose persistence in building and maintaining America's military and industrial superiority finally persuaded the Communists they could never hope to defeat us, and thus ended the cold war.
Ours is the Republican Party of Bob Dole, another plain-speaking son of the American heartland, who persevered in the service of his Kansas neighbors to be a congressman, a senator, our party's nominee for Vice president, minority and majority leaders of the United States Senate.
And, God willing, with your help and mine, the next President of the United States.
 
Remarks by President Bush
 As President, I worked to uphold the dignity and the honor of the presidency.
I tried, as did my superb staff, to treat both the White House and the presidency itself with respect. It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart when the White House is demeaned, the presidency diminished.
Bob Dole, as President, will treat the White House with respect, his staff will be beyond even the appearance of impropriety; and, in the process, he will increase respect for the United States of America all across the world. . . .
Consistent, strong U.S. leadership is vitally important to world peace.
Leadership around the world means keeping one's word. It means policy by conviction. It means never blaming others, or ducking and dodging, or putting our troops under United Nations command.
Leadership means standing against the voices of isolation and protectionism. It means being able to make a tough decision even when the pollsters and handlers say "No."
Bob Dole, himself bloodied in combat, tested by fire on the battlefield and in the world of politics, has proved his service to country. He knows we need a strong defense, and a strong economy.
He will be a commander-in-chief whom our own military respects, whom our allies will look up to, and whom any future adversary will fear.
There is no substitute for personal sacrifice, for courage, for honorable service to our country and Bob Dole has served his state, his nation and the Congress with honor -- always with honor.
And for him "Duty, Honor, Country" mean something noble. He will be a president we can look up to. He will do us proud.
 
Remarks by Mr. Powell
 I come before you this evening as a retired soldier, a fellow citizen who has lived the American dream to the fullest. As someone who believes in that dream and wants that dream to become reality for every American. My parents came to this country as immigrants over seventy years ago.
They came here, as had millions of others, with nothing but hope, a willingness to work hard and a desire to use the opportunities given them by their new land. A land which they came to love with all their hearts.
They found work that enabled them to raise a family. Work that allowed them to come home every Friday night with the fruits of their labor, a decent wage that brought sustenance and, more importantly, brought dignity into our home.
They raised two children to whom they gave a precious gift -- a set of core beliefs. A value system founded on a clear understanding of the difference between right and wrong and a belief in the Almighty.
Integrity, kindness and Godliness, they taught us, were right. Lying, violence, intolerance, crime drugs were wrong and, even worse than wrong, in my family, they were shameful.
We were taught that hard work and education were the keys to success in this country.
My sister and I were taught to believe in ourselves.
We might be considered poor, but we were rich in spirit.
We might be black and treated as second-class citizens.
But, stick with it, because in America, justice will eventually triumph and the powerful, searing promise of the founding fathers will come true.
We were taught by my parents to always, always, always believe in America.
My parents found here a compassionate land and a compassionate people. They found a government that protected their labor, educated their children, and provided help to those of their fellow citizens who were in need. They found their dream in America and they passed that dream on to their children.
Here, tonight, over seven decades after they landed on these shores, their son has been given the privilege of addressing the Republican party, assembled in convention to present to the American people our vision of how that dream can be passed on to future generations.
Our vision first and foremost rests on values.
Values, because values are the conscience of a society. Values which must be lived, not just preached.
Children learn values by watching their parents in their homes. Values which are then reinforced in their churches and in their places of worship, in the schools and in the communities in which they live.
And values, values fuel families.
Families that are bound together by love and commitment.
Families that then have the strength to withstand the assaults of contemporary life -- to resist the images of violence and vulgarity that flood into our lives every day.
Families that come together as communities to defeat the scourge of drugs and crime and incivility that threatens us.
That's why we Republicans believe that the family, fueled by values, must be restored to the central place in American life if we are to keep the dream alive.
Yet, families cannot thrive and pass on these beliefs if parents cannot bring home a decent, living wage from a hard days work. We Republicans believe that the good jobs needed to sustain families come from a faster-growing economy where the free enterprise system is unleashed to create wealth -- wealth which produces more good jobs.
In this richest nation on earth, we still have not solved the problems of poverty, of hunger, of poor health care, of inadequate housing, all of which tear away at the roots of strong families.
And for which government assistance is a poor substitute for good jobs. So that's why we are the pro-growth party.
We are the party committed to lessening the burden of taxes, cutting government regulations and reducing government spending, all for the purpose of generating the higher economic growth that will bring better jobs, wages and living standards to all our people.
At the same time, let us never, let us never step back from compassion.
The message we must convey to the American people is that we fight for health care reform, we fight for welfare reform and other reforms not just to save money, but because we believe there are better ways to take care of Americans in need than the exhausted programs of the past.
We must be firm but we must also be fair.
We have to make sure that reduced government spending doesn't single out the poor and the middle class.
Corporate welfare, and welfare for the wealthy must be first in line for elimination.
All of us -- all of us, my friends -- all of us must be willing to do with less from government if we are to avoid condemning our children and grandchildren with a crushing burden of debt that will deny them the American dream.
Let me put it to you, my friends, we all need to understand it is the entitlement state that must be reformed, and not just the welfare state. And we must do it in a way that does not paint all of government as the enemy.
Ineffective government, excessive government, wasteful government, that is the kind of government that we Republicans intend to defeat.
A nation as great and diverse as America deserves leadership that opens its arms not only to those who have already reaped the rewards of the American dream, but to those who strive and struggle each day against daunting odds to make that dream come true.
The Republican Party must always be the party of inclusion.
The Hispanic immigrant who became a citizen yesterday must be as precious to us as a Mayflower descendant; the descendant of a slave or of a struggling miner in Appalachia must be as welcome -- and must find as much appeal -- in our party as in any other party or any other American might.
It is our diversity that has made us strong. Yet our diversity has sadly, throughout our history, been the source of discrimination.
Discrimination that we, as guardians of the American Dream, must rip out branch and root.
It is our party the party of Lincoln, that must always stand for equal rights and fair opportunity for all.
And where discrimination still exists or where the scars of past discrimination still contaminate and disfigure the present, we must not close our eyes to it, declare a level playing field, and hope it will go away by itself.
It did not in the past. It will not in the future.
Let the party of Lincoln be in the forefront, leading the crusade, not only to cut off and kill discrimination, but to open every avenue of educational and economic opportunity to those who are still denied access because of their race, ethnic background or gender.
I've been asked many times why I became a Republican.
I became a Republican because, like you, I believe our party best represents the principles of freedom, opportunity, and limited government upon which our nation was founded.
I became a Republican because I believe the policies of our party will lead to greater economic growth which is the only real solution to the problems of poverty that keep too many Americans from sharing in the wealth of this nation.
I became a Republican because I believe, like you, that the Federal Government has become too large and too intrusive in our lives.
We can no longer afford solutions to our problems that result in more entitlements, higher taxes to pay for them, more bureaucracy to run them and fewer results to show for it.
I became a Republican because I believe America must remain the leader of the free world.
Republican leadership, a Republican president, will bring greater conviction and coherence to our foreign policy -- and will guarantee that our Armed Forces remain the strongest and most capable on earth.
I became a Republican because I want to help build a big tent that our party has raised to attract all Americans. You all know that I believe in a woman's right to choose and I strongly support affirmative action.
And, I was invited here by my party to share my views with you because we are a big enough party -- and big enough people to disagree on individual issues and still work together for our common goal: restoring the American dream.
I am a Republican because I believe in that dream, and I believe that we are the ones to keep it alive.
Later this week we will nominate our leader.
He is a man of proven courage.
He showed his courage in the battlefield.
He showed even greater courage in overcoming the wounds of war. He too has lived the American Dream.
My family began its American odyssey on the sidewalks of New York.
His story began half a continent away.
And yet it is a story with common threads.
One that is shared in many ways by millions of Americans from every state, from every generation, and from every race and creed.
Our candidate's life began in the wheat fields of Kansas where he was born to poor struggling parents who believed in him.
The values they bred in him led him to a distinguished career that took him to the leadership of the United States Senate.
That's where I met him.
We worked together closely for years on matters that were vital to war and peace with respect to this nation. I worked with him closely when I was national security advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
We could always count on him. I know this man.
In an era of too much salesmanship and too much smooth talking, Bob Dole is a plain-spoken man.
He is a man of strength, maturity and integrity.
He is a man who can bring trust back to government and bring Americans together again.
He is a fighter possessed of endless energy, drive and commitment. . . .
Yes, we Republicans have leaders and principles that are worthy of our aspirations.
Let us take our case to our fellow citizens with respect for their intelligence and fair-mindedness.
Let us debate our differences with the Democrats strongly, but with the civility and absence of acrimony that the American people long for in our political debate.
We stand, we stand on the eve of a new century.
A new era, filled with change, anxiety, excitement and opportunity, is dawning.
But many of the basic things -- many of the most important things in our lives and in the life of our nation remain constant.
The pride of bringing home that first paycheck.
The thrill you can't help feeling each time the band strikes up the Star-Spangled Banner and another magnificent young American wins Olympic gold.
The daily challenges and joys of raising a family.
The tremendous ripple effect of family, friends, and neighbors cooperating in ways that make home, neighborhood and nation better places for us all.
These are the things that remain constant.
These are the things that unite us.
There are other eternal truths, other eternal constants in our lives.
Our constant devotion to the principles of freedom, democracy and the free enterprise system.
Our constant belief in the promise of this country, a country where the best is always yet to come.
A country that exists by the grace of a divine providence.
A divine providence that gave us this land, told us to be good stewards of it and to be good stewards of each other.
A land that God has truly, truly blessed and that we are proud to call America.
Thank you.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Excerpts From Platform Adopted by Republican National Convention

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the platform adopted yesterday by the Republican National Convention.
 
PREAMBLE
We meet to nominate a candidate and pass a platform at a moment of measureless national opportunity. A new century beckons, and Americans are more than equal to its challenges. But there is a problem. The Clinton Administration has proven unequal to the heritage of our past, the promise of our times, and the character of the American people. . . .
This is what we want for America: real prosperity that reaches beyond the stock market to every family, small business and worker. An economy expanding as fast as American enterprise and creativity will carry it, free from unnecessary taxes, regulation and litigation.
This is what we want for America: the restoration of self-government by breaking Washington's monopoly on power. The American people want their country back. We will help them to regain it.
This too we want for America: moral clarity in our culture and ethical leadership in the White House. . . .
 
BUILDING A STRONGER AMERICA
 
Tax Relief for Economic Growth
American families are suffering from the twin burdens of stagnant incomes and near-record taxes. This is the key cause of middle-class anxiety. It is why people feel they are working harder but falling further behind; why they fear the current generation will not be as successful as the last generation; why they believe their children will be worse off; and why they feel so anxious about their own economic future.
In response to this unprecedented burden confronting America, we support an across-the-board, 15-percent tax cut to marginal tax rates. Fifteen percent represents the total increase in the Federal tax burden since Bill Clinton took office. . .
If the personal and dependent exemption that was $600 in 1950 had kept pace with inflation, it would be $3,800 rather than the current $2,500. That is why Republicans have made the $500-per-child family tax credit one of the primary features of our tax cut package. . . .
Today's personal savings rate is less than half what it was two decades ago. Republicans support expansion of I.R.A.'s and the establishment of spousal I.R.A.'s to encourage savings and investment. . . .
To remove impediments to job creation and economic growth, we support reducing the top tax rate on capital gains by 50 percent. . . .
We firmly commit to a tax code for the 21st century that will raise revenue sufficient for a smaller, more effective and less wasteful government without increasing the national debt. . . .
 
Balancing the Budget And Reducing Spending
Once and for all, we declare:
*The budget deficit and high taxes are two halves of the vise that is producing the Clinton middle-class squeeze;
*A balanced budget and lower taxes go hand in hand, not in separate directions;
*Reducing the budget deficit by shrinking government produces a fiscal dividend in stronger growth and lower interest rates;
*Ending that deficit will make possible a dramatic return of resources to the American people;
*Tax relief is the only way to return the economy to the growth rates our country enjoyed from World War II to the coming of Bill Clinton; and
*We will not mortgage our children's future by incurring deficits.
 
 Creating Jobs for Americans
. . . In addition to our overall program of lower taxes, regulatory reform, and less spending, we will:
*Allow small businesses to deduct the costs of their health insurance;
*Restore the fair home-office deduction so important to start-up businesses;
*Assure that no one who inherits a small business or farm has to sell it to pay inheritance taxes;
*Make the I.R.S. stop its discrimination against independent contractors;
*Enact both legal reform and product liability legislation to shield small businesses and protect jobs from the threat of unfair litigation; and
*Transfer from the public sector services that can be provided by the private sector more efficiently and cost effectively.
 
Home Ownership
. . . We affirm our commitment to open housing, without quotas or controls, and we condemn the Clinton Administration's abuse of fair housing laws to harass citizens exercising their First Amendment rights.
In addition, we support transforming public housing into private housing, converting low-income families into proud homeowners. Resident management of public housing is a first step toward that goal, which includes eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD's core functions will be turned over to the states. Its civil rights component will be administered by the appropriate Federal agency, while enforcement will remain with the Department of Justice. . . .
 
Promoting Trade And International Prosperity
. . . Exports already fuel our economy; their continuing expansion is essential for full employment and long-term prosperity. That is possible only within the context of expanding trade, and we can do it better without a Department of Commerce. . . .
Republicans are for vigorous enforcement of the trade agreements we already have on the books, unlike the Clinton Administration that uses United States trade policy as a bargaining chip and as a vehicle for pursuing a host of other social agenda items. . . .
To advance economic freedom, we insist that United States foreign aid, whether bilateral or through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, promote market reforms, limit regulation and encourage free trade. Republicans will stop subsidizing socialism in the less developed nations. Republicans will not allow the World Trade Organization to undermine United States sovereignty and will support a World Trade Organization oversight commission. . . .
 
Changing Washington From The Ground Up
. . . As a first step in reforming government, we support elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Energy . . . [Other] agencies we seek to defund or to privatize are the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Legal Services Corporation.
 
A Citizens' Congress
. . . We will eliminate made-in-Washington schemes to rig the election process under the guise of campaign reform. True reform is indeed needed: ending taxpayer subsidies for campaigns, strengthening party structures to guard against rogue operations, requiring full and immediate disclosure of all contributions, and cracking down on the indirect support, or "soft money," by which special interest groups underwrite their favored candidates.
 
Cleaning Up Government
It is time to restore honor and integrity to government. We propose to:
*Revoke pension rights of public officials who have been convicted of crimes;
*Strengthen citizen privacy laws and reform the F.B.I. to guard against the politicization of law enforcement that we have seen by the Clinton White House;
*Refuse to allow special interest groups to block innovative solutions for the poor or to block workplace or legal reforms that would help all working Americans. . . .
 
Restoring Justice to the Courts
. . . The Federal judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court, has overstepped its authority under the Constitution. It has usurped the right of citizen legislators and popularly elected executives to make law by declaring duly enacted laws to be "unconstitutional" through the misapplication of the principle of judicial review. . . .
 
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND PERSONAL SAFETY
 
Upholding the Rights of All
. . . As we strive to forge a national consensus on the divisive issues of our time, we call on all Republicans and all Americans to reject the forces of hatred and bigotry. Accordingly, we denounce all who practice or promote racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic prejudice, and religious intolerance. . . .
We endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions. . . .
We likewise endorse this year's Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative, to restore to law the original meaning of civil rights. . . .
The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the 14th Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. . . .
 
A Sensible Immigration Policy
As a nation of immigrants, we welcome those who follow our laws. . . . At the same time, we are determined to reform the system by which we welcome them. . . .
Illegal aliens should not receive public benefits other than emergency aid, and those who become parents while illegally in the United States should not be qualified to claim benefits for their offspring. . . .
We support a constitutional amendment or constitutionally-valid legislation declaring that children born in the United States of parents who are not legally present in the United States or who are not long-term residents are not automatically citizens.
 
FAMILIES AND SOCIETY
 
Improving Education
. . . Our goal is nothing less than a renaissance in American education . . .
We will abolish the Department of Education, end Federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning. We therefore call for prompt repeal of the Goals 2000 program . . .
 
Renewing Hope and Opportunity
. . . Because illegitimacy is the most serious cause of child poverty, we will encourage states to stop cash payments to unmarried teens and set a family cap on payments for additional children. . . .
 To promote personal involvement with anti-poverty efforts, we call for a Charity Tax Credit. . . . To insure that religiously affiliated institutions can fulfill their helping mission, we endorse Republican legislation to stop discrimination against them in government programs.
 
A CLEANER, SAFER, HEALTHIER AMERICA
. . . While we have made substantial environmental progress, we must reject failed approaches created by fear-mongering and centralized control. . . .
The current Endangered Species Act is seriously flawed. . . . We will improve the E.S.A. by implementing an incentive-based program in cooperation with state, local, and tribal governments and private individuals to recognize the critical relationship between a healthy environment and a healthy economy founded on private property rights . . .
Improving Public Lands
We support a thorough review of the lands owned by the Federal Government with a goal of transferring lands that can best be managed by State, county, or municipal governments. This review should insure that the Federal Government retains ownership to unique property worthy of national oversight. . . .
 
Power for Progress
. . . The United States should continue its commitment to addressing global climate change in a prudent and effective manner that does not punish the U.S. economy. Despite scientific uncertainty about the role of human activity in climate change, the Clinton Administration has leapfrogged over reasoned scientific inquiry and now favors misdirected measures. . . .
Republicans deplore the arbitrary and premature abandonment of the previous policy of voluntary reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.
 
RESTORING AMERICAN WORLD LEADERSHIP
 
The Atlantic Alliance and Europe
The Atlantic Alliance: Our relations with the nations of Europe must continue to be based on the NATO alliance. . . . We call for the immediate expansion of the framework for peace to include those countries of Central Europe which demonstrate the strongest commitment to the democratic ideals NATO was created to protect. . . .
Bosnia: We support America's men and women in uniform who are serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, we did not support the ill-conceived and inconsistent policies that led to their deployment. . . . We look forward to a timely withdrawal of U.S. forces from Bosnia. . . .
We have a national interest in a security relationship with a democratic Russia. Specifically, we will encourage Russia to respect the sovereignty and independence of its neighbors; support a special security arrangement between Russia and NATO, but not Moscow's veto over NATO enlargement; support Russian entry to the G-7 after its reforms have been achieved; and link U.S. assistance to Russian adherence to international treaty obligations. . . .
 
Defending America Against Missile Attack
The Republican Party is committed to the protection of all Americans -- including our two million citizens in Alaska and Hawaii -- against missile attack. . . . We therefore endorse the Defend America Act of 1996, introduced by Senator Bob Dole, which calls for a national missile defense system for all 50 states by the year 2003. . . .
To cope with the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the United States will have to deter the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction by rogue states. This in turn will require the continuing maintenance and development of nuclear weapons and their periodic testing. The Clinton Administration's proposed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is inconsistent with American security interests. . . .
The Middle East
. . . We reaffirm that Republican commitment to maintain Israel's qualitative military advantage over any adversary or group of adversaries. While we fully support Israel's efforts to find peace and security with its neighbors, we will judge the peace process by the security it generates both for Israel and for the United States. In that context, we support Israel's right to make its own decisions regarding security and boundaries. . . .
 
Space
The Republican Party led America into space and remains committed to its exploration and mastery. . . . We look toward our country's return to the moon and to completion of the International Space Station. . . . We will develop the Reusable Launch Vehicle, promote markets for commercial space launch services. . . .
 
APPENDIX I: MINORITY VIEWS
 
Amendments Considered By the Full Committee on Resolutions
 
Individual Rights and Personal Safety
. . . The Republican Party welcomes individuals on each side of the abortion issue, encourages their open discussion, solicits their active participation in the Party, and respects their positions and beliefs. . . .
We are committed as a party and as individuals to significantly reducing the number of abortions. . . . We believe that the decline in abortions we seek will be far better achieved by persuasion of individuals to choose -- as a matter of individual conscience -- behavior that will not produce unwanted pregnancies, than by governmental mandate and invasion of privacy. . . . Unlike the Democratic Party, we will not censor members of our party who hold opposing views on this issue. We are a party confident enough in our beliefs to tolerate dissent.

HEADLINE: When Savings Run Out, Some Shun Lifesaving

BYLINE: By SUSAN GILBERT 

 BODY:
THERE are many reasons why seriously ill patients choose to forgo intensive care, including the desire to avoid futile treatment and to die surrounded by loved ones rather than machines. But another reason may be that they have run out of money, a large study suggests.
Researchers found that the likelihood of seriously ill patients' deciding against life-prolonging care was 30 percent greater for those whose illnesses caused them great financial hardship -- depleting their savings, for example, or forcing them to postpone education plans for family members -- than for similar patients whose family finances were relatively unscathed. 
 The study appears in the current issue of Archives of Internal Medicine. Dr. Kenneth E. Covinsky, the lead author, emphasized that the study showed an association between financial distress and end-of-life decisions, not a cause-and-effect relationship. For instance, the course of illness that depleted savings could have also depleted a desire for more aggressive medical care.
"But it seems conceivable based on our results that when faced with financial hardship patients may opt against certain kinds of care," said Dr. Covinsky, an associate professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
Dr. Linda L. Emanuel, vice president of ethical standards for the American Medical Association, questioned whether financial hardship was what influenced patients to reject life-sustaining care. She said comfort care at home or in a hospice, focusing on relieving pain rather than prolonging life, might actually be more prohibitive than hospital care, because it was less likely to be reimbursed by health insurance.
Doctors say they do not discuss money with their patients and therefore do not ration treatment according to their insurance or financial status. "Nobody in my hospital does a wallet biopsy to see if a patient can pay," said Dr. John W. Hoyt, chairman of the critical care department at St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh and president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. "You're driven by your clinical judgment on whether a patient can recover."
But he and other doctors said the new finding raised the possibility that some patients might be rationing their own care, in effect denying themselves lifesaving treatment not because they thought it was hopeless but because it was beyond their means. "When someone says they don't want to try to live longer because they don't want to bankrupt their family, that's rationing," said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
The latest research was part of a $28 million, eight-year study called Support, the largest clinical study ever conducted of seriously ill patients. Dr. Covinsky and his colleagues followed 3,158 patients after a two-month hospital stay at five hospitals around the country.
First, patients were asked whether their families had lost all or most of their savings because of their illnesses, or whether the financial burden had forced their families to make major changes, like moving to a less expensive home or putting off medical care or educational plans for others in the family. Although 95 percent of the patients had hospitalization insurance, 27 percent answered yes to at least one of these questions and so were considered to have suffered economic hardship.
Then the researchers asked the patients if they would prefer a future course of treatment focusing on extending life as much as possible, even if that meant having more pain, or a plan focusing on relieving pain, even if that meant not living as long.
The second option was chosen by more of the financially-strapped patients than of the better-off patients, the study found. But the difference was greatest among the patients under 45, with 42 percent of those experiencing economic hardship choosing comfort care, compared with 32 percent of those who were not. Of the patients 85 and older who had financial trouble, 69 percent said they preferred comfort care, as against 62 percent of the others. Dr. Covinsky said money might have had less of an effect on the older patients' choices because as a group they were more likely to want to comfort care anyway.
The researchers posed the same questions to family members or friends designated by the patients to make to make end-of-life decisions for them should they become incapacitated. The goal was to see if the surrogates were more inclined than the patients to want to avoid life-sustaining care if family finances were in jeopardy. Other investigators have found that patients and surrogates often disagree about treatment options, and some have speculated that money is an important reason, Dr. Covinsky said.
The study found that surrogates' decisions were related to financial circumstances just the way patients' decisions were. In 73 percent of the cases, patients and their surrogates chose the same course of care. In cases where they disagreed, family finances did not seem to play a role.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Mark and Weak Bonds Send the Dollar's Value Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was slightly lower yesterday, hurt by strength in the German mark and by declines in the American stock and bond markets.
But trading was light, with many dealers in Europe and Japan on vacation. "If it's a thin market, it's not really worthwhile to risk a big position," said Jack Griffin, vice president on the corporate foreign-exchange desk at the New York branch of Fuji Bank Ltd. 
 The dollar initially rose after the Labor Department reported that its Consumer Price Index had risen three-tenths of 1 percent in July, more than some had expected. The report raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve might feel prompted to increase interest rates at its Aug. 20 policy meeting, a move that would make dollar-denominated holdings worth more.
Stronger-than-expected data on retail sales for July and early August, suggesting that the economy was growing at a healthy pace, were also seen as reasons to buy dollars.
But the bond market reacted negatively to the news, and falling bond prices pulled down stocks and helped undermine demand for dollars.
"The market clearly wanted to interpret the stronger data as a reason to buy dollars, but it wasn't enough of a reason," said Tom Hoge, vice president for corporate trading at the Bank of New York. "We spent the rest of the day drifting lower."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4750 German marks, down from 1.4780 marks on Monday. The dollar stood at 107.56 Japanese yen, down from 107.63. The British pound slipped to $1.5495 from $1.5515.
Strength in the mark also continued to weaken the dollar. The German currency has been rallying since late last week on growing doubt that the timetable for a single European currency by 1999 was realistic.
Most of the attention has focused on France, where a weak economy and political wrestling over the budget have raised fear that the French will fail to meet strict fiscal criteria to take part in the currency plan and force a delay.
"The mark hasn't gained much, but it's holding the gains over fear that the European monetary union timetable may be postponed," said Debra Larsen, assistant vice president for foreign exchange at Commerzbank in New York.

Bonds Tumble As Price Index Shows Upturn

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Signs of strength in yesterday's economic reports heightened fears of inflation among investors and caused a sharp selloff of Treasury securities, even as some analysts wondered whether the fears were justified.
The 30-year bond fell 1 8/32, to a price of 99 19/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 6.78 percent, from 6.69 percent on Monday. 
 The Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, higher than the two-tenths of 1 percent economists had anticipated, with inflation still being restrained. At the same time, the Government said that July retail sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent after dropping a sharp half-percent in June, a revision of an earlier estimated drop of two-tenths of 1 percent.
The gains are not generally expected to force the Fed into taking any action next week at the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy. The economy, especially considering the downward revision in the June retail sales, was still subdued, and that bodes well for a steady monetary policy, analysts say.
Still, market talk and the release of the weekly Johnson Redbook survey of retail sales, which showed a 1.8 percent gain for the first week of August, put pressure on prices.
Alex Araujo, a financial economist for Nesbitt Burns Inc., a Canadian investment firm, said: "This week's slate of U.S. data was expected to extend the past two weeks' string of bond-friendly releases, but today's C.P.I. and retail sales reports for July were the exact opposite. The greater-than-expected gain in retail receipts was held back by soft auto sales, but preliminary data suggest a sharp rebound in motor vehicle sales for August."
Mr. Araujo said the gain in the consumer-price figure raised the country's overall annual rate of inflation to 3 percent for the first time in more than a year.
"Although at this point there is probably not enough evidence for the Fed to justify a tightening in policy at next week's F.O.M.C. meeting," he said, "underlying growth and inflation trends remain troublesome, making a rate hike before year-end a distinct possibility." He expects stronger advances in the figures for both industrial production tomorrow and housing data on Friday than do most economists.
While the market may have shown concern about the higher-than-expected rise in the consumer price numbers, the Commerce Department's chief economist, Lewis Alexander, did not, telling Reuters that "Any time inflation ticks up it is a source of concern, but I think it's a little less alarming."
Mr. Alexander said he saw the economy slowing a bit and that there was weakness in durable goods. "What we're looking at is sort of the economy coming back to its speed limit a little bit," he said.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said that even though the market was disappointed with yesterday's economic statistics, "one has to remember that we have had a good run until today. And the data gave the market a good reason to consolidate some of those gains."
Mr. McCarthy said that even with the larger-than-expected increases, the inflation rate had begun to slow and would continue to improve in the next several months. "The economy is not overheating," he said.
Investors shunned the corporate debt market yesterday, as yields on benchmark Treasury securities climbed. There is about $3 billion of below-investment-grade debt scheduled for pricing this week, and among the largest sales will be one by Sprint Spectrum.
The wireless company, a partnership of the Sprint Corporation, Tele-Communications Inc., the Comcast Corportion and the Cox Communications unit of Cox Enterprises, plans to raise $650 million in a two-part sale to expand its network. Both parts are rated B2 by Moody's Investors Service, and B+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Bonds are considered below investment grade if they carry ratings of less than Baa-3 by Moody's or BBB- by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Needed for Center: $13 Million and Faith

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
It's 14 months and $13 million to go at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the $180 million colossus astride culture and commerce here in this state's largest and long-downtrodden metropolis.
A bold stroke in a strategy to link economic development and the arts, and forge new ties between downtown and the suburbs, the project is described as more than 65 percent complete, on schedule and already booking performers for its first season, starting in October 1997. The humpbacked complex centered on Prudential Hall (named for its biggest private sponsor) now rears eerily over a desolate 12-acre renewal tract, but artists' renderings show it aglow in burnished orange like a vintage cello. 
 "I said: 'Where? Newark? Why?' " said Stephanie S. Hughley, a theater and dance producer for the Olympic Games in Atlanta and a founder of the National Black Arts Festival. She was approached several years ago for consultation on programming for the 2,750-seat theater and concert hall and 500-seat theater with comparable rehearsal space. Since then, Ms. Hughley, who signed on last year as vice president for programming, says she has become a believer, along with three successive New Jersey governors through the current Whitman Administration, arts presenters and corporate benefactors. All say they hope the 250,000-square-foot complex can do for Newark and the arts what the Meadowlands arenas did for sports.
"New Jersey has become a microcosm for the global village," said Ms. Hughley, who said she had been negotiating appearances by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, Midori, Jessye Norman and the Alvin Ailey Dance Company among others. The center would become home to the homeless New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. And plans are under way for a New Jersey World Festival featuring, for its debut year, the culture of the Portuguese, who constitute one of Newark's largest ethnic communities.
With $167 million of the project's budget assembled from Federal, state and city agencies and corporate and private benefactors, the center's top official expressed guarded optimism that the last of the money can be found in time. "We need to raise a million a month until opening night," said Lawrence P. Goldman, the complex's president, an urban policy specialist who was vice president of Carnegie Hall. "We've always been living on the edge," he said. "When it was scary was when we had $5 million and needed $175 million."
Yet there is a nest egg in the center's financial future that few others can boast. In a strategy intended to assure a flow of operating cash, the project includes two large vacant parcels of land that are reserved for commercial exploitation. Mr. Goldman took a similar approach at Carnegie Hall. It owned a small parking lot next door on West 57th Street that yielded about $200,000 a year until it was redeveloped into a luxury office tower that returned $2 million a year to Carnegie Hall, Mr. Goldman said. "Think," he said, "where Lincoln Center would be if it had bought the land across Broadway."
"It's a big idea," he said, "because only a big idea will work." To bolster revenue the center has also been designed with an eye to renting out the large restaurant, which has what Mr. Goldman called "the biggest kitchen in New Jersey," and other public spaces for private parties and corporate functions.
The Newark project is remarkable in other ways. Along with Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, it is one of the largest arts complexes ever built in the country. And it is going up in a problem-plagued city of 275,000 people, down from 450,000 nearly 30 years ago when riots sent many fleeing to the suburbs.
Yet the site has an irresistible logic, Mr. Goldman maintains. Downtown Newark, barely 15 minutes from a fast-growing airport, is positioned between four major highways and rail connections to Manhattan. New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state, he said, and half its population, or 4.6 million people, lives within 25 miles of downtown Newark. So, he said, "My question is: Why wouldn't you build an arts center here?"
"The performing arts belong in cities," he said during a recent tour of the construction site. "Not only because they're easier to get to. There's something about the energy and diversity of downtowns that seem to feed on the creative process."
"The mall is only the mall," he said. "It can never be downtown. There is something about the electricity, complexity, even the conflict of cities, that's more exciting."
The center's location was no accident, he said. The new complex faces downtown Center Street a block off busy McCarter Highway with its rumbling trucks and two blocks from the desolate but presumably commercially exploitable Passaic River waterfront. It was meant to be seen as accessible, to the point of creating congestion. "Too much built in Newark since the riots looks like a fortress," Mr. Goldman said. "The whole point is to put people on the street. That's what makes cities great. Let it screw up traffic. Think of Lincoln Center at curtain time."
In the conception of arts center planners and its architect, Barton Myers, the project would also be a link between downtown Newark and its more affluent suburbs, where many residents, black and white, headed after the riots. The center's research found that about 55,000 workers from the suburbs and 35,000 college students and staff members commute into Newark daily; these groups are prime target audiences. A 1,100-car parking garage under Military Park opposite the arts center is to be renovated. And educational programs are to draw schoolchildren to the center daily. "Our dream is a sea of yellow school buses," Mr. Goldman said.
As models, he cites Pittsburgh and Cleveland, cities whose downtowns were reinvigorated by arts developments. Yet Newark has hardly been an easy candidate for reform. Corruption investigations have long scarred the political landscape, and these days are no exception. But Mr. Goldman said no improprieties had tarnished the arts center.
The construction work, he said, involved high levels of minority group participation, at the insistence of project and city officials. "I have to give Sharpe James a lot of the credit," he said of Newark's Mayor. "He's been a great leader for this project."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Earnings at Deere Climbed By 13.3% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Deere & Company said today that earnings rose 13.3 percent in the third quarter, bolstered by strong demand for agriculture equipment.
The company, based in Moline, Ill., earned $204.4 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $180.1 million, or 69 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 The earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations of 77 cents a share, according to First Call, and prompted a rally in Deere shares. The stock surged $2.50, to $39.
"It was a good solid quarter," said Roger Sit, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The stock has been pretty beaten up recently, which was unjustified, and good earnings were just what was needed to give them a lift."
Revenue rose 9 percent, to $2.91 billion, from $2.67 billion in the quarter a year ago.
Agricultural equipment sales rose 18 percent, to $1.61 billion from $1.36 billion, led by strong sales of high- horsepower tractors and harvesting combines.
Deere can expect continued strong farm equipment sales, thanks to the increased revenue of the farmers it sells to, said Jonathan Braatz, an analyst with Fahnestock & Company. "Planted acreage is going to be up, land values are rising, grain prices are higher, and the whole macro-environment remains very good," Mr. Braatz said.
In addition, farmers are getting larger Government subsidies than they normally would because of new farm legislation passed earlier this year.
Under its provisions, farmers receive a fixed but declining subsidy for seven years, no matter what the price of grain, as they are moved gradually to a more market-based economy. Previously, farmers received subsidies only if average grain prices fell below a certain level.
"Farm income is as good as its been in a long while," said Steven Decker, an analyst at Farmers Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based life insurance company that manages $17 billion in assets and owned about 1.3 million Deere shares as of June. "The subsidies from the farm bill are coming at the same time as grain prices are reaching all time highs, which bodes very well for Deere."
Other Deere businesses did not fare as well as farm equipment. Sales of industrial equipment such as bulldozers and excavators fell 2 percent, to $496 million from $504 million, while sales of lawn and garden equipment fell 6 percent, to $408 million from $435 million.
Revenue from Deere's financial services division rose 4 percent, to $352 million from $338 million.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Lehman Brothers, on an efficiency drive, sublets part of its headquarters site for 16 years.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE Global Financial Information Corporation has sublet 80,000 square feet -- the 27th and 28th floors -- at 3 World Financial Center, the 51-story, 2.2-million-square-foot office building that is headquarters to American Express and Lehman Brothers.
Financial details of the 16-year sublet from Lehman Brothers were not disclosed, but real estate brokers estimate that the annual rent would be about $30 a square foot, giving the lease an aggregate value of about $40 million. 
 Global will be consolidating operations from five Manhattan sites. The company provides computer-based financial information, analyses and other services; it recently bought the Knight-Ridder Financial news service for $275 million.
Robert B. Emden of Grubb & Ellis New York, who with his colleagues Elliot Klein and Mark Preston represented Global, said the deal would bring together Global's offices at 330 and 380 Madison Avenues, 40 Rector Street, 77 Water Street and 32 Old Slip.
He said the Knight-Ridder operation, now at 75 Wall Street, would also move to 3 World Financial Center. Global expects to complete the move by early fall.
Mr. Klein said the new space provided in-place technology, extensive improvements and furnishings "without the costs typically associated with building a new corporate headquarters, which Global originally considered doing."
Mark S. Green, a managing director in charge of corporate real estate at Lehman Brothers, said that as part of a continuing cost-reduction program, the investment firm was using its space more efficiently, making the two floors available for sublet.
Mitchell Steir of Julien J. Studley Inc. represented Lehman Brothers.

J. Crew United
J. Crew, the clothing retailer, has leased 125,000 square feet at 770 Broadway, at East Ninth Street, for executive offices, design and catalogue production.
The space is on the 11th and 12th floors of the 15-story, 937,000-square-foot building.
J. Crew will be consolidating from three other Manhattan sites: 625 Avenue of the Americas, at 18th Street; 115 Fifth Avenue, at 19th Street, and 11 West 19th Street.
Details of the 15-year deal were not disclosed, but brokers said that asking rents for the two floors were $22 a square foot annually.
Julien J. Studley Inc. represented J. Crew; Helmsley-Spear Inc. represented the building.
 
Not Renovating
Sometimes technology requires renovation -- and sometimes it requires new space.
The Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation, a publisher and marketer of telephone Yellow Pages, has leased 61,634 square feet -- the seventh and part of the ninth floor -- at 220 East 42d Street, the former Daily News Building.
The seventh floor of the 37-story, one-million-square-foot building for many years housed the newsroom of The Daily News, which moved in May 1995 to 450 West 33d Street, at 10th Avenue.
Donnelley will be moving its midtown sales office to 42d Street from 711 Third Avenue, at 44th Street, where it has about 50,000 square feet. The lease, for 10 years and 9 months, was valued at about $15 million.
The reason for the move? Technology, said Robert A. B. Baraff of the Edward S. Gordon real estate company, who represented Donnelley with his colleague Andrew Peretz and with Jon C. Sarkisian of the Jackson-Cross Company of Philadelphia.
"New technology made Donnelley require a different kind of layout, and the current building couldn't accommodate them," Mr. Baraff said. "The old space needed to be refurbished, the air-conditioning needed updating, and there was no way of staying in the space and doing the renovation at the same time. And the building didn't have other space to move them into. There was no place to park them temporarily."

Staying in Queens
The New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal has decided to keep its Office of Rent Administration's executive office at Gertz Plaza in Jamaica, Queens, and has renewed its lease for 120,000 square feet. The 10-year renewal was valued at $10.3 million.
Queens officials had feared that a move of the division and its 550 jobs would harm Jamaica's downtown.
The division had looked at other sites, including West 125th Street in Harlem and Fordham Plaza in the Bronx, where the agency has other offices, and had considered consolidating operations.
"We met with the division when the lease came up and we considered going elsewhere, but we decided Gertz Plaza was the best fit," said Robert R. Hinckley, a spokesman for the state's Office of General Services, whose Bureau of Leases handled the deal. "And we got a good rate for renewal."
The office is on two floors at Gertz Plaza, a 520,000-square-foot building at 162-10 Jamaica Avenue that once housed the Gertz department store. Ernest Faraci of Walter & Samuels Inc. represented the landlord, Lager Associates.
Ethan H. Lazar of Lager Associates said he was "delighted and relieved," because losing the agency "could have been a devastating economic blow to Jamaica."

HEADLINE: Residents Reclaim Their Old Way of Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CHESTER, Pa., Aug 13

 BODY:
As an original tenant in the Ruth L. Bennett Homes, Yvonne Carrington never forgot what the rows of modest brick town homes in her community looked like when she moved in 43 years ago. "It was a lovely place to live," she said.
In a way, her memory has been a curse. Built in the 1940's for the families of local shipyard workers, the homes soon passed into public housing and began a slow descent into decrepitude. They were eventually overwhelmed by rats, grafitti, drug dealers, poor management and crime. 
 But a rising level of anger among tenants and a new approach to rehabilitating public housing has enabled Mrs. Carrington to push aside images of squalor and foreboding and recall the old days. Today, tenants of the Bennett homes, housing officials and local leaders joined to celebrate the opening of the first 97 of nearly 400 units to be renovated. The remaining units are scheduled for remodeling within a year, followed by work on Chester's three other public housing projects. Altogether, 1,000 units will be restored.
"A truly remarkable transformation is taking place before our eyes," said Judge Norma L. Shapiro of the District Court for eastern Pennsylvania, whose ruling in a 1990 lawsuit set the renaissance in motion. "It's a wonderful example of what can happen when initiative, creativity and community are applied."
The lawsuit was the first of its kind, filed by public housing residents against the local housing authority to reverse years of decay and neglect.
At the time, the action was considered a radical adversarial approach. When public housing decayed, it was more common for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to form a friendly partnership with local officials eager for Federal assistance to improve existing stock, build new units or relocate tenants into other areas. These partnerships exist in Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans and San Francisco, among other cities.
The Chester initiative is under way while a House-Senate conference committee is negotiating final language of a bill that would change much of nation's housing policies for the first time in 60 years by shifting more power and discretion to the local authorities. A key component would be to hold the local authorities to certain performance standards and replace them with a private management group if they fail to uphold them.
The Administration has indicated it supports the Congressional overhaul so long as public housing remains affordable for the neediest Americans.
In the Chester case, local officials resisted the housing agency's intervention, and a group of tenants dissatisfied with the agency's efforts decided to sue the Chester Housing Authority.
Judge Shapiro ruled for the tenants in 1993 and placed the Chester Housing Authority in receivership, later approving a former New York City housing official, Robert C. Rosenberg, as the receiver in 1994. Since then, tenants' groups in two other cities, Washington and Kansas City, Mo., have sued their local housing authorities, resulting in court-appointed private receivers.
"I don't know if this gets things done any faster," Maryann Russ, the H.U.D. deputy assistant secretary for public and assisted housing operations, said of the court-ordered approach to improvements. "But in certain situations, because of a combination of political intransigence and deep-seated suspicions housing residents have about local administrations, this is the only way to bring in a new broom."
Mr. Rosenberg, now chairman of the Grenadier Realty Corporation in Brooklyn, discovered quickly that no broom was big enough. In assessing the local housing authority and H.U.D.'s early efforts at reform, he said he found deterioration everywhere, from an unresponsive maintenance system to crumbling interiors to grounds littered with glass and garbage.
"The tenants hated the management, and management despised the tenants," he said in an interview. "It was a bunker mentality."
Bookkeeping was so shoddy, he said, unpaid rents from before 1992 were forgiven.
Mrs. Carrington, 55, one of the forces behind the lawsuit and now president of the Bennett Homes Tenant Council, said the deterioration began in earnest in the 1970's when the community was hit by a rising incidence of drug use, teenaged pregnancies and unemployment. Almost any night, she said, drug dealers roamed dark passageways between rows of units, and gunshots were common.
One claimed the life of her daughter, Carla, 17, just days before she was to leave for college in Ohio. Caught by a stray bullet when a fight broke out among young men leaving a playground basketball game, the honors student at Chester High School was killed -- eight years ago this Saturday.
"I had never been afraid here before that," Mrs. Carrington said. "They were drug dealers, kids that just didn't have anything to do with their lives, kids just fussing over one another over who owns which territory."
Today, the rehabilitated units, paid for by $22.8 million in Federal housing grants, stand in gleaming contrast to those still waiting for repair. The new town homes have new peaked roofs, brightly colored entrances, remodeled kitchens and modernized radiator systems. Outside, children's play areas, trees and landscaped lawns have replaced the desolation and debris.
"When I first came here," Judge Shapiro said, "I saw no children playing outside. They were all inside, in darkened units, some watching TV, some just staring out."
Mrs. Carrington said her only concern now is that residents will appreciate what they have and what others have done for them. "We've gotten everything we were entitled to," she said. "But now we have to be responsible for ourselves. People need to see what they have here and make sure it stays that way."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Show a Bit of an Upturn

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Steep price increases for food and vacation lodging helped drive up the Consumer Price Index three-tenths of 1 percent in July, lifting inflation for the last 12 months to 3 percent, Labor Department figures showed today.
The rise, which was somewhat more brisk than generally expected, unnerved the bond market, pushing interest rates higher, just a week before the Federal Reserve's next scheduled policy meeting. Stocks slumped, steadied, then eroded further to finish with a loss of 57.70 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 At the retail counters last month, price-conscious shoppers increased their spending by a scant one-tenth of 1 percent, well short of what would have been needed to offset a June decline now figured at five-tenths of 1 percent. The June drop was more than twice as deep as the initial estimate.
Neither report, analysts said, fundamentally alters the economic outlook, but it is becoming increasingly clear that economic activity has slowed this summer, although perhaps less than some had come to believe.
And while it is still thought possible that the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates next week, few were counseling or predicting this.
"The market was kind of spooked by the C.P.I.," said Kathleen M. Camilli, research director at Tucker Anthony. "But there's no strong rationale for changing monetary policy."
Specialists took comfort today in the likelihood that food prices would not keep rising so rapidly and in the near certainty that the inflation in hotel prices, perhaps augmented by difficulties in seasonal adjustment, would soon subside.
"The inflation environment remains very tranquil," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at HSBC Markets in New York.
And shoppers have not been enthusiastic of late, even though they spent enough on groceries and other nondurables to generate a rise in that category of four-tenths of 1 percent in July, enough to offset a decline of that amount in purchases of cars and other durable goods.
Nondurables accounted for 59.4 percent of the $204.69 billion that shoppers spent at retail last month.
After allowing for the downward revision for June, the Commerce Department's sales report was "extremely weak," said Susan M. Sterne, president of Economic Analysis Associates in Greenwich, Conn., which specializes in consumer trends. Much of the sales increase, moreover, such as that for groceries, reflected higher prices.
Unit sales -- obtained by applying a price deflator to the department's data: that is, the official figures adjusted for seasonal and holiday variations but not for inflation -- have declined every month so far this year except for February and May, Ms. Sterne said.
A sizable part of the rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in consumer prices, which followed a one-tenth of 1 percent increase in June, resulted from a jump in the cost of shelter, a sector that accounts for 28 percent of the index. This included a 2.3 percent rise in the cost of out-of-town lodging, reflecting increases at beach resorts on the East Coast and in Las Vegas, Nev. It appeared that any effect from the Olympic Games in Atlanta was indirect.
Food prices climbed five-tenths of 1 percent, the second consecutive hefty increase, as dairy products, fresh vegetables and processed fruits and vegetables all rose substantially, while prices for fresh fruit declined.
Transportation prices declined for a second month as gasoline dropped 2.7 percent, airline fares eased 1.3 percent and used cars were lower, albeit slightly, for the fourth consecutive month.
Mr. Hunt said he closely watched the price of used cars because he found this a useful predictor of sales of new cars, which have slumped so far this month.
Medical care, once one of the chief sources of upward pressure on the price index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the fifth consecutive month, the report also showed.
The so-called core index -- the 77 percent of the index that excludes the wide-swinging food and energy components -- also rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July. This was the fastest since March, but an analysis from Merrill Lynch noted that the 2.7 percent rise in the core index over the latest 12 months was still the most benign in 30 years.
As for last month's slight rise in retail sales, merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes registered 1.6 percent less revenue, while auto dealers saw receipts fall six-tenths of 1 percent.
Those selling furniture and other household equipment posted a tiny decline that rounded to zero.
For nondurables, spending rose 1.1 percent at drugstores, eight-tenths of 1 percent at food stores and one-tenth of 1 percent at department stores and other outlets selling general merchandise.
However, consumers cut clothing purchases by 1.6 percent and spent six-tenths of 1 percent less at gasoline service stations. Spending was unchanged from June at restaurants and bars.
With its C.P.I. results in hand, the Labor Department calculated that real average weekly earnings dropped 1.5 percent last month after a hefty 2.2 percent June surge.
Average weekly hours fell sharply while hourly earnings were down modestly.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Dell Earnings Up 58% in New Sign of Vigor In PC Market

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
In the latest indication of new strength in the personal computer market, the Dell Computer Corporation reported a 58 percent increase in earnings for its second fiscal quarter late yesterday, far exceeding Wall Street expectations,
Dell, whose earnings report sent its stock price up sharply in after-hours trading, attributed the strong profit to sales growth that exceeded the industry average, and to a steep decline in computer chip prices. 
 Analysts said that while Dell was taking market share from some of the industry's weakened players, like AST Research and Apple Computer, its growth was also an indicator that the much discussed slump in personal computer sales might be more perceived than real.
For computer makers that can survive in a highly competitive environment, a cycle appears to have begun in which users -- particularly corporate customers -- are replacing their PC's with more powerful models to take advantage of the Intel Corporation's Pentium Pro microprocessor and the Windows NT software of Microsoft.
Dell's surprisingly strong earnings report comes after recent positive results from Gateway 2000, which like Dell takes orders directly from customers and ships the machines without a retail middleman. And even in the retail portion of the PC market, the computer superstore chain CompUSA recently reported strong quarterly results indicating that the trend toward more powerful PC's was being driven by experienced buyers, not novices, said Seymour Merrin, an industry consultant in Mountain View, Calif.
"People are trying to buy performance at a price, not just the lowest price but the best buy on a specific configuration," Mr. Merrin said.
Dell reported its results after the close of the market. In the regular Nasdaq trading session, Dell shares had closed at $56.625, down 62.5 cents. But traders said the stock climbed $2.375 after hours.
For the quarter that ended on July 28, Dell had earnings of $103 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with $65 million, or 66 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. The consensus among Wall Street analysts, as compiled by First Call, had been for earnings of 86 cents a share.
Sales grew 40 percent, to $1.69 billion, from $1.21 billion in the second quarter of the 1996 fiscal year. Second-quarter 1997 earnings reflected a 10-cent charge in connection with the retirement of a portion of the company's senior debt.
Michael Dell, the chief executive, said in a telephone interview from corporate headquarters in Austin, Tex., that Dell's direct sales allowed the company to operate with much smaller inventories than PC makers that sell through retailers. Smaller inventories meant that Dell could much more rapidly take advantage of the nearly 50 percent drop in memory-chip prices in the first half of the year.
"Even though we've stayed very competitive, we saw huge reductions in our cost of materials," Mr. Dell said. "Combined with that, we continued to grow very rapidly, particularly in servers, with 115 percent growth year over year, and 57 percent sequentially. We're not seeing this weakness in the market that's been talked about."
Mr. Dell said the company had 35 percent sales growth in Europe over all, led by 60 percent growth in France and Germany, despite weak economies in those countries.
"In economic recession, the direct model is even stronger because companies are under pressure to cut costs but still need to buy PC's to boost productivity," he continued. "The whole Dell mission is to replace the reseller and slowly but surely we are doing that."
While the company's profit margin received an extraordinary boost from lower-priced chips, the sales growth reflected a healthy market, said Andrew Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. "I think unit demand is much stronger than people realize," Mr. Neff said.
Despite recent theories that computer sales would slow because more and more individual and corporate customers already had PC's -- the so-called installed base of customers -- Mr. Neff sees a seller's opportunity.
"The larger the installed base," he said, "the larger the base that has to be replaced every year."

HEADLINE: Executive Of Sanyo Is Kidnapped In Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The president of a Japanese electronics company has been kidnapped in Tijuana, and Mexican officials said today that the company had decided to negotiate with the abductors rather than call in the police. Executives of the company said it was preparing to pay a ransom.
The abduction of the 57-year-old executive, Mamoru Konno, president of the San Diego-based Sanyo Video Components, by armed men in Tijuana on Saturday evening set off alarms throughout the foreign business sector here. It has watched with growing apprehension as kidnappings have surged across Mexico in recent months. 
 Although 1,500 kidnappings were reported in the country last year, most were of Mexican executives and ranchers, and abductions of foreign executives have been "a rare thing," said Christopher T. Marquet, managing director of Kroll Associates, the New York security firm. "But we're getting many calls now from expatriate businessmen in Mexico because kidnapping is such a growing problem."
Mr. Konno was accosted by two gunmen as he walked to his car in the parking lot of a baseball field in Tijuana after a game played by a Sanyo company team.
"Eyewitnesses, who are company employees, said that two men forced Mr. Konno into a vehicle with California license plates and drove away," said a statement issued by Sanyo.
Witnesses told Sanyo executives that the abductors hit Mr. Konno during the kidnapping, in an area of mesquite and vegetable fields on the outskirts of the border city.
"A Sanyo employee has since received two phone calls from Mr. Konno, who on behalf of the kidnappers requested $2 million in ransom to insure his safety and his release," the Sanyo statement said.
At a news conference today at Sanyo Electric's headquarters in Osaka, executives said that the company was preparing to pay the ransom the kidnappers have demanded.
"Paying money in these kinds of cases in Mexico appears to be a major factor in resolving the cases," said Takaharu Yamada, a spokesman for the company. Mr. Yamada refused to confirm that the ransom had been set at $2 million.
Sanyo Video Components, which has its corporate headquarters in San Diego, operates a television parts factory in Tijuana, and executives routinely shuttle between the Mexican plant and the offices north of the border. Mr. Konno had lived with his wife for about 18 months in Chula Vista, Calif., located between San Diego and the border.
"All the employees to this point have felt very safe," Alan Foster, vice president of Sanyo North America, said. "We are now going to rethink that."
There were conflicting reports about how Mexican authorities were reacting.
Bernardo Cisneros Medina, a spokesman for the State Judicial Police of Baja California, the force with jurisdiction over the case, said in a phone interview from Tijuana that neither Sanyo nor Mr. Konno's relatives have reported the abduction to the police. As a result, Mr. Cisneros said, Mexican police have not begun any investigation of the crime, at least officially.
But a senior Mexican official, speaking in Mexico City, said Mr. Cisneros's comments should be understood in the context of requests, lodged by diplomats at the Japanese Embassy in Mexico City with the Mexican Government, to handle the case with extreme discretion to protect the executive's life.
The Mexican television news program 24 Hours reported today that a State Judicial Police anti-kidnapping squad had arrived in Tijuana to take charge of the case.
One of Mexico's most high-profile kidnappings came in 1994, when relatives of Alfredo Harp Helu, chairman of one of the country's largest banking groups, paid an estimated $30 million ransom for his release. Various groups that monitor kidnapping trends in Mexico have reported a worsening crisis in the years since, partly because the near-collapse of the economy 20 months ago has left millions unemployed, including many former police officers.
Mexico's 1,500 abductions last year far surpassed the 1,000 reported in Brazil, a country nearly twice as large, and which has experienced its own kidnapping epidemic. In Latin America only Colombia reported more kidnappings last year than Mexico: more than 3,000.
The abductions in Mexico have appeared to be most common in the capital and in two states immediately to the south, Morelos and Guerrero, where wealthy families from the capital frequently vacation. Graco Ramirez, a federal congressman and director of a group that monitors violent crime, reported that over the last two years Morelos has suffered 184 kidnappings, nearly two per week.

DATELINE: BUJUMBURA, Burundi, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Burundi, feeling the pressure of sanctions imposed by other African countries because of the overthrow of a democratically elected Government, imposed stringent gasoline rationing today as anxious foreigners and Burundians left on the last commercial flights out.
Lines formed at Bujumbura's main football stadium for ration cards, but the general mood on the streets of Bujumbura, the capital, was calm, with only a few gasoline stations already closed because of shortages. 
 The Government-run radio said rationing was necessary to save stocks while efforts were made to reverse the economic blockade by neighboring states angered by a military coup on July 25.
Gasoline in the country, which is landlocked, was restricted to four gallons a month for cars, 8.8 gallons for taxis, 44 gallons for buses and 88 gallons for trucks.
Western diplomats said the Government barred some Burundians from leaving on the last two commercial flights out of the country today.
The rush for tickets on the two Sabena airlines planes to Brussels, which together can take more than 400 people, was increased by people transferring tickets from an Air France flight that had been canceled.
Burundi has been cut off from its surrounding nations since Friday by the sanctions, intended to force a return to civilian rule. The sanctions were imposed because of fears of genocide on a scale similar to that in Rwanda in 1994, when an estimated half million ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed by troops of the former Hutu-led Government or allied militias.
More than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi in three years of massacres and war between the minority Tutsi and the Hutu, who make up 85 percent of the country's 5.6 million people. In the coup, the Hutu President, who was not trusted by the Tutsi-led military, was overthrown by a former leader, Maj. Pierre Buyoya.
Diplomats said only six Burundians received official permission to leave on the flights today, including the wife of a Hutu president assassinated in 1994 and the wife and sister of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who was deposed by the army on July 25.
They said they expected about 15 Burundians, including members of Parliament from a Hutu party suspended after the coup and members of Mr. Ntibantunganya's intelligence service, who had already brought tickets, to be prevented from boarding the Belgian flights.
The diplomats said others had also been barred from taking the flights.
Mr. Ntibantunganya has been in the American Ambassador's residence since shortly before the coup. American officials said Major Buyoya has barred him from leaving Burundi.
Belgium, France and the United States told their nationals whose work is not vital to leave Burundi on the flights and the United Nations also wants to pull out all non-essential staff.
Burundi radio called for sacrifices "to fight this war against our nation" and added: "Sanctions will not discourage us. To the contrary they will only strengthen our solidarity."
Aid workers said that they had unconfirmed reports from Hutu of massacres by troops in the central province of Gitega since July 25 and that the army had moved to clear ethnic Hutu from an area where Hutu rebels have been active. There was no independent confirmation available from Gitega.

Prices Rose 0.3 Percent In July, Above Estimates
The Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, lifting the pace of price increases over the last 12 months to 3 percent, the Labor Department reported. The increase, which was somewhat brisker than expected, was driven by increases for food and vacation lodging.
Consumers meanwhile increased their spending at retail counters a scant one-tenth of 1 percent for the month, following a revised June decline of five-tenths of 1 percent. Neither report, analysts said, fundamentally altered the economic outlook. The core C.P.I., which does not include food and energy, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent. [Page D2.]
 
The price report spooked the bond market, which had a sharp selloff. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.78 percent, from 6.69 percent on Monday. [D16.]
 
Internet Population Begins to Age
The population of cyberspace appears to be getting older, less upscale and less educated, based on a new study that tries to discern the size and habits of the Internet user population in North America. The study, a follow-up to one last year, concluded that 22 percent to 24 percent of people age 16 and older in the United States and Canada "had access" to the Internet in March, as against 17 percent in August 1995. [D2.]
 
Group to Buy Seven TV Stations
A closely held partnership will buy seven television stations owned by Aflac, the insurance company, for $485 million. The buyers, three men in a partnership called Raycom Media, want to build a television broadcasting mini-empire. [D4.]
 
TCI Loss Widens in Second Quarter
Tele-Communications Inc. said its second-quarter loss nearly doubled because of higher costs to refinance debt and losses from investments in other cable companies, but cash flow improved. The owner of the Liberty Media Group and TCI Communications Inc. reported a loss of $184 million versus a loss of $95 million last year. [D5.]
 
Wal-Mart Profits Rise 11.5 Percent
Wal-Mart earnings rose 11.5 percent, to $706 million, in the company's second quarter as sales grew by 12.3 percent. Earnings per share rose to 31 cents, from 28 cents a year earlier, when Wal-Mart earned $633 million. [D4.]
 
A Closer Look at Retirement Care
Retirement Care Associates' stock has climbed 25 percent since Aug. 1, but prospective buyers might be wise to look closely at the company. Market Place. [D6.]
 
From Calvin Klein, A New Fragrance
CK Be, Calvin Klein's follow-up fragrance line to CK One, is being introduced with an elaborate campaign that is quintessentially Klein in its emphasis on youthful sexuality portrayed through unconventional imagery, as well as innovative novelties to encourage sampling, like scented wristbands and Ticketmaster ticket envelopes. The print and television campaign is the creation of Klein's in-house agency, CRK Advertising.
Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]
 
Seeking More Than a Hamburger
For years, serious investors rarely put their money in high-quality restaurants, instead betting on fast-food chains. But as the baby- boom generation ages and seeks nicer places to eat, investors are paying attention. [C3.]
 
3d-Quarter Profits Strong at Deere
Profits at Deere & Company rose 13.3 percent in the third quarter, bolstered by strong demand for agriculture equipment. The company earned $204.4 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $180.1 million, or 69 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. [D4.]

HEADLINE: Germans Back on U.S. Base, Now as Tenants

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ALAMOGORDO, N.M., Aug. 6

 BODY:
If the 300 German prisoners of war interned here half a century ago could have attended a military ceremony held here last May, they would have stared as if looking at a desert mirage.
"This is a great day for the Luftwaffe, for Alamogordo, and for our two countries," Germany's Defense Minister, Volker Ruhe, proclaimed as honor guards marched German and American flags past a row of Tornado ground attack jets, each marked with the Iron Cross of Germany's Air Force. With that, the German Air Force Tactical Training Center opened for business at Holloman Air Force Base. 
 In the ebb and flow of great power relations, a small milestone is quietly being etched in this dry, baking-hot expanse of cactus and sagebrush in south-central New Mexico: the training center is the first military facility in the United States leased by a foreign government.
To locals, it is simply "the German base." After investing $42 million in hangars and jet repair shops, Germany has moved here with 12 Tornado jets, 300 German Air Force men and 340 family members. Under a three-year expansion plan, the Germans want to invest another $125 million -- for maintenance hangars, a flight simulator, a jet engine shop, dormitories and fuel and munitions warehouses -- so they can increase their Tornado and Phantom F-4E training wing here to 50 planes and to increase the number of servicemen and dependents to 2,100.The German Government is paying the Pentagon about $22 million a year to use its corner of the base.
For the German military, New Mexico offers some of the best training conditions in the world: relentlessly sunny skies and plenty of desert for jet pilots to practice 500-mile-an-hour bombing runs 100 feet off the ground. Where Germans have trained in Germany and Britain, military pilots are now largely barred from flying below 1,000 feet, a restriction imposed after the Berlin Wall fell and residents' complaints increased.
Without Germany's rain, fog, snow or altitude restrictions, training in New Mexico allows the Luftwaffe to shave six months off a standard 2-year basic course for Tornado pilots. Now, another NATO power, which officials refuse to identify, is considering leasing space to train pilots here.
New Mexico is only slightly smaller than Germany. But, with only 1.7 million people, it has one-fiftieth Germany's population. Germany has a 40-year tradition of sending military pilots to United States bases for training. Currently, the nation buys about $200 million worth of American weapons a year.
As what is called "supersonic overland airspace" becomes an internationally marketable commodity, some Americans are feeling queasy.
"Until Wednesday, 1 May 1996, there was no foreign military base on our shores -- not since the British were ejected in 1814!" James (Bo) Gritz, a retired Green Beret colonel and an informal leader of the far-right paramilitary movement, wrote recently in his newsletter, Center for Action. Echoing ultranationalist comments that ricocheted through right-wing talk shows and shortwave radio programs in May, he wrote: "Hitler would be proud!"
With Internet headings like "German troops (Hessians) on our soil," the far-right furor grew so strong that about 60 members of Congress called the Air Force in May to ask about the expansion plans.
On Monday night, at a public hearing here on the German expansion plan, Bill Hornback, a ponytailed United States Air Force retiree, grumbled, "We go out and kick their tails two times -- and now they come here and call us 'hosts.' "
Ranchers complained about joy-riding pilots buzzing their sheep and cattle. But a vigorous defense of the Germans came from Richard Zierlein, chairman of the Otero County Commission. In a time of defense cuts, he said, the German Air Force's 10-year lease helps guarantee Holloman's future. It also pumps an estimated $10 million a year into the economy of a county with only 58,000 people.
"We've got the Stealths here, but they can pick up and fly away anywhere anytime," Mr. Zierlein said of Holloman, which is the home base for the United States's only unit of radar-evading Stealth bombers and for American training jets. "You can't do that with a German base."
Germany's buildup here coincides with a radical reduction in the number of American soldiers in Europe. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has cut the number of American military personnel in Europe to 100,000 from 300,000.
In Germany, the United States has closed four of its six air bases. By the end of the decade, if current plans are carried out, the United States will have roughly the same number of combat planes in Germany as Germany will have in New Mexico.
But Pentagon officials caution that while the numbers may converge, the missions radically diverge.
"We clearly have provided a line of defense to Germany that Germany is not providing by being in the United States," Kenneth Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, said after attending the opening ceremony here with the Secretary of Defense, William J. Perry. "In that way, it's not exactly reciprocal. They're not defending us by being in the United States." In addition, Germany contributes toward the cost of keeping American troops there.
The German presence here, American military officers say, underscores the idea that the modern relationship between the Western world's two most powerful economies is one of allies.
"It serves as a symbol to the German people that this is not a one-way street," said Brig. Gen. Bruce Carlson, base commander at Holloman. "We have not been over there for 50 years running through their streets and woods as conquerors. We are allies."
Pentagon officials note that the German "tenants" account for fewer than 5 percent of the daily sorties from Holloman. The American base commander said he was at the top of the chain of command at the base, adding, "Flying operations are all under my control -- they fly by my rules."
Joint operations and other cooperative efforts appear to be the way of the future, said Lieut. Col. Donald L. Hargarten, the American officer who oversees the German project here. "German pilots are flying in Bosnia," he said. "If they weren't there, it would be our guys."
The German military personnel at Holloman seem happily oblivious to those who object to their presence. They are enjoying one of their nation's balmiest overseas posts in more than four decades.
"It's a goody," Col. Eckhard Sowada, the flight-suited German commander, said from his office in a beige base building marked simply: German Air Force.
German soldiers get a 50 percent pay bonus for service overseas. Here, a spacious house with a pool and garden can be rented for $1,200 a month, far less than in Germany. At local supermarkets, the prices of bratwurst, knackwurst and Black Forest ham are about 25 percent less than at home.
Gasoline sells for a third the price in Germany. And, easing the culture shock for Germans who grew up driving on autobahns without speed limits, most Western states raised speed limits this summer to 75 miles an hour on rural interstates.
"Around the halls, I hear, 'Last weekend, I was in Vegas,' 'I was in L.A.' Another got his speeding ticket in Phoenix," said Colonel Sowada, whose business card shows a Tornado roaring over cactus. He kept up his tan all winter, skiing in the nearby Sacramento Mountains.
Sgt. Mike Sprengard, a spokesman for the German unit, watched a brace of Luftwaffe Tornadoes scrape noisily today across the half-dome desert sky and said: "New Mexico is great for Germans. I have been everywhere with my family -- Santa Fe, Taos, Carlsbad Caverns."
This is not the first time that German soldiers have fallen in love with New Mexico.
In the final months of World War II, 17 camps in New Mexico, including one at Alamogordo Army Air Field, held nearly 5,000 German prisoners of war, many of them sunburned veterans of the Afrika Korps. Although many of the 370,000 German prisoners held nationwide wanted to stay at the end of the war, virtually all were repatriated.
The only prisoner to escape without recapture was Georg Gaertner. In September 1945, he slipped away from a camp at Deming, N.M. In 1985, Mr. Gaertner, who had permanent-resident status here, finally surrendered to American authorities.
Today, Holloman's Family Support Center is easing the crosscultural adjustments for the 200 German military families here, much as base centers helped millions of American military families settle into West Germany in past decades.
Guides speaking German help Germans with such mysteries as using the swamp coolers that air-condition homes, cooking at near-zero humidity and at an altitude of 4,200 feet and dealing with local creatures like klapperschlangen (rattlesnakes) and the dreaded desert skorpion.
Reflecting this military town's largely warm welcome for the Germans, far more American families than were needed signed up to mentor new German families. Video stores are ordering German-language movies, and one store is stocking California Staats-Zeitung, a German-language weekly newspaper based in Los Angeles.
Next month, a German primary school will open. This fall, the base commissary is to double the size of its "German section" -- currently 310 European food items displayed below black, red and gold bunting, the colors of Germany's flag.
"People are very friendly here," Staff Sgt. Joerg Heinen, a 23-year-old ejection-seat technician, said as he paused by a shelf stocked with Bavarian sponge cake. "I hope I can spend more time here."
He is not alone. Five Germans applied for each position available in New Mexico, Colonel Sowada said. After a few months, two-thirds of the Germans here have asked to extend their tours to four and a half years from three years.
"They say they are doing it for the nation," he said, rolling his eyes skyward in mock disbelief.

HEADLINE: In Bosnia, a Prelude to Partition

BYLINE: By David Rieff; David Rieff is the author of "Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West."

 BODY:
Amonth before the Sept. 14 elections in Bosnia, the conventional wisdom among international officials and diplomats charged with overseeing the postwar settlement is that if the voting goes smoothly, a corner will have been turned and the chances of a durable peace vastly increased. If anything, the reverse is likelier to be the case.
Having returned from Bosnia last week, I am more convinced than ever that the elections will be followed by a speeding up of the partition already taking place on the ground -- and possibly, after the NATO Implementation Force leaves, by renewed war, probably between the Croats and Bosnian Government forces in central Bosnia and western Herzegovina. 
 The great accomplishment of the Dayton accord is that there is no longer a war. Its great flaw was the assumption that the warring sides had signed onto the terms voluntarily and were sincere about carrying them out.
When the NATO Implementation Force's first commander, Adm. Leighton Smith, left Sarajevo a few weeks ago, he insisted that the military provisions of the Dayton accords had been carried out successfully, but added that he was disappointed by the Bosnians' failure to take steps to further political reconciliation.
But the point, as Admiral Smith and his political masters in Washington surely know, is that none of the belligerents take seriously the weak unitary Bosnian state envisaged by the Dayton agreement. It is the nationalist Serb, Muslim and Croat parties that are likely to win overwhelmingly in their respective areas when the elections take place. And their lack of commitment to pluralism and comity is revealed by the absence on their lists of any candidates who are not members of the dominant group the party in question claims to represent.
We saw this triumph of ethnic politics in the last elections before the war started. During the fighting, the Bosnian Government side was made up of a coalition that included not only Muslim nationalists but democrats as well, Muslim and non-Muslim. The postwar period is witnessing once more the same self-destructive politics that ushered in the war in the first place.
Only this time it is being played out in a ruined Bosnia that is economically wholly dependent on aid from foreign donors and has been drained of a great proportion of its ablest citizens, by emigration, death, injury or mental disorder, a huge and underreported problem. Doctors in Sarajevo are panic-stricken by rising levels of alcoholism and psychotic disorders among veterans and others.
The superficial signs of recovery in Sarajevo -- the newly vibrant street life, the proliferation of cafes and the many new shops -- represent a false dawn, however much they may seduce visitors who remain in the capital for only a short time.
What has actually occurred since the Dayton pact is that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government has shown itself incapable of or uninterested in taking responsibility for its own citizens. Only sectors that are immediately profitable are flourishing. The results are catastrophic. Boutiques are full, but pharmacies are bare; hotels are being refurbished, but the University of Sarajevo is still in ruins. You can watch CNN in cafes, but most people's windows are still covered by the plastic provided during the war by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Both critics and supporters of the Government say that Sarajevo's authorities are counting on international donors to take up the slack. That's what happened during the war. But such largess is unlikely to continue indefinitely. There will be more aid, and already there is some road reconstruction and other large projects.
But the Bosnians are counting on much more. When they describe the help they need, it is clear they have in mind a kind of Marshall Plan that would subsidize the rebuilding of Bosnia's industrial base and provide money and technical assistance for rebuilding the shattered educational and social welfare systems.
At least some aid is flowing into Bosnian Government-controlled areas. On the Serb side, things are worse. So long as Radovan Karadzic's party is in control, most donors are reluctant to commit to projects outside the Croat-Muslim Federation territory.
The situation in western Herzegovina is even more dire. Croat-controlled areas take their orders from Zagreb, not Sarajevo, and are largely run by mafias that made fortunes in the war.
In Mostar, the 11th-hour settlement between Croats and Muslims that allowed the European Union officials administering the city to save face is a fraud. Though the Muslim-dominated Party for Democratic Action won the municipal elections, a Croat extremist will likely occupy the Mayor's office. And the European Union negotiators also accepted the Croat side's entirely specious challenge to the election results. As a result, it is doubtful whether the town council will ever be convened.
Instead, most observers on the ground believe that, after the September general elections, the Croats will demand union with Croatia proper. The Serb nationalists in the so-called Republika Srpska would likewise want to join Yugoslavia. That would either seal the partition of Bosnia or provoke another war.
In the face of all this, Western officials continue to speak in the most sanguine terms, as if the only task were to insure that the vote goes forward without too many irregularities. In reality, there is no reason why the nationalist parties should sabotage this voting. It suits their interests. For once the elections are over, they believe, the world's interest will wane and the partition of Bosnia they have been working for all along can resume away from the view of meddling outsiders.
The only hope for preserving a Bosnia in which pluralism can thrive is precisely that kind of outside interference, particularly on the part of the United States, which imposed the Dayton agreements. Bosnia will not become democratic unless the international community makes it clear that any other outcome will invite the most severe sanctions. But election years -- ours, not Bosnia's -- are times when unpleasant problems tend to be swept under the rug, not moments when the political elite, in America or anywhere else, volunteers to take on new responsibilities.

HEADLINE: What Productivity Gap?

BYLINE: By Norbert Walter; Norbert Walter is the chief economist of the Deutsche Bank Group.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Sometimes it is very hard for the rest of the world to understand why the United States is so down on itself. One of the clearest examples of this malaise is the fretting over its supposedly weak productivity growth.
Whatever the merits of Bob Dole's supply-side economic plan, he has succeeded in making productivity a central issue in the Presidential campaign. But much of the debate on the economy is really beside the point, because the key assumption -- that productivity growth is low -- is false. Compared with their counterparts in the rest of the world, American workers perform at least as well. 
 Increasing productivity -- measured by dividing a country's economic output by the number of workers -- is rightfully seen as the surest road to prosperity and higher wages. Some economists and public officials say it is an outright calamity that average American productivity growth -- the annual increase in productivity -- has declined from 2.7 percent in the 1960's to about 1 percent since the beginning of the 1980's. These figures are supposedly making Americans feel as if they are running in place.
The doomsayers point to the performance of America's major competitors. Much has been made of the fact that Germany's productivity increased by 3.6 percent in 1994 and 2.2 percent in 1993, while Japan had an annual productivity growth rate of 2.3 percent between 1979 and 1994. (It is rarely mentioned that annual productivity growth in both Europe and Japan has slipped to about 1.5 percent over the last 18 months.)
Why, then, are the Japanese and Europeans more than a little envious of the United States? To begin with, one needs to be careful not to confuse productivity growth with the overall level of productivity. Productivity growth only tells us about progress made from one year to the next. It says nothing about the starting level.
On this critical issue, American companies and workers are far more productive than those of either Japan or Germany, according to a solid body of economic and management studies. A June report by the McKinsey Global Institute, the Washington research arm of the McKinsey consulting company, found that Japanese workers were only 53 percent as productive as Americans while Germans, whose wages are on average much higher than Americans', were 90 percent as productive.
So the United States is not falling behind. Given that American workers operate at a much more productive level than those in Germany and Japan, even increases of "only" 1 percent mean that America is performing just as well as other economies with 1.5 percent productivity growth -- about what Japan and Western Europe are experiencing now.
While the United States may no longer be pulling away from its competitors, it is certainly maintaining its lead. After all, once a country is so far out on top, it is extremely difficult for it to increase productivity by leaps and bounds. Not even America can expect to squeeze blood from a stone.
The remarkable thing is that the United States has maintained its productivity with an unemployment rate of about 5 percent -- as compared with Western Europe's jobless rate of about 11 percent. Because productivity is the output of an economy divided by the number of workers, the fewer workers used to produce that output, the more "productive" the economy.
What if the United States had 11 percent unemployment? If with the simple stroke of an economist's pen we removed 6 percent of American workers from the equation, United States productivity growth would be approximately 1.5 percent, about the current rate for Western Europe.
European employers have been very accommodating in keeping wages high, but it means they can afford to hire fewer -- and therefore more productive -- workers. One out of every nine European workers is out of a job. If the United States were to increase wages to rates similar to Europe's, about 7.7 million more Americans would have to be unemployed, to keep labor costs under control. Who is willing to pay that steep a price to raise worker productivity?
These numbers should bring home a clear message to Americans: the United States has made the overall level of employment the top priority without really sacrificing much in terms of productivity.
Ultimately, it is much harder for a society to deal with a large number of people out of work and without prospects than to have lots of people feeling that they should earn more. To be sure, tight wages are an unpleasant reminder of growing competition around the globe.
But Americans would do well to realize that Europe and Japan can only wish that they had America's problems.

HEADLINE: Turkey's Troubling Deal With Iran

 BODY:
When Turkey's new Islamic-led Government came to power last month, the Clinton Administration anticipated no sharp shifts in Ankara's generally pro-American foreign policies. Washington reasonably expected that Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's dependence on a secular coalition partner and his reluctance to offend Turkey's military commanders would keep relations between the two NATO allies on course.
Those expectations must now be re-examined. The $23 billion gas pipeline cooperation agreement that Mr. Erbakan signed with Iran this week directly challenges one of the Clinton Administration's central foreign policy goals. 
 Washington wants to isolate Iran as a dangerous rogue state that sponsors international terrorism and seeks nuclear weapons. President Clinton last week signed into law a bill to impose sanctions on any country making new investments in Iran's energy infrastructure. The Turkish deal represents just such an investment. It is also the largest energy export deal Iran has ever made.
For Washington to use legislation to impose secondary boycotts, as the sanctions law does, is unwise and will cause friction with America's allies in Europe and elsewhere. But the underlying policy of discouraging international economic support for the Teheran regime is sound.
The Administration has not yet decided whether the Turkish deal formally violates the new sanctions law. Turkey contends, implausibly, that only trade, not investment, is involved. Yet it also talks about arranging barter deals to help Iran build its section of the proposed gas pipeline. American pressure may make international lenders so skittish about financing pipeline construction that the new conduit will never be built.
Mr. Erbakan ran for office last year promising to re-orient Turkish foreign policy in an Islamic direction, downplaying Ankara's ties with NATO and Israel and improving relations with Iran, Iraq and Syria. Since taking power, he has moderated his rhetoric. Even since signing the Iran deal he says he seeks no conflict with Washington.
But the symbolism of the huge deal, signed during a high-profile visit to Teheran and other Islamic capitals, speaks for itself. Turkey now seems set to embark on a more eastward-looking foreign policy. Neither the army nor Mr. Erbakan's secular coalition partners expressed any public objections to the Iran oil deal. A last-minute plea from the State Department not to proceed was ignored.
Turkey remains a democracy and an important American ally, located at the juncture of Eurasia and the Middle East. Washington should proceed carefully. Unnecessarily alienating Turkey's new Government would serve no American interest. Ankara need not follow Washington's lead on every foreign policy issue.
But the Administration needs to be frank in expressing its concerns over Turkey's warming ties with Iran. Mr. Erbakan should understand that he cannot provide political and economic support to the current regime in Teheran without ultimately damaging his relations with the United States.

HEADLINE: Shopping Mall Planned Near Meadowlands

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CARLSTADT, N.J., Aug. 13

 BODY:
A Virginia-based developer said today that it planned to build a huge shopping mall near the Meadowlands Sports Complex that would have as many as 18 anchor stores and restaurants along with 200 specialty shops.
The Mills Corporation said it was in the process of obtaining permits for the 592-acre site near the New Jersey Turnpike north of the Meadowlands and hoped to break ground on the 2.1-million-square-foot project next year, completing construction by 1999, said Susan Goyette, a spokeswoman for the company. 
 "It's a wonderful market," Ms. Goyette said. "The demographics are the best in the country. Within a 30-mile radius, you are looking at nearly 13.5 million people. The traffic for this location averages 200,000 vehicles daily."
The mall would generate more than $300 million a year in state sales taxes and would employ as many as 9,000 part- and full-time workers, Ms. Goyette said. She refused to discuss the cost of the project.
The company's chief executive, Laurence Siegel, said, "The Mills concept combines the shopping convenience of a regional mall, the value of a manufacturer's outlet center and the extended drawing strength of a major tourist attraction."
A plan has been developed to compensate for area wetlands. Approval must be sought from the Army Corps of Engineers. "We want to leave the area in a better state than what it is now," Ms. Goyette said.
The complex could be expanded to include 2.2 million square feet of office space, 50,000 square feet of restaurants, 150,000 square feet of light industrial space and 1,000 hotel rooms, she said.
"The characteristics of the New Jersey-New York area provide us with the opportunity to develop a truly unique project," Mr. Siegel said. "We are convinced that this newest Mills will be one of a kind."
Ms. Goyette said that the company has a tradition of working with communities before, during and after construction and was not worried about potential criticism of the project.
Mayor William Roseman praised the plan, which the company said would create 2,500 construction jobs.
"Through creation of jobs and the generation of millions of dollars in tax proceeds, this development will be a valuable contributor to the economy of not only Carlstadt but to the entire state of New Jersey," the Mayor said.
The proposed project comes three months after the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority announced that it would spend $265 million to add theaters, shops and indoor mountain climbing at the complex.
Officials said the entertainment pavilion, which is scheduled to be completed within four years, would bring an additional 6.5 million people a year to the East Rutherford complex and generate annual sales of more than $350 million.
"It's a very different type of thing," said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the sports authority. "The master plan proposed for the sports complex really focuses on an entertainment pavilion and is not meant to be anything like a traditional mall."
The Mills Corporation, which is based in Arlington, Va., owns and operates malls in Washington, Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Chicago, and is building facilities in Los Angeles, Dallas and Tempe, Ariz.
The co-developer, Empire Ltd., has owned the New Jersey property since the mid-1950s.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE DELEGATES;
Dole Tells New Yorkers the Ticket Is Just 2 Guys from Brooklyn and Buffalo

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Jack Kemp, the party's pick for Vice President and longtime Buffalo celebrity -- he represented the city both as a Congressman and a quarterback for the Bills -- was the scheduled speaker this morning at a meeting of New York's convention delegation.
But not long after everyone had packed into the ballroom of the Hotel Del Coronado, it was announced that a "surprise speaker" would also attend. It turned out to be the other half of the ticket, Bob Dole. 
 New York, with its 33 electoral votes, has always been a priority for both parties. But that both men would make the New York stop such a priority underscores the freshening hopes of party officials that Mr. Kemp's presence on the ticket might finally give Republicans a chance in a state that more often goes Democratic in national elections.
"We're coming to New York right away," Mr. Kemp promised.
The delegates and others who gathered inside the hotel's Crown Room, with its wooden, crown-shaped chandeliers, responded like football fans on opening day, as Mr. Kemp referred to his glory days with the Bills.
"I retired in 1970, but my friends from Buffalo think that I quit playing in 1965," Mr. Kemp quipped.
Even Mr. Dole, who was introduced to the crowd by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, made an effort to lay a claim to the state.
"Remember, I attended Brooklyn College," Mr. Dole said, referring to a brief time he spent at the institution before World War II. "You've got Brooklyn and Buffalo here. Not bad. A New York ticket."
Personal ties notwithstanding, New York will once again present a challenge for the national Republican ticket. Over recent months, public opinion surveys of likely voters in New York have given President Clinton a substantial lead.
Recent history offers little solace for the Republicans. In 1992, George Bush got 34 percent of the votes in the state, compared with Bill Clinton's 50 percent. Four years earlier, Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, also took New York, even as Mr. Bush was rolling to a big victory elsewhere.
In an effort to win support in New York, Mr. Kemp is expected to rely on the help of political allies in the state's minority communities, the result in part of the active role he played over the years on behalf of inner-city redevelopment.
This morning, he talked about black New York natives who are now Republicans, like Gen. Colin L. Powell and Van Woods, a former Black Panther and operator of Sylvia's, a well-known family-run soul food restaurant in Harlem.
In a speech punctuated by cheers, Mr. Kemp drew the most sustained applause when he recalled General Powell's speech to the convention on Monday night and asked, "Weren't you proud to see an African-American stand up and say how proud he was to be a Republican?"
Mr. Kemp, who made his mark in the minority community when he was head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Bush Administration, displayed his own diverse talents when he responded, in Spanish, to a heckler who had challenged him, in Spanish.
"We are going to carry this message of inclusion, opportunity and progress to every single corner of this country," he said.
Mr. Dole chose to focus on his plan to cut taxes, the highlight of his recently released economic agenda, and one that he and his supporters have been going to great lengths to explain.
Clearly buoyed by the response that his tax plan and selection of Mr. Kemp as a running has received, Mr. Dole was as playful as he was serious. "I don't know what you had for breakfast," Mr. Dole said, as he tried to quiet the cheering crowd, "but Al must have overeaten."
But he went on to make Mr. D'Amato, who heads the powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee, two promises.
"We're going to give you more seats in the Senate," Mr. Dole said. And "one of our first stops will be in New York."

HEADLINE: Postcard from the Campaign;
The Future of Tolerance

BYLINE: By HOWELL RAINES 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
Shortly after addressing his fellow Republicans here, Colin Powell told NBC News that he did not want to be regarded as a "poster boy" for Republican tolerance. No one can blame him for that, but you have to assume, based on the political skill with which he managed his career, that Mr. Powell understands how great a gap there is between his nostalgic vision of the "party of Lincoln" and the modern party as defined by the delegates to this convention. The majority of these delegates have no intention of belonging to a party that believes what Mr. Powell believes about abortion, affirmative action and immigration. So in explaining his vision of Republicanism, Mr. Powell was defining a party that does not exist and that will never exist if the activist core of this convention has its way.
But as the tributes to Ronald Reagan should remind us, a party is shaped by personalities as well as by the zeal of its factions. Given the anxiety over how Bob Dole will perform in 1996, no one here wants to talk too loudly about 2000 or 2004. But you can bet that plenty of people -- including Jack Kemp, Patrick Buchanan and perhaps even the tirelessly coy Mr. Powell -- are looking down the road. Of course, if the Dole-Kemp ticket wins, the mantle of inevitability will settle on Mr. Kemp's shoulders. But if Mr. Dole loses, then the succession struggle and the future of the party are opened up in some fascinating ways. 
 Should Mr. Kemp inherit or win the leadership of the party in four or eight years, then its economic-theory faction will be ascendant. Figures like Mr. Kemp and Newt Gingrich are passionate about taxes and fiscal policy, and they are willing to indulge the social-agenda conservatives on abortion, school prayer, guns or any other issue that stirs their passions. By the way, you have to give Mr. Gingrich and Haley Barbour credit for keeping the rowdy little army of evangelicals and social-agenda conservatives under control here despite Mr. Buchanan's efforts at rabble-rousing.
But the price of peace was to let them write the platform, and Mr. Buchanan is being only slightly hyperbolic when he says that if the G.O.P. is judged by its platform, it is really "Pat Buchanan's party." Mr. Buchanan did not draw a very big crowd to his sore-loser rally in Escondido on Sunday, but he got what he needed in the form of sound bites to remind "my people" that they have a chance to dictate both the platform and the ticket in 2000. Indeed, Mr. Buchanan yearns so deeply for a Dole defeat that he can hardly bring himself to speak the man's name in public.
If the Kemp wing represents the party's intellect and Mr. Buchanan represents its id, then Mr. Powell represents a party whose personality is shaped by the polite inclinations of its grass-roots voters rather than the passions of its delegate factions. Within the next decade, the flexible G.O.P. envisioned by Mr. Powell and Northeastern moderates like William Weld and Rudolph Giuliani could probably be created in only one way. That would be for Mr. Powell to march through the primaries with such forceful, overarching personal appeal that he developed the clout to drag the party toward the center on social issues.
Such a revolution by personality is exactly what happened in 1980, although of course Mr. Reagan dragged the party in a different direction. The current reality is that the tolerance at this convention for Republican moderates like Mr. Powell is pretty shallow. Susan Molinari is being tolerated because she makes a good television picture and promised not to say she believes in the right of women to have legal abortions.
Mr. Powell could be a more serious force if he set out to rally Republican voters to take back the party from its convention zealots. But no one knows whether he was delivering a serious political speech the other night or just kind of thinking out loud. One thing is for sure. Fixing used Volvos is probably easier and more fun than trying to get Abe Lincoln re-admitted to Pat Buchanan's party. HOWELL RAINES

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Speech Delivered to the G.O.P. Delegates by Representative Molinari

BYLINE: Associated Press

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Following is the keynote address delivered tonight by Representative Susan Molinari of New York at the Republican National Convention:
Good evening, I'm Susan Molinari and I am proud to represent a Congressional district in New York, the home state of the next Vice President, Jack Kemp. 
 You know, as a matter of fact, last night, I called Jack for some advice on what I should say tonight. And he gave me a few suggestions. In fact, he's still giving them. I had to put him on hold just now so I could come out here and give this speech right now.
I'll get right back to you, Jack.
I was honored when Bob Dole asked me to give tonight's keynote speech, and I have some really good news for you. This speech is a lot like a Bill Clinton promise: It won't last long, and it'll sound like a Republican talking.
I don't know about you, but I think this is one of the greatest conventions of all time.
Colin Powell and Nancy Reagan made me so proud last night to be Republican and really proud to be an American.
I know all of us were moved by General Powell and Nancy Reagan, because both of them spoke to us from the heart, each of them in their own way. Tonight, I hope to do no less.
Tonight I, too, want to talk to you about the American dream because it seems to be slipping out of reach for too many of us. And I want to tell America how Bob Dole and Jack Kemp and the Republican Party can make that dream easier to achieve again.
You know, for the Molinari family, our American story began in 1904, when Guyatano and Marie Molinari bundled up their young son and left Italy in search of a dream. And they found it -- on 104th Street in Queens.
That's where my great-grandfather opened up his barber shop, and I like to think that the red, white and blue-striped pole spinning outside his storefront symbolized his American dream.
He passed on his passion for hard work, his faith in his family and his love of his adopted country to his small son, who passed it on to my father, who passed it on to me. And along the way, the American dream got a little bit bigger, and in just two generations, a seat in a Queens barber shop led to a seat in the United States Congress.
Guyatano Molinari lived a simple dream. It was the same dream shared by a generation: Find a job, marry your sweetheart, have children, buy a home and maybe start a business. And in the process, always provide a better life for your children.
When my husband, Bill, and I had Susan Ruby three months ago, we really began to understand these dreams. You begin to think less about how the world is and a lot more about the kind of world you're going to leave behind.
But, for many people my age, our dreams and our hopes, which are no different than those of our parents, but are becoming more difficult. Those dreams are becoming more difficult because today, they're under real pressure and they're worried.
They worry about their jobs and whether they'll still have them tomorrow. They wonder whether they can provide security for their parents as they grow old and opportunity for their children as they grow up. They worry about drugs and violence, and every morning, they hesitate at the kindergarten door, if only for a moment, to let go of that small hand clinging so tightly to theirs.
I don't know a mom today who isn't being stretched to her limit trying to hold down a job while trying to hold down the fort, too. How many times have we said to ourselves, There just aren't enough hours in the day. And the truth is, there aren't.
Well, Republicans can't promise you any more hours in a day, but we can help you spend more hours at home with your family.
We know people are having trouble just staying afloat, and it's easy to see why. Bill Clinton passed the largest tax increase in history, and now Americans pay almost 40 cents of every dollar they earn in taxes, the most ever. Every year Bill Clinton has been in office, taxes have been higher, and family incomes have been lower.
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have a better idea: an economic plan for every American who is working harder and taking home less.
The Dole-Kemp plan will give every man and woman in this country a 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut. It's good news. It's good news because it's a plan for all of us.
It's for a single mother with two kids in Detroit who is trying to pay her bills and pay for child care, too. She'll get $1,000 from the Republicans' child tax credit.
And it's a plan for a grandmother in St. Louis who was hit hard by Bill Clinton's tax increase on Social Security benefits. She's going to get to keep all the benefits she has earned and deserves.
And it's a plan for a young couple in Pittsburgh trying desperately to buy their first home. For them, it's going to mean lower interest rates and mortgage payments they can afford.
We can do better with Bob Dole and Jack Kemp. And that's what this convention and this election is all about. Clearly, clearly, the American people understand we simply can't go on like we have for the last four years. Something has got to give or people will just give up.
We say we can create real opportunity for everyone with a dream. We can do better.
Now under Bill Clinton, Medicare will be bankrupt in less than five years. But this President would rather play politics than muster the political courage to rescue it. Republicans will save Medicare and protect Social Security so people can stop worrying about their parents' and their grandparents' health and security. We must do better.
You know, we are a generous people. We are a generous people, but when a welfare system traps millions of children in poverty and dependency, common sense tells us that we need change for their sake. And I'm proud to say that because of Bob Dole and the common-sense Republican Congress, we've finally ended welfare as we know it.
And we've got to stop the explosion. We all know we've got to stop the explosion in drug use by our kids that we've seen over the last three years. We must elect a President this fall with a zero tolerance for drugs in our schools, our playgrounds and in our work places. This is a fight we cannot lose. We can do better. We can do better. We can elect Bob Dole.
Now, now, I got to know Bob Dole during my first term in Congress. He contacted me near immediately and asked me to work with him to stem the growing trend of crimes toward women and children. We worked closely to produce legislation that gave women and children strong new protections against sexual predators by closing loopholes that let rapists and child molesters go free. Very important.
But it seems we have always counted on Bob Dole to do what's right for all Americans, and he has never let us down.
Now, think about Bill Clinton. He promises one thing and does another. He hopes we will forget his broken promises. But I ask you, Have you forgotten that he promised a middle-class tax cut and then passed the largest tax increase in American history? I didn't think so.
Have you forgotten that Bill Clinton promised common-sense health care reform, only to impose a huge, Washington-run bureaucratic health care system on all of us?
And have you forgotten that Bill Clinton promised to balance the budget first in 5 years, then 10 then 7, then 9 -- only go on to veto the first balanced budget in 25 years?
Americans know that Bill Clinton's promises have the life span of a Big Mac on Air Force One.
Now while that little tag line might be funny, what's not funny is what Bill Clinton is doing to the promise of America.
Two hundred years ago, it was that promise of freedom that inspired the first generation of Americans to found a nation. A hundred years ago another generation bound up the wounds of a civil war and opened the West. Thirty years ago, this generation dreamed of the stars and set our foot upon the moon.
And like those Americans who came before us, we have the same opportunity for greatness. Our dreams can be just as big.
This November, we will elect the last President of this century and the first of the new millennium. We can change the direction of our country. It will be a new day for America, an age of dreams as big and as bold as any that have come before. And we, every one of us here and every American, we can be the new patriots and the pioneers, the dreamers and the doers. We can restore the American dream.
At the end of the day when I'm rocking my daughter, Susan Ruby, to sleep, I look down and I wonder what her life's going to be like. And I want the best for her. I want a country that's free from danger, a nation and a world where she is free to believe in greatness and achieve her fullest potential.
But she'll never know that life if we continue down the rudderless path we have been on for four long years. We have a choice. We can change the future for our children.
The unique American spirit that defied a king and challenged the continent and conquered space still beats in the heart of every one of us, but we must have a leader that shares our dreams.
So tonight, I leave you with one last wish I have for my child and all of our children.
I want my daughter's earliest memories of our nation's leader to be of a man who still dreams despite adversity. A man who dreams of peace because he's known the horrors of war. A man who dreams big because he knows what it's like to begin life with so little. A man who asks the best from each of us because he's never given America anything less of himself.
I want my daughter to have a future that still loves heroes, where character still matters and America's leaders can inspire us and comfort us with the courage of their vision. There's nothing sadder than to look into the eyes of a child without dreams and see nothing but the empty stare of lost hope. Well, that's not my America, and that's not Bob Dole's America either.
On the day my great-grandfather first opened the door to his small barber shop decades ago, his dreams made my dreams possible.
Each generation, by its actions, must open the door for the next. We must leave behind a legacy of hope and opportunity. So, this November, let us look deep into the eyes of our children and listen hard to that still, small voice that lies within each of us, for we must elect a President not just for this generation, but for generations to come.
We must choose the better man for a better America, and that man, we know, is Bob Dole.

Momentum Could Push Owners Into Agreement

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A week ago today, the baseball owners' labor policy committee authorized its chief negotiator to go to court if necessary to establish that the two sides had reached an impasse in their effort to get a new collective bargaining agreement. A whirlwind weekend of talks and progress dramatically altered that state, and seemingly left the owners with no alternative but to make a deal, like it or not.
No substantive negotiations were held yesterday. Management and union lawyers met late in the day on language issues, but Randy Levine, the owners' chief labor executive, and Donald Fehr, the union head, did not meet. The delay in bargaining stemmed from the view held by some owners on service time players lost during their 1994-95 strike and litigation that arose from the strike. 
 Those owners, whose number is undetermined, do not want to give the players credit for the service time, and they want the union to drop the two unfair-labor-practice charges and the 19 grievances that are pending. But the owners would be hard-pressed to block a deal that granted service because the swift, stunning progress negotiators made in 48 hours undermined management's legal strategy.
Under that strategy, barring a negotiated agreement, the owners planned to ask Judge Sonia Sotomayor of United States District Court in Manhattan to lift the injunction that forced management to restore the work rules from the expired agreement. Their lawyers planned to argue that negotiators had tried to reach agreement under cover of the injunction but had reached an impasse. If Sotomayor agreed and lifted the injunction, unilateral implementation of a new economic system could follow.
But no impasse is in sight now.
Several union-related people said yesterday that there was no question the owners had lost their ability to argue for an impasse. Most of the management-related labor lawyers who were sought for their views did not return calls.
One who did, requesting anonymity, said the owners still could get to impasse, but they would need time, perhaps a couple of months. He quickly added that they would be foolish to pursue that course when they could make a deal now.
Two former officials of the players union also suggested that the owners' real choice now is to negotiate an agreement.
"At this point in time, of course it would be difficult for them to show that an impasse exists," Marvin Miller, former head of the union, said. "No question about it. I don't know what might develop later, but if you petition the court today and the judge heard you early next week and you said we're at an impasse, she might say tell me about it, give me the details. They'd be stuck. They haven't ruined any possibility of having an impasse declared at some point in time in the future, but for the immediate future, yes."
Would the owners be able to show an impasse exists over the service issue, Miller was asked. "I don't think so," he said. "Any judge would look at that and say: 'Look at all the possibilities here. Look at where you were and where you've come. Look at the options -- call a mediator, consider compromise positions. Go do your work. Don't bother me.' "
Richard Moss, who was the union's general counsel under Miller, echoed that assessment.
"They obviously are moving and they've made a lot of progress," Moss said by telephone from California. "They can't say they've reached an impasse and nobody is budging. You can't negotiate and have movement on both sides of the table, then at some time say we're not going to go any further and declare an impasse. That's not the way it works."
Are the owners in a position where they have to make a deal?
"I think so," Moss said. "I don't fault Randy. He did what he had to do to get the players to come forward as far as they have. If he went a little beyond his authority, he produced a pretty good result and now the owners have to decide if they want it."
Another labor lawyer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the owners had "dramatically increased the difficulty of getting someone to believe they're at impasse."
"It sounds like they've got themselves in a position where the parties are on the brink of having a collective bargaining agreement," the lawyer said. "That obviously is the opposite of impasse. Could they in 12 hours create impasse? Anything is theoretically possible, but it's highly unlikely."
The lawyer said impasse does not necessarily have to exist on a wide variety of issues. "It is always conceivable in this world to reach an irreconcilable difference on one issue," he said. "But would an impasse exist on one issue after 10 days of intensive bargaining? You get to the point where it's too late to undo the positive things that have happened."
If the service and litigation issues were the only ones left unresolved, the union could thwart an attempt to establish impasse by offering to submit those issues to arbitration.
The lawyer suggested that Levine, trying to make a deal, might have deliberately positioned himself so that the majority of owners would understand "there is no way to turn back and certainly no reason to turn back." Levine needs 21 of the 28 clubs to approve an agreement.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE PROSPECTS -- Far From Victory;
A United, Feel-Good Party Meeting Does Not an Election Success Make

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
There comes a time at every convention when it helps to step back from the hullabaloo and recall some hard-learned truths about Presidential politics.
Now is that time here in Lotusland. The political skies suddenly look as cloudlessly blue as San Diego's to the assembled Republicans, who have taken heart from the surprise selection of Jack Kemp as Bob Dole's running mate, the film summoning the spirit of Ronald Reagan and the subsequent star turn by the former President's wife, Nancy, and the powerful speech of Colin L. Powell. 
 "Absolutely the best speech I've heard at a convention since Everett Dirksen waggled that bony finger at Tom Dewey in Chicago in 1952 and told him, 'We followed you before, and you took us down the path to defeat,' " said Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senator from Tennessee and former majority leader.
"Best start to a convention in my memory," said Mr. Dole himself to a small group of supporters.
Well, yes. But that does not necessarily change very much. It makes the party professionals feel better, it helps the fund-raisers raise funds. But the "convention bounce" is often transitory -- George Bush gained 14 points in the polls in 1992, and it was gone within a week -- and very seldom decisive.
"This is the blind date stage of the campaign," said a home-town sage, Professor Samuel L. Popkin of the political science faculty at the University of California at San Diego. "Someone tells you about a girl, but you haven't met her yet, haven't had a chance to check her out and see if he's leveling."
The Democrats, in other words, are waiting for their turn in Chicago later this month and for the onset of the campaign proper after Labor Day.
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that General Powell, who spoke so movingly about the American Dream and his realization of it, not only declined to consider running for Vice President but also frankly scolded his new party, warning it not to turn its back on "Americans in need" in its rush to save money by reforming welfare and health care.
It is worth noting, second, that Vice-Presidential nominees seldom add much to the vote a Presidential nominee could have got on his own (though Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 is widely counted as an exception, and Mr. Kemp could be another because of the special circumstance of Mr. Dole's age). The best a Vice-Presidential nominee can do in most cases is to give the ticket a quick psychological lift, as Al Gore did for Bill Clinton in 1992, and avoid costly mistakes.
It is worth noting, third, that fond convention glances back to halcyon days -- to the New Deal and the New Frontier by the Democrats, to the Eisenhower and Reagan eras by the Republicans -- can only divert people from the present for a few fleeting moments. Michael Deaver was right when he said the convention was "bathed in nostalgia" for Mr. Reagan; the electorate, seeking fresh solutions to the everyday problems of a different time, is much less likely to be.
Churlish as they may seem amid the fervor of a convention that longs for a comeback, those points say something about the shape of the race to come.
As does this one: the Presidential nominee chosen here will not be Jack Kemp, Ronald Reagan or Colin Powell. It will be Bob Dole, and he will still have many of the problems that have dogged his campaign so far, even if, as seems likely, he leaves San Diego with a spring in his step, and even if he scores with his speech on Thursday evening.
Polling done in the days since Mr. Kemp was chosen, some of it as recently as tonight, shows that Mr. Dole has softened up Mr. Clinton's support, as expected, and may even have gained a few points on him. But it also shows that more voters have a negative than a positive picture of Mr. Dole and that he is particularly weak among women, partly because of his opposition to abortion rights.
He will have to find a way to deal with that, and it will not be easy. He may have turned his back on the party's platform, but he cannot disown his own, marginally milder, stand against abortion, which fences him off from many women in the normally Republican suburbs. And he remains a poor campaigner, still uncomfortable with the gladhanding and the chit-chat expected of him.
He is a short-winded practitioner of a long-winded craft.
Senator Dole's wife, Elizabeth, who has the easy grace of many Southern women, greeted Mrs. Reagan last night by grasping both her hands and telling her: "It was wonderful, moving, just perfect. We thank you so much." No doubt equally grateful, but as little given to gushing as Gary Cooper, Mr. Dole could manage only, "It was nice."
So is it all illusion? Is Bob Dole doomed to lose this election? Not necessarily. Campaigns change voters' minds; the question is how many.
The Kansan will have to stage a comeback of mythic proportions to win. More than 20 points down in most polls as the convention began, he was farther behind at this stage than anyone in the modern era who went on to win.
As Gerald R. Ford pointed out in his speech to the convention, he was 33 points behind Jimmy Carter at one stage in July 1976, and lost by only 2. Hubert H. Humphrey was 16 points behind Richard M. Nixon in August 1968, and lost by a hair. George Bush, 17 points behind Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, came back far enough to claim victory.
Despite the legend that credits him with the greatest comeback in American political history, Harry S. Truman was never more than 13 points behind.
The Dole entourage hopes that a promise of tax cuts will do the trick for their man. Whatever their economic merits, such promises can clearly have a catalytic political effect in a time when the middle class feels burdened by taxes and has little patience with many of the purposes to which they are put.
In two recent elections in the New York metropolitan area, tax-cut magic has been evident for all to see. In 1993, Christine Todd Whitman, 20-odd points behind at the time, proposed a 30 percent tax cut and overtook Gov. James J. Florio in the final weeks of the campaign. In 1994, George E. Pataki, a rank outsider at the start, did much the same thing to the previously invincible Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Whether the same thing will sell on a national level at a time of pervasive national concern about the deficit is an untested proposition. The Democrats will make the case that Mr. Dole's idea would bust the budget. He will argue that "all Americans can prosper together" through tax cuts, as William Kristol put it in The Daily Standard, "the sunniest of messages" for any candidate.
At the White House, they are talking now about a competitive race.

Home Sales at 9-Year High

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: EDISON

 BODY:
Sales of single-family homes in New Jersey reached a nine-year high in the second quarter of the year, the New Jersey Association of Realtors said yesterday. About 44,700 homes were sold in April, May and June, the most since the third quarter of 1987 and a 12.6 percent increase over the corresponding period last year. The average price of a home increased to $154,000 from $146,900. Robert L. Kinniebriew, the president of the association, said that increasing employment and rising consumer confidence were fueling the market.

HEADLINE: Inflation Fears Send Stocks Down Sharply

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Stocks suffered sympathy pains yesterday after the bond market was bruised by unexpectedly strong retail sales and higher consumer prices. A broad decline resulted, leaving the major stock market barometers down about 1 percent for the day.
The Dow Jones industrial index declined more than 50 points after 2 P.M., setting off the month's first mandatory limit on computer-driven trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow closed the day at 5,647.28, down 57.70 points, its largest decline since July 15. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fared a bit better, tumbling 5.57 points to close at 660.20 for the day. The Nasdaq composite index also fell sharply but steadied a bit before the closing bell to end the day at 1,126.15, down 12.12 points. Declining issues led advancing ones, 1,506 to 852 on the Big Board, where daily trading volume was relatively light at 362.5 million shares, compared with a daily average this year of 410 million shares.
Behind the slide were two Government reports: that retail sales in July rose one-tenth of 1 percent after dropping a sharp half-percent in June -- a revision of an earlier estimated drop of two-tenths of 1 percent -- and that the Consumer Price Index rose an unexpectedly high three-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Of course, the inflation-sensitive bond market saw even worse damage, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling 1 8/32, to a price of 99 19/32, or $12.50 for each $1,000, which pushed its yield up to 6.78 percent, from 6.69 percent on Monday, the largest one-day gain in yield since July 5. Most market economists had expected slightly weaker retail sales and smaller consumer price gains, and the afternoon surprise gave bond traders a rocky day.
But there are no indications that those fears of inflation are justified, several economists said.
"The bond market has almost become a casino where instead of guessing on black or red, they guess on the weekly and monthly economic statistics," said Lawrence Chimerine, managing director and chief economist of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. "But what impresses me most about inflation -- what I hear over and over from all the companies I talk to -- is that they still have little or no pricing flexibility. That's the clearest sign that there is little inflation pressure in the economy."
Steven Einhorn, portfolio strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company, agreed. "The markets are jittery on a short-term basis, but that is not something that will be long-lasting," he said. "This economy can deliver corporate profit growth of about 10 percent, and that is simply not consistent with poor equity markets."
Indeed, corporate earnings played only a small role in yesterday's market swoon, apart from the semiconductor sector, which was slightly beaten down after Maxim Integrated, a maker of circuits for electronic devices, reported fourth-quarter earnings of 49 cents a share, less than the 50 cents analysts had expected. Its shares fell $2.50, to $29.875.
Otherwise, individual stocks and industries were burdened by their own private demons, ranging from worrisome litigation to resigning auditors to unenthusiastic analysts.
On the Big Board, Philip Morris led tobacco stocks lower as investors continued to worry about an adverse jury verdict on Friday in a Florida product-liability suit against Brown & Williamson.
Philip Morris, which closed at 105 1/2 a share on Thursday, closed yesterday at 90, down 3 5/8. RJR Nabisco Holdings, the Loews Corporation, which owns Lorillard, and UST Inc. all declined as well.
On Nasdaq, the Chantal Pharmaceutical Corporation saw its shares fall 13/16 to 2 11/16, after its independent accounting firm, Coopers & Lybrand, resigned. The departure will further delay the company's long-overdue financial statements, prolonging the pain for investors whose shares traded for more than 27 at the beginning of the year.
Casino companies were hit by strong selling pressure after two analysts issued cautionary reports.
Neil Barsky at Morgan Stanley & Company said that the industry's problem was companies building too much, too fast and in too many locations. The building boom "will slow bottom-line growth for the foreseeable future," he wrote.
But Harold Vogel at Cowen & Company fretted that three casinos were not building fast enough. He cited construction delays at Circus Circus Enterprises, Harrah's Entertainment and Mirage Resorts in issuing "neutral" ratings on all casino stocks except the ITT Corporation, which he recommended.
Circus Circus shares fell 1 3/4, to 30 1/8; Harrah's slipped 7/8, to 21 1/4, and Mirage declined 1, to 22.
All told, yesterday's session looked like business as usual to Kent A. Logan, senior managing director of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
"The day-to-day volatility is unprecedented and has been for some time," he said. "Lacking conviction, lacking a sense of direction, the market tends to overreact to individual pieces of news."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 15, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about trading in the stock market on Tuesday referred incorrectly to the status of quarterly reports from the Chantal Pharmaceutical Corporation, whose stock fell that day. The National Association of Securities Dealers has allowed Chantal to file results for the first and second quarter as part of the company's cumulative nine-month figures in its third-quarter report. The reports for the first and second quarter are not overdue.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE OVERVIEW;
G.O.P. OPENS FIERCE ATTACK ON CLINTON OVER CHARACTER AND HANDLING OF ECONOMY

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Republicans melded homespun family images with hardball politics at their national convention tonight, as a line-up of speakers exploited what party leaders believe are President Clinton's two biggest vulnerabilities: his character and the economic anxieties of the middle class.
In putting Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island before the television cameras as the keynote speaker, Republicans made a play for female voters who have turned away from the party. A day earlier, the party sought to broaden its appeal to moderates, swing voters and perhaps even minorities by advancing a message of inclusion from Gen. Colin L. Powell. 
 As the cameras panned to her husband, Representative Bill Paxon of Buffalo, who balanced their 3-month-old daughter, Susan Ruby, on his knee, Ms. Molinari referred to herself as "a mom." Mr. Paxon sat beside Elizabeth Dole and Jack Kemp, Bob Dole's running mate, as his wife sought to put a softer, more youthful and maternal face on the Republican Party four years after Senator Phil Gramm of Texas delivered a hard-edged keynote address.
But from the beginning of her tersely written speech, Ms. Molinari, who is 38, made it clear that she would hardly be tame in making the case that Mr. Dole would make a better President than Mr. Clinton. "This speech is a lot like a Bill Clinton promise," she said. "It won't last long, and it'll sound like a Republican."
The most prominent time slots featured not only Ms. Molinari, but also two other women who favor abortion rights: Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
Waving a copy of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign manifesto, "Putting People First," Mrs. Hutchison leveled the most scathing attack, depicting Mr. Clinton as a radical liberal who never keeps his word: "It's time to wake up America to President Clinton and his high-taxing, free-spending, promise-breaking, Social-Security-taxing, health-care-socializing, drug-coddling, power-grabbing, business-busting, lawsuit-loving, U.N.-following, F.B.I.-abusing, I.R.S.-increasing, $200-hair-cutting, gas-taxing, over-regulating, bureaucracy-trusting, class-baiting, privacy-violating, values-crushing, truth-dodging, Medicare-forsaking, property-rights-taking, job-destroying friends.
"And," she added for effect, "that's just in the White House. Well, I ask you, isn't four years of President Clinton long enough?"
"Yes," the delegates shouted back with exuberance.
Mrs. Hutchison's caustic riposte was reminiscent of the lively speech that another Texan, then Gov. Ann Richards, delivered against George Bush at the 1988 Democratic convention.
But Mrs. Hutchison drew an even more overwhelming ovation when she ridiculed Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, "It Takes a Village." "In the real world," she said, "we don't want a village to raise a child -- we want a family."
The program opened with a handful of Governors recalling their own experiences cutting taxes and balancing their budgets as evidence that Mr. Dole's economic remedies would work for the nation.
After the nearly 2,000 delegates and alternates hissed at a black-and-white images of Mr. Clinton that flashed on two giant screens, Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut lashed out at Mr. Clinton for raising taxes. "Mr. Clinton, we do feel the pain," he said, "because you're causing it."
Except for an outburst from two anti-abortion protesters at the start of Ms. Molinari's speech, the crowd was remarkably sedate. But delegates rocked briefly when Patty Cabrera, a singer who mixes her Latin musical heritage with Christian pop lyrics, took the stage. One delegate, swaying to the music, brandished a sign, "Rock on Dole."
While Mrs. Dole and Mr. Kemp arrived in the hall in time for Ms. Molinari's speech, the nominee-in-waiting sat in his hotel suite in front of a television with Senator Alfonse D'Amato and other supporters.
It was for the largest television audience of the evening that the Republicans saved their punch-the-President theme, in which politicians and ordinary Americans -- including a woman in Pennsylvania who was raped and the owner of a gas station in New Jersey -- painted Mr. Clinton as a villain who had failed the country on issues including welfare and education.
Still, the evening was designed to showcase Ms. Molinari, who reviewed a list of promises that she said Mr. Clinton had shattered, like his pledge for a tax cut for the middle class to reforming the health-care system and balancing the budget. Her address was spiced with about as many references to Mr. Clinton as to either Mr. Dole or Mr. Kemp, who are to receive their party's Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominations later in the week.
"Americans know that Bill Clinton's promises have the lifespan of a Big Mac on Air Force One," Ms. Molinari said. "While that may be funny, what's not funny is what he is doing to the promise of America."
Beyond the attacks, her speech was intended to show that working women and their families would fare far better with a Dole administration. "At the end of the day while I'm rocking Susan Ruby to sleep, I look down and wonder what life will be like," said Ms. Molinari, whose husband, Mr. Paxon, is the conservative chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. "I want the best for her. I want a country free from danger. A nation and a world where she is free to believe in greatness and achieve her fullest potential.
"But," she added, "she will never know that life if we continue down the rudderless path we have been on for four long years."
As Ms. Molinari recalled how her great-grandfather opened a barbershop in Queens, and how her father, Guy V. Molinari ended up as a member of Congress, Mr. Molinari looked on with pride. By the end of the speech, Mr. Molinari, who is now Staten Island Borough President, was holding his granddaughter and feeding her from a bottle.
In an unaccustomed role, Speaker Newt Gingrich steered clear of his familiar position as one of Mr. Clinton's most combative critics, and instead offered a testimonial to community service groups. Buoyed by a sea of red-and-blue "Newt" signs waving across the sprawling convention center, Mr. Gingrich asserted that the delegates would be nominating "two of the greatest leaders this party has ever produced."
Less than two years after he helped guide the Republicans to a historic takeover of the House and Senate, Mr. Gingrich is now the party's most unpopular figure. By keeping his speech short, inoffensive and earlier than the prime-time hour when most networks broadcast the proceedings, convention planners sought to help polish Mr. Gingrich's reputation while putting some space between him and his party. Even so, he was a hit in the hall, drawing one of the most raucous, foot-stomping greetings of the evening.
Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, one of two black Republicans in Congress, had a far more prominent role tonight, as did Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the Budget Committee. "We don't define compassion by how many people are on welfare or A.F.D.C. of live in public housing," Mr. Watts declared in a powerful speech the stirred the convention. "We define compassion by how few people are on welfare, A.F.D.C. and public housing because we have given them the means to climb the ladder of success."
Absent from the program tonight were the volatile matters like abortion the dominated the opening night on Monday. As a result, Ms. Molinari and Mrs. Hutchison, both of whom support abortion rights, did not not mention the issue. Mrs. Whitman spoke only fleetingly about it.
Instead, all three took aim at Mr. Clinton while touting Mr. Dole's agenda for lower taxes and balancing the budget.
Rather than lacerate Mr. Clinton, Mrs. Whitman urged Republicans to unite behind Mr. Dole's economic plan and boasted of her drive to cut taxes significantly in New Jersey.
Though she is known nationally for her support of abortion rights, Mrs. Whitman barely touched the subject. "We believe in the value of the individual," she said. "We appreciate the differences that make each person unique. We know they add to the richness of American life and they add to the strength of the Republican Party."
Haley Barbour, the party chairman, made no secret of the Republicans' effort tonight to appeal to women, who in recent elections have favored the Democrats by a larger margin than men. "I think it's just impossible that women voters will not see, as Susan Molinari does," he said, "how lower taxes, a real war on drugs" and other stands put forward by Republicans benefit women.
As Mr. Dole awaited his nomination on Wednesday, his campaign completed details for the closing two days of the convention. It announced that Senator John McCain of Arizona, would place Mr. Dole's name in nomination. Mr. McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, who had been a favorite to be Mr. Dole's running mate in the days before Mr. Dole settled on Mr. Kemp. The seconding speeches will be made by Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas and Wendy Lee Gramm, a former Reagan Administration official who is married to Mr. Gramm, one of Mr. Dole's opponents in the primaries.
Mr. Kemp will be nominated by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York.
All through the program tonight, Democrats trolled the hall for reporters, producing news releases rebutting the major speakers. Even before Mrs. Hutchison took to the rostrum, the Democratic Party denounced it in a statement as evidence that Republicans have "nothing left but to engage in nasty, gratuitous personal attacks on the President."
As part of the parade of up-and-coming Republican politicians, Senator William Frist of Tennessee, a surgeon who was elected in the sweep of Congress in 1994, went after Mr. Clinton for his aborted health-care plan. And he accused Mr. Clinton of not dealing honestly with the problems in Medicare.
"Clinton's own Cabinet members admit Medicare will go bankrupt in five years," he said. "And still, Bill Clinton denies there's a problem -- refuses to provide a solution and criticizes those that do."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE CONSTITUENCIES;
Minority Focus Raises Some Doubts

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
With Jack Kemp, an advocate for minority concerns, as the Vice-Presidential nominee, Colin L. Powell as the opening night headliner and black and Hispanic Republicans given visible roles at the convention, the Republican Party is trying to convey an image that it is a party where minority voters will find a welcome.
Indeed, the efforts to present a welcoming face to minorities have prompted some Republican officials to predict that the party is poised to make inroads into the Democrats' traditional strength among members of minorities. 
 "I think the time is ripe for the party to make some headway there," said Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, one of the two black Republicans in Congress. "I think there is a market there for the Republican Party."
But as the party strives to shed its image as a bastion of white voters (97 percent of the delegates here are white), even some black Republican stalwarts question whether its actions are sincere or merely another prop in a well-scripted convention. There are only half as many black delegates here as there were four years ago. And the party platform opposes affirmative action and civil rights for homosexuals and calls for limiting assistance to legal immigrants.
"The Republicans are trying to present a face to the minority community that theirs is a big-tent party," said David Bositis, a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization that concentrates on issues involving blacks. "But unless they do something to back it up, it's not going to have any effect. They've got to talk to black and Hispanic communities and, even more important, they have to listen to the black and Hispanic communities and start incorporating some of their concerns."
Some black Republicans say that the prominent place of Mr. Powell and Mr. Kemp within the party will help over time to steer it away from the hard-right stances that have dampened enthusiasm among minorities.
"I hope that we are going to finally cut loose from that element and abandon the Southern strategy that's been used since 1986," said Milton Bins, president of a black Republican organization called the Council of 100, referring to the party's efforts to woo Southern whites.
While surveys show that majorities or large pluralities of blacks support conservative positions like school vouchers, "three strikes and you're out" laws and a Federal tax credit of $500 per child, the party's position against affirmative action, and its unfriendly stance on immigration, weakens the Republicans' appeal among black and Hispanic voters, some political analysts say.
Indeed, there is evidence that the Republicans' tenuous hold on its black supporters -- former President George Bush received 11 percent of the black vote in 1992 -- is weakening.
Despite the montage of black faces in the convention hall that were shown on network television during Mr. Powell's speech, there are only 52 blacks among the 1,990 delegates, and 50 black alternates, at this year's convention, down from 107 delegates and 90 alternates in 1992.
Surveying the nearly monochromatic delegations at the convention center on Monday night, Chris Rock, a comedian, quipped on Comedy Central, a cable channel, "I feel like I'm at the Million White Man March."
In 1994, there were 24 black Republican candidates for Congress. This year, there are 16, said Gwen Daye Richardson, editor of Headway magazine, a conservative black publication. A reason for the decline is the lack of support black candidates get from the national party, some former candidates and some black Republicans say.
"The party's not doing a whole lot," Ms. Richardson said. "They're not doing anything to stand in the candidates' way, but not doing anything to promote them, either."
Ms. Richardson and others say they think that the presence of Mr. Kemp means that the Republican ticket will campaign more in minority communities in this election. They say that should increase the number of black and Hispanic votes the Republicans will receive.
There is no question that this year's convention showcases more black and Hispanic Republicans than any other Republican gathering in recent memory.
In addition to speeches by Mr. Powell and Mr. Watts, the convention will be addressed by Representative Gary A. Franks of Connecticut, the other black Republican in the House. Kay C. James, a black leader in the anti-abortion movement, will call the roll on Thursday night when Bob Dole is officially nominated. An American Indian recited the Pledge of Allegiance to open Monday night's session, and a young black boy sang the national anthem.
Party officials said these appearances were a sign of the Republicans' commitment to diversity and would help them attract younger minority voters, who tend to be more conservative and have dim memories of actions like the opposition of such Republican leaders as Barry Goldwater and George Bush to the landmark civil rights bill of 1964.
"We don't need to change our message, and we're not about to," said Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. "We just need to do a better job in communicating with the minority community. And people like Colin Powell and J. C. Watts help us do that."
In an interview this morning on the NBC News "Today" program, Mr. Powell urged blacks to take a second look at the Republicans.
"I want to help my party convey a message to African-Americans and others of color that we are a party that has appeal," he said. "You should listen to our economic message. You should listen to what we say about families and values and improving our school system and all the other things we intend to improve, and then make your judgment."

HEADLINE: Legislature's Intent in Backing the 'Primacy of English'

 BODY:
Following is the text of the legislative intent section of the proposed law making English the official language of Suffolk County:
The Legislature hereby finds that immigrants flocking to America's shores, in search of political and religious freedom, have formed the backbone of America's growth, development and progress. 
 This Legislature hereby determines that the assimilation of diverse immigrant cultures and traditions has contributed to freedom without fear, to diversity without intolerance, to multiculturalism without violence, and to economic, social, scientific, literary, medical, technological, spiritual, religious and individual freedom and unlimited opportunity for the "tired . . . poor . . . huddled masses yearning to breathe free."
The Legislature also finds and determines that the official sanctioning of multilingualism has a deleterious impact on the citizens of Suffolk County by discouraging the assimilation of immigrants into the society around them, by slowing down English-language proficiency in our schools, by retarding the progress of students in our educational institutions, by reducing the efficiency and mobility of our labor force, and by creating dangerous barriers between communities of Suffolk County.
This Legislature further finds that establishing the primacy of English as the official language of Suffolk County will not diminish the ethnic and cultural diversity that flourishes through the preservation of the right of all citizens to learn or continue to use secondary or tertiary languages in their own private settings. This Legislature hereby encourages the learning and/or continued use of other languages in private settings which reflect and strengthen the ethnic identities of various groups within the County of Suffolk.
Therefore, the purpose of this law is to reaffirm and reinstitute the traditional time-tested use of a common means of communication as a means of educating the citizens of this county; as a unifying force between various communities and cultures, and as an instrument of social progress and economic advancement.
By compelling the County of Suffolk to conduct all of its official business in English, the objective of this law is to encourage all denizens within this county to adopt the one language standard, which, over the years, has constituted the single greatest vehicle for economic and social progress in the county, while, at the same time, reducing the cost of county government by eliminating expenditures for duplicative services.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark On Hint of German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar posted its biggest one-day gain against the mark in almost four months yesterday, after comments from the Bundesbank's chief economist encouraged expectations for lower interest rates.
The economist, Otmar Issing, told The International Herald Tribune yesterday: "The recovery is not yet robust enough that you can say with certainty that it will continue. An appreciation of the D-mark does not fit into the current landscape." 
 His comments were interpreted by traders as a signal that the Bundesbank council might cut rates at its meeting on Aug. 22 to stem the mark's rise. A weaker mark would make German exports less expensive, fostering economic growth.
"People probably upgraded the chance for a rate cut after Issing made those comments," said Michael Faust, who oversees about $1 billion at Bailard Biehl & Kaiser, a California money management firm.
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.4895 marks, up 1 percent from 1.4750 on Tuesday and the highest level since July 24. The dollar traded at 108.10 yen, up from 107.56. The British pound fell to $1.5490 from $1.5495.
Mr. Issing's comments came just days after he suggested in an interview with Die Welt, a leading German newspaper, that another rate cut would do little to change the outlook for Germany's economy.
Still, the interview did encourage expectations that the Bundesbank might cut rates even after surprising the market by leaving rates unchanged at its last meeting in July.
"It came out of the blue, said David DeRosa, director of foreign exchange at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "The implication is that they're not on board with the dollar falling. We haven't heard that in a long time."
As the dollar began rising, it got an extra lift as traders canceled short sales -- bets that the currency would fall.
In a short sale, traders borrow securities or currencies and sell on the gamble they can buy them back at lower prices and pocket the difference. If prices rise, they must buy back immediately or face mounting losses.
German overnight interest rates are lower than United States rates, and a rate cut would tend to benefit the dollar by making United States bank deposits more attractive.

HEADLINE: Productivity Slips as Labor Costs Increase

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Workplace productivity slipped at an annual rate of one-tenth of 1 percent in the second quarter, but the decline had little immediate effect on inflation, the Government said today.
Though the dip in efficiency did lift labor costs, Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said businesses apparently absorbed the increases and did not pass them along to customers by raising prices. 
 "For this reason, inflation should not rise and productivity should pick up again in the third quarter, as hours increase more slowly," he said.
Indeed, Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said recent data already pointed to increased productivity and slower growth in labor costs in the current quarter.
The report, by the Labor Department, showed that nonfarm productivity eased as job growth increased the overall number of hours worked. Productivity measures output per hours worked.
But based partly on second-quarter employment reports, which showed big increases in payrolls, many analysts had expected productivity to decline more, by five-tenths of 1 percent. It had increased at a 1.8 percent rate in the first three months of 1996 after falling at a 1.1 percent rate three months earlier.
Output rose at a 4.2 percent rate from April through June, much faster than the 2.7 percent rate in January through March. But the number of hours worked also surged, rising at a 4.3 percent rate, more than four times the 1 percent rate during the previous quarter.
That resulted in a 3.8 percent rate of increase in unit labor costs, more than twice the 1.5 percent rate of the first quarter. Labor costs are typically two-thirds of what consumers pay for a product.
The financial markets paid little attention to the report, even though investors generally fear signs of quickening economic activity because they could cause the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates in an effort to head off inflation.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business inventories increased by one-tenth of 1 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted $997.49 billion, from $996.98 billion in May, when stockpiles shrank by a similar amount. Analysts called the mild increase, which took place at the retail level, a sign that companies were keeping their stockpiles lean and avoiding the large buildup that occurred in 1995.
The slight increase also occurred as business sales slipped five-tenths of 1 percent, the first decline in five months, to $711.53 billion, from $715.13 billion a month earlier, when they shot up eight-tenths of 1 percent. As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio edged up to 1.40, from 1.39 a month earlier. That meant it would take 1.40 months to exhaust stockpiles at the June sales rate.
The Labor Department said a measurement of inflation in its productivity report rose just 2.2 percent despite the decline in productivity. Growth in manufacturing productivity slowed during the April-June quarter. It rose at only a 1.5 percent rate, compared with a 5.6 percent rate three months earlier, marking the smallest increase since the second quarter of 1993.
Increases in productivity are considered critical to raising the living standards of Americans, because if businesses are producing more with the same amount of work they can increase wages without raising prices. Increases in productivity can also be used to raise corporate profits.
Some analysts fear that the tightening of the labor market over the last few years could lead to increased wages that without sufficient gains in productivity could cause greater inflation.
Federal Reserve policy makers will study the productivity report with other recent data on Tuesday when they consider whether to raise short-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: Muslim and Croatian Leaders Approve Federation for Bosnia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Trying to save the Dayton peace accord, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced today that two Balkan leaders had finally agreed to create a federation to jointly govern Muslims and Croats in half of Bosnia.
The two Presidents, Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, have pledged many times that politicians under their control would join together in a Muslim-Croat federation. 
 The federation was created on paper two years ago by the Clinton Administration, as a counterbalance to the Bosnian Serbs. But despite Washington's pressure it has consistently failed to emerge as a working government.
The federation is meant to control about half of Bosnian territory, and a Bosnian Serb republic the other half. Under the Dayton accord's vision of preserving a single nation, these two substates would in turn be united under a newly created national presidency, assembly, court and central bank.
Mr. Christopher acknowledged at a news conference that promises had been made before on the federation, but he said today's agreement was the first in which a set date -- August 31 -- had been established for its formal creation.
"I don't shy away from the fact that this is a work in progress," Mr. Christopher said after meetings with Mr. Izetbegovic, Mr. Tudjman and the President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. "We're making progress but we have to work at it."
Mr. Christopher met with the three Balkan leaders today in the third of a series of meetings designed to smooth out problems in the Dayton agreement. He is scheduled to visit Sarajevo on Thursday.
Elections for the varied layers of government set up in the Dayton plan are scheduled in Bosnia on Sept. 14.
The State Department, through frequent visits of high officials to Bosnia and head-to-head talks like the recent White House meeting between President Clinton and Mr. Tudjman, has been working overtime to salvage elections that are already wrapped in confusion, manipulation and intimidation.
The impending elections, which are to occur only six weeks before the American presidential election, are adding to the pressures on the State Department to try and move the federation beyond the realm of fiction.
The federation is supposed to have an integrated military command and economic institutions to manage taxes, investment and economic aid.
American diplomats said that today's agreement requires that Herceg-Bosnia, the self-governing entity that the Bosnian Croats have established within Bosnia -- and which Croatian nationalists hope can be integrated with Croatia -- would be dismantled by Aug. 31.
John Kornblum, the American State Department official responsible for the day-to-day policy on Bosnia, said: "The real point is not to argue whether these people are truly enthusiastic. We know they are not. But we never give up."
State Department officials said that operational arrangements for military protection of voters in Bosnia on election day were also discussed for the first time, in addition to the federation agreement.
Mr. Kornblum said he expected "tens of thousands" of voters who were displaced by ethnic cleansing operations during the war to go to their original neighborhoods to vote on election day. Election planners have said these people will need military protection. The Supreme Allied Commander, General George Joulwan, was at the talks here today to discuss what his forces were prepared to do, diplomats said.

An "October surprise," in political parlance, is the making of big news to affect a November election. Because such manipulation of events by government officials is unfair, the opposing party seeks to impugn the surprise's motive.
At least two events are in the pipeline, one that could damage and the other boost the Clintons. Both pose an ethical dilemma: Should the normal course of action be changed to avoid affecting an election -- or is that avoidance itself an intrusion into the course of law or diplomacy? 
 The first is the Washington grand jury's coming decision to indict or not indict Hillary Clinton and White House officials for obstructing justice by hiding subpoenaed documents and lying.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr knows he could affect this election by seeking that indictment this summer. He is surely aware of Justice Department guidelines discouraging pre-election indictment. However, if he deliberately slows down a criminal case lest it hurt a political candidate, he would subvert the democratic process -- and invite huge resentment if evidence is presented of White House wrongdoing too late for a national decision.
What's right? It's best to proceed as if there were no election. Neither speed up nor delay the process of law. After thousands of hours of grand jury testimony, some counts against some targets have ripened or dead-ended; the prosecutor should ask the Washington jurors investigating abuses of power to make a charge, to issue a public "information" or to close up shop. (The Whitewater grand jury in Little Rock, wading through complicated corruption, may take much longer.)
In the same way, though in an order of magnitude affecting human life, the "October surprise" dilemma faces Clinton Administration officials gathering intelligence on the source of two attacks in Saudi Arabia that killed 24 Americans.
If statements made by Defense Secretary William Perry on National Public Radio two weeks ago are accurate, the Saudis are "close to completing their investigation" and he anticipates their finding an "international connection." Asked if that connection was Iran, Perry answered: "possibly. . . . We know that Iran is very active in international terrorism, some of it directed against the United States . . . so, yes, they are the leading candidate. . . ."
Asked by the reporter Martha Raddatz if the U.S. would retaliate if the Saudi report pointed to Iran as the state sponsoring the terrorist act against us, Perry promised, "If we have compelling evidence of international sponsorship of that bombing, we will take strong action. . . ."
Soon afterward, White House national security officials secretly tipped the Dole campaign to the likelihood of a punitive strike against Iran if that evidence became "compelling." Since then, we have heard unconfirmed reports from Saudi oppositionists of confessions wrung from six suspects. Our officials hope these will not be beheaded as quickly as the last bunch, before our F.B.I. has a chance to see them.
Assume, for argument's sake, that the Saudi report and our intelligence point clearly to Teheran as the central source of the blasts that killed Americans. If sponsored by a state, those acts of terror become acts of war. How should the U.S. respond?
At a seminar here at the Republican Convention of former Secretaries of State (Kissinger, Haig, Shultz, Eagleburger), state-sponsored terror was raised only hypothetically -- not about this specific case -- and the panel agreed the U.S. response must be fierce. Senator John McCain, at the subsequent lunch, used the term "disproportionate."
That means to me that Bill Clinton should not be asking himself "Will a military strike seem politically motivated to make me look macho?" or "Will more economic sanctions be enough?" but should call Dole, and make the case to him -- as well as to Congressional leaders -- about "compelling" evidence.
If our retaliation against Iranian oil facilities is severe enough to make Teheran cease its terror war, he'll get that bipartisan support. And though the rallying-round would help the Clinton campaign, no Republican could properly complain about an "October surprise." Neither the criminal law nor the law of nations need be suspended for an election.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Close Session Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of government securities were mixed yesterday, as fresh economic data somewhat reassured investors. While the data indicated some strength, the signs were not as strong as the market's consensus forecast.
By the close, the 30-year Treasury bond was selling at a price of 99 19/32 in choppy trading, the same as at the close of Tuesday's sharp selloff; the yield also remained unchanged at 6.78 percent. Still, most intermediate and short-term maturities improved a bit. Market participants were not ready to forget Tuesday's selloff, and they continued to trade cautiously. 
 The data released yesterday included preliminary second-quarter productivity and labor costs and June business inventories and sales. Nonfarm productivity fell one-tenth of 1 percent, according to the Labor Department, following an increase in productivity of 1.8 percent for the first quarter, a reading that was revised downward from the earlier estimate of 2.1 percent.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said that while the weak productivity figure and a 3.8 percent surge in unit labor costs were disappointing, they offered little new information. "Data already reported for the third quarter point to stronger productivity growth and slower labor cost growth," Ms. Schaja said.
Business inventories, the Commerce Department reported, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June, offsetting a decline of the same range in May. Manufacturers' and wholesalers' inventories were flat during June, while retailers' inventories rose two-tenths of 1 percent. Sales increased, pushing the inventory-to-sales ratio up to 1.4 from 1.39 a month earlier.
Positives working for the market yesterday included a stronger dollar, which makes American investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreigners, and a coupon pass by the Federal Reserve, in which the central bank entered the market as a ready buyer of various maturities. Yesterday, the Fed confirmed it had engaged in a pass and was buying government securities bearing coupons with maturities ranging from February 1997 to July 1998.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company, regarded the economic data as playing only a minimal role in market activity; he said that the coupon pass by the Fed appeared to lead to some late gains.
Mr. Gamba said that stops -- or the levels some participants set to get out of the market -- appeared to be in the 110 30/32 range for trading in bond futures.
He figured that after the bond futures contracts hit that price level, some investors sought to take advantage of the early decline in prices and set up short positions with borrowed securities, only to see the market come back and move above those levels later in the session.
"I think some of those people were caught," he added, "forcing them to go back into the market to buy securities in order to cover those short positions and limit their losses."
Today, reports are due on July capacity utilization and industrial production as well as the weekly count of first-time unemployment claims. Also, the Philadelphia Fed report on business activity is due, and the Treasury is scheduled to auction new one-year bills, all of which may have kept a lid on prices yesterday, Mr. Gamba said.
After yesterday's data were released, the market was driven mostly by technical factors. Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston, said: "Market prices continued developing the lower end of Tuesday's price range, and are poised to initiate a directional move on Thursday. That direction will be completely dependent on the price action around two key levels for the September bond futures contract -- 110 29/32 and 111 18/32. The 111 18/32 resistance area is a major hurdle that needs to be cleared for the short-term directional bias to turn bullish."
Yesterday the September bond contract closed at 111 2/32 in futures trading, slightly less than the session's high of 111 6/32.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Economists are wary of Dole's promise to reduce taxes.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHILE economists are not lining up to congratulate Bob Dole on his plan to cut taxes even as he proposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, many do admire his skill in snaking a path between the deficit hawks in the Republican Party and the what-me-worry supply-siders.
But whether or not Mr. Dole is ever in a position to try to implement his plan, there is still a price to pay. For in suggesting that the American economy can painlessly grow its way out of its fiscal problems, Mr. Dole is postponing the day Americans face up to the gap between what they expect from Government and what they are willing to pay for it. "He's setting the debate about what to do with Social Security and Medicare back five years," argued Paul Krugman, an economist at Stanford University. 
 Veterans of the Washington budget wars will recognize Mr. Dole's subtle technique in fashioning a hypothetical budget that honors all the graven images. There's a 15 percent income-tax cut and a break on Social Security earnings for the middle class, a $500-a-child tax credit and retirement accounts for homemakers to please the family lobby, capital-gains reductions for the rich and education incentives to cheer the proponents of investment in "human capital."
To cover the cost of the $548 billion in tax breaks and reduce the deficit to zero over six years, he asserts that $147 billion will come back as a growth dividend. That's almost double what Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan Business School thinks is likely. But unlike Reagan-era claims that tax cuts would pay for themselves, it does at least pass the laugh test.
Then there's the invocation of the time-honored tradition that David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget director, called "the magic asterisk." Spending is supposed to be reduced by $393 billion by implementing the Republican budget plan that was vetoed by President Clinton and that cost Congressional Republicans much of their political popularity. Another $217 billion in cuts are proposed, but the details are nearly as hazy as Mr. Stockman's phantom cuts.
Among the least plausible: $90 billion in "administrative costs" that, by default, would have to come out of all the agencies that have already been slimmed down. Then, among other proposals, there's another $32 billion from the Energy Department, which is more than the total now budgeted for its nondefense activities, and $15 billion from the Commerce Department, which might well require the gutting of the National Weather Service.
All this may be forgivable by the doubly debased standards of campaign and budget politics. What Mr. Krugman does not forgive, though, is the implication that six years is as far as one has to look. For even if Mr. Dole managed to balance the budget in 2002 after cutting taxes, the country would soon be drowning in red ink again.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the projected annual deficit rises by $118 billion from 2002 to 2006. Thereafter, things really begin to cook. For even if the budget were balanced in 2002 and discretionary spending was frozen in real terms, if nothing was done to alter current benefit policies, the deficit would rise from about 1 percent of total national output in 2006 to 6 percent in 2020 and to 17 percent in 2050.
The explanation is simple. Revenues from Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes currently exceed outlays, but this surplus will begin to fall in little more than a decade. Unless expenditures are checked or taxes are increased sharply, they will push the budget deeply into the red by the second decade of the next century. And the effect will be magnified by the need to service the ballooning national debt: interest payments, now 3 percent of G.D.P., are projected under that scenario to reach 14 percent in 2050.
Mr. Dole's opponents are equally guilty of ignoring the long-term budget arithmetic. After all, Democrats made political hay of the Congressional Republicans' tentative steps toward containing the relentless rise in Medicare costs.
But the Republican candidate raises the ante by proposing big tax cuts and by taking Medicare, Social Security and military spending "off the table." More important, by setting 3.5 percent economic growth as a target, he suggests that the hard budgetary decisions will never have to be made. For if the economy were to grow that fast over the next 50 years, rather than the roughly 2 percent projected by the C.B.O., Washington would be swimming in revenue.
Robert Reischauer, the former director of the C.B.O., noted wryly that the irony here was that anti-tax Republicans might actually promote the growth of government by playing budget politics as usual. The longer Washington waits to decide how to pay for projected deficits, he argues, the more likely they will be financed with tax increases. After all, the less warning the baby boomers have, the harder it will be to ask them to cover their retirement costs from their own savings.

HEADLINE: The Jack Kemp Reverse

 BODY:
Welcome to the N.F.L. By tradition, that is what rookies are told by way of introduction to the brutal realities of professional sport. Surely the phrase must have flashed through the mind of the old footballer Jack Kemp when he was told the price he would have to pay to be on the Republican ticket with Bob Dole.
The exact terms of the negotiation were secret until Wednesday, when in a series of reported interviews Mr. Kemp announced that he was supporting a mindless plan to expel the children of illegal immigrants from public schools. Up until his reversal, Mr. Kemp had worn as an emblem of courage his rejection of Proposition 187, the 1994 California ballot initiative for closing the schools to immigrant children. In the same interviews, Mr. Kemp revealed that he was ending his opposition to another California ballot initiative that would abolish affirmative-action programs in the state. 
 He justified the latter action by saying that upon mature reflection he thought Mr. Dole was right in believing that it was possible to achieve economic and educational equality for minorities without special programs to make up for past discrimination. Before he got his bell rung in San Diego, the old Jack Kemp used to believe that it was premature to cut off such aid to victims of historic discrimination without having effective programs to replace them. His blithe assurances that he and Mr. Dole will come up with such alternatives defies belief, given the Republican Party's current ideological makeup.
But Mr. Dole has clearly made Mr. Kemp an offer he could not refuse. He could sell out a few core beliefs on civil rights and immigration, or his political career would continue to be as dead as it was before Mr. Dole called him in Texas on Aug. 9. Well, Jack Kemp is not the first Republican to reverse field. The clearest example is George Bush's instant reversal of position on abortion and supply-side economics upon joining Ronald Reagan's ticket in 1980.
Mr. Bush was haunted for the rest of his career by a reputation for excessive flexibility, but Mr. Kemp is probably being comforted by handlers who tell him that the public allows every politician a small number of open-field reverses. Given the fact that he is running against a President who recently ignored a half-century of Democratic tradition and half his Government to sign the harshly punishing welfare bill, Mr. Kemp will also not be the only revolving cynic on the 1996 ballot.
Even so, the humbling of running mates, like the blooding of N.F.L. rookies, is seldom a civilized spectacle. Mr. Dole's decision to whip Mr. Kemp into line just when the G.O.P. is trying to re-credential itself as a party of racial fairness is, at best, a puzzling one. The cost to Mr. Kemp's substantial ego must have been painfully high, for his reputation as a man of firm civil rights principles has been central to his entire career and, one suspects, to his self-image. For once, we have before us a political occasion in which a favorite phrase of Ross Perot seems wise. As Mr. Perot would say, it's sad -- just sad.

HEADLINE: Richard Upton Dies at 81; Put Primary in the Spotlight

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Richard Upton, the man credited with turning the once sleepy New Hampshire primary into a quadrennial political extravaganza and a make-or-break test for Presidential hopefuls, died on Monday in Concord, N.H. He was 81 and a former speaker of the state's House of Representatives.
New Hampshire had been holding national Presidential primaries since 1916, and since 1920 they had always been the first of the Presidential season. But until Mr. Upton had his brainstorm in 1949, they tended to be distinctly lackadaisical affairs in which the voters selected slates of delegates to the national nominating conventions, not the candidates, themselves. 
 Although the candidates' names appeared at the end of a list of prospective delegates pledged to support them at the conventions, pledges made in the cold New Hampshire winter sometimes came unglued in the heat of an unfolding political campaign, and some slates ran as uncommitted delegates, asking New Hampshire voters to trust them to make the right deals at the smoke-filled convention rooms.
Mr. Upton's innovation, which took effect in 1952, was to create a separate column listing the candidates, making the primary a true test of their personal standings with the voters.
To hear him tell it, and as the acknowledged "father of the New Hampshire primary," he was called on to tell it often over the years, the only thing Mr. Upton had in mind in 1949 was to bring the primary closer to the voters and increase turnout, not to create a political and media frenzy that turns the national spotlight on New Hampshire every four years and pumps some $30 million into the state economy.
By his own measure, the Upton primary has been a resounding success. It regularly attracts 80 percent or more of party enrollees, a good 20 points more than its closest rivals.
As the first real primary (a week after the Iowa caucuses) the New Hampshire primary has also exerted enormous influence on Presidential politics, so much so that from 1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower began his road to the White House by beating Senator Robert Taft of Ohio in the first Upton primary, until Bill Clinton sneaked into the White House after placing second to Paul E. Tsongas in New Hampshire, not a single man had been elected President without first winning the New Hampshire primary.
For all that, it's influence was perhaps most evident in smashing the political ambitions of an incumbent President who actually won the primary. That was in 1968, when Eugene McCarthy made such a strong second-place showing behind President Lyndon B. Johnson (who had clinched the 1964 nomination after winning the New Hampshire primary as a write-in candidate, albeit an incumbent President) and Mr. Johnson withdrew from the race in favor of his Vice President, Hubert H. Humphrey, who won the Democratic nomination but lost the election to the Republican winner in New Hampshire, Richard M. Nixon.
In a state in which legislators are unpaid volunteers and government service is sometimes still viewed as a civic responsibility, not a career, Mr. Upton was a citizen statesman with a capital C.
After three terms in the legislature, including one as speaker of the House, he retired to his family and his law practice, always subject to the call of pubic duty. In both 1964 and 1984, for example, he served as chairman of state constitutional conventions, becoming the only man in New Hampshire to preside over two such conventions.
A member of an old New Hampshire family, Mr. Upton, whose father served an interim term as United States Senator, represented a distinct version of the Yankee stereotype, in his case one whose flinty upbringing included polishing stops at Exeter, Dartmouth and the Harvard Law School.
Two years after receiving his law degree in 1938, Mr. Upton was elected to the House, but left after one term to serve in the Army Air Corps in World War II.
Returning to New Hampshire in 1946, he was re-elected to the House, where his Republican colleagues had been so impressed with his fair and even-handed approach to politics that they promptly made him majority leader. Two years later, at the age of 34, he was elected Speaker.
It was then he had his brainstorm and the power to make it happen, typically shunning the limelight. Because of a New Hampshire tradition in which Speakers try to maintain at least a semblance of independence by not introducing or championing legislation, the primary reform measure, which eventually passed both houses and was signed into law by a somewhat skeptical governor, Sherman Adams, was originally introduced by Reuben Moore.
Mr. Upton's surviviors include two sons, Bill, of Concord, N.H., and Matthew of Northbridge, N.H.

HEADLINE: Clinton Looks At Job Ideas For Inner City

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
As President Clinton prepares to sign legislation ending the 60-year Federal guarantee of assistance to needy children, Administration officials are considering proposals to encourage the creation of jobs in the inner cities, possibly including new tax breaks for businesses.
Mr. Clinton's aides say he wants to unveil such a program -- most likely at the Democratic National Convention -- to show that there will be jobs available for people when they stop receiving welfare benefits under the time limits set in the welfare bill. 
 An announcement at the Chicago convention could also help mollify the party's liberal wing, which was angered by Mr. Clinton's decision to sign the Republican-drafted welfare legislation reversing social welfare policy begun by Democrats in the New Deal. The party split was demonstrated in the Senate, where 25 Democrats voted for the bill and 21 voted against it.
Mr. Clinton's aides say they are also examining a few more tax incentives that might be added to the President's list of limited tax breaks designed to help the middle class and working poor, which he has offered as an alternative to Bob Dole's plan for sweeping tax cuts. One idea under consideration is making it easier to receive tax relief on capital gains from the sale of a home.
But Administration officials say Mr. Clinton will not move closer to the more sweeping approach of the Republicans. Mr. Dole has said his plan will stimulate the economy with $548 million in tax cuts while still balancing the budget by 2002.
"We think the President's effort of disciplined deficit reduction combined with targeted tax cuts focused on education is clearly preferable to a massive across-the-board plan," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr. Dole's proposal would either increase the deficit or force reductions in spending on Medicare and Medicaid.
The President has already begun to ridicule Mr. Dole's plan, saying it reminded him of a trip to a candy store.
"You know, 'I'll have some of that and some of that and some of that and some of that,' " Mr. Clinton said last week in California. "But if you eat it all at once, you might get sick."
Clinton advisers say the President will sharpen his criticism as Democrats remind voters repeatedly that last year when House Republicans wanted to cut taxes by $245 billion and balance the budget over seven years, they also called for $270 billion in savings in the Medicare program.
While campaigning, Mr. Clinton has argued that his tax proposals serve particular social purposes, like helping people get higher education, and yet are small enough not to threaten deficit reduction. He has, for example, proposed a tax credit to make the first two years of community college virtually tuition free.
His aides said the same philosophy applied to the options they are drawing up for review next week. They include possible incentives for job creation in inner cities and for the hiring of former welfare recipients.
The job creation proposals are designed to mitigate the possible effects of the welfare bill, which will establish a lifetime limit of five years on welfare payments to any family and require most adults to work within two years of receiving aid.
"The President believes very strongly that successful implementation of welfare reform will depend on the availability of work," a White House official said.
Possible options, officials said, are the expansion of the enterprise zone program, which provides tax incentives for businesses to open in the inner city, or a refinement of a proposal already advanced by the President to use $2 billion in tax breaks to encourage the cleanup and revitalization of mildly contaminated urban industrial sites.
Another idea would be to offer designated tax relief on capital gains to encourage capital investment in distressed urban areas.
The tax cuts under consideration would range from $1 billion to $3 billion annually, officials said.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE VOTERS;
In One Town, Some Women Begin Giving Dole a Second Look

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: The Gender Divide

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 14

 BODY:
A national political convention always gives a party a bounce in the polls, and there is evidence that the tightly scripted television gala being beamed nightly from San Diego this week is reaching into this Middle American place and winning over some of the women the Republicans are striving so hard to attract.
A week ago Nanette Ream, a Republican voter who owns Fidelity Tours, a small travel business, felt she could not support Bob Dole because he was too much the captive of big business and big money. But she liked the selection of Jack Kemp for his maverick streak, she is impressed with how well the Republicans have orchestrated their message of inclusiveness, and she got a kick out of Susan Molinari, even if the Republican Congresswoman from New York is not going to make the world forget Henry Clay or Daniel Webster. "She's like a little Mary Lou Retton of the Republican Party," Ms. Ream said. 
 Kathy Magel, a businesswoman working out of her home, and an independent voter, was leaning toward President Clinton as of last week. But the Kemp selection, the Monday night lineup of two former Presidents who are rarely seen publicly now -- Gerald R. Ford and George Bush -- plus the Reagan video and the speeches by Nancy Reagan and Colin L. Powell absolutely dazzled her. "Do you think they can keep it up?" she asked the next morning, adding: "I definitely won't vote for Clinton now. I'm leaning Dole-Kemp, though I can't take out Perot yet."
Jana Demchak, director of development for a pregnancy center offering alternatives to abortion, usually votes Republican but remained undecided until Mr. Dole selected a running mate who opposes abortion and the party's delegates adopted its anti-abortion platform on Monday. She, too, is now on board for Mr. Dole.
Still, if the Republican ticket is narrowing the gender gap this week, there appears to be a long way to go here in Stark County, a place that mirrors national voting trends. A poll of the county in May, performed for The New York Times, showed Mr. Clinton ahead of Mr. Dole by 52 percent to 29 percent among registered female voters, and it is not hard to find Republican and politically independent women here who have not been won over by what they have seen this week, or who are are indeed angered by it.
This is a place where most of the men and women who make up the backbone of the county Republican Party -- Charles and Sarah Brown, W. R. Timken Jr., Representative Ralph Regula, Janet Weir Creighton -- believe abortion should be legal, a private matter rather than one for government.
Leading Republican businesswomen in the community like Amelia Renkart-Thomas, president of Metropolitan Industries, a fifth-generaton family floor-tile business, and Nancy McPeek, an assistant vice president for Bank One and past president of the local United Way, remain angry with Mr. Dole for what they see as his flip-flop over abortion tolerance language in the party platform.
Ms. Renkart-Thomas, who voted for Mr. Dole in the Republican primary, is now leaning toward President Clinton. Ms. McPeek is undecided. "I have major, major concerns about the influence of the conservative right," she said.
The parade of Republican women speaking from the convention podium has not softened Ms. Renkart-Thomas's feelings. "I'm angry that they'd have all those moderates speak last night who essentially say, 'Just ignore the platform, it doesn't make a difference,' " she said. "I'm a lawyer by training, and I think words do make a difference, and I feel condescended to."
The gender gap is in part about social welfare policy. Programs like welfare, job training, subsidized housing and legal aid tend to serve more women than men, because women generally earn less than men and are more often the ones who must care for children when a family comes apart. In Canton, as in much of the country, these programs tend to be run by female administrators and female social workers.
Mary Cain, a Democrat who runs a free medical clinic for Canton's Republican Mayor, and Margaret Egbert, the director of the Y.W.C.A., who often votes for Republicans, including Congressman Regula and Senator Mike DeWine, both say they were willing to be persuaded to vote for the Republican ticket this time.
But both are leaning more strongly toward Mr. Clinton now. Ms. Cain resented the "choreographed" picture of the Republican Party she saw on television, the contrast between the march of diversity to the podium and a platform opposed to affirmative action.
"It was like every third person was black," she said, and "I never saw so many sleeping babies at a convention." Watching the coverage, she wondered at times whether there were any white men left in the party.
Ms. Egbert, of the Y.W.C.A., was pleased with Mr. Kemp's selection and "electrified" by General Powell's speech. "Then I was driving to Kiwanis," she said, "and I heard a radio report that Kemp was modifying his positions on affirmative action and immigration to go along with Dole, and I said, 'It's already beginning.' "
But if the Republican ticket still has a way to go with women, it has plainly invigorated the faithful among them this week. Cindy Lazor, a vice president of the Stark County Foundation, and Marilyn Thomas Jones, a prominent community volunteer, both feel stronger in their support for Mr. Dole because of the convention. Ms. Jones, a black Republican, a rarity here, was so thrilled about General Powell's speech that she placed a tape recorder by her television to save his words.
Ms. Creighton, the county auditor, and Ms. Brown, a community leader in nearby Alliance, are delegates in San Diego. They said in telephone interviews that the forging of a unified party there had been exciting and revitalizing.
"Abortion?" Ms. Creighton said. "It's not even discussed; it's old news. We heard a rumor that when Christine Todd Whitman was introduced, Kansas and Iowa were going to walk out. The Ohio delegation is right next to them. We were all ready to slide over and take their seats so you couldn't see it on TV. But nothing happened."
Ms. Brown bought several buttons to bring back to Canton that say, "Pro-Dole/Pro-Choice."
Ms. Brown believes that as the election draws closer, abortion will recede as an issue, the economy will predominate, and the Republicans will win if they can convince people that Mr. Dole's pledge to cut tax rates by 15 percent is real and can be accomplished without running up the deficit.
Among those here who must be convinced is Beverly White, a supervisor in the county's department of social services who has been working in welfare programs for 29 years. Ms. White believes in welfare reform and is currently overseeing a program that trains recipients for jobs.
She was pleased by the Republican Congress's effort to overhaul welfare and says that if Mr. Clinton had refused to sign the bill, she would have voted Republican.
But Mr. Clinton has promised to sign it. And now Ms. White cannot see how the Republicans can cut tax rates 15 percent and still provide all the money to educate and train these poor women and finance day care for their children. So, for now at least, Ms. White continues to be part of Mr. Dole's gender-gap problem.
 
An American Place
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 22d article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE PROSPECTS;
Seeds of 2000 Abound, But Which Will Grow?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Each convention is father to the next, even if the child denies its patrimony, as San Diego 1996 has done with Houston 1992.
Much depends, of course, on how things turn out in November. If Bob Dole wins, then the Republican gathering four years from now will be more or less cut and dried. It will be his convention (or, if he decides not to seek re-election, Jack Kemp's), and it will focus on the record he has made in his first term. 
 But suppose he does not win -- not so large a supposition, given Mr. Dole's persistent deficit in the polls. Then a contest for 2000 will begin as soon as this fall's returns have cooled, hopeful against hopeful, philosophy against philosophy. If he does a good job in the Dole campaign, Mr. Kemp will emerge as the early favorite for 2000.
No shoo-in, though. Mr. Kemp's ideas on race and immigration sit uneasily with the party's dominant social conservatives, and that can cause trouble, as demonstrated by his difficulty this week in reconciling his longtime support of affirmative action with Mr. Dole's (and this convention's) opposition to it.
There is a whole list of potential challengers, starting with those who, unlike Mr. Kemp, tried for the Presidential nomination in 1996 and failed.
Most of them appeared on the convention rostrum only in the form of video snippets last night -- some for only a minute or so, not much of a recompense for their months of campaigning. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, facing a tough re-election fight, was up there on the virtual-reality screens, if not on network television, and so was former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, still pegging away on education.
Off the floor, the also-rans were more visible. Mr. Alexander, for example, held two parties to thank workers and contributors for their help. Any message about staying tuned for 2000 had to be subliminal. It is bad political manners to speculate about the next election before this one has even been decided.
"He wants to be a good oarsman in Bob Dole's boat," said an aide, Mel Lukens. "Let's get to November, then we'll see where things stand."
None of that oarsman stuff for Pat Buchanan, and no video cameo, either. Unwelcome as a live speaker for fear he would throw away the script, unwilling to appear on tape, he has assiduously worked the fringes, only grudgingly endorsing Mr. Dole, claiming that it is really "Pat Buchanan's party" that has assembled here and citing the right-wing platform as evidence. Next time, he said at a consolation rally last weekend, the Buchanan brigades would name the candidate, too.
That seems unlikely. In two campaigns, he has had trouble winning more than 30 percent of the primary electorate, with the rest finding his message too raw for comfort, however primally exciting.
But dreams die hard, especially in a year when Bob Dole, twice a loser, finally won the nomination. Dan Quayle, a warm-up speaker tonight, may have another go in 2000, hoping voters will remember him not as the Vice President who often looked as lost as a deer on a highway at night but as the man who launched the now-fashionable "family values" into the American political seas.
The 49-year-old Mr. Quayle might serve as the champion of the social conservatives, including the Religious Right, if they come to view Mr. Kemp as putting too much emphasis on economics and racial harmony and not enough on abortion, school prayer, flag-burning and other issues they consider far more important.
This convention probably marked the end of Presidential ambitions for some. It is hard, for example, to imagine a future in the executive branch for Speaker Newt Gingrich, who only a year or so ago was considering running this time. He came to San Diego with one of the lowest popularity ratings of any active politician; his party not only put him on the rostrum in not-very-prime time, but enlisted him in its effort to spread a smoke screen over his own record. Not a single time did he utter "Contract With America."
At 62, Gov. Pete Wilson's Presidential hopes have apparently ended, as one of his closest aides said, "in a shuddering anticlimax." Re-elected against the odds two years ago, a candidate himself this year, a former Mayor of San Diego, host Governor for this convention, he ended up with no major speaking role after a wrangle with convention producers over his backing of abortion rights.
At the last minute, as a face-saver, he agreed to give a one-minute introduction of Elizabeth Dole, the candidate's wife.
Introduced to much of the country this week have been several prime pieces of political talent, already well known to the Washington cognoscenti, with the potential to contend for the Presidency or Vice Presidency in 2000 or 2004.
Among them are Senator John McCain of Arizona, 59, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, a candid, conscientious conservative with a strong independent streak, who was chosen to nominate Mr. Dole tonight; Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, at 50 a telegenic, less patrician version of his father, who defeated the formidable Ann Richards two years ago and has earned popularity since; and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, 49, who gave a poised, well-calculated platform performance this week, touching on her support for abortion rights but not ramming it down the throat of a convention more conservative than she.
One of the biggest winners of this convention, in terms of realizing his goals, has been Steve Forbes, who spent $35 million of his own considerable fortune on a Presidential campaign that seemed at the time pointless if not masochistic.
But it was he who forced the idea of tax cuts and growth into the primary campaign. When it was clear that Mr. Dole had won, he did all he could to sell his ideas to the prospective nominee, a career budget-balancer who began by scorning Mr. Forbes's supply-side schemes as discredited mumbo-jumbo.
This month, Mr. Dole has promised a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, coupling that with a pledge to balance the budget using the huge additional revenues he says it will produce. A supply-side proposition if ever there was one. If he has not yet advocated a Forbesian flat tax, he has advocated a flatter tax. And he chose as his running mate Mr. Kemp, whom Mr. Forbes would have backed for President had he been willing to run. Not a bad showing for a candidate who carried Delaware and Arizona and lost everywhere else.
Asked if he thought he might be rewarded with the job of Treasury Secretary in a Dole administration, Mr. Forbes left that door open.
And what of Colin L. Powell, the retired general who gave such a galvanizing speech on this convention's opening night? Warily refusing to commit himself to a heavy schedule of campaigning for Bob Dole, he left town early. He might be a candidate for a Cabinet position (State? Defense?) in a Dole administration, or even, just conceivably, in a second Clinton administration, if the President chooses a bipartisan approach.
Whether General Powell is keeping open his options for 2000, or whether he means it when he says that he is as disinclined to enter elective politics as was his hero, George C. Marshall, is a question that would baffle the Cumean Sibyl. But he will remain a political presence, a potential candidate with the potential to steer the Republican Party in a direction very different from its present one.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE SPEECH;
After Months of Fine-Tuning, Dole Gives Some Final Honing to the Speech of His Career

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Bob Dole signed off on his acceptance speech this afternoon after almost four months of editing and redrafting and a last-minute scramble for a new ending.
Mark Helprin, the novelist who wrote Mr. Dole's well-received Senate resignation speech on May 14, handed Mr. Dole the first draft of the speech on April 22, before he wrote the resignation speech. 
 Mr. Helprin, the Cyrano who has helped give poetry to the Kansan of few words, has now left San Diego -- and left Mr. Dole to his last practice session this afternoon with a teleprompter in his hotel room, where the former Senate majority leader has been rehearsing primarily with his teleprompter technician, Pete Bonnefond.
Aides call Mr. Dole's speech the most important of his life. It covers three broad areas -- economics, morals and defense of the nation -- as an effort to define the candidate in a positive way to a guaranteed national audience that seems willing to take a second look.
"It is a broadly thematic speech that does not follow the laundry-list contours of many of these speeches in previous conventions," said John Buckley, Mr. Dole's communications director who has been steeped in the editing ever since Mr. Dole received it April. The speech showcases the candidate's values "even as he defines what his Presidency would accomplish," Mr. Buckley said.
The last time Mr. Dole officially faced the nation for a formal speech was in January, when he gave the Republican response to President Clinton's State of the Union Message. And he bombed.
Ensconced then in his Senate office, Mr. Dole was stilted, his delivery uninspired, the lighting awful. The speech did not sound like him.
Mr. Dole has traveled light years from that frigid night when even his friends blanched at how poorly he came across and worried openly about how he would fare in any verbal venue, particularly in debates against the more polished President Clinton.
Perhaps the most important lesson Mr. Dole has learned is that for a big speech, he cannot just wing it, as has been his custom.
Mr. Dole received a first draft of his acceptance speech from Mr. Helprin as Mr. Helprin was writing his speech of resignation from the Senate. The final draft is similar in structure and tone to the original, but Mr. Dole has been making it his own, winnowing it from its original 45 minutes to suit his sparer style.
"Bob Dole has an aversion to 50-cent words," Mr. Buckley said, "and he will always take a rolling pin to pretense."
Mr. Dole has spent about 15 hours editing the words, primarily with Mr. Helprin and Mr. Buckley. In the last week, Mr. Buckley said, he and Mr. Dole "worked through the speech very aggressively, with him questioning every comma, phrase and clause."
The only crisis came on Tuesday when Mr. Dole decided he still did not have the right ending, and he called in two of his longtime Senate speech writers, Kerry Tymchuck and Richard Norton Smith, who wrote Mr. Dole's eulogy for Richard M. Nixon. They rewrote the final four paragraphs of the acceptance speech.
Mr. Dole has been practicing the speech aloud since late July under the direction of Jack Hilton, the speech coach who has been guiding his delivery since the primaries.
Mr. Buckley said that for much of the last week, Mr. Dole's "primary partnership" was with Mr. Bonnefond, the teleprompter technician, and that the two had rehearsed at a Dole friend's house in the La Jolla section of San Diego to get away from the hubbub of the convention.
Paul Begala, the chief speech writer for Bill Clinton's 1992 acceptance speech, said a difficulty in writing this sort of speech was that so many other people want to insert something, leaving the candidate with "a kitchen-sink amalgam of attempts to placate a variety of friends."
Mr. Begala said he failed Mr. Clinton by not being able to say no to many of those requests.
Mr. Buckley said Mr. Dole had sought to minimize this problem by presenting near-final versions to no more than 10 people.
Still, other problems present themselves. For Mr. Dole, defining himself may not be a simple matter. His record in support of moderate causes combined with a more conservative campaign -- highlighted recently by his giving to to the religious right on abortion -- has left a blurred impression of what he stands for and where he would take the country.
Mr. Dole's thematic challenge, said Theodore C. Sorensen, who wrote many of John F. Kennedy's speeches, is to meld these two images.
"He must rouse the partisan audience in the hall," said Mr. Sorensen, the author most recently of "Why I am a Democrat." "Without applause and cheers, the speech will go over dead. But at the same time he has to appeal to the much broader, cooler, more moderate audience watching on national TV."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: MAN IN THE NEWS;
A Master of Process, Not Philosophy: Robert Joseph Dole

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT and ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
It was his last campaign swing before coming here to accept his party's nomination, and Bob Dole had just risen from his knees at the flower-strewn memorial in Atlanta for the victims of the Olympic park bombing. Surrounded by a forest of cameras and microphones, he was asked what his thoughts had been as he laid down his bouquet of sunflowers.
"I thought about terrorism and people who would injure and kill innocent people for no good reason," Mr. Dole said. "And I thought about the spirit of the Olympics, because the Games did go on, as they should have." 
 He stopped, as if to collect his thoughts. The reporters strained forward, anticipating the dramatic line for the evening news that they knew ought to be coming.
"That's about it," Mr. Dole finally said, arching his eyebrows as the curious silence continued.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Dole will accept the Republican Presidential nomination, something he has sought, off and on, but mostly on, for more than 15 years. The stakes resting on his performance could not be higher. Over the last several months, he has let slip so many opportunities to command voters' attention that his own aides have come to view his acceptance speech as his last chance to convince the electorate to take one more look.
Mr. Dole clearly knows it. The former Senate majority leader began working on his address four months ago. Although he normally chafes at rehearsal, he has spent most of this week practicing the speech, which will be his occasion to carry forward some of the themes he has finally been developing and, much as George Bush had to do in 1988 at his own convention, challenge the perception that he is incapable of rising to this political moment.
But that Mr. Dole should, at this late date in his career, find himself still struggling to define for voters who he is and where he hopes to lead the country may well be more revelatory than anything he says here on Thursday night.
Mr. Dole has spent his entire adult life in politics, running his first campaign, for the Kansas Legislature, when he was a 27-year-old law student. He made his first of three bids for the Presidential nomination in 1980, when even his allies thought he had no chance of winning. Now, at age 73, a time when politicians typically think about retirement, he is still hoping to attain the nation's highest office.
Few in Washington have devoted themselves more fully to the institutions they serve, or have a better command of the way the political process works. For this, Mr. Dole is widely esteemed by his colleagues, who made him the longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history.
Yet for all his drive and experience, Mr. Dole remains evidently uncomfortable with, and even dismissive of, the demands of a modern Presidential campaign.
He is a candidate for the nation's most visible office who is visibly uncomfortable with voters. Though he complains that the public does not know enough about who he really is, he persists in talking about himself in the third person, as if to keep his distance. And though he seems to know that it is required, he avoided, until he presented his tax cut plan just a week before the convention, offering even the most boilerplate campaign rhetoric about an agenda or a vision.
Indeed, throughout his career, Mr. Dole has generally resisted any but the broadest ideological characterization. The former Senator is a master of process more than philosophy, an expert negotiator who seems instinctively, and impatiently, to discount talk about big ideas -- be they from President Clinton or Speaker Newt Gingrich -- as so many words.
Mr. Dole and his associates have tried to cast these limits as a campaigner as a virtue: He is the man who represents action not rhetoric, character not appearance. He is, in short, no Bill Clinton -- and that is a good thing. "There's nothing very fancy about Bob Dole," Mr. Dole said of himself in Toledo, Ohio, one day last spring. "What you see is what you get. And you like it. And I like it."
At the heart of Mr. Dole's candidacy, then, is not so much what he says, or even what he believes, but the years of service he has given his country, starting with the day 51 years ago when he was wounded and almost left for dead in Italy. As one of Mr. Dole's closest associates, Senator John McCain of Arizona, put it, "He feels that his record speaks for himself."
 
A Life of Struggle Marked by Patience
Just before traveling here on Sunday, Mr. Dole took his new running mate, Jack Kemp, into the basement of the modest house in Russell, Kan., where he grew up.
The gesture was stage-managed to underscore Mr. Dole's humble beginnings: for a time during the Depression, the entire Dole family lived in the basement while the rest of the house was rented to an oil prospector. But it also pointed, obliquely, to the broader themes of his biography.
Mr. Dole's life has been structured by struggle, and his political career marked by occasional -- but still widely remembered -- outbursts of bitterness.
Robert Joseph Dole was born on July 22, 1923, about the same time oil was discovered near Russell. Many in town grew prosperous, or at least comfortable, because of oil, but not the Doles. Mr. Dole's father, Doran, ran a cream-and-egg station and later managed the local grain elevator; his mother, Bina, sold Singer sewing machines door-to-door. For much of their childhood, the four Dole children shared one bedroom.
With the help of a loan from a local banker, Mr. Dole entered the University of Kansas, planning to become a doctor. The plan was interrupted, permanently, by World War II. A year after Pearl Harbor, Mr. Dole enlisted, and was eventually assigned to the 10th Mountain Division. He was injured in the hills above the Po Valley on April 14, 1945, just three weeks before the war in Europe ended.
It took him more than three years to recover, and then not completely: he never regained the use of his shattered right arm. Instead, he learned to compensate, and he still allots extra time for the most basic tasks, like buttoning a shirt.
Mr. Dole often speaks of Dr. Hampar Kelikian, the Chicago surgeon who operated on him after the war, as one of the most influential figures in his life. It was Dr. Kelikian who finally convinced Mr. Dole the damage to his arm was irreparable, and the counsel he gave him was not so much inspirational as austere.
"You've got to do more with less," is how Mr. Dole recently recalled it.
Mr. Dole's war injury led, quite directly, to his career in politics. He has wryly repeated the words of the Kansas Republican official who told him: "You got shot, we can get you elected." And in his rise through the party's ranks, which has consumed nearly half a century, he has demonstrated much the same relentless patience he exhibited in dealing with his disability.
Election by election, Mr. Dole worked his way up from the Russell County prosecutor's office to the Republican Presidential nomination, first winning a seat in Congress in 1960, then one in the Senate in 1968 and finally becoming the Senate's Republican leader in 1984.
During his entire career, Mr. Dole never lost a contest in his home state. But there were still notable setbacks and humiliations along the way.
In 1976, for instance, during his race for Vice President with Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Dole was roundly panned for characterizing the two world wars in a debate as "Democrat wars." Afterward, he was widely, though many argue unfairly, blamed for the Republican ticket's loss.
In 1980, when Mr. Dole made his first bid for the Presidential nomination, he received just 607 votes in the New Hampshire primary, coming in not just dead last, but laughably so. Eight years later, in his second bid for the nomination, Mr. Dole made a far more credible showing, but was still best remembered for snapping at Vice President George Bush, "Stop lying about my record."
Announcing his resignation from the Senate this spring, Mr. Dole gave what has been described as one of the most eloquent speeches of his career. In it, he dwelled on the struggles of his life, declaring that "little has come to me except in the hard way." And he described himself as drawn to the Presidency precisely because of the job's enormous burdens.
His campaign, he said, is "about electing a President who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather to its difficulties."
 
A Singular Devotion To Making the Deal
Mr. Dole rarely talks about his "vision" for the country without using a qualifier: "my so-called vision."
Two weeks ago, when Mr. Dole called for a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, and then again last week, when he picked as his running mate Mr. Kemp, one of the nation's leading exponents of supply-side economics, aides argued that Mr. Dole had finally laid questions about his vision to rest.
Both moves were hailed by Republican leaders as energizing and bold, and acknowledged even by Democrats to be politically canny. But both moves were also at odds with Mr. Dole's own often-stated views, favoring deficit-reduction over tax cuts and deriding supply-side economics. And in that sense, they seemed to raise almost as many questions as they answered about who, once again to use Mr. Dole's words, "Bob Dole really is."
To an extent unusual even among national politicians, Mr. Dole has devoted his life to his profession, and has few outside interests. In 1972, he divorced his first wife, Phyllis Holden, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Robin, who is now 41 years old. Mr. Dole has called the marriage a casualty of his devotion to politics. His second wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, whom he married in 1975, is herself an accomplished politician who has held two cabinet posts and is now on leave from her job as president of the American Red Cross.
Asked to characterize Mr. Dole, associates often speak of him as a "legislator," putting extra emphasis on the first syllable. By this, they seem to mean at once that he is an adept lawmaker and that he thinks like one -- valuing the deal as opposed to the ideal. "His view is you go for what you can get," explained Mr. Dole's former chief of staff, Sheila Burke.
The highlights of Mr. Dole's legislative record demonstrate this pragmatic approach.
Despite his long career in the Senate, there are less than a half-dozen major bills that are considered genuinely his. Foremost among these is a 1982 measure that, in contrast his recently announced economic plan, raised taxes to help close the deficit.
What Mr. Dole was most admired for in the Senate were his skills as a deal maker and consensus builder. He was instrumental in bringing liberals and conservatives together on a wide range of issues, and played an important role in expanding the food stamp program in the mid-1970's, in extending the Voting Rights Act in 1982 and in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.
Indeed, that instinct for conciliation was on display again here, as Mr. Dole pushed for a "statement of tolerance" in the Republican platform on the subject of abortion rights, then permitted it to be watered down until it was eventually relegated to an appendix. To reach consensus, here as in the Senate, Mr. Dole allowed his own views to be submerged, and blithely announced on the eve of the convention that he had not even read the platform and would not campaign on it.
Mr. Dole could play the sharp partisan, too, and in his last years as Senate leader, he helped to block many of President Clinton's major initiatives, including the health care package that was Mr. Clinton's main effort in domestic policy. But even as the Republican Party was transformed by an anti-government ideology that helped his party win Congress in 1994, Mr. Dole remained circumspect in his criticism. "You know, the Government does a lot of good things," he said in an interview in June. "So I'm not going in there with a meat ax."
Indeed, Mr. Dole has never seemed comfortable with sweeping theories of any sort. When Senator Dole discussed legislation -- as he did virtually every day, all day -- he rarely spoke in ideological terms, people who worked with him say. Rather, he talked in terms of practical politics: which lawmakers and constituencies would support the measure, and which ones opposed it.
 
An Image Colored By Genuine Reserve
The setting last month was the New York studio of "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee," the guests were Bob and Elizabeth Dole, and the subject was Mr. Dole's search for a running mate. Mr. Dole, asked whom he might pick, tilted his head to the side, and pronounced that the next Republican candidate for Vice President might be no further than a seat away.
"Somebody with experience," Mr. Dole said, glancing over at Regis Philbin. "Somebody who was mature."
Kathie Lee Gifford looked as if she were going to slide off her stool. "Bob Dole -- cracking jokes!" she declared in an astonished tone.
Much to the dismay of his advisers, Mr. Dole's image, just three months before the election, remains a political caricature, composed in nearly equal parts of his often-dour public countenance, his uneasy manner on television, his celebrated public displays of temper, and, finally, his characteristic pose as Senate majority leader -- head bowed and mumbling.
The picture is not so much wrong as it is incomplete. Mr. Dole, in spite of his famous outbursts, is not, generally speaking, mean or ill-tempered. Among his Senate colleagues, he was known for his courteous and even gentlemanly manner. He is, in fact, often very funny, though his particular brand of humor -- dry and caustic one-liners often aimed at himself -- does not translate well into print or television.
Mr. Dole can also be sentimental and, unusual for a man of his generation, emotive enough to weep in public. He did so most recently when he visited the boyhood home of Dwight D. Eisenhower in Abilene, Kan.
Still, Mr. Dole's reserve is genuine, even to the point of seeming forbidding. He does not have a wide circle of friends or even advisers; in a business where people are always looking to present themselves as close to men and women in power, the number of people in Washington who will make that claim about Mr. Dole is surprisingly small. He is uncommunicative with his staff, and when he is disappointed with someone's work, his response is often simply to stop talking to him.
First-time visitors to Mr. Dole's campaign plane are advised that just because Mr. Dole is sitting alone in his seat, staring out the window and drumming the fingers of his left hand on the table -- his public statements to the contrary, there is little evidence that Mr. Dole really spends much time reading Presidential biographies -- it does not mean that he is bored or looking for conversation.
Given his diffidence, it is not surprising that the crowd gathered here to nominate Mr. Dole has thus far shown little of the kind of frenzied excitement that greeted Ronald Reagan in 1980 or even Bill Clinton in 1992. From the start of the campaign, Mr. Dole has consistently drawn polite, but thin and less-than-entirely enthusiastic crowds.
Indeed, with all the noise and the cheers of the convention, it is easy to forget just how tough it was for Mr. Dole to get to this point. Although he was the overwhelming front-runner for the Republican nomination, he lost three out of the first four primary contests. As recently as three weeks ago, party leaders and elected Republicans were publicly complaining that Mr. Dole's campaign was foundering, worried that he would lead his party into a historic defeat against President Clinton this November.
The central paradox of Mr. Dole's campaign is that a man who is so reserved is running on a platform that relies so heavily on his own life. Beyond the economic plan he has so recently embraced, Mr. Dole's candidacy still returns now, as it has throughout his career as a politician, to the argument that his service to country, in war and in Congress, is what makes him the superior candidate. "A Better Man," declares his campaign slogan. "For a Better America."
"The other horse is a little slicker," Mr. Dole likes to tell his audiences, "but you know I'm steady. What you see in Bob Dole is what you get. You get it today. You get it tomorrow. You get it next year."

HEADLINE: MAN HELD IN ROLE IN CROWN HTS. CASE

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Nearly five years after the violent racial clashes that tore through Crown Heights in Brooklyn, Federal law enforcement officials said yesterday that they had arrested a 43-year-old man whom they described as a prime instigator in the unrest that led to the fatal stabbing of a Hasidic scholar.
In an indictment unsealed yesterday, Federal officials charged that the man, Charles Price, had violated the civil rights of the scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum, by urging crowds of young men "to find and attack Jews" in the aftermath of a car accident that killed a 7-year-old black boy. 
 With the indictment, Mr. Price becomes only the second suspect indicted for crimes linked to Mr. Rosenbaum's slaying, although investigators believe that between 10 and 15 people participated in the attack. The other suspect, Lemrick Nelson Jr., was acquitted of murder in a state trial in October 1992, prompting anger and dismay among many of Brooklyn's Hasidic Jews and renewing tensions in the neighborhood.
The day after Mr. Nelson's acquittal, Federal officials began a civil rights investigation into the case in response to pleas by Jewish leaders and elected officials. That investigation led to the indictment of Mr. Nelson in 1994 on Federal civil rights charges, and to the charges now brought against Mr. Price.
Mr. Nelson, now 20, was named along with Mr. Price in yesterday's indictment after the United States Court of Appeals ruled that he should be tried as an adult, not as a juvenile as he was listed in the 1994 indictment. The maximum sentence for a juvenile is five years; for an adult, life in prison.
His lawyer said Mr. Nelson was in a probation "boot camp" in Georgia on an unrelated crime and would probably be arraigned after he completed that program.
Prosecutors said yesterday that the announcement of Mr. Price's indictment, just six days before the fifth anniversary of the crime, was not timed for dramatic effect or to bring the charges before the five-year statute of limitations that applies to most Federal crimes. There is some dispute over whether the statute would apply in this case.
While Mr. Nelson's indictment was expected, the arrest of Mr. Price, an unemployed laborer with a minor criminal record, was a surprise to many.
Federal officials say they now think Mr. Price is the man long sought by investigators after being seen on a videotape urging young men to attack Jews. Investigators would not comment yesterday on who shot the videotape. The tape was apparently made shortly after a Hasidic driver, in a station wagon in a procession including the Rebbe Menachem M. Schneerson, lost control of his car and slammed into a sidewalk, killing 7-year-old Gavin Cato.
The accident set off four days of violence that a state investigator later called "the most extensive racial unrest in New York City in 20 years." There have been political repercussions ever since, with many Jewish leaders complaining that the police, at the direction of Mayor David N. Dinkins, delayed responding to the first reports of unrest. Those complaints became a campaign issue between Mr. Dinkins and his successful opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in the 1993 mayoral race.
Investigators said yesterday it was Mr. Price who had been referred to numerous times in Mr. Nelson's state trial as the "bald black man" who whipped crowds into a frenzy during the unrest and who was also mentioned in a state report on the incident as a man who stood at the corner of President Street and Utica Avenue and shouted: "Do you feel what I feel? Do you feel the pain? What are you going to do about it? Let's take Kingston Avenue!"
But, as with several other instances in which prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to track down suspects, they were never able to identify the man. One senior law enforcement official, who insisted on anonymity, said: "The primary mystery throughout was: Who was he? We wanted to pursue and prosecute as many of the people involved in the incident as we could, as many as was appropriate. But you have to have evidence."
An investigator on the case, who also insisted on anonymity, added, "To a certain extent, there was a calculated, conscious silence on the part of people in the neighborhood about who this person was or might have been."
Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the Brooklyn District Attorney's office provided information that finally led Federal investigators to Mr. Price's door, though neither he nor Charles J. Hynes, the District Attorney, would elaborate yesterday on what that information was or when it was provided. But a senior law enforcement official said that a person being interviewed last year in connection with another crime implicated Mr. Price. Detectives matched Mr. Price's picture from prior arrests with his image on the videotape.
Since the beginning, the Brooklyn District Attorney has been plagued by false starts and failures in the case. In 1994, efforts to indict a man who was believed to have stabbed Mr. Rosenbaum were abandoned after a crucial witness admitted he had not been at the scene of the attack. The year before a 29-year-old, who was also described as a bald black man, accused of being the main instigator of the violence was acquitted by a Brooklyn jury on reduced charges after an hour of deliberations.
Wearing a red and black hooded sweatshirt, camouflage pants and white high-top tennis shoes, Mr. Price was arraigned quickly yesterday afternoon before Chief Magistrate A. Simon Chrein at the United States Courthouse. He pleaded not guilty. Alan Vinegrad, one of two Federal prosecutors on the case, asked that Mr. Price be detained because he was "dangerous and a risk of flight."
Mr. Price's lawyer, Darrell L. Paster, asked for a bail hearing, which was set for Wednesday. Then Mr. Price, who stood completely still and expressionless before the magistrate with his hands folded in front of him, was led away, unhandcuffed, by marshals.
Mr. Paster said later that Mr. Price denied the charges against him and that he was "very confused and very frightened about the situation he is in." He would not comment on whether Mr. Price had been at the scene of the unrest the night that Mr. Rosenbaum was killed, or whether he was the man in the videotape mentioned by prosecutors. But he said Mr. Price "told me that he was not involved in the crime he was accused of."
"He hadn't been questioned about this, and he didn't know he was being considered as a suspect," Mr. Paster said.
Federal officials said Mr. Price had a criminal record that included several misdemeanor arrests and one felony arrest for attempted criminal possession of a weapon.
Mr. Vinegrad, the Assistant United States Attorney, said there was some question about whether the statute would apply. The charges against Mr. Price -- that he violated a person's civil rights, leading to that person's death -- are now covered by the 1994 Federal death penalty law, which has no statute of limitations.
But by filing charges before the fifth anniversary of the death, prosecutors have eliminated the possibility that the case could be challenged over the statute of limitations.
Despite officials' avowals that they were not prompted by the statute of limitations, Mr. Price's lawyer expressed concern that they were. Mr. Paster said, "My concern is that under the pressure of the statute of limitations, there might have been a rush to judgment in identifications of my client."
Mr. Vinegrad denied it. "He was indicted now because we were finished with the investigation," he said.
Because Mr. Rosenbaum's death occurred before the 1994 death penalty law was passed, Mr. Nelson and Mr. Price face maximum penalties of life in prison.
The indictment was actually handed up on Aug. 6, after the Court of Appeals ruling made it possible to add Mr. Nelson to the indictment. But officials only unsealed it yesterday, after they were able to track down and arrest Mr. Price at a boarding house where he lived, on Dean Street in Crown Heights.
The indictment was hailed by Mr. Rosenbaum's family and by Jewish leaders as a victory, but one that came far too slowly and only after relentless pressure on the Federal authorities. "Why has it taken so long?" asked Assemblyman Dov Hikind at a press conference outside the courthouse. "Why haven't more people been taken to justice?"
"Thank you, Janet Reno," he added.
Mr. Rosenbaum's brother, Norman, reached yesterday by phone in Melbourne, Australia, said: "This comes as a pleasant surprise, and certainly something that vindicates the position my family has taken all along. But as far as I'm concerned, this means that out of the group of 30 who we believe attacked Yankel, and urged the attack, there are 28 people still capable of being indicted."
In the case of Mr. Nelson, who was acquitted in state court, his lawyers have argued that indicting him on the Federal charges amounts to double jeopardy under the Constitution. But the courts ruled long ago that a Federal civil rights prosecution in these circumstances does not violate the double jeopardy clause. Under what is known as the "dual sovereignty doctrine," Federal prosecutors are not bound by state verdicts.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: ON THE TICKET;
In New Role, Kemp Fights With His Past Over Ideology

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
After spending most of his political career as a fiscal conservative but social moderate, even maverick, Jack Kemp has publicly reversed himself on issues as touchy as immigration and affirmative action, and is now caught up in an ideological wrestling match with himself to mesh his brand of Republicanism with Bob Dole's more right-leaning brand.
The former New York Congressman, chosen by Mr. Dole as his running mate and selected by acclamation at the party's national convention tonight, acknowledged today that the tug-and-pull was under way -- leaving him lurching back and forth between his old speech-making self and his new running-mate self in public statements here this week. 
 "You're watching a metamorphosis," he said in an interview at the convention's headquarters. "I would be a fool to put my feet down in a position where I can't accommodate metamorphoses."
Mr. Dole favors elimination of affirmative action programs and the withholding of most government services from illegal immigrants.
Mr. Kemp, at least before he became Mr. Dole's Vice-Presidential choice, was a strong supporter of affirmative action and staunchly opposed withholding government services like schooling and medical assistance from illegal immigrants.
But over the course of the last six days, Mr. Kemp has reversed himself on affirmative action and, in an interview published today by The Los Angeles Times, on immigration. Then, after a few hours of publicity about those shifts, Mr. Kemp seemed to shift again.
In the interview, he neither fully embraced the Dole view nor fully gave up his own view. Rather, he came at the two issues elliptically, saying illegal immigration had to be stopped, somehow, and that racial parity had to be found, somehow.
"Obviously, I just can't do the laissez-faire approach I have in the past," he said. But he insisted that the Dole-Kemp views were "reconcilable," and noted that he was far from the first Vice-Presidential candidate to be caught up in an ideological bind with the man at the top of the ticket.
Anyway, he added, Mr. Dole had moved toward him on the issue of tax cuts to improve the economy, something Mr. Kemp has long favored and Mr. Dole, until a few days ago, had long opposed.
The political challenge Mr. Kemp faces is that he must not come across as being at ideological odds with Mr. Dole, yet he must seem to give the Republican ticket a balancing measure of ideological moderation. That balance was a prime reason Mr. Dole reached out to him.
Sitting in his shirt-sleeves in a borrowed office high above the sparkling San Diego Harbor, words pouring out in that inimitable Kemp fashion, like a dictionary going through a corn sheller, Mr. Kemp insisted there was absolute unity on the Dole-Kemp ticket. "But unity does not require uniformity," he said.
What about withholding services from illegal immigrants and eliminating affirmative action?
Mr. Kemp considered the question once again, and this time chose to come at it from the side, saying that the best way to solve the illegal immigration problem was to "close the door of illegal immigration so that we can keep the door of legal immigration open."
In some earlier statements this week Mr. Kemp indicated that he favored withholding government services, such as schooling, from illegal immigrants. But he pulled up short of that today, saying instead that he believed illegal immigration could be slowed by increased checking of credentials and birth records and that the slowing could be accomplished without turning "California or the country into a police state."
"My life is not about 187," he said, referring to Proposition 187, the 1994 California ballot initiative that called for withholding such services and prompted calls for Federal legislation that would do the same.
As for affirmative action, Mr. Kemp in recent days has indicated support for the California ballot initiative that would eliminate all affirmative action programs based or race or sex, an initiative Mr. Dole has endorsed and one, like Proposition 187, that also has prompted calls for similar Federal legislation.
But today Mr. Kemp did not directly embrace the initiative, preferring instead to cite his close ties to the nation's blacks and to call racial and ethnic reconciliation "one of the single greatest goals of this country on the eve of the 21st century."
He also said Mr. Dole had promised him that the coming campaign would not be racially charged or divisive, and said he was "comfortable" with that.
"Obviously, I would want to accommodate myself to the party that is going to choose me, hopefully, to be Vice President," he said. "I can't go out and freewheel and be an independent wildcatter like I was when I was in the House. I've got to be myself, though."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Speeches by Sen. McCain and Gov. Pataki Nominating Dole and Kemp

BYLINE: Associated Press 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Following are the remarks tonight by Senator John McCain of Arizona and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, at the Republican National Convention:
 
Remarks by Mr. McCain
In America we celebrate the virtues of the quiet hero; the modest man who does his duty without complaint or expectation of praise; the man who listens closely for the call of his country, and when she calls, he answers without reservation -- not for fame or reward, but for love. He loves his country. 
 Tonight, my friends, we come to celebrate such a man, and bestow upon him the greatest honor our party is empowered to grant -- our nomination for the President of the United States. But our purpose is not only to give tribute to this man -- though a fitting tribute it is. Our purpose is much larger than that. Our purpose is our country's greatness, which we mean to preserve by offering to this nation the leadership of the man from Russell, Kan.
Tonight we ask Bob Dole to answer his country's call again, and stand a post for America, the first post of the land, not for his sake, but for ours; not for his glory, but for the dreams we dream for our children, and for the dreams they will dream for theirs.
We nominate Bob Dole for President because he is a man of honor, a man of firm purpose and deep commitment to his country's cause. We nominate Bob Dole for president because this nation deserves better than the aimless direction we have endured for four years. We nominate Bob Dole for President because we will not take our leave of this century without affirming to the world that America -- blessed, bountiful, beautiful America -- will remain what she has always been: "the last best hope of earth."
Ours is not a blind conceit for a country that's been good to us. We have heard the voices of those who have yet to share in the promise of America.
But Bob Dole wants to lead an America where every father's child can do as well as his father's child has done, because he knows in his heart how great is the promise of America, how generous is the dream of America, how just is the cause of America.
The Americans who fought in the second World War came home to the G.I. Bill and a booming economy. They immediately began building prosperous lives and a better nation. They used their opportunities to create greater opportunities for other Americans. And they gave a name to this century. They call it the American century.
Like a lot of guys, Bob Dole went to war for his country's sake, and he came home a little bit broken by the experience. He had to rebuild himself before he could build his career. But he didn't do it alone. He had a lot of help. He had a family that never let him down. He had a lot of friends and neighbors in Russell who gave what little money they had to help pay for Bob's recovery. They were good people, these Kansans -- the very best. Many of them are gone now, but I know Bob sees their faces every day. Every day. He knows what he owes them.
They gave him hope. And they told him to serve the hopes of others. This is what Bob Dole has done all his life. In his plain-spoken, dignified way Bob has carried our deepest cares and held our brightest hopes. And that, my friends, is why the American people will elect this decent, honorable man to lead this great country to the next American century.
Others, others may offer you sound bites and showmanship. But Bob Dole offers you leadership -- leadership, leadership evident in the stature of a man who risked his life for love of country, and considers service to America his honor.
All I want you to believe about Bob Dole is that he gets his vision from you. Your hopes are his mission. Your cares are his cause. Your dreams are his purpose and your country is the love of his life. America, we cannot spare this man.
I have had the honor in my life of being commanded by a great many brave, resourceful and decent leaders, but none more so than my friend, Bob Dole. A long time ago, in another walk of life, I was deprived of my liberty. The brave men I served with there wanted nothing more than to keep faith with our country and for our country to keep faith with us.
When the United States Senate tried to cut off funding for the war in Vietnam before America's prisoners of war were released, Bob Dole led the opposition. For seven weeks, for seven weeks he forcefully debated the measure and succeeded in preventing America from leaving the field while so many of her sons remained the prisoners of our enemies. All the while he waged that debate, all the while he waged that debate, Bob Dole wore a P.O.W. bracelet that bore my name.
I never knew that Bob had done me that great honor until very recently. Bob never told me he wore my bracelet. He never sought my thanks. He never imposed on me an obligation to him for the support he gave me at a time when I needed it most. I learned of it, just last winter during a debate on Bosnia, when Bob mentioned it only to emphasize the point that no matter how strong our opposition to the President's policy, we must never let our troops doubt for a second that they had the full support of the United States Congress and people.
Although Bob Dole never asked me for recognition for his kindness to me, I have felt since learning of it, that this modest, good man deserved from me a heartfelt expression of gratitude. I wish to do so now. For myself, for my comrades who came home with me to the country we loved so dearly, and for the many thousands who did not: Thank you, Bob, thank you for the honor of your concern and support. We fought in different wars, but we keep the same faith. I shall always be grateful.
As a down payment on my gratitude, I am privileged to render you a small service this evening, but, by so doing, I render a far greater service to my country by placing before this convention, the name of my friend, the honorable Robert Dole of Russell, Kansas, in nomination for the presidency of the greatest nation on earth.
God bless you, Bob, and God bless America.
 
Remarks by Mr. Pataki
What a great convention.
And I have more good news this evening. I even have good news for President Clinton. Mr. Clinton, next year Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are going to cut your taxes 15 percent.
To my fellow Republicans, to all Americans, the good news is that Jack Kemp is going to make a great Vice President.
With Jack Kemp as Bob Dole's Vice President, we will have two leaders who are firmly committed to smaller government, to lower taxes, and to a better America.
Jack Kemp is a man with a vision for America, a vision of optimism that's grounded, not in government, but in a fundamental faith in the American people and the human spirit.
And how Jack Kemp can articulate that vision.
How many times, how many times, has Jack Kemp talked about tax cuts, enterprise zones, free markets, strong families and progressive conservatism.
What does this mean? It means hope. It means growth. It means opportunity. It means a better America for everyone, from the barrios to the boroughs, and across every corner of America.
It was Jack Kemp with Ronald Reagan who led the fight to reduce taxes. Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp knew then the simple truth most Americans now recognize. If Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money, they can be trusted to spend and invest it far more wisely than government.
That's a policy that Bill Clinton rejects, but time and again Americans have proven Jack Kemp right. Proven that it is their ambition to reach for the American dream that sparks opportunity, and builds a healthy economy. Tax cuts mean jobs -- new jobs that allow our families to achieve the American dream.
When Bob Dole and Jack Kemp announced they would cut taxes by 15 percent and they would balance the budget, do you know what Bill Clinton said?
He said, you can't do that. You can't cut taxes like that. You know, Mr. Clinton, for once, you're right. You can't cut taxes. You can't balance the budget. But we can. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp can. And Bob Dole and Jack Kemp will.
Jack Kemp is a messenger of optimism, a good and decent man. A man of integrity and compassion. A man who cares deeply about all Americans.
It is Jack Kemp who led the fight for enterprise zones so that the party of Lincoln could ensure that the American dream would be within the grasp of all Americans. Jack Kemp knows that we can't succeed unless we succeed together. We don't succeed unless all Americans of all races and all religions have access to the American dream.
That's why, that's why the Kemp legacy still echoes so loudly in our great state of New York. As we all know, as we all know, Jack Kemp played a little football. He started here in San Diego and ended up in Buffalo, where twice he quarterbacked the Bills to a league championship.
In football, quarterbacks have one mission, to move the ball forward, to move it down the field, and to score. Going side to side gets you nowhere.
Going side to side, fumbling, running reverses to fool the people as the Clinton government has done for the last four years, has led our country nowhere.
It's time, It's time for a better team. Tonight, we bring together two winners. A team that combines the leadership, the experience, integrity and honor of Bob Dole, with the vigor, the vision, the ideas and ideals of Jack Kemp.
I'm proud to call Jack Kemp my friend. I'm proud to call Jack Kemp a New Yorker. And I and all Americans will be proud to call Jack Kemp Mr. Vice President.
I am honored to nominate Jack Kemp as the next Vice President of the United States.

HEADLINE: Battle Lines in a War on Noise Lie Just Beyond the Runway;
Nearby Queens Residents Unite to Take On Airports

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Bill Mulcahy, a retired city firefighter, was enjoying the warmth of a recent sunny morning in his backyard in Queens. His father-in-law sat at a table under an umbrella and his niece lazily dangled her toes in a shallow, plastic pool. This, Mr. Mulcahy said, is the good life.
Then a jet suddenly appeared in the sky, shattering Mr. Mulcahy's quiet retirement. The plane passed over Jamaica Bay and soared above the Mulcahys' two-story house in Rockaway Beach, the roar of its engines smothering conversation. 
 "That was from Runway 31-L," Mr. Mulcahy yelled, his arms akimbo, his eyes resentful and glued to the plane as it flew toward the Atlantic Ocean. "It had to make almost a 180-degree turn over Jamaica Bay to go over us."
Most people living near Kennedy and La Guardia Airports might shrug off the din after a while. But in a city filled with neighborhood agitators and block revolutionaries, Mr. Mulcahy, 51, belongs to a particular Queens subculture: those who hate the airports but refuse to move. They memorize the designation of each runway and publish newsletters against the airports, with a feistiness that puts them on a first-name basis in Borough Hall, at the Federal Aviation Administration offices in Washington and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey atop the World Trade Center.
Three years ago, Mr. Mulcahy co-founded Sane Aviation For Everyone. Flanked by a former Roman Catholic priest from Rego Park and a septuagenarian podiatrist from Howard Beach, he has waged a relentless, sometimes colorful, campaign against airplane noise in news releases and marches, on public access television and the Internet.
The group is part of an increasingly sophisticated network of noise protesters who fax and E-mail one another studies and bills relating to their cause. From Queens to Seattle to Sydney, Australia, they share strategies on how to lobby politicians and battle their common enemies -- airports, airlines and government aviation officials.
"You become so involved because every rock you turn over, you find something nastier," said Jack Saporito, the director of the Alliance of Residents Concerning O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. "This has become a full-time job. I used to have a small marketing company, and it's gone straight to pot." And so Mr. Saporito, 49, now works four hours a night as a janitor to "keep himself above water."
He and the others view themselves as crusaders against a neglected form of pollution: noise. They say they fight on behalf of apathetic neighbors. They want fewer nighttime landings and takeoffs or higher-altitude routes over their roofs or different paths altogether. Their critics see them, at best, as gadflies and, at worst, as conspiracy-mongers whose identities are dependent on the airports they hate.
Noise protesters are rallying these days against Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which plans to add a third runway, and the new Denver International Airport, which opened last year. But the New York area, where a third of the airplane-noise-affected people in the nation live, seems the epicenter of the debate.
Relief comes for only a few and then for only two weeks near the end of the summer, when the United States Open prompts the routing of flights around the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows. But moving flight patterns out of one neighborhood only puts them in another.
The Port Authority estimated in 1994 that 211,000 people, or more than 10 percent of Queens residents, were "noise impacted," living close enough to the borough's two major airports that the average ground noise level from planes was above 65 decibels.
A jet taking off usually registers more than 100 decibels, using the standard measurement for the relative loudness of a sound. Some residents live so near to La Guardia that the average ground noise level around their homes (between 30 and 40 decibels during quiet moments) reaches more than 75 decibels, the equivalent of a car alarm. But the majority of those affected by jet noise at the two New York airports endure between 65 and 70 decibels -- enough for many schools to have qualified for funds to soundproof their walls and windows.
Houses near the airports stand a stone's throw from runways. Jets land and take off, as if a few feet above rooftops, rattling walls and windows, temporarily blotting out the sun, stopping people in mid- . . . . La Guardia disturbs more people, but the summer raises the noise to its peak at Kennedy. International travel increases. Jets need more power when the weather is hot. Residents' windows are open.
The situation begs the question: why do these people stay?
Why should they move, asks Allan Greene, the podiatrist who helped start the Sane Aviation group and has lived in a two-story house in Howard Beach since 1964. "There are old houses here built before the airport was ever here."
Mr. Greene, who dedicates three hours a day to airplane noise, said he suddenly became deaf in his left ear in 1989. "The doctors claimed it was viral," he said. "They don't know. I tried to get them to say it was aircraft noise, but they wouldn't commit themselves."
If Mr. Greene describes himself as Sane Aviation for Everyone's whip, Frans C. Verhagen is its spiritual leader. After serving as a missionary priest in Ghana, the Dutch-born Mr. Verhagen became interested in ecology at Columbia University in the 1970's. He said he eventually "evolved out" of the priesthood, then married and taught environmentalism at the New York Institute of Technology and junior high schools.
Unlike the others, Mr. Verhagen, 60, lives in Rego Park, midway between the two airports. "Our organization is about far more than working toward noise mitigation," he said. "Noise policies represent only the tip of the ecological iceberg of neglect by the industrial technological paradigm of a mechanistic world view."
The group had trouble focusing early on. When four of its members met with Representative Nita M. Lowey a year ago, she listened to them for 15 minutes. Then, she asked what they wanted her to do.
"We didn't have an answer," Mr. Greene recalled. "It took us by surprise. We thought she would come up with an answer."
Since then, the group has retained Patrick Russell, a lawyer representing several antinoise groups on the East Coast and in Denver. One, a coalition of 208 communities in northern New Jersey, has waged one of the longest and fiercest campaigns since routes out of Newark International Airport were changed in 1987 and sent planes over virgin territory.
"Focus on noise!" Mr. Russell exhorted the Queens group during a recent meeting when someone had suggested tackling air pollution. Mr. Russell urged them to get a list of registered voters near the airports. Contact civic leaders. Create a new group, New York Citizens for Environmental Research, to unite members from Brooklyn, Long Island and Westchester County.
Antinoise forces organized in the last decade after the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 led to a boom in flights. Built in the propeller age, airports were overwhelmed. Only one, Denver, has opened since 1974.
For Mr. Saporito, it all began in 1986. He moved away from an apartment half a mile from O'Hare to the suburb of Arlington Heights, 12 miles away, seeking quiet. But a runway extension a few years later sent planes his way, he said, and two years ago, he started his protest group with only 26 members. Today, the mailing list totals 1,200, he said, with each household paying $10.
Last month, Mr. Saporito, a Vietnam War veteran, reckoned he made 800 telephone calls, working up to 80-hour weeks. So complete is his devotion that he used to talk to his daughter on the phone twice a day but has not heard her voice in two weeks. Worse yet, his noise-protest efforts stopped him from spending as much time as he wanted last year with his dying mother.
People also began to regard noise as a form of pollution that might reduce the value of their homes and harm their health. Arline L. Bronzaft, a former professor of psychology with the City University of New York who has studied the effects of noise on learning and has worked with the Queens antinoise group, said no one has been willing to finance a comprehensive study of airport noise.
"The attitude toward the impact of airport noise now is comparable to the attitude toward cigarette smoking 30 years ago," she said.
The paradox for airport officials is the number of noise-affected people has dropped in recent years, they say. Quieter planes and new flight patterns have reduced the residents affected by the Port Authority's three major airports from 2 million two decades ago to 250,000 two years ago. By the year 2000, when airlines are required to convert their entire fleets to a new generation of jets, the number should go down again.
But no one expects the issue to disappear, especially in New York, the world's most congested airspace.
As David Plavin, president of the Airports Council International, a trade group for airports and a former head of airports for the Port Authority, put it: "It's a class issue. It's a political issue. It's a racial issue. It's an economic issue."
Mr. Mulcahy, surrounded by stacks of documents on Kennedy Airport in his bedroom, shook his finger at a map of the Rockaways. Although the aviation authorities are supposed to fan the routes over the peninsula, the planes avoid the wealthier, white communities west and east of his neighborhood, he said.
Even with fanning, which started in 1995, the Port Authority said Mr. Mulcahy's area, a straight shot from one of the runways, will inevitably draw more of the flights.
Mr. Mulcahy moved to this outpost of the New York empire after working for several years at a fire station nearby. He has no plans to move.
His wife wants him to make money from the thousands of dollars he has spent on computer equipment. But for him, the message of airport noise is more important. To spread it beyond New York, he created a Web page (http://pages.prodigy.com/ NY/rockaway/safe.html) and bombarded several Internet news groups with his views.
Many attacked him, some with surprising venom. Someone even created a news group (alt.aviation. bill-mulcahy.screech.babble.drool) just to ridicule his views on aviation. Mr. Mulcahy regarded all that as part of the Internet's Wild West culture.
But he was disappointed that the news group had recently become a no man's land to which the only visitors were pornography peddlers. He couldn't interest any of them in airplane noise.

HEADLINE: The Pitfalls in Home-Care Policies

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
IT sounds indispensable: long-term care insurance that covers domestic help and personal-care services so that frail elderly people can remain in their own homes.
Advertisements for such policies, like the one in the August issue of Money magazine, promise "a surprisingly affordable way to guarantee yourself access to higher-quality home care without having to rely on your life savings." 
 Consumers, frightened by the prospect of entering a nursing home, bought 4.8 million long-term care policies that included in-home services in 1995, up from 1.9 million in 1990, according to the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group. A typical policy for a healthy 65-year-old cost about $3,000 a year.
But there may be a sizable gap between what consumers think they bought and the help they will actually receive when they need it. And truly comprehensive coverage often exceeds a family's ability to pay.
Most policies will not provide immediate at-home help after a broken hip because so-called homemaker benefits do not go into effect until 60 to 100 days after a hospital stay. Most policies would not help someone who had simply lost the ability to get in and out of the bath; strict criteria must be met before such help is provided.
In-home benefits are "the most misunderstood element of today's long-term care policies," said Gail Holubinka, director of the New York State Partnership for Long-Term Care, a public-private program that works to bring down insurance costs. "They may be of less use than you expect, unless you have some family backup, too."
Long-term insurance used to cover only nursing-home care or in-home care after discharge from a nursing home. But critics noted that what most older people in declining health really needed was help with domestic chores and with dressing and bathing. Why require hospitalization before benefits kick in? they asked; the onset of physical or mental decline rarely happens that way.
So, insurers began offering policies with two parts. The first part offered in-home care benefits that usually pay $100 a day for help with personal and domestic chores. Most policies require that the helper be hired through a licensed home-health agency, costing $15 to $25 an hour.
The second part of a policy is the nursing-home benefit, usually $200 a day. (Nursing homes in the New York area cost about $250 a day, according to the Partnership for Long-Term Care.)
But are a few hours of help a day truly what an elderly person needs to keep functioning? Dr. Leslie Libow, chief of medical services at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in New York, described the needs of two recent patients.
The first was an 86-year-old widow living alone in a Manhattan apartment. She had lost most of her vision and was unsteady on her feet. By having a helper come in each day for three hours to wash and dress her, make some food and take her on brief walks, the woman was able to stay in her home for about three years longer than had been expected.
The typical policy would have been sufficient for this woman, but, Dr. Libow added, the woman could get by on so little help because her daughter lived nearby and visited each day.
A second case involved an obese woman of 78 who had severe neurological problems that left her so short of breath she had trouble getting out of bed and feeding herself. Her arms and legs were weak. But she wanted to stay at home with her husband, who was also quite frail. Home help was needed for at least eight hours each day.
In this sort of case, the average benefit would have fallen short. Hiring a helper for eight hours would cost $120 to $200 a day at agency rates.
In spite of such drawbacks, Dr. Libow said he found the advances in in-home coverage "impressive." Though he acknowledged that there are obstacles to widespread use, he said he believed that "as families become more facile at putting these policies into action, the better it will be."
To activate a policy, policyholders must get confirmation from a doctor that they have lost the ability to perform two or more of the following by themselves: eating, bathing, dressing, moving without falling, moving from a bed to a chair and getting to the toilet. Many insurance companies send their own representative to confirm the diagnosis.
"It has to be far more serious than people expect," Ms. Holubinka said. "It not just a matter of not being able to button your sweater."
A live-in companion may be of the most use to the elderly in the early stages of decline, said Cathy Cress, president of Cress Care Management for Elders of Monterey, Calif. Yet, a companion, costing $150 a day, rarely qualifies for reimbursement.
How, then, to make an informed decision? A good source for counseling is the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers in Tucson, Ariz.; (520) 881-8008.
To reduce premiums, experts say, long-term care policies should be bought before age 60. Consider examples offered by Gerie Charnow of Huntington, L.I., a geriatric-care manager, who also sells long-term care insurance.
A 55-year-old New York woman in good health would pay around $1,880 a year for a policy from John Hancock that provided $200 a day for nursing-home care and $100 a day for homemaker services, either of which could last six years. A comparable policy from the Travelers Insurance Company would cost $1,470. If the same woman bought the policy at age 65, she would pay $3,500 from Hancock and $2,700 from Travelers.
At 55, it is also relatively inexpensive to reduce the waiting period for home-care benefits to go into effect, which could make a big difference. For instance, if the 55-year-old woman were to drop from a 60-day to a 20-day waiting period, her annual premiums would rise only $90 at Travelers, $218 at Hancock. To do that at 65 is much more expensive.
Some of the best deals in policies are offered in states that have public-private collaborations like the New York State Partnership for Long-Term Care (888 697-7582). The 65-year-old woman could get a Hancock policy through the Partnership for $2,500 a year, about 30 percent less.
Consider, too, companies that offer direct cash benefits for home care instead of reimbursement. First Unum Life Insurance Company of Portland, Ore., is one. Although premiums are higher -- the same 65-year-old New York woman would pay $3,600 for her Unum policy -- the net cost could be lower because the woman could hire helpers without going through an agency.
"You could even use the money to pay a daughter or son to care for you," said Tracy Sherman, a Unum spokeswoman.
A policy should have an inflation rider of at least 5 percent a year, experts say, and benefits should last at least three years. And it should cover respite care (to allow a family member a break) and adult day care, should outside services become more practical.
If the cost does not put you in the poor house, it could be a good idea to bring the daily benefits for home-based care up to the level of nursing-home care. Most policies incorporate only half the amount. Another way to maximize benefits is with policies that allow "pooling." If home help is needed only five days a week, the weekly sum of $700 is divided over five days.
Finally, "never be persuaded to buy more than you can comfortably afford," said Bonnie Burns, a consumer consultant in Santa Cruz, Calif. You could be paying for services you might never use.

HEADLINE: The New Car Market's Lost Generation;
Auto Industry Struggles to Satisfy the Tastes of First-Time Buyers on a Budget

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: MONROE, Mich.

 BODY:
Kristin M. Anson, a 31-year-old radiology technician, and her husband, Bill, a 35-year-old truck driver, really want to buy a new full-size, option-laden Dodge pickup for upward of $25,000. But after carefully reviewing their pinched budget, they have decided instead to keep the 1989 Mercury Cougar they bought in 1992 for $9,900.
What irks them is that Mrs. Anson's older brother, who is a 45-year-old power plant foreman, has been able to afford a succession of new cars and trucks. "It's aggravating that I work just as hard, if not harder, but the rewards do not come as easily as they do for people born 10 years earlier," Mrs. Anson said, balancing her 19-month-old daughter, Samantha, on her right hip at the county fair in this blue-collar town, some 40 miles south of Detroit. 
 Mrs. Anson is not the only one annoyed by the harsher financial realities faced by the 35-and-under generation. Increasingly, domestic and foreign auto makers worry that Americans born in the 1960's and early 1970's are proving a much less prosperous market than the graying baby boomers of the 1950's.
In response, the car companies are rethinking vehicle design and marketing strategies, aiming to match less expensive cars and small trucks with buyers who cannot keep up financially with their older brothers and sisters.
As Honda Motor tries to hold prices level for redesigned vehicles like the Civic coupe, it has hired authors of books about young people's finances to help it decide what features to omit. Ford Motor actually lowered prices on some versions of its Escort when it restyled the small car this spring. And General Motors and Ford both plan to go after the youth market by designing compact sport utility vehicles that could sell for under $15,000 with off-the-shelf engineering.
Indeed, the need to hold down costs for younger buyers -- who now account for a bit more than a quarter of new-car sales, a slowly eroding share -- is one reason that Detroit's Big Three are reluctant to grant significant pay and benefit increases in talks with the United Automobile Workers this fall.
Advertising campaigns are also being tweaked. After concluding that more and more buyers of Jeep Wranglers were turning to parents and grandparents for the money, Chrysler softened its rough-and-tumble cowboy theme this spring, said Thomas R. Krehbiel, a managing partner at Chrysler's advertising firm, Bozell Worldwide, a unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt Inc.
Now, Chrysler's television commercials show 20-year-olds sitting around campfires in serene wilderness, with Wranglers parked nearby. A new radio spot features a young woman driving a Wrangler with a dozing mother-in-law in the back. Wrangler prices start at $13,995, making it one of the few vehicles cheap enough to sell extremely well to young buyers.
At such prices, though, the vehicles being marketed to younger drivers cost far more than the classic first cars of the past. In 1951, for example, a Volkswagen Beetle listed for $1,280 -- or $7,626 in today's dollars.
"The whole industry, domestic and nondomestic, shares a concern with respect to affordability," said Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman. "You can't allow the pricing of our products to move beyond the market."
Car makers are far from alone in trying to cope with the profound economic changes set in motion by the aging of the baby-boom generation. That group's huge numbers left a dearth of well-paying jobs for those who followed, including the last of the boomers, who were born in the early 1960's. The impact is being felt from the fashion business to the home-building industry.
And the concerns may only grow as the younger generation grows older. When baby boomers begin retiring over the next couple of decades, experts predict that the next generation will be unable to fill the boomers' shoes. For car makers, that would mean fewer sales of the more expensive -- and profitable -- vehicles that mark middle age.
Demographics can cut both ways, of course. Some economists have found evidence that the youngest Americans now entering the work force -- those born when the birth rate bottomed out in the mid-1970's -- may be doing better financially because they are in relatively short supply. Detroit's marketers are already studying the buying preferences of this group -- for instance, interviewing students on spring break in Daytona Beach, Fla.
For now, though, the car makers have their hands full trying to satisfy those born in the 60's and early 70's, a demanding constituency that may have little to spend but does not want anything that looks cheap or cuts corners on reliability and safety.
So far, Detroit's record has been spotty, with high fixed costs for engineering and factory work making it hard to offer cars under $10,000 and sport utility vehicles under $15,000. Starting prices on Dodge and Plymouth Neons, which are marketed as first new cars, are jumping $500, to $10,895, for the coming model year. And some of the least expensive cars, like Ford's diminutive three-door Aspire, which sells for $9,530, are having trouble attracting buyers, who are put off by the lack of space and style, among other things.
Because of the dollar's long slide, foreign car makers, too, have had a hard time producing inexpensive vehicles that meet the quality demands of young buyers. For example, Toyota Motor has just introduced a compact sport vehicle, the RAV4, which is aimed at young buyers but sells for $15,368 to $18,518 before options.
The hand-wringing over affordability and young buyers represents a sharp U-turn for car makers after years of catering to people born in the 1950's, the nation's largest generation and one of the most prosperous. It was this group that fueled the market for small pickup trucks in the early 80's and then, as it began producing its own mini-boom of babies, created the mini-van market almost overnight. Now, these drivers are buying extraordinary numbers of large sport utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the GMC Suburban. More than half of all industry profits come from mini-vans and sport utility vehicles.
But ask auto executives about the generation born in the 1960's and they grow grim.
A few statistics from Census Bureau data and other sources demonstrate the scale of the problem. When the children of the 1940's were aged 25 to 34 in 1974, they needed to work an average of only 21.7 weeks to afford a typical car -- just a week longer than the average then for Americans of all ages. When the children of the 50's were the same ages in 1984, they needed to work 31.9 weeks, or three weeks longer than the national average.
But when the children of the 60's were the same ages in 1994, they needed 36.2 weeks, or nearly five weeks longer than the average.
General Motors has been tracking this sort of data for years, keeping it in mind while designing fairly affordable cars like the Chevrolet Cavalier.
G.M. also takes elaborate steps to measure the popularity of certain options against the cost of making them standard. The analyses have persuaded the company to make antilock brakes optional on a growing number of low-priced models, like the Geo Metro, said Robert L. Bierley, G.M.'s director of truck planning. At the same time, G.M. is scrambling to install passenger-side air bags on all its cars and light trucks because the demand by young people for second air bags is strong relative to the cost.
In re-engineering vehicles to keep costs down, the biggest changes involve making novel use of existing parts, like putting suspension systems from today's cars on future sport utility vehicles. Auto makers are also trying to cut costs in smaller ways -- not painting fuel tanks, for instance, and choosing less expensive fabrics for seats and carpets.
Meanwhile, the financing arms of the auto companies are trying to address the affordability issue with long-term leases and stretched-out loans that reduce monthly payments. The big auto makers also have discount programs for recent college graduates.
One of the biggest questions confronting product planners is whether to stick with their current efforts to design more affordable sport utility vehicles, like the small Wrangler. The alternative is to switch to making even lower-priced cars, which can be cheaper than almost any sport vehicle.
Market surveys show that the younger the buyers, the more they want sport utility vehicles, said James N. Hall, a consultant at Auto Pacific Group, a marketing firm in Santa Ana, Calif. But not all cheap sport vehicles sell well; dealers have large inventories of unsold Geo Trackers.
The latest convert to generational analysis is Ford, which ran into trouble selling its redesigned and more expensive Taurus sedan last autumn. "We're really taking all of this data into our new products," said George E. Manning, Ford's strategy manager for corporate design.
What Ford and others are finding is that the younger buyers are not all the same. While the Mazda Miata is popular among the children of the 1960's, more practical vehicles like Saturns have been hits among the children of the early 70's, a period sometimes known as the Baby Bust because of its sharp decline in births. "The trailing-edge baby boomers would be more likely to trade off something practical for something cuter, while a baby buster would have nothing to do with that," Mr. Manning said.
Some industry executives profess not to be very concerned about affordability. John R. Watts, Honda's assistant manager of product planning, noted the rising number of young Americans living with their parents long after college and contended that these men and women might spend more money on cars and trucks, rather than less.
Other executives point out that the rise in income inequality in the United States, which has been particularly pronounced among young people, will allow them to at least sell large, high-profit sport utility vehicles to the most affluent younger buyers.
Peter Cansler, a 28-year-old data processing director in Milwaukie, Ore., just bought his first new vehicle, a 1996 GMC Sierra pickup. He reasoned that the $25,000 vehicle would hold most of its resale value because late-model pickups are in short supply. "I figure I can drive it for a year and only lose $1,000," he said.
More typical, though, are people like Neil and Kathryn Kramer, both born in 1969, who went looking for a car in late July. He earns $30,000 a year as a dispatcher for the sheriff's office here in Monroe, a job he found four years ago after six months of unemployment. She earns $18,000 from a clerical job at the county courthouse. They have a 6-year-old son, Nicholas, and recently bought an $85,000 house. So the prospect of spending close to $20,000 for a midsize sedan appalled them.
Instead, they paid $10,900 for a 1995 Oldsmobile Achieva.
"I can't afford a new one right now," Mr. Kramer said. "I can get a better deal on a used one that's a year or two old."

NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND
An Affectionate Portrait of Britain
By Bill Bryson
324 pages. William Morrow & Company. $25.
 As the title of this book suggests, the American writer Bill Bryson has not written your usual sort of travelogue. He has not tried to give us a dispassionate assessment of contemporary Britain or a reportorial tour of its cities and provinces. What he has written instead is an unabashed love letter, an affectionate inventory of the virtues of his adopted homeland.
 Having lived in Britain for nearly two decades, Mr. Bryson decided last year to make a sort of farewell tour of the island, before returning home to the United States with his wife and children. He would spend several weeks traveling about the country, from London down to the south coast and north through Manchester and Liverpool to Scotland; along the way, he would make some casual notes and try to dissect his abiding love for the country. The resulting book is an engaging, if somewhat self-indulgent, antidote to Paul Theroux's dyspeptic 1983 volume, "The Kingdom by the Sea." 
 Whereas Mr. Theroux saw poverty, unemployment, violence and dullwittedness, Mr. Bryson sees optimism, humor and achievement. He loves the country's curious pronunciation of words (Cholmondeley as "Chumley," Belvoir as "Beaver"). He loves its genius for names (prisons named Wormwood Scrubs and Strangeways; villages named White rashes, Mockbeggar and Blubberhouses).
Perhaps most of all, he loves its "incidental civilities": "cheery red mailboxes, drivers who actually stop for you at pedestrian crossings, lovely forgotten churches with wonderful names like St. Andrew by the Wardrobe and St. Giles Cripplegate, sudden pockets of quiet like Lincoln's Inn and Red Lion Square, interesting statues of obscure Victorians in togas, pubs, black cabs, double-decker buses, helpful policemen, polite notices, people who will stop to help you when you fall down or drop your shopping, benches everywhere."
Although Mr. Bryson glosses over many of Britain's problems, he is not a complete Pollyanna. In the course of his travels, he notes that northern Britain lost more than a million jobs during the early 1980's and that scores of factories have closed. Anonymous concrete and glass edifices have sprung up around the country, he says, and many small English towns have become indistinguishable from one another: "They all have a Boots the Chemist and W. H. Smith bookshop and Marks & Spencer department store."
Oxford, especially, has earned his displeasure for its careless treatment of the past, its disfigurement of the landscape with such architectural atrocities as "the horrible, low-ceilinged, ill-lit drabness" of the Clarendon Shopping Center, the "equally unadorable" Westgate Shopping Center and the "brutalist compound of the magistrates' courts."
Still, Mr. Bryson's disdain for Oxford cannot suppress his delight in its history and achievement. He marvels that he can walk through its streets and in the space of a few hundred yards pass "the home of Christopher Wren, the buildings where Halley found his comet and Boyle his first law, the track where Roger Bannister ran the first sub-four-minute mile, the meadow where Lewis Carroll strolled." Where else but in Britain, he asks, can one find "a landscape more packed with centuries of busy, productive attainment?"
The author of several books on language ("Made in America," "The Mother Tongue"), Mr. Bryson writes in snappy, novelistic prose that's seasoned with little-old-lady Britishisms. "Goodness me!" he exclaims when he catches himself railing against Oxford's modern architecture. Elsewhere, while trying to recover from a hangover, he laments that all he wanted was "a bit of a sit-down."
"Notes From a Small Island" has its longueurs -- too many descriptions of the author's drinking, too many asides about the weather -- but Mr. Bryson enlivens his account with amusing descriptions of places and people. He notes that the new houses surrounding the sanitarium in Virginia Park echo the mother building's Victorian details. "The result was that they looked as if they had somehow been pupped by the sanitarium," he writes. "You could almost imagine them, given sufficient time, growing into sanitariums themselves."
In addition, Mr. Bryson introduces us to a wide assortment of oddballs encountered in both his travels and his readings: a puffin aficionado, who's devastated when the author inadvertently causes him to miss "World of Birds" by switching channels on a rooming house television; the fifth Duke of Portland (1800-1879), who spent most of his time in a small corner of his mansion, in a room stacked to the ceiling with boxes of wigs, and a fellow railroad passenger who has devoted himself to traveling the rail lines of Britain, counting rivets and engine numbers.
There's a tendency on Mr. Bryson's part -- shared by many travel writers -- to focus on the eccentric, the bizarre and the anomalous, and also to make overly broad generalizations about his subject. For the most part, however, he is an entertaining travel companion, curious, whimsical and observant. With this volume, he has succeeded in sending his beloved Britain a charming, if sometimes facile, valentine.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Shows Signs of Slowing

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Strong production by auto makers gave national industrial output a small nudge upward in July, the Federal Reserve said today, as the economy showed signs of gradually slowing its pace of expansion.
Total output rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July -- its smallest monthly increase in four months -- following a revised jump of six-tenths of 1 percent for June. Businesses operated at 83.2 percent of their capacity last month, down slightly from a revised 83.4 percent for June. 
 Analysts said it showed the economy was still expanding at the start of the second half, but much less vigorously than during the spring and at a rate that should hold off interest-rate increases by Fed policy makers next week.
"It's all consistent with other data that suggest the economy in the second half is demonstrating a pace of growth that is on the subdued side," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Another report, by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, gave a clearer indication of a slowdown in manufacturing. The Philadelphia Fed's index of manufacturing activity fell sharply in August and its monthly survey pointed to weaker activity in the second half of 1996.
The Philadelphia Fed said its measure of manufacturing fell to 21.5 in August from 38.6 in July. The index is the percentage of respondents indicating an increase in activity minus the percentage noting a decrease.
All the increase in national industrial production during July came from a surge in output by auto plants. Auto makers depleted their inventories in the second quarter and may be building them up in advance of labor negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union this fall.
Manufacturing output over all registered a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in July after a stronger seven-tenths of 1 percent gain in June.
Output at utilities plunged 1.8 percent following a 1.5 percent drop in June, while production by mining companies was down three-tenths of 1 percent in July after a 1.7 percent rise in June.
Industrial production, after falling five-tenths of 1 percent in March, has risen for four straight months but at a diminishing rate. Output was up eight-tenths of 1 percent in April, five-tenths of 1 percent in May and six-tenths of 1 percent in June before last month's slim gain.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts in July, industrial production fell one-tenth of 1 percent after an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in June.
Gross domestic product, or G.D.P., which is the broadest measure of total output of goods and services, expanded in the second quarter at a 4.2 percent rate, the strongest growth in two years.
Most analysts expect growth to slow to around 2.5 percent in the second half, more in line with a 2 percent to 2.25 percent rate that the Fed sees as safe long-term growth that will not fuel sharp wage and price rises.
A third report from the Labor Department, showing that weekly jobless claims edged up last week by 5,000, to 321,000, contained more ambiguous information about the economy's potential for generating inflation pressures.
While the weekly figure rose, the closely watched four-week moving average of claims fell to a seven-year low of 313,000, from 324,500 in the preceding week.
"The labor market is still quite strong," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "There's certainly no worry of any downturn there."
Nonetheless, Ms. Latta said she did not expect the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee to raise interest rates at Tuesday's meeting because of other signs that the rate of economic growth is beginning to lose a step.
Mr. Dederick of Northern Trust noted that the jobless claims figures, which are more current than the data used to measure industrial output, implied the possibility that wage pressures continued to bubble below the economy's surface.
"But it's not enough to be consistent with the idea that the Fed has reached the point where it has to rein the economy in" by raising rates, Mr. Dederick said. "Perhaps it should do so, but the evidence isn't there for it yet."

New Hint of German Rate Cut Leaves Dollar Largely Steady

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, as comments from German central bank officials reinforced perceptions that the bank might soon lower interest rates.
The latest remarks came from Edgar Meister, a member of the Bundesbank's policy council. In a television interview, he said that another small rate cut could help Germany's sluggish economy. 
 The dollar had surged against the mark on Wednesday after Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, also hinted that a rate cut might be in the offing. And the bank's rate-setting council returns from its four-week summer break next Thursday.
"After the Issing and Meister comments, it is certainly starting to look like the Bundesbank might cut rates again," said Stephen Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York, adding that the possibility of lower German rates was supporting the dollar.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.4854 marks, from 1.4895 marks on Wednesday. The dollar was unchanged at 108.10 Japanese yen. The British pound edged up to $1.5510 from $1.5490.
But trading volume was light because of the Assumption Day holiday, which closed markets in France, Italy and elsewhere in Europe.
A reduction in short-term interest rates in Germany would make bank deposits in dollars more attractive.
"The dollar is looking strong again, and that's one reason why," said Richard Vullo, manager of currency sales at Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank.
The Bundesbank's rate-cut deliberations may turn on whether the growth of Germany's M-3 money supply slows. The central bank watches the money supply figure -- a measure of cash, short-term time deposits, and most savings deposits -- as a gauge of future inflation. So far this year, it has overshot the bank's 4 to 7 percent target, growing in June at an annual rate of 9.6 percent.
If the Bundesbank decides not to lower rates, "you could see the same thing as last time: another period of mark strength," said Steve Barrow, an economist at Chase Investment Bank in London.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Sag in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities sagged under a combination of manufacturing and labor data yesterday. While there was strength in the numbers, the reports did not indicate that the manufacturing sector was about to race ahead in the third quarter, as some investors fear.
Nevertheless, the bond market gave this batch of mixed data a cold reception. The 30-year bond fell 8/32 , to a price of 9911/32 , pushing its yield up to 6.80 percent, from 6.78 percent on Wednesday. 
 The market managed to cut into some of its early losses after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve released the results of its August business survey, which saw the general business activity index drop to 21.5, compared with 38.6 in July, offsetting the industrial production statistics. The index had been expected to drop to 26.9. The significance of the report is that it is the first reading on the manufacting sector for August.
Industrial production in July rose one-tenth of 1 percent in contrast to an expected decline of one-tenths of 1 percent, while the weekly jobless claims showed a gain of 5,000, to 321,000, for the week ended last Saturday, in line with expectations. But it was the drop in the four-week moving average that drew a negtive reaction from market participants.
Supply has also been a factor weighing on prices, with a $19.25 billion Treasury auction of a new one-year bill today amid heavy issuance of corporate debt competing for investor dollars.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said: "The recent slide in the market is primarily the result of an economy that does not appear to be slowing nearly as much as had been hoped. But economic growth, in fact, is moderating, although the extent of that moderation is still unknown.
"Thus, while a Fed tightening seems to be a long way off, the market is still allowing for a less accommodative policy stance before the year is out."
Mr. Fine observed that industrial production during July was not as soft as expected, but, he added, a gain of only one-tenth of 1 percent is not exactly an indication of strength. Further, he said, while the decline in capacity utilization was less than expectations, "at 83.2 percent, capacity utilization is hardly suggestive of any imminent breakout of inflation in the industrial sector."
Of the Philadelphia Fed survey, he noted that general business conditions in that Fed district were still healthy, although activity was off from July. "Of more concern," Mr. Fine said, "perhaps, was the outlook six months forward, which dropped noticeably from the prior month and may be an early sign of a worsening business psychology."
Analysts note that technical factors, or the use of price movements as indictors of future price patterns, have played a key role in Treasury trading over the last few days, and participants have waited for further signs of economic weakness. Traders believe that for the market to move higher and for the yield on the long bond to make a move toward 6.50 percent, economic data of pronounced weakness and duration will be required.
Yesterday's one-year bill auction had little market impact, traders said, since the size of the issue has not changed for the last four auctions and little of it is new cash.
The average rate at the auction was 5.36 percent, about as expected, down from 5.49 percent last month. The bid-to-cover ratio -- the total amount bid against the size of the auction -- was at 2.52 to 1, and noncompetitive bids somewhat below average at $902 million.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new one- year bill:

HEADLINE: Steven D. Gold Is Dead at 52; Expert on Government Financing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Steven D. Gold, an authority on state and local government financing, died on Wednesday night at George Washington University Hospital Center in Washington. He was 52 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Gold, an economist, joined the Urban Institute in Washington eight months ago as co-director of a multimillion dollar project dealing with changes in health services and social programs as the Federal Government shifts responsibility for these programs increasingly to the states.
Before going to the institute as a senior fellow, Mr. Gold served for six years as director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany, where he was also a professor of public administration and policy.
As director of the center, he earned a reputation for expertise on state and local taxes, budget deficits and financing. He advocated against balancing the Federal budget at the expense of programs important to the states.
In this vein, he had criticized the balanced-budget amendment that Congress considered last year.
"Republicans are right that giving states more flexibility can reduce some costs," Mr. Gold wrote, "but exaggerate when they say states could save enough to absorb all the Federal cuts without slashing services."
Mr. Gold was born in 1944 in Philadelphia, and received a bachelor's degree from Bucknell University in 1966, and a master's degree and doctorate in economics from the University of Michigan, the latter in 1972. He had taught at Grinnell College and Drake University, and in 1981 became a senior fellow of the National Conference of State Legislatures. From 1985 to 1990, he was director of the conference's fiscal studies.
Mr. Gold wrote or edited 17 books on state and local finances, the last being "The Fiscal Crisis of the States"(Georgetown University Press), published last year. He wrote dozens of articles on his specialty.
Mr. Gold is survived by his wife of 28 years, the former JoAnn Levine, a sister, Linda Gold of Seattle, and a brother, Richard, of Seattle.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed in a Quiet Day, With the Dow Down by 1.10

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed in one of the quietest sessions of the year yesterday, enlivened only by a small, late rush of buying ahead of today's "double witching" expiration of stock options and index options.
"It's one of those hurry up and wait days," said Michael Metz, Oppenheimer & Company's chief investment strategist."There's no incentive to get aggressive in either direction." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.10 points, to 5,665.78. But broader market gauges rose, and advancing issues led decliners, 1,293 to 1,048, on light volume of 325.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the seventh-slowest full session so far this year, the exchange said.
The Nasdaq composite index added 1.18 points, to 1,134.69.
Blue-chip issues were lower much of the session but blipped upward on late buying tied to today's expiration of options.
Stocks were hampered by weakness in bonds, where long-term rates rose to 6.80 percent, from 6.78 percent on Wednesday, after a mixed bag of economic reports. Industrial production rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July, the Federal Reserve reported, in contrast to the one-tenth of 1 percent decline that had been expected on Wall Street.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that while jobless claims rose 5,000, to 321,000 last week, the closely watched four-week moving average of claims fell to a seven-year low, pointing to strength in the labor market that could put upward pressure on wages.
Analysts said the reports should help convince Fed policy makers not to raise interest rates at their meeting on Tuesday.
"The data were sufficiently mixed," Mr. Metz said. "They didn't disturb the mind-set that there was some moderation of economic expansion."
Drug stocks rose despite the weakness in other blue chips.
Merck rose 3/4, to 69 1/8; Eli Lilly edged up 3/8, to 58 1/2, and American Home Products added 3/8, to 58. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and other health groups said Merck's chicken pox vaccine should be given to all adolescents not yet exposed.
Among individual issues, Orchard Supply Hardware Stores surged 5, to 34 3/4, after it agreed to be acquired by Sears, Roebuck for $35 a share, or $415 million. Sears fell 1/4, to 44 5/8.
Hewlett-Packard slipped 1/8, to 43 3/8, but fell 3 1/2 in after-hours trading after reporting a 26 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, reflecting a slowdown in new orders and a charge to exit the disk drive manufacturing business.
The company said it earned $425 million, or 40 cents a share -- below analysts' estimates of 48 cents a share. Hewlett, whose warnings about earnings had been a key factor in the market's July tailspin, also said its near-term outlook was uncertain, particularly overseas.
But Bill Meehan, a Prudential Securities market analyst, did not see Hewlett's news sparking a broad tech selloff today. "I don't see a spillover tomorrow or a rampage to the downside," he said.
Protein Design stumbled 33 percent, or 7 5/8 points, to 15 1/2, after news that trials of its Protovir antibody for treating inflammation of the retina in AIDS patients was halted due to lack of effectiveness.
The Big Board composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.58 points, to 354.22. The average price per share added 6 cents.
The American Stock Exchange index gained 2.19 points, to 552.53.
The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,482.397, up 12.470 points, or 0.19 percent.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
So Beautiful, So Relaxing, So Far From San Diego

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo., Aug. 15

 BODY:
Here in the crystalline splendors of the Tetons, President Clinton has played many roles on his vacation this week: golfer, hiker, horseback rider, armchair astronomer. But none has he played with more apparent relish or conviction than that of studied ignorer of the Republican National Convention.
The President's aides insist that, to their knowledge, he has watched not so much as a minute of the televised proceedings from San Diego (though they have, of course). And whenever Mr. Clinton is asked about it in public, he responds with a nonchalance bordering on narcolepsy. 
 "I'm going to leave them alone and let them have their convention," he told reporters on Wednesday, as he and his daughter, Chelsea, rode horses at the 800-acre ranch where they are staying. Asked his reaction to Bob Dole's choice of Jack Kemp, he allowed: "I like Al Gore."
To be sure, the President has had plenty of diversions. On Monday, he did not get home until nearly 10 P.M. after a long day and an 8 1/2-mile hike in Yellowstone National Park, and simply "soaked my weary bones." On Tuesday, he played golf until dusk and watched a movie. Tonight, he is to attend a party for local glitterati like the actor Harrison Ford at the home of James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank.
But surely Mr. Clinton, a self-confessed channel surfer, has sneaked just an itsy-bitsy, teensy-weensy peek at the Republicans from time to time.
"He has not watched any of the convention," said the traveling White House spokeswoman, Mary Ellen Glynn. "I can't tell you whether he's caught some of the news clips or not. He may have."
Then again, Mr. Clinton may not have to watch the convention, because Douglas Sosnik, the White House political director, is here to watch it for him, in a dumpy downtown motel. Mr. Sosnik gives his boss morning-after briefings.
"Every time I see him, I ask him, because I know the press is going to ask," Mr. Sosnik said. "And he says, 'Gimme a break! I'm not going to watch that.' "

In the Rough, on the Greens
If Mr. Clinton has been close-mouthed about the Republicans this week, he has been chatty enough about nearly everything else, from his weight (15 to 20 pounds less than a year or so ago, he says) to his fitness (he admitted to "a little heavy breathing" during his hike with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2,220 feet down Mt. Washburn in Yellowstone).
In Yellowstone, the President marveled at the wonders of nature ("You can feel the heat coming up!" he said of a hot spring) and the leavings of nature ("We saw some bear scat.") He gave tips on hiking at altitude, warning reporters to take it easy at first, but adding: "You could stay here a week or 10 days, and you wouldn't even feel it."
In fact, Mr. Clinton told reporters on Wednesday, he might have pushed himself a bit too hard on Monday in his ramble through the land of grizzlies, pine and cow parsnips in Yellowstone.
"When I took you off on that wild goose chase, I didn't know how demanding it was," said Mr. Clinton, who chose the 8 1/2-mile hike over an easier, three-mile alternative down a road, offered by the Park Service. "I was very sore yesterday, I was very sore. I found out my rhythm wasn't quite there on the golf course. Oooooh, that was bad."

Everything He Needs
 In all, Mr. Clinton has kept a much slower pace, and much lower public profile, in his eight-day visit than he did in his 17-day sojourn here last summer. He himself said that on Wednesday, he was "sort of a derelict -- I thought I would sleep in and kind of laze around."
Part of the reason for the President's low profile is that he need not ever leave the 4,000-square-foot log home where he is staying as the guest of Max Chapman Jr., the former head of the American branch of Nomura Securities, the Japanese investment giant. Mr. Chapman's spread, along the Snake River north of town, has almost every conceivable amenity.
There are horses and trails, fishing in the river, a squash court, a gym and a private observatory. Mr. Clinton and Chelsea wanted to stay up to watch a midnight meteor shower on Monday, but the President pooped out too early, aides said.
Mr. Chapman's spread, the Bar B Bar Ranch, is apparently impressive even by the standards of Jackson, where log mansions have popped up like mushrooms in recent years, and where some of America's oldest and richest families have vacationed for generations. "Have you seen the house?" Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, who lent his own impressive home adjoining the Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis Club to the President last summer, asked reporters the other day. When the reporters told him they had not, the Senator's face lit up: "Neither have I," he said, "but I hear it's spectacular."

HEADLINE: Tourist-Hungry Hartford Revives Spirit of Twain;
Banking on the Appeal of an Adopted Son

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Mark Twain was born in the small, backwater town of Florida, Mo., grew up in nearby Hannibal, and achieved fame writing about life on the Mississippi River. A world traveler, lecturing from London to Sydney, he insisted that he be buried in Elmira, N.Y., where he and his wife, Olivia, spent many summers.
Yet, the way people here tell it, Hartford is the place he really called home. 
 "He left Hannibal as soon as he could get out of there," said Wilson Faude, a former curator of the Mark Twain House, the 19-room Victorian mansion where Samuel L. Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, lived for 17 of his 74 years.
"The Mississippi is a brown, mosquito-ridden river," Mr. Faude said. "Hartford is the green end of the road for him. I don't care what he did everywhere else. I know that under the shelter of these trees, American literature was transformed."
It was during that period, from 1874 to 1891, that Twain wrote "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."
Although some might quarrel with Hartford's claim to Twain's affections, the issue is not just a matter of academic debate or civic pride. What is at stake here is money. Over the last few years, this city has hit hard times, and Mark Twain has emerged as a ticket to revival.
This weekend, the city will be host to Mark Twain Days, a three-day hoopla organized by the Mark Twain House, with free performances by Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens and the Smothers Brothers; a raft race down the Connecticut River; a Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher look-alike contest, and a jousting tournament, among other activities. The hope is that thousands of suburbanites who have steered clear of Hartford will be drawn into the city.
It comes as civic leaders have done their best to promote a Twain frenzy. Banners bearing the writer's mustachioed face adorn the streets. A local brew pub has a new offering, Samuel Clemens Extra Pale Ale. And the city and state have imported a play about the author's life, "Mark Twain: The Musical" from Elmira, converting the state armory into an air-conditioned 1,300-seat theater. The play will run through August.
Indeed, Twain seems to be popping up all over town. Last month, the State Bond Commission approved $1.5 million to build a visitors' center and make repairs at the author's mansion here. At that meeting, a Twain impersonator interrupted Gov. John G. Rowland's speech on the importance of tourism and called for the vote. "Isn't it about time for the ayes?" the actor, Ken Richters, drawled, explaining that he needed the money to fix up his house.
Hartford is certainly not the first to try to cash in on the writer. His books have been translated into 72 languages and have inspired more than 100 movies, not to mention a Tom Sawyer television series, Mark Twain riverboat rides at Disney theme parks and a Mark Twain guest character on "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Ernest Hemingway described "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" as the origin of "all modern American literature."
In Japan, there are Tom Sawyer clubs and Tom Sawyer camps where children are sent for rustic outings. For 68 years, Angels Camp, Calif., has held its Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee, inspired by Twain's short story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," with this May's event drawing 37,000 people.
In Elmira, where visitors can see Twain's grave and the study from the summer home where he wrote, receptionists at the Chamber of Commerce answer the (800) MARK TWAIN telephone line with the greeting, "Hello, Mark Twain country."
But they are a little prickly when Twain's ties to Elmira are challenged. "The largest portions of his books were written here," insisted Nancy Keefer, executive vice president of the Chemung County Chamber of Commerce, noting that Twain's six-week summer vacations provided relief from the business stress and social obligations of Hartford.
The loss of the Twain musical has hurt tourism in Elmira, but Ms. Keefer said the town's position in Twain lore was secure -- he is buried there. "Everyone can claim him, but we still have him," she said.
And Hannibal, undoubtedly the champion of Mark Twain kitsch, is clearly not concerned about Hartford.
Tourism is estimated to bring 400,000 people to Hannibal each year, and with a Twain museum and some historic sites, there is the Tom 'n Huck Motel, the Becky Thatcher Book and Gift Shop, the Mark Twain Dinette and a car dealership, Mark Twain Jeep Eagle. Visitors can buy Mark Twain mugs, Mark Twain shot glasses, Huckleberry Finn straw hats and pens with figurines of Tom and Becky floating inside.
The high point of the year in Hannibal is National Tom Sawyer Days, the week of July 4, complete with a Tom and Becky look-alike contest, mud volleyball, a watermelon-seed-spitting contest and a fence-painting competition.
Told of Hartford's event, Mayor Richard B. Schwartz of Hannibal expressed disappointment that Hannibal's latest reigning Tom and Becky were not invited to offer their official imprimatur. But he wished Hartford well.
Whatever Hartford's ambitions, it will take work to get people to think of the city as a Twain landmark.
A survey of a dozen patrons at the New York Public Library found that five thought Twain lived in New York City when "Huckleberry Finn" and "Tom Sawyer" were published, two said Missouri, two said the South, one said "Philly" and one answered simply "not in Brooklyn." Only a librarian knew it was Hartford.
Long known as the insurance city, Hartford, with its Puritan roots, might seem an unlikely place for Twain to have called home. The often profane author, who practically chain-smoked cigars and enjoyed his Scotch whisky, was not always patient with his fellow citizens, referring to the church he attended, which drew many insurance executives, as "The Church of the Holy Speculators."
But Twain, whose publisher was here, clearly fell in love with the place. Flush with insurance money and a center of manufacturing and the subscription book industry, Hartford was said to be the nation's wealthiest city, and it had its own genteel literary and artistic circle. Twain's next-door neighbor was Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
Although Twain gushed about other places -- he called the Chemung Valley, where Elmira sits, a "foretaste of heaven" and described San Francisco as "the friendliest land and the livest, heartiest community on our continent" -- he saved his most purple prose for Hartford.
"Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see, this is the chief," Twain wrote upon his first visit in 1868. "Everywhere the eye turns it is blessed with visions of refreshing green. You do not know what beauty is if you have not been here."
It was here that Twain raised his three daughters before leaving the city in 1891 because of financial troubles.
"Hartford was really home after he left Hannibal," said Justin Kaplan, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain: A Biography" (Touchstone: 1966). "When he moved to Hartford he did not want to be known as the cigar-smoking, poker-playing Mark Twain. He wanted to become part of a genteel literary and social circle. He became determined to be a respectable family man."
Asked whether Twain succeeded, Mr. Kaplan said, "No, but he gave it a good try."
Despite this history, city leaders had ignored Twain's potential as a lure for tourists. The idea of exploiting Twain's links to Hartford came largely from Lary Bloom, the editor of The Hartford Courant's Sunday magazine.
Aware of Hartford's troubled economy, Mr. Bloom made it his mission to educate his readers about Hartford's past, and touted "cultural heritage tourism," a growing segment of the tourism industry, as the road to revitalization. During the last two years, he published a series, Twain's World, highlighting historical landmarks, and he was part of the initial discussions behind Mark Twain Days.
In the May 7, 1995, introduction to the series, Mr. Bloom wrote about Hartford as "the most underappreciated city in America," dubbing it "the passthrough city in the passthrough state."
Mr. Bloom said he had recently visited Prince Edward Island, Canada, where thousands go to visit the birthplace of Anne Shirley, the heroine of "Anne of Green Gables," the novel by Lucy Maude Montgomery.
"Is there a hook for Hartford that would also serve as a hook for Connecticut?" he said. "Surely there is -- a face even more famous, if less adorable than Anne's, with a cigar dangling from its mouth."
The linchpin of this dream was the Farmington Avenue house, which was used for coal storage in the 1920's and converted to apartments and a public library before it was restored to its original form and reopened as a museum in 1974. Last year, it attracted about 50,000 people.
The home is a striking dark brick mix of Gothic and gingerbread, with three turrets, five balconies, an elaborate veranda and porte-cochere. Mr. Kaplan described it as "part steamboat, part medieval stronghold and part cuckoo clock."
The interior is even more elaborate -- hand-stenciled walls and wall papers by Louis Comfort Tiffany and other designers. From the entrance hall to the third-floor billiard room, it is a fabulous display of the decorative arts -- carved wood panels from India, elegant brass and cloisonne enamel lighting fixtures and other period furnishing.
"This house captures all of Twain's exuberance, his taste for the world and his passion for things modern," said John Boyer, the house's executive director. "This town now realizes what it's got. People have found religion."
And the boosterism has taken in some grand claims.
Mr. Faude, the former curator, contended that Twain came up with the name Huckleberry when staring out the window of his Hartford home and seeing the bushes. And he even maintains that the writer's descriptions of the Mississippi River were inspired by the "glittering, gleaming" water of the Connecticut River.
Some writers might take offense at such hype, but Twain likely would not have.
A frustrated businessman who was always in search of ways to make millions, Twain sold his likeness and pen name for use on cigar boxes, whisky labels, insurance promotions and his own line of scrapbooks and vest straps.
"He would love this," Mr. Boyer said. "He was the arch-propagandist who made up his name and created this persona. The only thing that troubles me are the words I hear him whispering late at night: 'Where's my cut?' "

HEADLINE: Burundi's Leader Plans to Rule at Least 3 Years

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BUJUMBURA, Burundi, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Defying international pressure for a return to civilian rule, Burundi's new military leader says the Government plans to remain in power for three years.
"We think a period of three years will be enough to achieve the program we have set ourselves," the leader, Pierre Buyoya, a retired major who took power in a coup on July 25, said in a broadcast on Wednesday night. 
 In his address, Mr. Buyoya urged Burundians to support his plans for a three-year transitional government "at this serious point in our history."
He said he planned to include legislators from the previous National Assembly in a proposed parliament. But he gave no further details. He has previously said that a transitional parliament "would include representatives from all walks of society."
Besides the powers held by the previous assembly, the new parliament "will also play a determining role in the national debate and the attempts at national reconciliation," he added, without elaborating.
He also repeated his earlier pledge to rein in the military, saying, "We are to reinforce discipline, strictness and professional ethics among all the forces charged with maintaining law and order."
The Tutsi-dominated military has been accused of killing Hutu civilians in retaliation for attacks by Hutu rebels. The Hutu guerrillas have also been blamed for killing Tutsi civilians, especially those living in camps after the fighting drove them from their homes.
Eighty-four percent of Burundi's people are Hutu, 14 percent are Tutsi and the rest are Twa. But the Tutsi have traditionally controlled the military and much of the economy.
Mr. Buyoya has defended seizing power, saying he can stop the violence that has killed more than 500,000 people since the 1993 assassination of the country's first Hutu leader, Melchior Ndadaye, in a failed military coup. President Sylvestre Ntibantungaya, the Hutu leader ousted in last month's coup, remains at the residence of the United States Ambassador, Morris Hughes.
Mr. Buyoya spoke only hours after the state radio reported food prices and transport fares were rising because of economic sanctions imposed by Burundi's neighbors.
Borders with Zaire, Rwanda and Tanzania have been closed. Zambia has said it will be vigilant in enforcing the sanctions and has barred Burundi from using its ports on Lake Tanganyika.

HEADLINE: A Last Blast Of the Whistle Coming Soon

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho Aug. 14

 BODY:
This city was so charmed by its old train depot, and so enchanted by the mystique of locomotive travel, that it mounted a $1.5 million campaign to buy the station.
The donations poured in, with corporate bigwigs and working-class Joes and Janes helping the city buy the depot from a private company last month. 
 As it turns out, people here would do anything at all for the train, except ride it.
With ridership declining, Amtrak has announced it is cutting train travel to Boise, one of 42 cities that will lose service, including Dallas, Las Vegas and Little Rock.
"I'm sorry to see it go," said Dan Neighbor, 45, who had donated $150 for the depot purchase, but said, "I've got to admit, I never rode it."
Amtrak is restoring the Broadway Limited, between New York and Chicago, and adding a third daily train between New York and Miami. But the train travel in the West is being cut sharply, with more than 3,000 passenger miles being discontinued.
The latest cuts were deemed necessary after Congress earmarked $200 million for Amtrak, some $50 million less than it had requested.
Many of the cuts, which take effect Nov. 10, will be on routes where service had been scaled back a year ago. The Pioneer, for example, which stops in Boise on its runs between Seattle and Denver, and then on to Chicago, had gone from daily service in each direction, to just three days a week. Amtrak had hoped, vainly it turns out, that reducing the frequency of train runs could improve efficiency and save some endangered routes.
"It worked for a while," said Marc Magliari, a spokesman for Amtrak. "But ultimately, people are not willing to shift their demand to your supply. If you don't do it daily, you might as well just not do it at all."
He noted that some cities on struggling routes, like Boise, had made "Herculean efforts" to save train service, "which made these unfortunate choices all the more difficult."
Three of the lines to be discontinued -- Los Angeles to Salt Lake City; St. Louis to San Antonio; Denver to Seattle -- were losing a total of about $60 million, Mr. Magliari said.
In Boise, where the Union Pacific began rail service in 1887, ridership lately had dropped sharply in the last 12 months, to 4,666, from 6,258.
Some people here blamed Amtrak's problems in Boise, in part, on odd service hours. The train to Seattle leaves here at 4:24 A.M.; the train to Denver leaves at 11:26 P.M.
"Those hours were simply unmarketable," said Suzanne Burton, a spokeswoman for the city.
More than anything else, the lower ridership is a matter of competition: trains are slower than airplanes, and generally just as expensive.
"If you're in a hurry, the train is just not an option," said Mr. Neighbor, a carpentry contractor. "And in this society, we're pretty much always in a hurry."
For Boise, the Amtrak announcement was certainly no reflection on the city's fortunes, or its future. From its perch in the foothills of the Sawtooth Mountains, this city, the capital of Idaho, has been one of the hot spots of the American West for several years, a place for high technology, and fly-fishing.
"We haven't done any marketing for the past four years," Shirl Boyce, the manager of the Boise Area Ecomomic Development Council. "We've had so much coming in, we haven't been able to handle it."
The population of the Boise area has grown to about 365,000, from about 275,000 a decade ago. It has been an astonishing turnabout from the 1980's, bleak times here for an economy then dominated by agriculture, mining and timber.
"You could have shot a howitzer through a street downtown and not hit anything," Mr. Boyce said. "We were doing each other's laundry."
Today, the economy has greatly diversified, particular with growth in the computer field. Micron Technology, for example, employs about 10,000 workers in the Boise area.
Boise already has plenty of uses for the old railroad depot, which has arched windows, a soaring belltower and a great hall with high ceilings and painted beams. A real estate developer is leasing much of the depot for office space. The hall will be rented out for private affairs, like wedding receptions, said Ms. Burton, the city spokeswoman.
By and large, people took the news of the train's demise as a foregone conclusion. "All of us drive around in our cars, and then we say we ought to keep the trains," said Roy Ellsworth, a 64-year-old physician, as he sat inside his four-wheel-drive vehicle. "We're hypocrites."
For all the complaints about subsidies for trains, he added, few talk about subsidies for automobiles.
"What, for example, is the highway patrol, if not a huge subsidy to the highway system?" he asked.
His wife, Frances Ellsworth, 47, said she was not surprised that the train's days were numbered, but added, "I'm sure going to miss the sound of the whistle."
There was a touch of melancholy in the voices of some, who recalled the station for its joyful homecomings and tearful farewells, the place where families waved to scared young troops going off to war.
Pablo Pacania, a 90-year-old retired Air Force veteran, recalled riding the train from California to Boise in 1951. "I remember waking up and looking out the window," he said, "and seeing my wife, the first thing I saw, my wife."
Mr. Pacania lives in a modest house next to the station. "People always ask me, 'What about the noise? What about the noise?' " he said. "And I tell them, 'It does not bother me. I like the train.' "
Then he took off the broad cowboy hat and waved it, wistfully.
"I will miss the train, yes," he said. "People were always standing there, waving. So many families, waiting, waiting. Now -- all gone. I will miss the train."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Hewlett Stock Tumbles as Earnings Fall Despite Alert

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company, confirming an earlier warning of bad financial news, reported a 26 percent decline in its fiscal third-quarter earnings today.
The company, whose warning of a growth slowdown early last month had helped send technology stocks plummeting, reported profits of 40 cents a share -- well below the 49 cents a share that had been predicted in the latest survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research. 
 Shares of the company's stock plunged $3.50, to $40, today. But analysts were unwilling to predict whether the selloff would affect other technology stocks on Friday, in part because another computer company, Cisco Systems Inc., reported better-than-expected profits today after the stock market closed.
As Hewlett-Packard had warned last month, its earnings were reduced by a pre-tax charge of $135 million, or about 13 cents a share, to cover the company's withdrawal from the computer disk-drive manufacturing business and to account for losses in that business.
Without that charge the company would have met Wall Street's earnings estimate, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, Robert Wayman, said.
But David Wu, an analyst at the Chicago Corporation, said, "It really didn't matter whether they met expectations. This wasn't a good quarter for H.-P."
The earnings for the quarter totaled $425 million, compared with $576 million, or 55 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 17.7 percent, to $9.11 billion from $7.74 billion.
The most recent quarter, which ended on July 31, put an abrupt end to the rocketing earnings growth that the electronics manufacturer, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., had enjoyed in recent years; earnings increases of 20 percent were not uncommon. But now the company's executives are expressing concern about the uncertain business climate Hewlett-Packard is facing in diverse markets including personal computers, work stations, peripherals, test equipment and components.
For the quarter, Hewlett-Packard said orders were up 8 percent, well below the 24 percent rise reported in the second quarter of this year and the 34 percent gain in the third quarter of the 1995 fiscal year.
In the third quarter, orders in the United States grew 4 percent, to $3.9 billion, while orders from outside the United States increased 11 percent, to $4.8 billion.
Company officials cited transitions to new products and a general economic slowdown in major markets for some of the slowdown. They also said that the company's fiscal third quarter had traditionally been slow and that last year's period had been unusually strong for the company.
"Our PC growth continues at or above the industry growth rate," Mr. Wayman said. "But it is slower than when we were rapidly gaining market share."
Mr. Wu, the analyst, said he was concerned that the company's growth appeared to be weak in both the United States and Asia. "And when the computer business goes to single-digit growth, that's ominous," he said.
Cisco Systems, the leader in equipment and software used for controlling the flow of information in corporate computer networks, said that its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 85.7 percent, to $266.8 million, or 45 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had been expecting earnings of 40 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter, which ended on July 28, soared 176.3 percent, to $1.72 billion, from $621.2 million a year earlier.
The results do not include earnings and revenue from the Stratacom Corporation, a networking vendor that Cisco bought last month, and $15.5 million in pretax expenses for the acquisition. With those results, Cisco had earnings of $276.6 million, or 41 cents a share.
Cisco reported its earnings after the Nasdaq market closed; its shares had ended the day's regular trading session up $1.125 at $57.75, in anticipation of good news. Trading in the stock, at volume of 9.9 million shares, was the third most active in United States markets. Cisco shares rose 37.5 cents, to $58.125, in after-hours trading.

Hewlett-Packard said the results for the latest quarter included the effect of ending disk-drive manufacturing. That move, combined with operating losses in this business, reduced earnings by about 13 cents a share.

Economy's Growth Slows As Output Gains Just 0.1%
Strong production by auto makers gave the nation's industrial output a small nudge upward in July, the Federal Reserve said. Total output rose one-tenth of 1 percent -- the smallest increase in four months -- following a revised jump of six-tenths of 1 percent for June. Businesses operated at 83.2 percent of their capacity, down slightly from a revised 83.4 percent for June.
Analysts said the data showed that the economy was still expanding, but much less vigorously than in the spring and at a rate they did not expect to lead Fed policy makers to increase interest rates next week. [Page D2.]
 
Sears Acquiring Hardware Chain
Sears, Roebuck agreed to buy Orchard Supply Hardware Stores for $35 a share, or about $308 million, plus the assumption of debt, as part of the rapid expansion of its chain of hardware stores. Orchard, based in San Jose, Calif., has 61 stores, all in California; Sears has 115 hardware stores, but none in California. [D2.]

Stocks were mixed in quiet trading, enlivened only by a small, late rush of buying ahead of today's "double witching" expiration of stock and index options. The Dow industrials fell 1.10 points, to 5,665.78. But the Nasdaq composite index added 1.18 points, to 1,134.69. [D6.]

A Second Agency for Arch Deluxe
Eyebrows along Madison Avenue rose earlier this year when McDonald's passed over its usual agencies to name Fallon McElligott to handle the introductory campaign for the Arch Deluxe.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Constancy Gap

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
A couple of days before the Republican Convention, I arrived with my undecided vote jingling in my pocket. I was getting a little impatient to throw it into the struggle. A week later I made my decision -- to leave it resting for awhile longer right there in my pocket.
This exclusive news bulletin may or may not arouse the nation; we must wait until the next poll to determine the impact. But we know one thing: Unless Bob Dole gets the support of the 8 to 10 percent of us undecided voters, whatever thin chances he has will disappear faster than a morning mist over San Diego Harbor. 
 Long before this convention, I agreed with President Clinton's opponents that the issue about him and his Presidency was character and values. I don't see how they can be separated. In San Diego I found myself convinced that exactly the same problems were what bothered me most about the Republican Party and its candidates.
Staying undecided about a Presidential election as long as I can is my habit, for two reasons. Journalistically, it might help me keep a little sharper -- more aware of the weaknesses of the candidate I might lean toward, a little more open to the strengths of the other one. Second: Sometimes it is really hard for me to believe how miserably unworthy a candidate I had voted for before seems the second time around. I keep groping for evidence that he is a fine fellow, an admirable leader after all, which would nicely vindicate us both.
The first time he ran for President, I decided to vote for George Bush because I had met Michael Dukakis. The second time I voted for Bill Clinton, because Mr. Bush had thrown away the political victory over Saddam Hussein that should have come from the military victory.
I have something of a soft spot for Mr. Dole, probably because his tart sense of humor and self-deprecation are very New York. Those classes at Brooklyn College obviously did him worlds of good.
So it wasn't too hard to look at Mr. Dole fresh despite my disagreements with many of his positions. They range from freedom of choice to effective gun control to the rights and treatment of immigrants. But I think I only have one absolute litmus test. Any candidate who uses bigotry as a political weapon is out, out. Mr. Dole has passed that test all his life.
But character-values troubled me consistently as the Republican Party displayed itself here. Each voter defines them for himself. For an American politician, this voter thinks, they should rest on constancy, in life and work, and to Democratic ideals as embodied in the Constitution.
Mr. Clinton has too often shown himself to be a man of inconstancy, which is the desertion of promise and ideals. He seems to have no concern that the voters will resent it. Judging by the polls, he is correct, which only makes an inconstant President even more cynical.
In San Diego the Republican Party treated the Constitution as something to be changed whenever it suited political convenience. The party adopted a platform with amendments that would outlaw abortion, mandate balanced budgets, bar citizenship to American-born children of all illegal immigrants and many legal ones, protect victims' rights and "safeguard Old Glory." They acted as if the Constitution were a loose-leaf book, a cut-and-paste job. But all Mr. Dole could summon himself to say was that he had not read the platform. The dog ate his homework.
Mr. Dole himself proved inconstant to his once-strict vision of economic rectitude. He suddenly decided that Americans could indeed have it all -- much lower taxes, a balanced budget and reduced deficits, details to come later, maybe.
But the most disappointing inconstancy came where least expected -- from Jack Kemp. On orders from Mr. Dole, Mr. Kemp decided he was against affirmative action after all. And he decided, against everything he had said and stood for, that children of illegal immigrants should be barred from public school. After writing my last column praising the selection of Mr. Kemp, I struck out a sentence as too obvious to warrant space: "Mr. Kemp will honor his word about immigrants."
There it is -- after San Diego nothing to do but wait to decide for myself where the constancy gap has shown itself greater, in the White House or the convention in San Diego.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE SPEECH;
Dole Presents the Future As Tale of Two Candidates

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
In Bob Dole's acceptance speech tonight, two characters sprang forth larger than life.
One was Bob Dole, who emerged gently in the first person singular, a resolute, Reaganesque father figure who could reach back with grace across the rudeness of contemporary life and recreate Norman Rockwell's America. 
 The other was Bill Clinton, portrayed, sometimes indirectly, as a President who is "content with the way things are" and has "failed to adequately provide for our future defense" -- the leader of a communal band of arrogant youth.
In one of the harshest condemnations Mr. Dole has ever made of the Clinton Administration, he said it was "demeaning" that this "corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned" should control taxpayer money.
These two characters battled throughout Mr. Dole's speech. As a literary device, the demonizing of an opponent has a rich history; as politics, its success is less certain.
The Bob Dole of this speech is humble, a son of the heartland, a boy reared by his revered parents in the tiny town of Russell, Kan., and now "just a man, at the mercy of God." Because of his hard-working parents, he said, "I will always remember those in need." Absent was any mention of Bob Dole as the powerful majority leader of the Senate, the post he resigned in June to campaign for the Presidency full time.
"The first thing you learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man compared to the lay of the land," he said. And nothing compares with the love he holds for his parents. "There is no moment when my memory of them and my love for them does not overshadow anything I do -- even this, even here."
The Bob Dole of tonight's address is also a man of refreshing honesty, confronting his age, 73, head on and pronouncing himself rich with "the gracious compensations of age."
In one of the most lyrical passages of his speech, the Bob Dole presented here makes a virtue of his years as he yearns to be "the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action." To those who say such an America never existed, Mr. Dole reports back like a witness to Shangri-La: "I was there. I have seen it. I remember."
It is he who stands for the "old values," even as they have lain somnolent during the Clinton reign.
The Clintons, in this presentation, have presided over a society that is rife with "crime, drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty and the abandonment of children." It is the unnamed Hillary Rodham Clinton who, Mr. Dole says, has decreed that "it takes a village -- that is, the collective, and thus, the state, to raise a child."
In the Dole world "it takes a family," he said, adding, "I am here to tell you that permissive and destructive behavior must be opposed, that honor and liberty must be restored, and that individual accountability must replace collective excuse."
Because of the Administration's selfish economic policies, Mr. Dole said, "somewhere, a grandmother couldn't afford to call her granddaughter, or a child went without a book."
But lest his listeners think of him as sentimental, the Bob Dole of this speech is also a man of resolve. "If I win," he asserted, "the lives of violent criminals are going to be hell."
The Mr. Dole presented here would be firm where Mr. Clinton has been weak. "President Clinton has failed to adequately provide for our future defense," Mr. Dole said, painting Mr. Clinton as a kind of national deadbeat dad. "For whatever reason his neglect, it is irresponsible."
But for all of his resolve, the Bob Dole of this speech is also fair, imbued with a sense of justice, social responsibility and compassion by his life experience and his father's love for "a son who was thought to be dying in an Army hospital."
"Do you imagine for one minute that as I sign the bills that will set the economy free I will not be faithful to Americans in need? You can be certain that I will, for to do otherwise would be to betray those whom I love and honor most, and I will betray nothing."
In the end, Mr. Dole brought the contrast between his white hat character and Mr. Clinton's black hat down to this simple assertion as he asked his listeners to vote for him:
"I ask for that vote so that I may bring you an administration that is able, honest and trusts in you."

HEADLINE: In America;
Dole's Budget Fiction

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
"I want a balanced budget by 2002," said Bob Dole. This was the new Bob Dole. He was exuberant, riding the bounce that had come with the addition of Jack Kemp to the ticket.
The day-shift workers at the Solar Turbines plant, about a dozen miles from the convention center, listened carefully, if skeptically. 
 "We can do that," said Mr. Dole, "and cut taxes at the same time."
It has become his mantra. The Republican Presidential nominee says it over and over, like a man trying to convince himself. I can cut taxes and balance the budget. I can. I can.
You'll never see a clearer example of a politician protesting too much. Bob Dole can't possibly believe what he is saying. You expect him to look up at any moment and, his eyes widening with dismay, cry out, "How'm I gonna do that?"
Instead, what he told the workers at the plant was, "We'll figure out a way to downsize the Government a little bit and you'll never miss it." He said he would "cut out a few departments" and "cut back on a few programs" and, bingo, the budget would be balanced, even with the half-trillion-dollar Dole-Kemp tax cut.
Well, as we learned in the Reagan era, it's not quite that easy.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has just completed an analysis of Mr. Dole's tax cut and budget-balancing plan. Whereas Mr. Dole told the Solar Turbine workers that a little tinkering with the Government -- a little "downsizing" -- would be sufficient, the center found otherwise.
The center points out that Mr. Dole's plan calls for $217 billion in program cuts in addition to the $650 billion in cuts already proposed by the Republican majority in Congress. If all of those cuts are implemented the Federal Government would not just be downsized, it would be devastated.
(The word "cuts" is used in the center's analysis to refer to reductions in the amount of spending currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office.)
The analysis describes the impact such enormous cuts would have on that portion of the Federal Government that is not related to entitlement programs or defense:
"This budget area covers a wide variety of programs, such as education, the environment, scientific research, law enforcement, and veterans' health care. By 2002, this budget area would be reduced 37 percent below the current level, after adjusting for inflation. Stated another way, 37 percent of the Federal Government, other than entitlements and defense spending, would have to disappear."
And that is assuming Mr. Dole's revenue estimates are accurate and that as President he would be able to surmount the considerable political obstacles to such deep spending cuts. Neither is a safe assumption. Robert Reischauer, a deficit hawk and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, was quoted in The Washington Post as saying, "It would appear that Mr. Dole's economic advisers have been feeding their calculators performance-enhancing drugs."
Mr. Dole's estimate of annual revenues under current law is $80 billion higher than the C.B.O.'s estimates, apparently because of an upward blip in revenues last year that Mr. Dole has conveniently decided to view as permanent. And he assumes that 33 percent of the revenues lost as a result of his supply-side tax cuts will be recouped via economic growth.
If those assumptions are incorrect, and most economists believe they are, Mr. Dole would have to find still more spending cuts, perhaps $150 billion worth. That, according to the center's analysis, would push the total spending cuts required between now and 2002 above $1 trillion.
That won't happen. It is not politically doable. What will happen will be the same thing that happened under Ronald Reagan. The budget won't be balanced. The deficit, especially in the long term, will grow. And that will cause a drag on economic growth that will last well into the 21st century.
Mr. Dole began his speech at the turbine plant by saying many voters believe that politicians will say anything to get elected.
Indeed.

Convention Summary

 BODY:

DOLE'S RECURRING THEMES
On the final night of the Republican National Convention, Bob Dole took center stage with the most important speech of his long political career. The prepared text laid out the Presidential nominee's vision of economic opportunity for all Americans and touched again and again on the issue of trust.
 
WHITMAN'S RISING STAR
Christine Todd Whitman, the New Jersey Governor and co-chairwoman of the convention, is making her own considerable splash at the gathering. So popular is Mrs. Whitman that she had to announce more than once that she was not interested in being Mr. Dole's running mate. She appeared at the convention podium so often that at times it seemed like "This Week with Christine Whitman."
 
REPUBLICANS' CREDIBILITY
The Republicans certainly did not overdose on truth serum. But their grand speech-making, while generously spiced with hyperbole and bravado, did not include any out-and-out lies, either. Scholars and political speech-writers say the party, in making assertions about the largest tax cuts or increases in history, has deftly crept right to the edge of what is considered fair and accurate without crossing into the zone of mendacity. And many of the statements were so sweeping as to be meaningless -- and impossible to verify -- as when Speaker Newt Gingrich said the Republicans were the "party of freedom."

HEADLINE: Bob Dole's Mixed Message

 BODY:
In his acceptance speech last night, Bob Dole demonstrated both the strengths and the weaknesses of his candidacy. It was moving to hear him describe his memories of the past, but he faltered in elaborating a vision for the future. Once again, he remained unable to integrate his newly adopted tax-cut plan into his own traditional economic views.
Mr. Dole has always been at his best when recalling the small-town life of his youth, his suffering in World War II and his sacrifices as a wounded veteran. In a Reaganesque celebration of his status as a senior citizen, he told the delegates that at 73, he could "be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action. To those who say it was never so, that America had not been better, I say, you're wrong, and I know. Because I was there. I have seen it. I remember." 
 But the candidate was far shakier in explaining how he was going to build that bridge. Recalling Bill Clinton's 1992 slogan "It's the economy, stupid," Mr. Dole accused the Clinton Administration of advancing materialism at the expense of moral values. But he lurched from there into his promise to give Americans a huge tax cut -- a plan that certainly seems more tailored to avarice than to spiritual growth. He showed his bitter, least attractive side when he sought to link Government programs with "a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned."
Once in attack mode, Mr. Dole then offered up a stump-speech medley, including a churlishly disproportionate assault on teachers' unions and standard slashes at liberal judges, criminals and Government bureaucracies. His analysis of defense spending, and the claim that President Clinton has failed to "provide for our future defense," was plain dishonest. A candidate who has just called for a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, a balanced budget and protection of Social Security and Medicare is in no position to declare that he will spend more. Mr. Dole even lashed out at Hillary Rodham Clinton's book "It Takes a Village," suggesting it was a call for state collectivist day care rather than a modest endorsement of family responsibility.
Before tonight's session, Mr. Dole's allies had said he needed the speech of his career to spur an uneven campaign. Any politician would have a hard time passing that test. There were few if any lines that will be remembered past the weekend. It was a speech that lacked soaringly memorable language and a clear thematic spine, but it was also a speech that blended well enough into the Republicans' strategic plan for the week.
Mr. Dole's speech was the culmination of a four-day convention that, as a prepackaged television show, met many of the organizers' hopes. The candidate, delegates and podium speakers hit all their marks. The on-camera activities bore no resemblance whatsoever to the angry public tussles of 1992. Instead of Patrick Buchanan threatening "religious war," the dominant image was the keynote speaker Susan Molinari's omnipresent baby. There was so little right-to-life rhetoric that some of the religious conservatives were complaining that the G.O.P. wanted their votes but not their voices.
Mr. Dole has seemed relaxed, more willing to read from a teleprompter, less inclined to undercut his prepackaged message with cloudbursts of candor. His new running mate, Jack Kemp, has proved that he knows how to behave Vice-Presidentially by wearing a muzzle and following orders.
But all this came at a cost that will become more apparent after Labor Day. The Dole team enters the last 10 weeks of the Presidential race looking more electable, but it has sacrificed consistency. Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp are now different candidates than they were a month ago, with some dramatically altered positions. Mr. Dole has surely not forgotten his painful struggles to keep supply-side economics from bankrupting the country during the Reagan era. But he steps onto the campaign trail a born-again supply-sider. Mr. Kemp has just done an about-face on some of his foundation principles, such as support for affirmative action and defense of the children of illegal immigrants.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp now have a more energetic aura, and tens of millions of dollars in newly released campaign financing to buy advertisements. What they do not have any longer is a base from which to criticize Mr. Clinton for his well-known willingness to shift with the political winds.

Excerpts From Kemp's Speech on Accepting Nomination

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Following are the remarks tonight by Jack Kemp in accepting the Republican Party's nomination for Vice President:
Tonight, here in San Diego, Bob Dole and I begin this campaign to take our message of growth, and hope, and leadership, and cultural renewal to all Americans. And as I said in Russell, Kan., Bob Dole's hometown, last Saturday, we're going to take our cause from the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California. 
 We're not going to leave anyone out of this cause and this campaign. We're going to carry the word to every man, woman and child, of every background.
But today, on the eve of the new American century, it's time to renew the American promise and to recapture the American Dream, to give our nation a new burst of freedom, with liberty, equality and justice for all.
That's what it means to be a Republican.
Tonight I'm putting our opponents on notice. We're going to ask for the support of every single American. Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race and belief in America. We're not going to leave anybody out of this opportunity society.
We may not get every vote. Now, listen to me for a moment. We may not get every vote, but we'll speak to every heart. In word and action, we will represent the entire American family.
That's what we must be all about.
And so in the spirit of Mr. Lincoln, who believed that the purpose of a great party was not to defeat the other party, the purpose of a truly great party is to provide superior ideas, principled leadership, and a compelling cause. And in that spirit, I accept your nomination for the Vice Presidency of the United States of America. . . .
With the end of the cold war, all the "isms" of the 20th century -- Fascism, Nazism, Communism, Socialism and the evil of apartheid-ism -- have failed, except one. Only democracy has shown itself true to the hopes of all mankind. We must be that party.
You see, democratic capitalism is not just the hope of wealth, but it's the hope of justice. When we look into the face of poverty, we see the pain, the despair and the need of human beings. But, above all, in every face of every child, we must see the image of God.
You see, the Creator of all has planted the seed of creativity in every single one of us, the desire within every child of God to work and build and improve our lot in life, and that of our families, and those we love, and in our work.
And in the act of creating that is part of all labor, we discover that part within ourselves that is divine. I believe the ultimate imperative for growth and opportunity is to advance human dignity. Dr. Martin Luther King believed that we must see a sleeping hero in every soul.
I believe America must establish policies that summon those heroes and call forth their boundless potential and that of the human spirit. But our fullest potential will never be achieved by following leaders who call us to timid tasks, diminish dreams, and some error of limits.
You see, every generation faces choices: hope or despair, the plan for scarcity or to embrace the possibilities. Societies throughout history believed they had reached the frontiers of human accomplishment, but in every age those who trusted that divine spark of imagination discovered that vastly greater horizons still lay ahead.
You see, Americans do not accept limits. We transcended those limits. We do not settle for things as they are. We are intent on succeeding. . . .
Today America is on the threshold of the greatest period of economic opportunity, technological development and entrepreneurial adventure in the history of the world. We have before us tomorrows that are more thrilling than the most glorious of our yesterdays.
And yet the genius of the American people is being stifled. Our economy is growing at the slowest pace of recovery of any period in the century. Income of the working men and women of America is dropping or stagnant. There's kind of a gnawing feeling throughout the nation that in some way, for some reason, there's just something wrong.
Our friends in the other party say the economy is great, it's moving forward. It's moving like a ship dragging an anchor, the anchor of taxes and excessive regulations and big government and bureaucracy.
They say it's the best we can do and the best we can hope for. But that's because they put their entire trust in government rather than people. They want a government that runs our lives, runs our businesses, runs our schools.
You see, they just don't believe in the unlimited possibilities that freedom can bring.
 
Defining the Democrats
Today the Democratic Party is not democratic. They are elitist. They don't have faith in people. They have faith in government. They trust government more than markets, and that's why they raise taxes on middle-income families. That's why they tried to nationalize health care. That's why today they say they're unalterably opposed to cutting taxes on the American family.
That's the problem with elitists. They think they know better than the people. But the truth is, there's a wisdom, there's an intelligence, in ordinary men and women far superior to the greatest so-called experts that have ever lived.
That's what our party must be all about.
The Democratic Party is the party of the status quo, and as of tonight, with Bob Dole as our leader, we're the party of change.
Our first step will be to balance the budget with a strategy to combine economy and government with the type of tax cuts designed to liberate the productive genius of the American people.
Now, of course, the naysayers in the Clinton White House say it can't be done. They've got to say that. They don't know Bob Dole, and they don't know Jack Kemp.
As Bob and I have said before, and will continue to say throughout this campaign, with a pro-growth Republican Congress balancing the budget while cutting taxes is just a matter of presidential will.
If you have it, you can do it. Bob Dole has it, and Bob Dole will do it. You can count on it. . . .
Here we are on the eve of the 21st century, in the middle of that technological revolution that is transforming the world in which we live. But how can it be that so many families find themselves struggling just to keep even or just to get by? . . .
Our tax cut will mean that parents will have more time to spend with their children and with each other. It means that a working parent can afford to take a job that lets them maybe be home when the kids come home from school. It means that the struggling single mother in the inner city of America will find it easier to get out of poverty and to work off the welfare system, which is a drag on her hopes and aspirations.
We cannot forget, my friends, that a single mom and her children in this country can not be left out of our great revolution for this country. The American society, as a whole, can never achieve the outer reaches of its potential so long as it tolerates the inner cities of despair. And I could tell you that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp will not tolerate that despair in our nation's cities.
I read the account . . . of a reporter of his conversation with a little 10-year old boy at Henry Homer public housing in Chicago, which I had had the honor of visiting. The reporter told in his book that he asked the little boy what he wanted to be when he grew up. The little boy said, "If I grow up, I'd like to be a bus driver."
He said, "If I grow up." He said "if," not "when." At the age of 10, he wasn't quite sure he'd even make it to adulthood.
Think how much poorer our nation is, and deprived of, not allowing that child to reach his or her potential -- and those like them. Think of how much richer our nation will be, when every single child is able to grow up to reach for his or her God-given potential, including those who come to America, including those who are willing to risk everything to come to this nation.
 
Goals for America
My friends, we are a nation of immigrants, and as the former president of Notre Dame University, Father Theodore Hesburgh said, the reason we have to close the back door of illegal immigration is so that we can keep open the front door of legal immigration. That is what it means to be American.
You see, our goal is not just a more prosperous America, but a better America. An America that recognizes the infinite worthwhile of every individual, and like the good shepherd leaves the 99 to find the 1 stray lamb. An America that honors all its institutions, the values that moms and dads want to pass on to their children. An America that makes the ideal of equality a daily reality, equality of opportunity, equality in human dignity, equality before the laws of mankind, as well as in the eyes of God. An America that transcends the boundaries between the races, with the revolutionary power of a simple, yet very profound idea to love our neighbors as ourselves.
We must remember all that is at stake in America's cultural renewal, not just the wealth of our nation, but the meaning as well. Today more than ever before, America's ideals and ideas grip the imaginations of women and men in every corner of the globe.
And isn't it exciting, isn't it exciting, to think that it's 1776, only this time all over the world? All over the world. . . .
Our nation and its President must be strong enough to stand up for freedom against all who would challenge it. A world of peace, a world of hope, that's what America's economic and cultural renewal means at home and around the globe. This is what our cause is all about. This is why we'll elect Bob Dole the next President. This is why we need a Republican Congress.
And I want you to know the other night I was honored, I was so honored, to be a small part of that tribute, but so meaningfully, to President Reagan. Mrs. Reagan said she was touched by my calling Ronald Reagan "the last lion of the 20th century." Well, I said history will record that, and I believe America is fortunate that last night you, and you, and you, nominated a leader worthy of succeeding President Reagan, a man with the strength, the determination, and the vision to do the job that lies ahead.
And I want you to know tonight from the bottom of my heart, I believe Bob Dole will be the first lion of the 21st century.
Thank you.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: POLITICAL MEMO;
True, False or Fog? Speeches Are All of the Above

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
In her keynote address to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night, Representative Susan Molinari told of "a grandmother in St. Louis who was hit hard by Bill Clinton's tax increase on Social Security benefits."
Under Bob Dole's tax plan, Ms. Molinari said, "she'll get to keep all the benefits she's earned and deserves." 
 Ms. Molinari's description of the effects of the Clinton tax bill and Mr. Dole's proposal to repeal it was not precisely accurate. But it was close enough to the truth, scholars and political speech writers agree, that it met the standards of what is fair in political oratory.
This has been the case throughout the convention here this week. Even the fact-checkers at the Clinton campaign, who have been poring over every word spoken at the convention, have been unable to catch the Republicans in a baldfaced lie.
Most of what has been said has been so platitudinous that it cannot be said to be factually true or false.
How can one prove, for instance, that Bob Dole was telling the truth tonight when he said that it was "demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes"? Or when he said, "The trade policy of the Clinton Administration has been a disaster"? Or when he insisted, "President Clinton has failed to adequately provide for our future defense"?
One may disagree. But like almost everything in Mr. Dole's speech tonight, it is a matter of opinion, not fact.
When speakers like Ms. Molinari have made statements of fact, they have always contained enough truth that they have passed the test of fair comment.
Roderick P. Hart, a professor of communications and government at the University of Texas, said political speeches should be viewed the same way as literature -- "with a willing suspension of disbelief."
Just as Shakespeare is read for the value of the literature and not for historical accuracy, Professor Hart said, so political speeches should be listened to for the themes and not for the facts.
In the case of Ms. Molinari's description of the grandmother who had her Social Security benefits taxed away by President Clinton and who would get them back under Mr. Dole, here are the facts:
Social Security payments to middle- and upper-income retirees were first made subject to income taxes by a 1983 law. Mr. Dole, then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was largely responsible for Senate passage of the measure. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law.
Under that law, the St. Louis grandmother, assuming she filed a joint tax return, owed taxes on Social Security benefits generally to the extent that 50 percent of her benefits plus her other taxable income exceeded $32,000.
Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction legislation in 1993 raised the percentage of Social Security benefits subject to taxation to 85 percent when that plus other income totaled more than $44,000.
What Mr. Dole proposes is to repeal the Clinton increase, not repeal the 1983 law. A rough calculation shows that if the St. Louis woman has a total income of $50,000, of which $20,000 is from Social Security, her tax saving under the Dole plan would be less than $100 a year.
But all that is too complicated for a sound bite at a political convention. Ms. Molinari's point was that some retirees had their taxes raised by Mr. Clinton and that Mr. Dole would lower them. The point is accurate.
In the same vein, one speaker after another, including Mr. Dole, has accused Mr. Clinton of sponsoring the biggest tax increase in American history. The charge is true or false depending on how one counts. These are the facts:
The Clinton legislation in 1993 raised taxes by $241 billion over five years. In 1982, a bill that was sponsored by Mr. Dole and signed by President Reagan raised taxes by $215 billion. But in 1993 dollars, the 1982 tax increase was worth $286 billion.
So in actual dollars, the 1993 measure was in fact the largest tax increase in history. But adjusted for inflation, it was smaller than the one Mr. Dole sponsored in 1982.
In earlier eras, Presidential candidates like Grover Cleveland, James G. Blaine and William Jennings Bryan often made outrageously false accusations about their opponents. But this rarely happens today.
A case from the 1980 campaign between Mr. Reagan and Jimmy Carter proves why.
Mr. Carter began his campaign on Labor Day with a speech in Tuscumbia, Ala. Mr. Reagan immediately accused Mr. Carter of opening his campaign in the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan, something that the Republican candidate had been told by an assistant but that was not true. Textbooks say the Klan originated in Pulaski, Tenn.
A modest flap developed, and Mr. Reagan was forced to issue a retraction, an embarrassing thing to have to do on the first day of a general election campaign.
Obviously, this did no long-term damage to the Reagan candidacy, since he won handily in November. But the minor factual mistake resulted in greater scrutiny of Mr. Reagan's words and led to a period when his campaign was hampered by a series of minor gaffes.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE RUNNING MATE;
Kemp Gives Early Look At Strategy

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Jack Kemp accepted the nomination for Vice President tonight by previewing the attacks he will offer against Democrats, characterizing his opponents as "elitists" who have resisted Republican efforts to cut taxes and regulations in favor of an intrusive government that "runs our lives."
"They don't have faith in people," Mr. Kemp said in an address that led up to Bob Dole's acceptance speech tonight. "They have faith in government. They trust governments more than markets, and that's why they raise taxes on middle-class people." 
 He continued: "That's the problem with elitists. They think they're better then the people. But the truth is there's a wisdom, there's an intelligence, in ordinary men and women far superior to the greatest so-called experts that have ever lived."
Mr. Kemp paid scant attention to the causes with which he has identified throughout his career. There was no mention of the gold standard or enterprise zones tonight. Instead he presented the Democratic Party as the protector of the establishment, and urged Americans to elect both Mr. Dole and a Republican Congress.
"The Democratic Party is the party of the status quo," he said. "And as of tonight, with Bob Dole as our leader, we're the party of change."
Mr. Kemp seemed to be balancing his desire not to be seen as an "attack dog" -- the traditional role of Vice-Presidential candidates, including Mr. Dole when he ran for Vice President in 1976 -- while still sharply indicting Democratic policies.
At the same time, the speech was notable for what Mr. Kemp did not mention, or only barely mentioned -- in particular affirmative action and anti-immigrant measures. Mr. Kemp has spent the last week repositioning himself to try to submerge his differences with Mr. Dole on those two issues. Mr. Dole has endorsed the elimination of affirmative action programs and called for restricting Government subsidies to illegal immigrants.
Tonight, Mr. Kemp, who has in the past declined to support some of the Republican proposals for restrictions on immigrants, said, "The reason we must close the backdoor of illegal immigration is so that we can keep open the front door of legal immigration -- and keep the light of opportunity lifted beside the golden door."
Mr. Kemp was scrappy and in good spirits throughout the 24 minutes of his speech. He began his remarks by joking about his verbosity. ("Before I speak, may I say a few words?" he asked to some laughter.) He pointed repeatedly into the crowd, as if he was able to recognize delegates through the television lights.
And, in the same way that Mr. Dole, in his acceptance speech, directly confronted questions about his age and his temperament, Mr. Kemp took on some of the questions raised about his own beliefs on certain issues and whether they meshed with Mr. Dole's.
"Guess what," Mr. Kemp said. "All the critics aside, I'm going to be with him. At his side. Every step of the way."
His speech was, over all, shorter and less soaring than Mr. Dole's. Mr. Kemp is seen as the better speaker, and aides said they were making certain that Mr. Kemp did not overshadow Mr. Dole tonight. One result was that Mr. Kemp's speech was mostly free of either the kind of sharp attacks or intellectual explorations for which he is known.
Yet there were some exceptions.
"With the end of the cold war," he said, "all the 'isms' of the 20th century -- Fascism, Nazism, Communism and the evil of apartheid-ism -- have failed. Except one. Only democracy has shown itself true the help of all mankind."
Mr. Kemp demonstrated with his speech one reason he was chosen by Mr. Dole, asserting, as Mr. Dole would later, that the Republican Party is more inclusive and moderate than it is reputed to be. He quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and referred to his own long-standing interest in programs to help depressed cities.
"American society as a whole can never achieve the outer-reaches of potential, so long as it tolerates the inner cities of despair," said Mr. Kemp, who served as Secretary of Housing under President George Bush. "I can tell you that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp will not tolerate that despair in our nation's cities."
Mr. Kemp, carrying out one of the dominant arguments of the evening, drew cheers as he reviewed the specifics of Mr. Dole's call for tax cuts. At the same time, he argued, as he has throughout his career, that such a program, if successful, would lead to economic growth -- to "not just a more prosperous America, but a better America."
"Tonight I'm putting our opponents on notice: We're going to ask for the support of every single American," he said.
"Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race and belief in America. We're not going to leave anybody out of this opportunity society. We may not get every vote, but we'll speak to every heart."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Ideals and Grit, and a Vast Imponderable

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
It is hard to say what more the Republicans could have done here.
They hid Pitchfork Pat Buchanan behind a haystack somewhere. They pushed contentious policy issues so far to the periphery of their convention that they may risk falling into the Pacific. They used every symbol at their disposal -- charismatic black orators, people coping bravely with disabilities, moms with babes in arms and even a macho governor of Texas sharing the spotlight with his ex-schoolteacher wife -- to send a message of diversity and inclusiveness. 
 There was only one flub: Jack Kemp's seeming flip-flop, within hours of being designated as the Vice Presidential candidate, on matters he had always professed to care deeply about: immigration and affirmative action.
Tonight, the party's nominee for the last Presidential election of this century, Bob Dole, surely the last member of the World War II generation to seek the White House, strove mightily to define himself and his values for a country that has still not figured him or them out after all his years of campaigning.
Mr. Dole's words took flight, even if his delivery -- his cadences and his gestures -- remained earthbound. He avoided, for the most part, the terse, cryptic asides that so confounded his audiences on the campaign trail.
Now the great imponderable is whether Mr. Dole converted enough of his unseen audience, the nation's politically agnostic voters, to give himself a real chance in November. He spoke for 57 minutes, straining the limits of television's short attention span. But at a minimum, he used the largest audience of his life to give a much fuller account of what makes him tick than ever before.
Speaking to an overwhelmingly urban and suburban nation that longs for the small-town verities of Jefferson's and Jackson's America, he portrayed himself as a man with his feet planted on the bedrock of American tradition, a John Wayne or a Jimmy Stewart doing battle with a President whom he pictured as rootless, glib, expedient and imprudent.
Speaking to a nation that has turned unwontedly pessimistic in the last decade, he described himself as "the most optimistic man in America."
His frequent invocation of God and his repeated paeans to grit and patriotism, to say nothing of his assaults on Bill Clinton's record at home and abroad, buoyed the delegates and sent many of them home believing a Republican victory might be within reach.
Those on the floor cheered, they shouted, they waved their red-white-and-blue placards, and a few of them cried, especially when Mr. Dole talked of the poverty of his parents.
"I am here to tell you," the Kansan said in a speech full of elegant, eloquent passages, "that permissive and destructive behavior must be opposed, that honor and liberty must be restored and that individual accountability must replace collective excuse.
"I am here to say to America, do not abandon the great traditions that stretch to the dawn of our history, do not topple the pillars of those beliefs -- God, family, honor, duty, country -- that have brought us through time and time and time and time again."
Mr. Dole indulged in no generalized diatribes, as so many other Republicans have done recently, against the institution in which he labored for decades. The Federal Government, he said, can be "the bridge between failure and success" for people, and he promised to safeguard Medicare, Social Security and the rights of immigrants. He invited those who disagreed with his stirring stand against racism to use the "clearly marked" exits to leave the hall.
He kept his finger off the hottest of hot buttons, like abortion and school prayer, and sometimes sounded as if he were talking back to the platform his party adopted this week.
It was a values speech more than a programmatic speech, except for some specific economic promises. It was a conservative speech that brought together the traditional conservatives' longing to safeguard the old and good and the newer, more radical conservatives' determination to rip out the new and bad. In that sense, it was a unity speech.
It was a candid speech, neither apologizing for nor ducking Mr. Dole's age (73) or his lack of political glamour. "Good Presidents and good candidates don't run from the truth," the nominee said at one point.
It had moments of real humility. "I can only look up, and at a very steep angle, to Washington and Lincoln," he said.
It was also a partisan speech, in which Mr. Dole mocked President Clinton's "touchy-feely" style with the comment "I don't need the Presidency to make or refresh my soul," and scorned Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, "It Takes a Village," with the insistence that no, "it takes a family" to raise a child. He credited Republicans and Republicans alone with winning the cold war.
But the speech was free of rancor. Often accused of harshness, Mr. Dole went out of his way to say of Mr. Clinton, "He is my opponent, not my enemy."
For some commentators and some Republicans, the convention was too pat. They bemoaned its dearth of fresh ideas and its reliance on the technological and dramatic capabilities of television, epitomized by Elizabeth Dole's performance as the Oprah Winfrey of nominating night. A few suggested that platform fights and formal, podium-bound nominating and keynote speeches might now be passe.
Conventions have always been a blend of substance and stagecraft, at least since William Jennings Bryan, pressing the cause of free silver at Chicago in 1896, thundered melodramatically at his enemies, "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." The stagecraft has now all but eclipsed the substance.
Yet if the convention had strayed from the script, as did the Republican convention at Houston in 1992 and the Democratic gathering in Chicago in 1968, yielding scenes of disunity or disorder, critics would have written off Mr. Dole's chances before the campaign got under way. In the media age, public displays of intraparty intolerance and controversy have become too costly to permit.
But slick productions like this week's also bear price tags. The big broadcast networks devoted less time than ever to their live telecasts, spent more time than ever calling attention to the political packaging and attracted smaller audiences than ever before -- about 15 million viewers combined on Monday and Tuesday nights. Network newscasts, cable channels, the print media, radio and the Internet also helped spread the word, but each applied its own "filter."
There is little doubt that the Republican delegates and officeholders were energized, to use a currently fashionable political buzz word, by what took place in San Diego this week. That by itself will pay major dividends in fund raising and in the vigor with which workers for the national, state and local candidates bend to their tasks.
But it will take time, during which the Democrats will apply all the reverse spin they can at their convention the week after next in Chicago, to judge whether Mr. Dole has achieved any more here than an ephemeral "bounce" in the polls.
There are historical reasons to be dubious, plus some preliminary polling data from this week. Three days of nationwide questioning by CBS News found widespread skepticism about Mr. Dole's plan for tax cuts and indeed about the whole idea of cutting taxes now. The survey showed that most voters with an opinion of him have a negative one and that most women remain very wary of him.
But that, of course, was before tonight's convention-topping speech.
Richard M. Nixon, that most hard-nosed of modern Republican Presidents, once said: "There is one thing solid and fundamental in politics: the law of change. What's up today is down tomorrow." Mr. Dole now has about 11 weeks of tomorrows to make that come true in the Presidential politics of 1996.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Dole's Speech Accepting the G.O.P. Nomination for President

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Following are remarks tonight by Bob Dole, accepting the Republican Party's Presidential nomination:
This is a big night for me and I'm ready. We're ready to go. 
 Thank you California. And thank you San Diego for hosting the greatest Republican convention of them all, the greatest of them all.
Thank you President Ford and President Bush and God bless you Nancy Reagan for your moving tribute to President Reagan.
By the way, I spoke to President Reagan this afternoon and I made him a promise that we would win one more for the Gipper. Are you ready? And he appreciated it very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, delegates to the convention, and fellow citizens: I cannot say it more clearly than in plain speaking. I accept your nomination to lead our party once again to the presidency of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will.
And I am profoundly moved by your confidence and trust, and I look forward to leading America into the next century.
But this moment, but this is not my moment, it is yours. It is yours, Elizabeth. It is yours, Robin. It is yours, Jack and Joanne Kemp.
And do not think that I have forgotten whose moment this is above all. It is for the people of America that I stand here tonight, and by their generous leave. And as my voice echoes across darkness and desert, as it is heard over car radios on coastal roads, and as it travels above farmland and suburb, deep into the heart of cities that, from space look tonight like strings of sparkling diamonds, I can tell you that I know whose moment this is: It is yours. It is yours entirely.
And who am I, and who am I, that stands before you tonight?
 
Remembering the Beginning
I was born in Russell, Kan., a small town in the middle of the prairie surrounded by wheat and oil wells. As my neighbors and friends from Russell, who tonight sit in the front of this hall, know well, Russell, though not the West, looks out upon the West. And like most small towns on the plains, it is a place where no one grows up without an intimate knowledge of distance.
And the first thing you learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man compared to the lay of the land. And under the immense sky where I was born and raised, a man is very small, and if he thinks otherwise, he's wrong.
I come from good people, very good people, and I'm proud of it. My father's name was Doran, my mother's name was Bina. I loved them, and there is no moment when my memory of them and my love for them does not overshadow anything I do, even this, even here.
And there is no height to which I have risen that is high enough to allow me to forget them, to allow me to forget where I came from and where I stand, and how I stand, with my feet on the ground, just a man, at the mercy of God.
And this perspective has been strengthened and solidified by a certain wisdom that I owe not to any achievement of my own, but to the gracious compensations of age. And I know that in some quarters I may not, I may be expected to run from the truth of this. But I was born in 1923, facts are better than dreams, and good presidents and good candidates don't run from the truth.
I do not need the presidency to make or refresh my soul. That false hope I will gladly leave to others, for greatness lies not in what office you hold, but in how honest you are, in how you face adversity, and in your willingness to stand fast in hard places.
Age has its advantages. Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith, and confidence in action. And to those who say it was never so, that America has not been better, I say, you're wrong, and I know, because I was there. And I have seen it. And I remember.
And our nation, though wounded and scathed, has outlasted revolution, civil war, world war, racial oppression and economic catastrophe. We have fought and prevailed on almost every continent and in almost every sea. We have even lost, but we have lasted, and we have always come through.
What enabled us to accomplish this has little to do with the values of the present. After decades of assault upon what made America great, upon supposedly obsolete values. What have we reaped? What have we created? What do we have? What we have in the opinion of millions of Americans is crime and drugs, illegitimacy, abortion, the abdication of duty, and the abandonment of children.
And after the virtual devastation of the American family, the rock upon this country -- on which this country was founded, we are told that it takes a village, that is, the collective, and thus, the state, to raise a child. The state is now more involved than it has ever been in the raising of children, and children are now more neglected, abused, and more mistreated than they have been in our time. This is not a coincidence. This is not a coincidence, and, with all due respect, I am here to tell you, it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child.
If I could by magic restore to every child who lacks a father or a mother, that father or that mother, I would. And though I cannot, I would never turn my back on them, and I shall as President, promote measures that keep families whole.
I am here to tell you that permissive and destructive behavior must be opposed, that honor and liberty must be restored, and that individual accountability must replace collective excuse. And I am here to say to America, do not abandon the great traditions that stretch to the dawn of our history, do not topple the pillars of those beliefs -- God, family, honor, duty, country -- that have brought us through time and time and time and time again.
 
On Old Values
To those who believe that I am too combative, I say, if I am combative, it is for love of country. It is to uphold a standard that I was born and bred to defend. And to those who believe that I live and breathe compromise, I say that in politics, honorable compromise is no sin. It's what protects us from absolutism and intolerance. But one must never compromise in regard to God, and family, and honor, and duty and country.
I am here to set a marker, so that all may know that it is possible to rise in politics with these things firmly in mind, not compromised, and never abandoned, never abandoned. For the old values endure. And though they may sleep and though they may falter, they endure. I know this is true. And to anyone who believes that restraint, honor, and trust in the people cannot be returned to the government, I say, follow me.
Only right conduct distinguished a great nation from one that cannot rise above itself. It has never been otherwise. Right conduct every day at every level in all facets of life -- the decision of a child not to use drugs, of a student not to cheat, of a young woman or young man to serve when called, of a screenwriter to refuse to add the mountains of trash, of a businessman not to bribe, of a politician to cast the vote or take action that will put his office or his chances of victory at risk but which is right.
And why have so many of us -- and I do not exclude myself, for I am not the model of perfection -- why have so many of us been failing these tests for so long?
The answer is not a mystery. It is, to the contrary, quite simple and can be given quite simply. It is because, for too long, we have had a leadership that has been unwilling to risk the truth, to speak without calculation, to sacrifice itself.
An administration in its very existence communicates this day by day until it flows down like rain and the rain becomes a river and the river becomes a flood.
Now, which is more important? Wealth or honor?
It is not, as was said by the victors four years ago, "the economy, stupid." It's the kind of nation we are. It's whether we still possess the wit and determination to deal with many questions, including economic questions, but certainly not limited to them.
All things do not flow from wealth or poverty. I know this first hand, and so do you. All things flow from doing what is right. The triumph of this nation, the triumph of this nation lies not in its material wealth but in courage, sacrifice and honor. We tend to forget this when our leaders forget it, and we tend to remember it when they remember it.
The high office of the presidency requires not a continuous four-year campaign for re-election, but, rather, broad oversight and attention to three essential areas -- the material, the moral, and the nation's survival, in that ascending order of importance.
And in the last Presidential election, in the last Presidential election,
you, the people, were gravely insulted. You were told that the material was not only the most important of these three but, in fact, really the only one that really mattered. I don't hold to that for a moment. No one can deny the importance of material well being. And in this regard it is time to recognize that we have surrendered too much of our economic liberty.
I do not appreciate the value of economic liberty nearly as much for what it has done in keeping us fed as to what it's done in keeping us free. The freedom of the marketplace is not merely the best guarantor of our prosperity, it is the chief guarantor of our rights. And a government that seizes control of the economy for the good of the people, ends up seizing control of the people for the good of the economy.
And our opponents portray the right to enjoy the fruits of one's own time and labor as a kind of selfishness against which they must fight for the good of the nation. But they are deeply mistaken, for when they gather to themselves the authority to take the earnings and direct the activities of the people, they are fighting not for our sake, but for the power to tell us what to do.
And you now work from the first of January into May just to pay your taxes, so that the party of government can satisfy its priorities with the sweat of your brow, because they think that what you would do with your own money would be morally and practically less admirable than what they would do with it.
And that has simply got to stop. It's got to stop in America. It is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes.
Somewhere, a grandmother couldn't afford to call her granddaughter, or a child went without a book, or a family couldn't afford that first home, because there was just not enough money to make that call, buy the book or pay the mortgage or, for that matter, to do many other things that one has the right and often the obligation to do. Why? Because some genius in the Clinton Administration took the money to fund yet another theory, yet another program, and yet another bureaucracy. Are they taking care of you or are they taking care of themselves?
 
 Economics for the Future
And I have asked myself that question and I say, let the people be free to keep as much of what they earn as the Government can strain with all its might not to take, not the other way around.
I trust the American people to work in the best interest of the people. And I believe that every family, wage earner and small business in America can do better -- if only we have the right policies in Washington, D.C.
And make no mistake about it: my economic program is the right policy for America and for the future and for the next century. And here's what it'll mean to you. Here's what it will mean to you.
It means you will have a President who will urge Congress to pass and send to the states for ratification a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
It means you will have a President and a Congress who will have the will to balance the budget by the year 2002.
It means you will have a President who will reduce taxes 15 percent across-the-board for every taxpayer in America. It will include a $500 per child tax credit for lower- and middle-income families. Taxes for a family of four making $35,000 would be reduced by more than half -- 56 percent to be exact. And that's a big, big reduction.
It means you'll have a President who will help small businesses -- the businesses that create most new jobs -- by reducing the capital gains tax rate by 50 percent. Cut it in half. It means you will have a President who will end the I.R.S. as we know it. It means you will have a President who will expand Individual Retirement Accounts, repeal President Clinton's Social Security tax increase, provide estate tax relief, reduce government regulation, reform our civil justice system, provide educational opportunity scholarships, and a host of other proposals that will create more opportunity, and security for all Americans and all across America.
And I will not stop there. Working with Jack Kemp and a Republican Congress, I will not be satisfied until we have reformed our entire tax code, and made it fairer, and flatter and simpler for the American people.
The principle involved here is time-honored and true: and that is, it's your money. You shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep what you earn. To the contrary, the Government should apologize for taking too much of it. The Clinton Administration just doesn't get it, and that's why they have got to go.
 
Restoring the Promise
The President is content with the way things are. I am not. We must commit ourselves to a far more ambitious path that puts growth -- expanding opportunities, rising incomes and soaring prosperity -- at the heart of national policy.
We must also commit ourselves to a trade policy that does not suppress pay and threaten American jobs. And by any measure the trade policy of the Clinton Administration has been a disaster. Trade deficits are skyrocketing and middle-income families are paying the price.
My administration will fully enforce our trade laws and not let our national sovereignty be infringed by the World Trade Organization or any other international body.
Jack Kemp and I will restore the promise of America and get the economy moving again, and we'll do so without leaving anybody behind. And I have learned in my own life, from my own experience, that not every man, woman, or child can make it on their own. And that in a time of need, the bridge between failure and success can be the government itself.
And given all that I have experienced, I shall always remember those in need. And that is why I helped to save Social Security in 1983. And that is why I will be the President who preserves, protects and strengthens Medicare for America's senior citizens.
For I will never forget the man who rode on a train from Kansas to Michigan to see his son, who was thought to be dying in an Army hospital. When he arrived, his feet had swollen and he could hardly walk, because he had to make the trip, from Kansas to Michigan, standing up most of the way.
Who was that man? He was my father. My father was poor. And I loved my father. Do you imagine for one minute that as I sign the bills that will set the economy free I will not be faithful to Americans in need? You can be certain that I will, for to do otherwise would be to betray those whom I love and honor most, and I will betray nothing.
Let me speak about immigration. Let me speak about immigration. The right and obligation of a sovereign nation to control its own borders is beyond debate. We should not have here a single illegal immigrant. But the question of immigration is broader than that, and let me be specific. A family from Mexico who arrived here this morning, legally, has as much right to the American dream as the direct descendants of the founding fathers.
The Republican Party is broad and inclusive. It represents many streams of opinion and many points of view. But if there is anyone who has mistakenly attached himself to our party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of every race and religion, then let me remind you:
Tonight this hall belongs to the party of Lincoln, and the exits, which are clearly marked, are for you to walk out of as I stand this ground without compromise.
And though I can only look up, and though I can only look up and at a very steep angle, to Washington and Lincoln, let me remind you of their concern for the sometimes delicate unity of the people. The notion that we are and should be one people rather than "peoples" of the United States seems so self-evident and obvious that it is hard for me to imagine that I must defend it.
 
Pride in America
When I was growing up in Russell, Kan., it was clear to me that my pride and my home, were in America, not in any faction and not in any division. In this I was heeding, even as I do unto this day, Washington's eloquent rejection of factionalism. I was honoring, even as I do unto this day, Lincoln's words, his life, and his sacrifice.
The principle of unity has been with us in all our successes. The 10th Mountain Division, which I served in Italy, and the black troops of the 92d Division who fought nearby, were the proof for me, once again, of the truth I'm here trying to convey.
The war was fought just a generation after America's greatest and most intense period of immigration. And yet, when the blood of the sons of the immigrants and the grandsons of slaves fell on foreign fields, it was American blood. In it you could not read the ethnic particulars of the soldier who died next to you. He was an American. And when I think of how we learned this lesson, I wonder how we could have unlearned it.
Is the principle of unity, so hard fought and at the cost of so many lives, having been contested again and again in our history and at such a terrible price, to be casually abandoned to the urge to divide? The answer is no. Must we give in to the senseless drive to break apart that which is beautiful, and whole, and good?
And so tonight, I call on every American to rise above all that may divide us, and to defend the unity of the nation for the honor of generations past and the sake of those to come.
The Constitution of the United States mandates equal protection under the law. This is not code language for racism, it is plain speaking against it.
And the guiding light of my administration will be that in this country we have no rank order by birth, no claim to favoritism by race, no expectation of judgment other than it be evenhanded. And we cannot guarantee the outcome, but we shall guarantee the opportunity in America.
I will speak plainly, on another subject of importance. We are not educating all of our children. Too many are being forced to absorb the fads of the moment. Not for nothing are we the biggest education spenders and among the lowest education achievers among the leading industrial nations.
The teachers' unions nominated Bill Clinton in 1992, they are funding his re-election now, and they, his most reliable supporters, know he will maintain the status quo.
And I say this, I say this not to the teachers, but to their unions. I say this, if education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying. And to the teachers unions I say, when I am President, I will disregard your political power, for the sake of the parents, the children, the schools and the nation.
I plan to enrich your vocabulary with those words you fear -- school choice and competition and opportunity scholarships -- all this for low and middle income families so that you will join the rest of us in accountability, while others compete with you for the commendable privilege of giving our children a real education.
There is no reason why those who live on any street in America should not have the same right as the person who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- the right to send your child to the school of your choice. And if we want to reduce crime, if we want to reduce crime and drug use and teen pregnancies, let's start by giving all our children a first-class education.
And I also want these children to inherit a country that is far safer than it is at present. I seek for our children and grandchildren a world more open, and with more opportunity, than ever before. But in wanting these young Americans to be able to make the best of this, I want first and foremost for them to be safe.
I want to remove the shadow that darkens opportunities for every man, woman, and child in America. We are a nation paralyzed by crime, and it is time to end that in America.
And to do so, to do so, I mean to attack the root cause of crime -- criminals, violent criminals. And as our many and voracious criminals go to bed tonight, at, say six in the morning, they had better pray that I lose the election. Because if I win, the lives of violent criminals are going to be hell.
During the Reagan Administration, we abolished parole at the Federal level. In the Dole administration, we will work with the nation's governors to abolish parole for violent criminals all across America. And with my national instant check initiative, we will keep all guns out of the hands of criminals.
 
Tests for Judiciary
And I have been asked if I have a litmus test for judges. I do. My litmus test for judges is that they be intolerant of outrage, that their passion is not to amend but to interpret the Constitution, that they are restrained in regard to those who live within the law and strict with those who break it.
And for those who say that I should not make President Clinton's liberal judicial appointments an issue of this campaign, I have a simple response. I have heard your argument: the motion is denied.
I save my respect for the Constitution, not for those who would ignore it, violate it, or replace it with conceptions of their own fancy. My administration will zealously protect civil and constitutional rights, while never forgetting that our own primary duty is protecting law-abiding citizens -- everybody in this hall.
I have no intention of ignoring violent -- I said violent -- criminals, understanding them, or buying them off. A nation that cannot defend itself from outrage does not deserve to survive. And a President who cannot lead against those who prey upon it does not deserve to be President of the United States of America. I am prepared to risk more political capital in defense of domestic tranquillity than any President you have ever known. The time for such risk is long overdue.
And in defending the nation from external threats, the requirements for survival cannot merely be finessed. There is no room for margin for error. On this subject, perhaps more than any other, a President must level with the people, and be prepared to take political risks. And I would rather do what is called for in this regard and be unappreciated than fail to do so and win universal acclaim.
And it must be said: Because of misguided priorities, there have been massive cuts in funding for our national security. I believe President Clinton has failed to adequately provide for our defense. And for whatever reason his neglect, it is irresponsible.
I ask that you consider these crystal-clear differences. He believes it is acceptable to ask our military forces to do more with less. I do not. He defends giving a green light to a terrorist state, Iran, to expand its influence in Europe, and he relies on the United Nations to Libyan terrorists who murdered American citizens. I will not. And he believes that defending our people and our territory from missile attack is unnecessary. I do not.
And on my first day in office, I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack and rebuild our armed forces. It is a course, it is a course President Clinton has refused to take. On my first day in office, I will put terrorists on notice: If you harm one American, you harm all Americans. And America will pursue you to the ends of the earth. In short, don't mess with us if you're not prepared to suffer the consequences. Thank you.
And furthermore, the lesson has always been clear. If we are prepared to defend -- if we are prepared to fight many wars, and greater wars, and any wars that come, we will have to fight fewer wars, and lesser wars, and perhaps no wars at all. It has always been so, and will ever be so.
 
Military Commitment
And I am not the first to say that the long gray line has never failed us, and it never has. For those who might be sharply taken aback in thinking of Vietnam, think again, for in Vietnam the long gray line did not fail us, we failed it in Vietnam. The American soldier, the American soldier was not made for the casual and arrogant treatment that he suffered there, where he was committed without clear purpose or resolve, bound by rules that prevented victory, and kept waiting in the valley of the shadow of death for 10 years while the nation debated the undebatable question of his honor.
No. The American soldier was not made to be thrown into battle without clear purpose or resolve, not made to be abandoned in the field of battle, not made to give his life for indifference or lack of respect.
And I will never commit the American soldier to an ordeal without the prospect of victory. And when I am President, every man and every woman in our Armed Forces will know the President is their commander in chief -- not Boutros Boutros Ghali or any other U.N. secretary general.
This I owe not only to the living but to the dead, to every patriot, to every patriot grave, to the ghosts of Valley Forge, of Flanders Field, of Bataan, of Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sanh, and the Gulf. This I owe to the men who died on the streets of Mogadishu not three years ago, to the shadows of the bluffs of Normandy, to the foot soldiers who never came home, to the airmen who fell to earth, and to the sailors who rest perpetually at sea.
This is not an issue of politics, but far graver than that. Like the bond of trust between a parent and a child, it is the lifeblood of the nation. It commands not only sacrifice but a grace in leadership embodying both caution and daring at the same time. And this we owe not only to ourselves. Our allies demand consistency and resolve, which they deserve from us as we deserve it from them. But even if they falter, we cannot, for history has made us the leader, and we are obliged by history to keep the highest standard possibly.
And in this regard may I remind you of the nation's debt to Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush. President Nixon engaged China and the Soviet Union with diplomatic genius. President Ford, who gave me my start in 1976, stood fast in a time of great difficulty, and with the greatest of dignity.
Were it not for President Reagan, the Soviet Union would still be standing today. He brought the Cold War to an end -- not, as some demanded, through compromise and surrender -- but by winning it. That's how he brought the cold war to an end.
President Bush, with a mastery that words fail to convey, guided the Gulf War coalition and its military forces to victory. A war that might have lasted years and taken the lives of tens of thousands of Americans passed so swiftly and passed so smoothly that history has yet to catch its breath and give him the credit he is due. History is like that. History is like that. Whenever we forget its singular presence it gives us a lesson in grace and awe.
And when I look back upon my life, I see less and less of myself, and more and more of history of this civilization that we have made, that is called America. And I am content and always will be content to see my own story subsumed in great events, the greatest of which is the simple onward procession of the American people.
What a high privilege it is to be at the center in these times, and this I owe to you, the American people. I owe everything to you, and to make things right and to close the circle I will return to you as much as I possibly can. It is incumbent upon me to do so, it is my duty and my deepest desire.
And so tonight, I respectfully, I respectfully ask for your blessing and your support. The election will not be decided -- the election will not be decided -- by the polls or by the opinion-makers or by the pundits. It will be decided by you. It will be decided by you.
And I ask for your vote so that I may bring you an administration that is able, honest and trusts in you.
For the fundamental issue is not of policy, but of trust -- not merely whether the people trust the President, but whether the President and his party trust the people, trust in their goodness and their genius for recovery. That's what the election is all about. For the Government cannot direct the people, the people must direct the government.
This is not the outlook of my opponent -- and he is my opponent -- not my enemy.
Though he has of late tried to be a good Republican -- and I expect him here tonight -- there are certain distinctions that even he cannot blur. There are distinctions between the two great parties that will be debated, and must be debated, the next 82 days. He and his party who brought us the biggest tax increase in the history of America.
We are the party of lower taxes and greater opportunity.
We are the party whose resolve did not flag as the cold war dragged on, we did not tremble before a Soviet giant that was just about to fall, and we did not have to be begged to take up arms against Saddam Hussein.
We're not the party that, as drug use has soared among the young, hears no evil, sees no evil, and just cannot say, "just say no."
We are the party that trusts in the people. I trust in the people. That is the heart of all I have tried to say tonight.
My friends, a Presidential campaign is more than a contest of candidates, more than a clash of opposing philosophies. It is a mirror held up to America. It is a measurement of who we are and where we come from, and where we're going. For as much inspiration as we may draw from a glorious past, we recognize America preeminently as a country of tomorrow. For we were placed here, for a purpose, by a higher power, there's no doubt about it. Every soldier in uniform, every school child who recites the Pledge of Allegiance, every citizen who places her hand on her heart when the flag goes by, recognizes and responds to our American destiny.
Optimism is in our blood. I know this as few others can. There was once a time when I doubted the future. But I have learned as many of you have learned that obstacles can be overcome, and I have unlimited confidence in the wisdom of our people and the future of our country.
Tonight, I stand before you, tested by adversity, made sensitive by hardship, a fighter by principle and the most optimistic man in America. My life is proof that America is a land without limits.
With my feet on the ground, and my heart filled with hope, I put my faith in you and in the God who loves us all. For I am convinced that America's best days are yet to come. May God bless you. And may God bless America. Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE OVERVIEW;
DOLE, 'THE MOST OPTIMISTIC MAN IN AMERICA,' VOWS RETURN TO NATION'S ENDURING VALUES

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Bob Dole accepted the Republican Party's Presidential nomination tonight and sought to turn his age and his temperament into virtues by urging Americans to embrace him as "a fighter by principle and the most optimistic man in America."
Putting aside the bitter disputes that have come to characterize Republicans, Mr. Dole also left behind for this night the wavering mood that has characterized his campaign. Instead, he offered determination and his rarely seen but winning smile to an audience yearning for him to seize the moment. He reached back to some earlier, loftier time of the nation and his party as he appealed to voters around the nation who have been repelled by what they view as a harshness from its leaders. 
 "The Republican Party is broad and inclusive," Mr. Dole declared as he summoned the hall to a frenzy of flag-waving. "It represents many streams of opinion and many points of view. But if there is anyone who has mistakenly attached himself to our party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of every race and religion, then let me remind you: Tonight this hall belongs to the party of Lincoln, and the exits, which are clearly marked, are for you to walk out of as I stand this ground without compromise."
Standing before his party as its leader after two failed campaigns for the Presidential nomination, Mr. Dole set out to take advantage of the largest television audience he has ever attracted -- with a bold self-portrait of a patriarchal figure rooted in timeless American values.
Written largely by the novelist Mark Helprin, the speech sometimes seemed at odds with Mr. Dole's laconic style, often marked by incomplete sentences. In another striking departure, the ordinarily oblique Mr. Dole repeatedly referred to himself in the first person. [Text, page A26.]
Despite the written flourishes, Mr. Dole drew an often pallid reception from the hall, and it was uncertain whether he connected with the television audience. Mr. Dole, still uneasy with the twin teleprompter screens that flank a modern politician's lectern, looked dour and uncomfortable at times as his eyes flicked from side to side and he often looked down.
In his evocative finale to the four-day convention, Mr. Dole kept up the tone that has marked speech after speech here: The word abortion appeared only once in text and there was scant mention of his 35-year career in the House and Senate, where he was majority leader until he retired in June.
The presentation veered repeatedly into oddly placed political messages, mixing, for example, an attack on teachers' unions with passages about his life, his country and his vision.
Mr. Dole also seized the prime-time opportunity to present once again his plan to cut taxes by 15 percent and balance the budget as a sure way to "restore the promise of America." Mocking Bill Clinton's campaign mantra of four years ago, he said: "Which is more important, wealth or honor? It is not, as was said by the victors four years ago, 'the economy, stupid.' It's the kind of nation we are."
In his acceptance speech for the Vice-Presidential nomination, Jack Kemp, a former Buffalo Congressman and former Housing Secretary, also sketched out the economic plan as he asserted that, "The genius of the American people is being stifled -- our economy is growing at the slowest pace of any recovery in the century."
Between the well-crafted appeals to all voters, Mr. Dole's purpose tonight was to close President Clinton's advantage in the polls, and he did not shrink from raising doubts about the President's character and accusing him of "a continuous four-year campaign for re-election."
While he sarcastically described Mr. Clinton as trying to be "a good Republican," Mr. Dole also cited "crystal clear differences" with him on a range of issues, from school choice, to building up the military to battling crime to unraveling of American families.
Early on in the 57-minute address, Mr. Dole confronted two issues that have dogged his campaign: that, at the age of 73, he would be the oldest President elected to a first term, and that he is too combative to lead the country.
After recalling his humble origins in Russell, Kan., "a small town in the middle of the prairie surrounded by wheat and oil wells," Mr. Dole portrayed himself as a man of the people who has the maturity to lead as he asked voters to turn to a man of the World War II generation.
"This perspective has been strengthened and solidified by a certain wisdom that I owe not to any achievement of my own, but to the gracious compensations of age," he said. "Now, I know that in some quarters I may be expected to run from the truth of this. But I was born in 1923, and facts are better than dreams, and good Presidents and good candidates don't run from the truth."
Depicting himself as driven not by ambition but by devotion to the people, Mr. Dole went on: "I do not need the Presidency to make or refresh my soul. That false hope I will gladly leave to others. For greatness lies not in what office you hold, but in how honest you are, in how you face adversity -- and in your willingness to stand fast in hard places.
"Age has its advantages," he continued. "Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action. And to those who say it was never so, that America has not been better, I say, you're wrong: And I know, because I was there. And I have seen it. And I remember."
Then Mr. Dole moved to assure people that despite his reputation as a legislative mechanic who is known for his sharp asides, he has the calm temperament to be President. "To those who believe I am too combative, I say, if I am combative it is for love of country. It is to uphold a standard that I was born and bred to defend. And to those who believe that I live and breathe compromise, I say that in politics honorable compromise is no sin, it is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance. But one must never compromise in regard to God and family and honor and duty and country."
Mr. Dole's address capped a cheery demonstration of smiling Republicans united behind the retired Senator. All week, the televised images were not of partisan squabbling over abortion, immigration or affirmative action but of an inclusive, diverse party that, for viewers who remember the hard-edged Houston convention in 1992, represented a complete metamorphosis. The convention also offered a tamer face for Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress that was elected in 1994.
But the tableau of harmony -- reinforced as Patrick J. Buchanan and other primary opponents joined him on the podium tonight -- was essentially a television program that was precisely controlled by Mr. Dole's campaign and the Republican Party.
Beyond the merriment on the convention floor, there was evidence of dissent that has long wracked the party: anti-abortion advocates grumbled that their position was virtually absent from the program; moderates balked at the platform's conservative orthodoxy and Republicans of all stripes expressed nervousness over whether the convention would give Mr. Dole the "bounce" he needs for the 81 days before the election.
On some issues, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp steered clear of their party's strongly worded platform, like the plank on immigration, which calls for restrictions on Government benefits for legal immigrants. "We should not have here a single illegal immigrant," Mr. Dole said. But, he went on, "A family from Mexico who arrived this morning, legally, has as much right to the American dream as the direct descendants of the founding fathers." Mr. Kemp asserted that "we can keep open the front door of legal immigration."
And while Mr. Dole depicted himself as a man who would come to the aid of the poor, he glossed over a record that his critics depict as tough on the underclass.
Mr. Dole opened the speech with an emotional tribute to his father, Doran, who owned an egg and cream station, and his mother, Bina, who sold sewing machines out of the back of her car.
"My father's name was Doran, my mother's Bina," he said. "I loved them and there is no moment when my memory of them and my love for them does not overshadow anything I do -- even this, even here. There is no height to which I have risen that is high enough to allow me to forget them, to allow me to forget where I came from, where I stand and how I stand, with my feet on the ground -- just a man at the mercy of God."
From the start, Mr. Dole invoked the most basic themes: God, family, honor, duty and country in defining himself as a candidate apart from Mr. Clinton. Yet Mr. Dole did not hesitate to confront the man he wants to oust from the White House.
"It is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes," he said.
Without mentioning the First Lady by name, Mr. Dole ridiculed Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, "It Takes a Village," even before he criticized her husband. "The state is now more involved than it has ever been in the raising of children," he said, "and children are now more neglected, more abused and more mistreated than they have been in our time. This is not a coincidence, and, with all due respect, I am here to tell you that it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child." Delivering one of the most slicing speeches of the convention, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas also made fun of Mrs. Clinton's book on Tuesday.
In the address marking his most comprehensive effort to define the hopes of his candidacy, Mr. Dole raised the stakes for his blueprint to cut taxes, which his critics say conflicts with his career of championing balancing the budget.
He also took on Mr. Clinton on a panoply of issues. "And on my first day in office," he said, "I will put America on a course that will end our vulnerability to missile attack and rebuild our armed forces. It is a course that President Clinton has refused to take. On my first day in office, I will also put terrorists on notice: If you harm one American, you harm all Americans. And America will pursue you to the ends of the Earth."
He added sternly, "In short, don't mess with us unless you are prepared to suffer the consequences."
In preparation for the speech by Mr. Kemp, a onetime professional quarterback, delegates were handed mini-footballs as the filed into the convention hall. Mr. Kemp, who is known more than Mr. Dole as a man who likes to talk exuberantly of ideas, used his acceptance speech not so much as an attack dog but to lay out some of those ideas and deliver a message of inclusiveness.
"I am putting our opponents on notice," he said. "We are asking for the support of every single American. Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race and belief. We may not get every vote, but we will speak to every heart."
As evidence of the high stakes for Mr. Dole in this speech, frantic aides said that even though the candidate toiled over drafts for nearly four months, he was still wrestling with it late this afternoon. The final product has had many authors. The first draft was by Mr. Helprin, the novelist who wrote Mr. Dole's well-received speech when he announced on May 14 that he was resigning the Senate. But John Buckley, the campaign's communications director, and others have been deeply involved in the writing. And by this morning, Mr. Helprin had left town in what campaign aides said was a dispute over the content.
For a politician who disdains windy speeches, especially ones that verge on philosophical, tonight's speech was even more of a challenge. In addition, Mr. Dole had to follow three days of well-received oratory, from Gen. Colin L. Powell to last night, when Elizabeth Hanford Dole waded talk-show-host style onto the convention floor.
As the candidate himself cracked at a tribute to Mrs. Dole this afternoon: "After Elizabeth's performance last night, I better practice. In fact, one of the TV anchors said last night he was glad Elizabeth didn't do this earlier, or he wouldn't have a job. He would be out of work."
Adding to the pressure was that the President, who will have his own week in the limelight when the Democrats gather in Chicago on Aug. 26 can be a distinguished orator. But Mr. Dole's advisers said they hope that Mr. Dole's plain-spoken delivery will make a powerful contrast to Mr. Clinton -- and appear more genuine than from a President whom the Republicans ridiculed all week long as an untrustworthy occupant of the White House.
While Mr. Dole's speech drew mixed notices among delegates, Patricia Adair, from Kansas, said, "This speech is better, peppier than what I've heard from him before and saying what people want to hear -- the truth." But David Tenwell, an alternate from Montana was less enthused: "I don't think it was a home run. The man is just not an orator. But he is not supposed to be. He is supposed to be the next President of the United States, and he did specify what he is going to do."
Even as the Republicans proclaimed their convention a ringing success, Mr. Dole still faces a struggle. A nationwide poll taken over the last three days by CBS News shows widespread skepticism for his economic plan. About 3 in 10 registered voters say taxes will increase in a Dole presidency, and 4 in 10 say taxes will stay about the same.
The poll also found that half of registered voters think cutting taxes by 15 percent is the wrong thing for the country. And given a choice, voters would rather see their representatives reduce the Federal budget deficit than cut taxes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Mark As German Rate Cut Is Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday, bolstered by growing speculation that Germany's central bank will reduce interest rates when its policy council meets on Thursday.
"People are thinking a Bundesbank rate cut is a done deal next week," said Steve Koenig, manager of currency sales at Bank Brussels Lambert. "That's why we're seeing the mark fall." 
 Lower short-term rates in Germany reduce the appeal of bank deposits there, and often weigh on the mark.
The market was full of speculation yesterday that reports on the German money supply would show that its growth slowed last month, giving the central bank room to reduce rates. Some Bundesbank officials have said such a slowdown is a prerequisite for a rate cut. The central bank is expected to release money supply figures early next week.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4918 marks, from 1.4854 marks on Thursday and the highest level since July 18. The dollar slipped to 107.70 Japanese yen from 108.10 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5481 from $1.5510.
Hopes for a German rate cut have been building for several days, encouraged by comments from Bundesbank officials.
"The Germans are trying to make it fairly clear that their economy is not in the greatest shape, and they're concerned about the mark's strength," said Bob Gruber, senior currency salesman at Chase Manhattan Bank. "What better way to keep it under control than to cut rates?"
The mark also suffered from talk that a survey to be published next week by a German economic research institute would show that the economy was still sputtering.
Many analysts predict that on Thursday the central bank will lower its 14-day repurchase rate, which it charges on short-term loans to financial institutions in exchange for government securities.
"The rumor mill is starting up again regarding a Bundesbank rate cut next week," said Ben Strauss, currency trader at Bank Julius Baer.
But the Bundesbank surprised many traders by leaving rates unchanged at its last meeting on July 25, prompting a rebound in the mark. The central bank has held the repo rate at 3.3 percent since February.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Post Their First Gains in a Week

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices gained yesterday for the first time in a week, aided by a report on housing starts that pointed to a slowing economy.
"When the dust clears, we're going to find out we still have moderate growth and low inflation," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson in Chicago. "The bond market is going to head higher." 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , to 9928/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.76 percent from 6.80 percent.
For the week, bonds slumped enough to lift yields 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Bond prices were bolstered early in the trading day by speculation that the Bundesbank would cut German interest rates as soon as Thursday. Such a move would make yields on United States securities more attractive in comparison.
Also buoying bonds today was a Commerce Department report that home construction in July was at a 1.455 million annual rate, down 1.3 percent from the previous month's pace.
July's decline in housing starts came as little surprise after a downturn in sales the previous month. Sales of new single-family homes declined 5.3 percent in June, while sales of previously owned homes fell 2.3 percent.
"You're getting to a point, generally, where home-building activity is going to soften," said Raymond Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
The growing weakness in housing did, however, confirm a view that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged when its policy makers meet on Tuesday.
This view prevailed in the market even as yields rose this week following Tuesday's report on consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, higher than the two-tenths of 1 percent economists had anticipated.
"There's enough evidence to suggest weakness in the economy," said Michael Marzano, a bond futures trader for Fimat Futures USA at the Chicago Board of Trade.
When Fed policy makers meet on Tuesday, "there may be some nervousness, but nothing will happen," said Dung Vu, who oversees $7 billion of bonds at Corestates Investment Advisers in Philadelphia.
Bonds could advance again next week, "as long as we get through Tuesday unscathed," Mr. Marzano said.
The Fed last changed interest rates on Jan. 31, when it reduced overnight bank rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.
In the corporate bond market, Sterling Chemicals Holdings Inc., the Tokheim Corporation and Casino Magic of Louisiana, three companies with lower-rated debt, raised $590 million yesterday.
Investors added $232.9 million to mutual funds specializing in lower-rated bonds in the week that ended Wednesday, bringing to $1.5 billion the cash that has flowed into the funds in the last five weeks, according to AMG Data Services Inc.
Bonds are considered below investment grade, or junk, if they carry ratings below Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service and BBB- from the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Investors demand higher yields to compensate for their additional risk.
In yesterday's largest sale, Sterling Chemicals, a Houston-based maker of commodity petrochemicals, sold $275 million of 11.25 percent 10-year senior notes. It raised another $100 million by selling 12-year notes that do not pay interest for five years. These notes were priced to yield 13.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Peace, Then Justice in Cambodia

 BODY:
After blood-soaked decades of internal conflict and outside interference, Cambodia is struggling to regain political and economic equilibrium. With so many of its political leaders associated with the violence, Cambodia cannot make a completely fresh start. But as political alliances shift, the killings should not be forgotten or excused. Justice may have to wait, but its time must come.
The issue arises again because the No. 2 Khmer Rouge leader, Ieng Sary, wishes to be welcomed back into lawful Cambodian society. The regime he served, alongside his friend and brother-in-law Pol Pot, killed more than a million people, roughly one Cambodian out of seven, between 1975 and 1979. 
 Hun Sen, Cambodia's co-Prime Minister and himself a former Khmer Rouge official, offered Thursday to guarantee the life and safety of Mr. Ieng Sary, now 71 years old, if he follows through on his offer to align thousands of armed followers with Government military forces.
The offer is not easy to endorse, but seems justified as a step toward stability, provided it does not come with immunity from future prosecution if Mr. Ieng Sary is shown to have had a direct role in the mass murders of the 1970's.
The defection of Mr. Ieng Sary's estimated following of 3,000 guerrillas could drain away half the present troop strength of the Khmer Rouge, allowing the Government to re-establish control of the resource-rich northwestern border region with Thailand. That in turn would weaken the Khmer Rouge's ability to finance political destabilization activities in Phnom Penh.
A week ago Mr. Ieng Sary and several Khmer Rouge generals publicly split from the hard-line leadership of the organization, calling for reconciliation with the Government and repudiating the murderous Khmer Rouge policies of the past, for which they conveniently blamed Pol Pot. The split came two months after reports that Pol Pot had died, and it may have grown out of internal maneuvering to succeed him. Whatever the motive, Mr. Hun Sen wants to capitalize on the split.
Supporters of Cambodia's other co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranarridh, have condemned dealing with Mr. Ieng Sary. So has the chief opposition leader, Sam Rainsy. But for most of the 1980's, Prince Ranarridh and his father, King Norodom Sihanouk, were militarily allied with the Khmer Rouge in a guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-backed Government. That guerrilla alliance was also supported by China and the United States, although since the 1991 peace agreement Washington has worked hard to isolate the Khmer Rouge and supported efforts to investigate the details of its crimes.
While it might indeed be awkward for Cambodia's present Government to put Mr. Ieng Sary on trial for his actions in the 1970's, Cambodian society as a whole is owed a chance for truth and eventual justice.
If Mr. Ieng Sary, who knows well enough his own degree of complicity, does not want to face the risk of trial and punishment, he can remain in the northwestern jungles or retire to China or North Korea rather than return to Phnom Penh.

HEADLINE: Sometimes Two Wheels Are Better Than Four;
Scooter Sales Thriving From Rome to Delhi

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PISA, Italy

 BODY:
Jean-Baptiste Gaube du Gers says he's found a foolproof antidote to stress, and it is built in a factory a short drive from this central Italian city.
Mr. Gaube du Gers is the 48-year-old general manager of Odiot, a Parisian gold and silversmith, and when a transport strike shut down the French capital in 1990, he got so tied up in traffic that his doctor warned him about getting an ulcer. 
 "He was the one who told me I should switch to a two-wheel vehicle," Mr. Gaube du Gers said. Instead of 90 minutes, he now needs about half an hour to get to work on a perky little scooter built by Piaggio Veicoli Europei S.p.A., the Italian company best known for the classic Vespa.
"It's ideal," he said, still giddy after five years of scootering. "You can slip in between cars, you can even drive up and down stairs!"
Mr. Gaube du Gers's choice lifts the spirits of executives at Piaggio, based just east of here, who still recall the bitter days not too many years back when Europe's scooter manufacturers, who invented the sputtering two-wheelers after World War II, almost went out of business.
Now, sales are booming in many parts of Europe and beyond, making the scooter the unlikely subject of an upbeat case study of the push and pull of global competition.
When the market revived, in the 1980's, it was largely thanks to the Japanese, who used a combination of low-cost manufacturing skills and high-tech innovation to make the scooter once again the object of Europeans' desire.
Yet now, European companies like Piaggio, whose $1.4 billion in annual sales makes it the market leader, are faring better than ever. For once, the chastened Europeans learned their lesson, and with a flutter of sexy new scooter models wrested back control of their home turf, and are even carrying the battle back to Japan, shipping scooters to Asian markets and winning customers in Japan itself.
In India, Piaggio already turns out 250,000 scooters a year in a joint venture with local partners, nearly half the volume of its production in Europe, where it makes roughly 30 percent of the Continent's annual output of 1.6 million machines.
Last year, it began production in China, by far the biggest scooter market in the world.
The new generation of scooters, equipped with clean-burning engines and some with catalytic converters, is also on its way to the United States, where the Europeans failed to find a home once before.
In the decades after World War II, scooters such as the Vespa captured the American imagination, until the tough new emissions laws of the 1980's drove them from the roads. Though few in the industry expect scooter sales to take off in the United States in a big way, both Piaggio and Aprilia S.p.A., another Italian manufacturer, are planning to introduce models there.
While motorized two-wheeled vehicles, like motorcycles, have been around since early in this century, it was not until 1946 that the scooter was born. Engineers at Piaggio, a former manufacturer of aircraft engines, cast around for an economical means of transport for Italians just emerging from wartime destruction and came up with the Vespa, or "wasp" in Italian, because of its pinched shape.
Sales of scooters fell in the late 1950's, as cheap small cars like the Volkswagen Beetle and Fiat 500 became available. But demand revived in the 1970's, when the youth of Europe's rebellious generation of 1968 rediscovered them. By the early 1980's, that boom had fizzled, too, until the arrival in the middle of that decade of the Japanese.
Learning from European leaders like Piaggio, which by the early 1980's was shipping about 17,000 scooters a year to Japan, Japanese manufacturers such as Honda grasped the market's potential and began turning out high-tech copies. Lavishing them with new features like disk brakes, automatic transmissions and light but strong plastic bodies, the Japanese began a European offensive. To accelerate the invasion, they bought into European competitors. Thus, Honda acquired 25 percent of the scooter division of the French auto maker Peugeot, the market leader there, while Yamaha took over France's No. 2, MBK.
Pressed to the wall, the Europeans fought back. Adopting the Japanese innovations, like plastic bodies, the Europeans, particularly in Italy, flooded the market with snappy new models and competitive prices.
Aprilia, Europe's No. 2 maker, with annual sales of $372 million, is a case in point.
Aprilia's engineers develop new models with computer-aided design systems. While final assembly is done at plants north of Venice, the components are made by a network of about 350 small, independent suppliers throughout the region.
Last year Aprilia, which makes eight scooter models ranging in price from $2,000 to $3,000, increased sales of all of its two-wheeled vehicles, including motorcycles, to 170,000, from 47,200 in 1991, and much of the gain came from scooters.
Piaggio, similarly, relies on dozens of local suppliers, though it typically manufactures larger components, like motors, itself. Piaggio makes 35 models, with new ones continuously in the pipeline.
For many, the scooter's European revival recalls the golden age of the 1950's, when Gregory Peck tooled around Rome on a Vespa in the 1953 film classic "Roman Holiday" with Audrey Hepburn clutching his waist.
Indeed, some of the industry's best sellers are clearly inspired by the lines of early classics, like Aprilia's Scarabeo, which is based on a 1950's model called the Galletto.
Captivated by the new models, and faced with higher car costs and ever-more congested city streets, more and more Europeans are making the switch.
In France, scooter sales climbed to 219,000 last year, from 157,000 five years earlier, and continue to rise. In Germany, sales were 120,000, against only 52,000 in 1990. Even in rainy Britain, where sales plummeted in the early 1990's, they are catching on again. Spain, similarly, has seen recent dramatic increases after a drop in sales early in the decade.
"Everyone's riding a scooter," said Matteo Righero, Piaggio's senior vice president for Europe. "It's been a rapid, dramatic and drastic change."
Beginning in 1998, Aprilia plans a drive to increase sales of motorcycles in the United States. "When we start with motorcycles, we'll insert our scooters, too," said Ivano Beggio, Aprilia's 51-year-old owner and president.
Piaggio, for its part, is negotiating with a Chicago-based company called Scooterworks USA to promote its models, including a revival of the classic Vespa, which will be introduced in September to commemorate its 50th anniversary. The Vespa will sell in the United States for about $3,500 to $4,500.
Yet industry experts caution that the scooter will probably remain a rare bird in America -- where the faster and brawnier motorcycle remains the two-wheel vehicle of choice and where few of the pressures, like high gasoline prices, exist that drive the European market.
"They're not transport in the United States," said Philip McCaleb, the 41-year-old president of Scooterworks, who paid $100 for his first scooter -- a 1962 Vespa 150 -- while living in Athens in the 1980's. "They're very cool toys."
Scooter freaks flood the Internet with lore, and Piaggio's World Wide Web site (http://www.piaggio.com) has drawn a huge response from Americans since opening last year. Collectors plunk down as much as $5,000 for mint-condition classics, like the 1950's Vespa Grand Sport.
Still, Piaggio's disappointing history in America is fairly typical. Beginning in the 1950's, the company sold Vespas in the United States both directly and through Sears, Roebuck under the Allstate Cruisaire brand. After mixed success, Piaggio bailed out in 1982.
"America is not really a two-wheel market," said Mr. Righero of Piaggio. "Nevertheless, there's a growing attention, linked also with the Italian style of life, and we want to cultivate it."
While the Europeans are scrambling, the Japanese, of course, are far from playing dead.
Earlier this year, Honda, the No. 1 Japanese manufacturer, announced that "because of the dramatic expansion of the scooter market in Europe," it was concentrating the development, engineering and sales of scooters on the Continent for the first time in one place, at a new headquarters in Rome. (The Italian capital, with about 3 million scooter-mad inhabitants, boasts a market for 40,000 scooters a year, ranking it with some of Europe's smaller countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands.)
Honda, which manufactures scooters in Spain and Italy and will bring a new plant on line in Turkey next year, says the reason for the move is in part to catch up with the fast development times of its Italian competitors, some of which are now churning out new models every six months or so.
Because of extensive testing, Honda needs about two years to develop a new model, said Christophe Baillien, a Honda spokesman in Rome, adding, "That's far too long."
In response, the Europeans are taking the struggle to Japan's home turf, not least because many of the European companies believe that the revival in their own home markets may be about to peak. By contrast, Asian countries such as India and China, with their huge populations and low level of economic development, are embracing the scooter as a popular means of transport, just as West European countries did after World War II.
Indeed, Piaggio ads in India today recall those used in Italy in the 1950's, with mother, father and child enjoying their new scooter.
Aprilia now delivers scooters to such Asian markets as Japan, South Korea and India, and is negotiating a joint venture with the Chinese.
China is now the world's center of scooter production, according to Mr. Beggio of Aprilia, who said the Chinese make about six million two-wheel vehicles, including motorcycles, every year, more than triple Europe's output. "It's become for them the first means of transportation," he said.
The Japanese, of course, remain far stronger in Asia than the Europeans, and new competitors constantly enter the fray, further narrowing the field. Kymco, a Taiwan manufacturer that expanded in the 1980's with Japanese money and technology, now turns out about 600,000 scooters a year.
But the Europeans remain undaunted.
"Our next challenge," Mr. Righero said, "is Southeast Asia."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: A REVIEW;
As an Orator, Dole Ranged From High to Dry to Muddled

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian -- the ancient masters of oratory -- would give Bob Dole no more than a beta for his acceptance speech in San Diego on Thursday night.
While his text included some elegant tropes and high-toned rhetorical devices that would have made Aristotle and company smile approvingly, Mr. Dole swerved back and forth from lofty to folksy. Beginning with an assurance that he would be plain spoken, for instance, Mr. Dole was soon asking grandiloquently: "And who am I that stands before you?" 
 Just Plain Bob reasserted himself when he assured the nation of his tender feelings toward his mother and father, and then switched to ringing the rafters with metaphors like "Let me be the bridge," only to delve into technicalities, like stating that he would reduce taxes for a family of four making $35,000.
Among the more elegant rhetorical devices employed by Mr. Dole was an inversion of the order of words in two parallel clauses, or chiasmus, as in: "A government that seizes control of the economy for the good of the people, ends up seizing control of the people for the good of the economy."
There were several examples of the word play paronomasia like: "We cannot guarantee the outcome, but we shall guarantee the opportunity."
Also on display was anaphora, the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences ("This I owe to the men who died" and "This I owe to you.")
And antithesis, a staple of American oratory from the Gettysburg Address to John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address, was also used to good effect. ("If we are prepared to fight many wars, and greater wars, and any wars that come -- we will have to fight fewer wars, and lesser wars, and perhaps no wars at all.")
Yet, the saturnine Senator delivered one of the most humorless acceptance speechs in memory, apart from a quip about President Clinton's having appropriated so many Republican ideas that he might show up at the San Diego convention. There were rhetorical muddles, too. Mr. Dole's assertion that the Clinton Administration's ineptitude "flows down like rain" (flows like rain?) -- and then becomes a river and finally a flood -- capsized in a raging sea of metaphor.
Mr. Dole's most memorable line was calling himself "the most optimistic man in America."
It was not a bad peroration -- unless one takes it to mean he is the only person in the country who believes he can defeat Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: Requiem for a Manhattan Music Shop;
Obsolescence in the Age of Air Guitar and the Copying Machine

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
The melody that matches Ruth Binzer's mood these days is something in a minor key. That rules out two of her favorites, Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" (second file cabinet on the right) and the "Exultate" from Verdi's "Otello" (fourth file cabinet on the right). Her brother-in-law, Norbert Grunau, suggests Chopin's "Funeral March" Sonata (first file cabinet on the left). But there is a problem.
"I think that's gone," she tells him, thumbing through the bottom drawer to be sure. 
 Soon, her sheet-music store on the Upper East Side will be gone, too. After a lifetime of selling scores to instrumentalists, vocalists and a conductor or two -- from private-school band directors in her Upper East Side neighborhood to stick wavers from across town at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall -- Miss Binzer is closing the store her father bought, her mother ran and she and her sister inherited.
The narrow little shop at 218 East 81st Street, between Second and Third avenues, where the business moved 12 years ago after 30 years on East 85th Street, is where the actress Celeste Holm bought the score she needed when a last-minute call came for a White House appearance. It is where the conductor Erich Leinsdorf sometimes stopped in. It is where composers like Lukas Foss and Otto Leuning were sure to find just about everything they had ever published.
Once, it was all in those file drawers.
But a couple of months ago, Miss Binzer put up a going-out-of-business sign at the Binzer Music House, in part because she was worried about rising costs, in part because she felt that it was just time to retire. Now she has a new headache: the city's Department of Consumer Affairs has refused to extend her 90-day going-out-of-business-sale permit until the end of the month, which is when her lease expires.
"I said, 'What's another three weeks?' " Miss Binzer recalled. "This lawyer at Consumer Affairs said: 'Absolutely not. If I give it to you, I've got to give it to those schlocky guys on Fifth Avenue and 42d Street.' " Or words to that effect.
The closeout at Miss Binzer's was anything but schlocky. There was not a single gray-market camcorder or imitation designer watch in sight. And no wonder: for some years now, Miss Binzer has been a rarity in the city that was once the sheet-music capital of the world.
After all, it was New York that gave the world Broadway, Tin Pan Alley and song pluggers -- pianists hired by music publishers to help sell sheet music by playing brand-new tunes over and over. And in Miss Binzer's specialty, classical music, New York had not only Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, but also recording studios for professionals and instrumental ensembles, church choirs and glee clubs for amateur musicians.
But the demand for sheet music in New York City has dwindled for a variety of reasons. For one, a surprising number of New York-based musicians make their recordings in places like Purchase or Troy, N.Y., where costs are lower. Columbia's legendary 30th Street studio, where everyone from Glenn Gould to Rudolf Serkin to Isaac Stern made some of their best-known recordings, is long gone. And RCA's Studio A on West 44th Street was turned into office space for the Internal Revenue Service.
As for sheet-music shops, only a handful remain. The venerable G. Schirmer store has been gone for a decade. Some are near concert halls: Patelson's Music House, behind Carnegie Hall on West 56th Street, and Brown's Music Company, at 44 West 62d Street, across Columbus Avenue from Lincoln Center.
"There are so few stores like that left," said Robert Lissauer, a musicologist and the author of Lissauer's Encyclopedia of Popular Music in America, 1888 to the Present (Facts on File). "They used to have them in every neighborhood. They had the mom-and-pop music store and the mom-and-pop record store, and every home had a piano with sheet music on it, plus the Chopin etudes that the children in the house were learning."
No more. Steven Blier, the co-artistic director of the New York Festival of Song and a teacher at the Juilliard School, said that it is not in rock stars' interest to glamorize the idea of learning to play an instrument -- it cuts into record sales. And so the number of music stores continues to dwindle.
"It is very frustrating for us," said Susan Feder, a vice president at G. Schirmer, now a music-publishing unit of Music Sales Inc., "that when we issue a classical orchestral score, there are only about 10 dealers in the country who will accept it automatically. Even here in New York, you can walk into the stores that are left and they say, 'Don't have it; can't get it,' which isn't true, but because of the manpower required to get it and the cost of real estate needed to hold on to it, the economics don't work very well anymore."
As Miss Binzer has learned.
"We've always been able to pay our bills," she said. But she decided to close because her lease was expiring on Aug. 31 and she figured the rent would go up. How much? "I didn't even discuss it" with the landlord, she said. "I think he wanted $300 more a month. I'm paying $1,300 now. It's not that we have a tremendous space here, but it is the Upper East Side. The neighborhood has never been really cheap."
And if her expenses are not exactly breaking her, they are creeping up at a time when sales are not keeping pace. Her insurance premium, for example, is up to $2,700 a year, she said.
And then there is the damage done by the rise of copying machines. "Singers used to buy two copies, one for their pianist and one for themselves," said Mr. Blier of the New York Festival of Song. "Now they barely buy one copy. I try to discipline myself not to just go for Xeroxes, but it's very tempting."
Miss Binzer realized when customers were giving in to the temptation. "Sales dropped," she said, "and the publishers don't know what to do. Some guy walked in here from I.B.M. to sell me a machine. I said, 'Excuse me, it's against the law.' "
Miss Binzer tried to sell the store in the spring, before the going-out-of-business sale. She was asking $50,000 to $70,000. "Potential buyers, every one of them, I could see it, wanted a quicker return on the investment" than sheet-music sales permit, she said.
Natalie Risbeck, a pianist and teacher who lives on East End Avenue, hoped a grass-roots effort would save the store. "I thought it would be great if a whole bunch of music teachers bought it," Ms. Risbeck said, "but that didn't happen."
Now, because of the expired going-out-of-business permit, she has scheduled an auction for Wednesday at 1 P.M.
"It's terrible, but I understand why she's doing it," Ms. Risbeck said. "Every single piece of music that I use has come from her. We've been so spoiled having her here."

HEADLINE: Dole's Speech Wins Praise Of Executives

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
From Wall Street to board rooms around the country, business executives praised Bob Dole yesterday for displaying energy, decisiveness and even youthfulness in his speech accepting the Republican Presidential nomination. But many questioned whether his economic program could work.
"Given the concerns about his age, I think one of the enduring impressions will be the energy level and intensity that he brought to the speech," said Peter Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment banking firm, and a former Commerce Secretary in the Nixon Administration. "That will be very reassuring to the public." 
 The Dole tax cut proposals drew high marks from most of the executives -- just the tonic needed, they said, to bring the economy to a higher level of growth than it has been able to achieve during President Clinton's tenure. But most of the bottom-line-oriented executives saw balancing the budget as equally important and wondered whether a Dole Administration -- or any Administration -- could manage the necessary spending cuts to offset those tax reductions.
"He has captured the spirit of much of the country in saying that we have to have a less intrusive Government," said Joseph T. Gorman, chief executive of TRW Inc., a large and diverse manufacturing company based in Cleveland. But "if Dole's not going to change Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security," he added, "then it is going to be very difficult to find the spending cuts."
Mr. Dole's convention speech on Thursday in San Diego included a call for support of his economic plan, which was first announced on Aug. 5. The main proposals -- lower income and capital-gains taxes, less regulation of business and a balanced budget by 2002 -- have drawn relatively little public comment from the nation's chief executives over the last two weeks.
On Wall Street, there was concern that the tax cuts could be inflationary if they were not offset by spending reductions.
"Right now we are close to full employment in a strong economy," said Henry Kaufman, chairman of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm, "And," he added, "if you cut taxes you run the risk of overheating the economy with too much stimulus, bringing on inflation. That concerns the financial markets."
Mr. Peterson has been arguing for years that spending programs for the elderly must be restrained to avoid a ballooning of the Federal deficit to crisis levels when the baby-boom generation retires in the next century. Mr. Dole promised not to change these programs before 2002, Mr. Peterson noted, "but I hope the Republicans don't say anything that would tie their hands on entitlement reform after that date."
Others, like Sanford Robertson, president of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a San Francisco-based investment bank that is a major backer of several Silicon Valley enterprises, praised Mr. Dole for promising to lower the capital-gains tax. "I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats respond with something similar," said Mr. Robertson, a lifelong Republican who supported Mr. Clinton in 1992 and still backs the President. He complained, however, that Mr. Dole's program harked "back to the Reagan era, a little bit more of the 'trickle-down' stuff," adding, "I don't think there's any great inspiration there."
T. J. Rodgers, the outspoken chief executive of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a major chip maker in San Jose, Calif., said Mr. Dole's best move was to name Jack Kemp as his running mate. "They're going to cut taxes and give money back to the American people," he said. "Kemp is going to be the spark plug of this campaign."
Whatever their political leanings, corporate executives were encouraged that Mr. Dole had put the issue of economic growth at the top of the nation's agenda. Several business leaders have been arguing that the right policies could foster a greater output of the economy without higher inflation than the 2.5 percent growth rate now considered the upper limit by many economists.
Stanley C. Gault, the recently retired chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber, praised Mr. Dole for offering policies that Mr. Gault said would promote more growth than the Clinton Administration has considered possible. "Dole has taken a bold move, one that he and his people have been thinking about and analyzing for many months," Mr. Gault said in an interview after Mr. Dole outlined his economic program but before the speech.
And not everybody on Wall Street is spooked by faster growth.
"I fall into the growth camp," said Elizabeth R. Bramwell, president of Bramwell Capital Management Inc., a money management firm, insisting that Mr. Dole's tax cut proposals are the right avenue to lifting the economy.
For Tracy O'Rourke, chairman of Varian Associates, a health care and semiconductor equipment company, Bob Dole has upstaged Bill Clinton on the economy. "Clinton's policies have locked us into a 2 percent to 2.5 percent growth rate," said Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican. "The key thing about the Dole growth plan is that it is a balance of cutting taxes, reducing the regulatory burden and trying to balance the budget."
But many of the executives expressed concern, before and after Mr. Dole's speech Thursday night, that his proposed spending cuts were too vague, and his goal of balancing the budget might be undermined, not only by leaving Social Security and Medicare untouched, but by increasing military spending, as Mr. Dole said he would do.
"His tax cuts are viable and good," said Douglas Durst, who heads the Durst Organization, a New York real estate developer. "But I don't see any reason to increase defense spending. What enemy do we have that we need a large army to fight against?"
Social issues steer Roger McNamee, general partner of Integral Capital Partners, a venture capital firm, away from the Republican camp. "I have a really hard time reconciling Bob Dole the individual with the increasingly extreme social program of the Republican Party," Mr. McNamee, a Democrat, said. "As appealing as the words are that Bob Dole uses to describe his economic program, that meat comes in the wrong sandwich bread."
For Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminum Corporation of America, neither Democratic nor Republican economic proposals offer the central reason for selecting one candidate over the other. "Three years from now, you don't know what events will be on the table," he said. "Therefore my vote will go to the candidate I trust and that is Mr. Dole. Trust is the issue."

HEADLINE: Latest Data Hint Fed Will Hold Rates Steady

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Despite signs of a tight labor market and an uptick in consumer inflation, Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to leave short-term interest rates unchanged when they convene on Tuesday, economists said today.
A string of recent statistics has generally confirmed expectations of a slowing of activity this summer, including today's report that builders broke ground on 5.7 percent fewer single-family homes in July than in June. 
 "Most people, probably rightly, believe they won't do anything," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, putting the chances of a decision to tighten monetary policy at just 10 to 15 percent because of a lack of compelling evidence that the economy is growing too fast.
"They're probably going to stand pat," agreed Maureen F. Allyn, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. Pointing to criteria that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, cited last month before Congress -- inflation, economic activity and signs of bottlenecks -- she said the Fed could not credibly justify an increase in rates, especially since it would mean a policy reversal.
The last time the Fed policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, adjusted rates was to lower the Federal funds rate, an overnight lending rate, by a quarter of a percentage point in January. The move was regarded as an insurance policy against the possibility of recession, which disappeared quickly with the approach of spring.
But while growth in the April-June quarter came in at a very robust annual rate of 4.2 percent, most data since then have turned mixed.
Blue Chip Economic Indicators' survey of 50 economic forecasters last week came up with a consensus growth rate of 2.6 percent for the third quarter and 2.1 percent for the fourth.
Consumer prices have edged up of late but inflation at earlier stages of production has not. Factory activity has slackened and corporate purchasing managers are finding little delay getting deliveries from suppliers.
Moreover, retail sales scarcely rose last month while hourly earnings retreated from a June surge.
Today came word that the housing sector, also cited by Mr. Greenspan as something to be closely watched, was faltering.
"Evidence now is really solid that the single-family market has topped out," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders and a Fed alumnus.
"They'd really be hard pressed to rationalize it now," he said, referring to a decision to raise rates as significant economic sectors were slowing. "It would be quite a dramatic thing if they moved next week."
Although the Fed tends to assign foreign developments low priority at its policy meetings, analysts also noted that the Bundesbank was scheduled to meet on Thursday in an atmosphere of heightened speculation, fueled this week by comments of its chief economist, that it will cut short-term rates.
Analysts said the Fed would prefer not to raise rates here if the German central bank lowers them.
And the Fed, given any choice, would also rather not raise rates during a Presidential election campaign, the record showing rate changes to be only half as common during September and October of Presidential election years as in other years, Mr. Dudley said.
Many Fed watchers, in fact, think the central bank will probably sit tight into 1997. After Tuesday's session, the schedule for the Federal Open Market Committee shows meetings for the balance of this year on Sept. 24, the final one before the election, and on Nov. 13 and Dec. 17.
But since the bulk of its policy changes take effect only after a lag of many months, the Fed must to a large degree base decisions on future projections, not just on the latest figures. This is a notoriously imprecise exercise, however, further arguing against raising rates this month, Ms. Allyn said.
"You could be pre-emptive if you had accelerating growth," she said, "but I don't know anyone who thinks the economy's speeding up now."
Housing starts were down by 1.3 percent over all in July, the third consecutive monthly decline, the Government's report also showed, with July's annual pace of 1,445,000 at 4 percent below the peak in February, and June starts revised downward into negative territory.
Permits for future construction rose 2.6 percent, but those for single-family dwellings, economically more important than apartments, fell 1.4 percent, the third straight decline.
"The housing market should continue to slip during the remainder of the year," said Veronika White, an economist with First Union Bank in Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: Old Foe of Atom Arms, India Now Blocks Test Ban

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Aug. 16

 BODY:
For those who remember the days when Indian leaders led the world in condemning the moral evils of nuclear weapons, there was a special irony in the moment this week when Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda slammed the door shut on efforts to persuade the New Delhi Government to go along with a worldwide ban on nuclear testing.
For months, American diplomats have worked to head off a threatened veto by India that would torpedo negotiations in Geneva on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, considered by many to be the most important step yet toward curbing the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 On Thursday, as the oppressive heat and humidity of the Indian summer pressed in on a sea of people gathered for the anniversary of India's independence in 1947, Mr. Deve Gowda stood on the ramparts of the Red Fort and, by promising to continue opposing the global treaty, removed the last slim doubt about India's stand.
"I want to assure the people that the security needs of the country will be our top priority and the programs of the Agni and Prithvi missiles will be continued," he said, referring to two missiles developed by Indian scientists that are capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads and fired at targets as close as Pakistan, in the case of the Prithvi and as far away as the heartland of China, in the case of the Agni.
India's public explanations for rejecting the test-ban treaty, more than 40 years after Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru became the first world leader to call for a ban on nuclear blasts, have been linked to traditional Indian demands that any accord curbing nuclear arms be linked to their eventual elimination, and with it the "nuclear monopoly" held by the acknowledged nuclear-weapons states -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. With a covert nuclear research program of its own, including the explosion of a nuclear "device" in 1974, India has long been prickly about any international meddling in its plans.
But what Indian leaders have not said publicly is that they also see a newer, more pressing reason for India to retain what analysts here call its "nuclear option" -- the rising economic and military power of China, and the growing nuclear forces that go with it.
Among diplomats who have negotiated with India on the test ban, and among Indian defense analysts, there is general agreement that it is the specter of China's emergence as the most powerful nation in Asia that is driving India to be the spoiler on a test-ban accord that was, in a sense, an Indian idea in the first place.
Along with that, diplomats and analysts say, the Indian stand reflects the changing nature of India itself, from a country that was an economic backwater but, in its sense of itself, a moral superpower to a nation that is increasingly like others -- inspired by a determination to match its Asian neighbors in prosperity, and to punch its weight in economic and military power. In short, a country much like China, with which India shares a 2,400-mile border that arcs along the high ridges of the Himalayas.
"By trying to force us into accepting the test-ban treaty, Western democracies are undermining India's capability to deal with the uncertainties that flow from any future threat from China," said Jasjit Singh, a retired Indian fighter pilot who is director of the influential Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi. China, Mr. Singh said, had emerged rapidly in recent years as "a superpower of a sort," with one of the world's fastest-growing economies and nuclear forces to match, "and this has forced India to re-evaluate its strategic posture."
For Mohandas K. Gandhi and Mr. Nehru, the leaders of the independence struggle, a guiding principle was solidarity among former colonial nations, and China was seen as a natural ally. In 1962, Indian trust was shattered by a border war in the Himalayas that left Chinese troops occupying thousands of square miles of territory previously held by India.
But while Mr. Nehru died not long afterward, of what his family described as a broken heart, it is only recently that Indian policymakers have begun to focus on the long-term challenge China poses.
During the negotiations on the test-ban treaty, Indian officials have barely mentioned China. In his Red Fort speech, Mr. Deve Gowda came closer than usual, saying that India had to "keep in mind the overt and covert nuclear activity by our neighbors," but even that was interpreted by Indian newspapers as referring to Pakistan, which is said by Western intelligence officials to have its own small stockpile of nuclear weapons, or at least the ability to assemble them rapidly if the need arises.
Privately, Indian officials acknowledge that they use public expressions of concern about Pakistan as a subterfuge for what worries them far more, the growing might of China. Western intelligence estimates in recent years have put Pakistan's probable stockpile of nuclear weapons at about 20, and India's in the range of 60 to 100. Moreover, India vastly outguns Pakistan in conventional forces.
According to the most recent estimate by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, China has at least 205 warheads in its ballistic-missile force as well as a huge conventional military. India and Pakistan, in contrast, still must must rely on aircraft as nuclear delivery systems.
Analysts in New Delhi say that China has never renounced its territorial claims on vast areas along the border between India and China, including large parts of India's Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh. Also, Indian strategists have become increasingly alarmed by Chinese military activities on two islands belonging to Myanmar, the former Burma, that are across the Bay of Bengal from India's eastern coast.
For now, India and China have a slowly improving relationship, with growing ties in cross-border trade, and a new round of border talks. But outside India, defense analysts who have followed the Geneva negotiations agree that India has reasons for long-range concern about China and for a fear of, if not necessarily an outright attack, bullying by a powerful nuclear neighbor.
"The Indians have fought a war with China, albeit a small one, so this is a reality for them," said Col. Terence Taylor, assistant director of the Strategic Studies Institute in London. Colonel Taylor said that the United States and the other major nuclear powers, by pressing India on the test-ban treaty, were hardening attitudes in New Delhi. "I think it's a recipe for not getting a treaty," he said.
Although the treaty has not been officially declared dead, efforts to keep it alive in Geneva appear to be faltering. On Wednesday the Indian delegate said that India, under the conference's consensus rule, would not allow the draft treaty to be forwarded to the General Assembly of the United Nations, where the United States had hoped it could be formally adopted by mid-September. India has already made it clear it would not sign on to a test ban itself. But in the treaty draft, India objects to a provision that it fears could attract further world condemnation on the issue: a requirement that all countries with nuclear arms, suspect nuclear programs or research reactors sign on before the treaty takes effect.
Privately, Indian officials say that at this point, no concession by the nuclear powers would be likely to persuade the Deve Gowda Government to back down, because of the political furor the issue has stirred. Since India's first and only nuclear test in 1974, Indian nuclear policy has been an uneasy compromise between hawks who would like an all-out drive to turn India into a major nuclear-weapons power, and Gandhian loyalists who see a nuclear-arms program as a betrayal of India's moral legacy. The result has been what Indians call "nuclear ambiguity," meaning a weapons program that is never publicly acknowledged.
But now the balance has shifted toward the hawks in the course of the treaty debate.

Dow Gains 23.67 Points, As Bond Yields Drop
With traders heartened by economic signs that suggested the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates at next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the stock market forged ahead for the second time this week.
Financial stocks, being sensitive to interest rates, helped pace the market's advance, with PNC Bank, Comerica and Barnett Banks among the gainers. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 23.67 points, to 5,689.45, fueled by oil stocks. For the week, the Dow was up 8.14 points. But with many technology stocks off, the Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.04 points to close at 1,1133.65. [Page 36.]
 
Treasury bond prices gained for the first time in a week, as traders took the slide in housing starts as a sign of a slowing economy that should bode well for keeping interest rates down. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , to 9928/32 , as its yield fell to 6.76 percent from 6.80 percent. But the yield was up 7 basis points for the week. [39.]
 
Western Resources Claims Victory
Western Resources claimed a victory in its $1.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Kansas City Power and Light, saying Kansas City Power shareholders rejected a plan to buy out Utilicorp United. The votes have yet to be counted, however, and Kansas City Power was not conceding defeat. A triumph, it is believed. would be the first successful hostile takeover of an American electric utility, and analysts predicted it would lead to more. [37.]
 
Directors of IES Industries, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, rejected a $1.17 billion buyout offer from MidAmerican Energy and approved a sweetened offer to merge with two other utilities, WPL Holdings of Madison, Wis., and Interstate Power of Dubuque, Iowa. [35.]
 
New Rules for Commuter Planes
Commuter aircraft, under rules taking effect today, will have to fly farther behind jet airliners when approaching or leaving airports to reduce the risk of crashes. Increased delays are expected to result. [6.]
 
A Costly Case of Writer's Block
Joe McGinniss had a front-row seat at the O. J. Simpson trial and a $1 million advance to write a book about the case. But Mr. McGinniss, best-selling author of "Fatal Vision," quit the project, citing a lack of anything new to say about the case. The 53-year-old writer plans to focus on his true passion: European soccer. He thus loses a two-book deal with Crown Books, and must forfeit a total advance of $1.75 million. [36.]
 
Coke Aces Pepsi in Venezuela
Coca-Cola raided Pepsico's long-time partner in Venezuela, heating up the global cola war between the two American companies. In what analysts viewed as an embarrassment to Pepsi and a blow to the company's international expansion plans, Coca-Cola announced that it had formed a joint-venture company with the Cisneros Group, a Pepsi bottler for five decades. Pepsi, contending it had a contract with Cisneros until 2003, vowed to fight. [35.]
 
Crude Oil Price at 3-Month High
Crude oil rose to its highest price in almost three months -- $22.60 a barrel for September delivery, up 70 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- reflecting optimism that demand is robust enough and stockpiles lean enough to absorb the oil that Iraq is expected to start exporting next month. [32.]
 
Dollar Rises Against the Mark
The dollar rose to 1.4918 German marks, from 1.4854 marks on Thursday, bolstered by growing speculation that the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates when its policy council meets on Thursday. [32.]
 
Indians Raising Capital Abroad
Government institutions like the State Bank of India, under increasing pressure from India's leftist parties to halt sales of public-sector companies to foreign investors, are finding novel ways to raise capital abroad while sidestepping criticism. [34.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CANDIDATES;
G.O.P.'S NOMINEES TAKE TO THE ROAD, MESSAGES IN TOW

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: DENVER, Aug. 16

 BODY:
With one last display of fireworks and burst of confetti, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp bounded out of their nominating convention in San Diego this morning, launching a campaign to change voters' views of the Republican Party and to turn the Presidential election into a referendum on tax cuts.
"Fifteen, fifteen, fifteen percent tax cut!" Mr. Dole said at a farewell rally in San Diego before flying here this evening. "Keep that in mind." 
 "Jack and Joanne have four children and eleven grandchildren," Mr. Dole continued, gesturing to his running mate and his wife on the stage, and then explaining to a momentarily perplexed audience what had prompted that observation: "Fifteen! Fifteen! Keep that in mind."
Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp began a three-day cross-country tour this morning with a comparatively restrained and moderately attended rally, on a platform set up behind a Hyatt hotel, within sight of the San Diego waterfront. The Republican Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominees spoke for a combined 18 minutes to an audience made up mostly of convention delegates and hotel workers.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp used the rally to reprise, and sharpen, the themes they presented on Thursday night, when they accepted their party's nomination: a call for tax cuts, a depiction of their party as one that cares about all Americans and an attack on Democrats as elitist defenders of big government.
But all the oratory and ceremony of today -- as well as the opportunity to watch Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp begin the honeymoon of their political union with a trip that will take them to Buffalo, Springfield, Ill. and Pittsburgh -- was overshadowed by the drama of Mr. Dole himself. He was, from the start of the day, unrestrained in his elation, demonstrating at every opportunity his delight at having won a nomination he first sought 16 years ago.
Mr. Dole startled his aides at 9 o'clock this morning, when he emerged from his hotel suite and -- with only a turn of his thumb and an "oakie-dokie" -- announced he was heading downstairs for a speech to Republican leaders. The former Senate majority leader, who had obediently followed the script drafted by his political advisers this week, was 45 minutes ahead of schedule. He showed up before most of the reporters and before Mr. Kemp himself, who came bouncing onto the stage just as Mr. Dole was concluding his remarks.
Mr. Dole greeted the crowd, many of them old friends from conventions past, with an oblique and poignant comment on how he viewed the events in San Diego, the ninth convention he had attended since entering politics in Kansas 43 years ago.
"I've been coming here since 1964 and I never got to talk last," he said, speaking to a hotel room full of Republicans. "Last night it finally happened. I got to say the last word."
"I'm now leaving full of excitement and full of enthusiasm and full of confidence," he declared.
The nomination his, Mr. Dole went on to needle his critics, many of them in his own party, who had complained that the candidate had failed to lay out a defining theme for his campaign. Mr. Dole told Republican leaders that while delivering his 57-minute acceptance speech on Thursday evening, "I saw my optometrist right there in the front row."
"They say I don't have any vision," he continued. "There he was, right in the front row. A man of vision. Twenty-twenty."
Mr. Dole's aides said they intended to make the trip today and the rest of the weekend, including a visit to Mr. Kemp's adopted hometown of Buffalo, as an opportunity to reprise the themes of the convention and present the Republican ticket to the American people. Mr. Dole's aides hope that the nominee and his running mate will, as a ticket, prove to be as politically successful as Bill Clinton and Al Gore were in the 1992 campaign, and thus there was a great deal of focus on the what they said.
Still, today was given to celebration. And in an appropriately choreographed ending to a tightly produced convention week, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp opened their rally in San Diego by walking down a staircase from the ballroom level of the Hyatt to the sounds of "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" (the Stevie Wonder version). Mr. Dole's campaign has, with increasing frequency, turned to Motown for the musical backdrop of its events.
Among those greeting the candidates at the rally was the cheer-leading squad of the San Diego Chargers, where Mr. Kemp began his career as a quarterback in the American Football League. The scantly clad cheerleaders waved gold tassles as the candidates and their entourage made their way to the stage.
Elizabeth Dole, smiling, jerked her head back in astonishment when she caught sight of the cheerleaders. Still smiling, she turned on her heels and worked the other side of the crowd. Her husband chose to face the cheerleaders.
The primary political focus of the day, first in San Diego and then in a late afternoon rally here in Denver, was Mr. Dole's tax cut plan, which includes a 15 percent cut in income tax rates and a halving of the tax rate on capital gains. Mr. Dole, anticipating a barrage of attacks from the Democrats on his plan at their own convention in 10 days, asserted that cutting income taxes, as well as halving the capital gains tax, would not create a catastrophic reduction in government services.
"I would not propose a tax cut, and I would have not proposed the economic package, had I not been certain that we could achieve it without hurting Social Security, without hurting Medicare," he said. "But I really believe we have an obligation to families with children and taxpayers all across America to make our tax code flatter and fairer and simpler."
"We have one simple message," Mr. Dole said here. "We're going to balance the budget and we're going to cut taxes at the same time. And we're not going to apologize for putting more money in your paycheck."
Mr. Kemp made the same argument, saying: "Don't let anybody tell you this is the party of the rich. This is the party of Bob Dole, and wants everybody to reach their potential as a child of God."
The nominees sought to rebut the notion that the Republican Party was, in Mr. Dole's words, "hard-hearted, that we don't care, that we're not sensitive."
"I love the Republican Party and I love the Republican Party more and more as we reach out to more and more people all across America," Mr. Dole said.
Mr. Kemp reiterated his pledge to campaign in inner cities and states not normally considered Republican, including New York. "We're going to campaign in every city from coast to coast and make this a nationalist populist campaign," he said.
With a smile, Mr. Dole repeated the charge he made in his acceptance speech that the White House was in charge of what he called "elites." In doing this he evoked a successful line of attack that President George Bush used against Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, when he tried to to turn his Democratic opponent's Harvard education against him, with references to "Harvard Yard."
Today the target shifted to the young political aides who helped elect Mr. Clinton and followed him into the White House in 1993. "They even had some of their operatives at our convention, I understand," Mr. Dole said. "Carville, Stephanopoulos, some of the operatives. The corps, the elite corps, that I spoke about last night."
He was referring to George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser, and James Carville, who was Mr. Clinton's political strategist four years ago and has since become a pundit and an author.
Mr. Dole also returned to the theme of trust, in an effort to build on doubts about the President's credibility. "I trust the American people," Mr. Dole declared at his rally here. "President Clinton trusts the Government."
The crowd responded with the chant: "We trust you! We trust you! We trust you!"

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
One Town Left the G.O.P. Alone During the Convention Spectacle

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: The Measure of a Convention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Jean Kuhn is an early riser and hadn't stayed up to see much of the Republican convention on television this week, but Thursday night the retired Hoover Company worker sat down to watch the acceptance speeches by Jack Kemp and Bob Dole. She is a longtime Republican and voted for George Bush in 1992.
"I started watching Kemp," said Mrs. Kuhn. "But I fell asleep. He was good -- what I saw." Indeed, she will vote enthusiastically for the Dole-Kemp ticket come November. 
 Sue Shane, a housewife married to an accountant, had just returned from vacation and she, too, felt bad about missing the convention on TV. "I was doing laundry last night," she said. When asked who she would vote for in November, she wasn't sure, although Hannah, her 8-year-old, piped in, "Dad said we're probably Dole."
Democratic voters like Ron Aguado, a firefighter, and Glenn Shaffer, a retired steelworker, went out of their way not to see the Republican convention. "As soon as the news would come on showing Elizabeth Dole walking around making that speech again," Mr. Shaffer said, "I'd hit the remote and switch channels. It's a bunch of bull."
It didn't seem to matter if it was the Fishers Foods supermarket in Republican North Canton where Mrs. Kuhn was interviewed in the frozen food section. Or the Fishers market on Cherry Avenue in Democratic Canton, where Mr. Aguado spoke while shopping for produce. Or the Fishers in Perry Township, a blue-collar Reagan Democrat area (Mrs. Shane, checkout line; Mr. Shaffer, produce). The overwhelming response from shoppers when asked what they thought of the Republican convention this week was, "I didn't watch it."
And that is not a reflection of how the Republicans did in San Diego or the popularity of the Dole-Kemp ticket. Most Republicans and independents interviewed who saw it gave Mr. Dole high marks. Sitting in the family room of his North Canton home, John G. Evans, a retired Goodyear executive was so moved and excited as he watched Mr. Dole's speech that he applauded at the finish, and his wife, Sally, said aloud, "I think it's going to be O.K.," meaning that for the first time she could envision a Dole victory.
Nor does public indifference necessarily portend better things for Democrats. Robert Caughey (deli section, North Canton Fishers) is a union man who expects to vote for President Clinton but won't watch the Democrats' show from Chicago. "I shouldn't say this," he said, "but I don't get much out of conventions."
Nationally the viewership of the Republican convention this year is down about 25 percent from 1992. Local television stations that did not air it actually have received a ratings boost in some cases. In Canton, people watch Cleveland television. Channel 8, the Fox station there, reports a jump in ratings for its 10 P.M. news this week, with viewers tuning in as the other networks' convention coverage began.
This is a place that every four years usually votes as America does for President, and there is no institution more at its heart than Fishers, a grocery chain of six stores that was founded in 1934 by Joseph Fisher and is now run by his grandson Jeffrey.
So it says something that only seven of the four dozen Fishers shoppers interviewed today in three very different sections of the county said they watched the convention.
Yet at the same time, they do seem to be picking up the new ideas that are important to them, and more than anything else, that seems to mean economic issues. Mr. Dole's proposal to cut the income tax rate 15 percent is widely known at all these Fishers stores, and a surprising number of people already have a strong opinion about its feasibility.
While several Republicans interviewed, like Tom Violand, a physician, and his wife, Nancy, a nurse,were delighted, it was plain that Mr. Dole still had a lot of selling to do, even among his fellow Republicans.
One Democrat, Dolly Potter, a housewife married to Tom, a truck driver (frozen foods, Fishers North Canton), asked where the cuts are going to come from if the budget is still to be balanced. "Medicaid, Social Security things that are important to people like me?" she said.
And Virgil Hiltner, a retired Superior Dairy vice president, who will vote for Mr. Dole, doubted whether Congress would ever have the backbone to stand up to lobbyists and make the cuts that would be necessary to keep the debt from soaring. Bill Sterling, a retired insurance agent, who also expects to vote for Mr. Dole, said his support for such a tax cut would depend on whether it benefited people of incomes of less than $50,000 a year.
Shoppers like Raymond Vance, a factory worker for Rubbermaid who votes Democrat, and Terry Capper, a Canton firefighter who votes Republican, say they are better off than they were four years ago at the start of the Clinton Administration. The unemployment rate in Stark for July, which came out today, is 5 percent, compared with 8 percent in 1992. In a poll of the county by The New York Times in May, 82 percent said they were better off or about the same as four years ago; 18 percent said they were worse off.
"I do fire inspections, and I always ask how business is doing," Mr. Capper (cereals, Fishers Canton) said. "For two years now, people have been saying 'better.' "
Major corporations here like The Timken Company and Diebold have been posting record profits the last few years.
At the same time, the weakness that exists in the economy -- downsizing and stagnant wages for the average worker -- seems to work to the political advantage of the Democrats. Asked whom they blame for these economic trends, 52 percent of the people polled here blame corporations a lot, while 19 percent blame unions a lot.
But Mr. Clinton is vulnerable here, as elsewhere, on character issues; 34 percent polled in May felt he had more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, while 53 percent said he did not.
By emphasizing Mr. Dole's war record, his recovery from his wounds and his humble background, the Republican convention this week indirectly hit hard at Mr. Clinton's vulnerability.
Dr. Violand and his wife were particularly taken by Senator John McCain's speech on Mr. Dole's heroism, Elizabeth' Dole's testimony to her husband's goodness and Mr. Dole's description of his father, a poor man, standing up all the way on the train on the trip to see his injured son.
"He's a very humble man," said Mrs. Violand, "He talked about growing up on the plains, and how it makes you feel insignificant, he talked about God and honesty."
The Violands watched practically all of the Republican convention but have not made similar plans for the Democrat gathering. Asked why, Dr. Violand said, "Oh, I don't know."
"They'll just tell lies," said Mrs. Violand.

HEADLINE: U.N. Plans to Hold Spending And Cut Staff by 30 Percent

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Under pressure from Washington to cut costs and streamline itself, the United Nations today released the outline of its 1998-1999 budget that projects no overall growth in expenditures for the rest of the century while staff reductions continue.
By 2000, the United Nations will have reduced the size of its permanent secretariat staff by 30 percent since 1985, and half of those cuts will have taken place since the beginning of this year, said Joseph E. Connor, Under Secretary General for Administration and Management. About 1,500 jobs will be lost from January 1996 until the end of 1999. 
 Mr. Connor, a former chief operating officer of Price Waterhouse who was nominated for his United Nations job by the Clinton Administration, said that efficiency savings and better accounting might actually produce a small amount, about $6 million, to reopen a contingency fund for unexpected needs.
Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative, welcomed the Secretary General's budget announcement as "an important and responsive step toward fiscal reform." She added: "Now we have to turn the momentum for reform and sound budgeting into a permanent part of the way the U.N. does business."
The United Nations, which works on a two-year budget cycle, is budgeted for $2.608 billion in appropriations for 1996-1997. Accounting for inflation but not currency fluctuations, the 1998-1999 expenditures are budgeted at $2.559 billion. This covers the staffing and operations of the New York headquarters and offices in Geneva and Vienna. It does not include separate agencies like Unicef or the World Health Organization, which have their own budgets.
But agencies are now being integrated in a new computerized management system for the collection and sharing of data bases, which is expected to lead to broader reductions and more efficient coordination, Mr. Connor said in an interview today.
While the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership have been criticizing the United Nations for what politicians continue to call its profligate ways, Mr. Connor has become one of the strongest defenders of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's management and fiscal reform programs.
He said today that the "constant lambasting" of the organization in the United States has taken its toll on a generally skilled staff. "People are hurt," he said.
The United Nations is still in financial crisis because it is owed $3 billion in members' unpaid dues, including $1.7 billion from the United States. The Clinton Administration, now under Congressional orders to certify that the United Nations is not exceeding its budget before any money is released, paid the organization a $47 million installment this week and promises another $40 million in September. It is the only permanent member of the Security Council to be in default.
Mr. Connor said today that the largest cuts in the coming budget will be in administration and building management. The cost of publishing documents will be reduced by 27 percent and travel will take a 26 percent reduction, he said.

Passing the Torch

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach 

 BODY:
Cities rise and fall, and the fashion pack picks up and relocates accordingly. The spontaneous combustion that occurs when creative people converge on one place dies out after a time, and then reignites somewhere else. If there is a single word that nearly all the photographers, agents, makeup artists and models use to sum up what they're looking for, it's "energy." In the 80's, they found it in Paris; now they find it here in New York.
Philippe Bialobos, a photographer who was based in Paris for 10 years, came to New York a few years ago, when he was 27, because he wanted "a change of energy." There are more opportunities here, he says. A photographer can be more "versatile" -- Bialobos is hired these days not only for fashion shoots but for portraits and for videos as well. In Paris, he adds, people are more blase, afraid to take the risks that doing something new entails. It's an attitude that is ultimately stifling, and Bialobos attributes it to France's current economic crisis. 
 Yannick Morisot, for her part, agrees that Paris has lost much of what made it fashion's creative capital, but she blames a number of factors for the change -- among them, the culture and a climate of racism, which limits the talent pool. An agent who represents nine photographers, including Jean-Baptiste Mondino and Pierre et Gilles, Morisot established an office in New York at the end of last year to promote their interests. "Everything is happening here at the moment," she says, "and that makes it easier for everyone." The photographer who wants to book time with the top models stands a better chance of getting it here, now that most of them have made New York their home.
Michele Filomeno, whose agency handles photographers, art directors, stylists and illustrators, is opening a branch in New York next month. "It's something that I had to do if I wanted to make my clients known and develop their careers internationally," he contends. In the early 80's, he was living in Milan and managing the people who shaped the image of Italian fashion at the time; eventually, it became clear to him that the only way to propel their careers to the next level was to move to Paris. And now, that next level is in New York, where fashion's movable feast has temporarily reassembled.

Birding For a Song In Maine

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
THERE are 4,500 islets in the Gulf of Maine, caught in the arms of Cape Cod and Cape Sable, Nova Scotia. In mid-July I chose to visit just one -- 333-acre Hog Island near the neck of Muscongus Bay, about 60 miles northeast of Portland. My selection process was far less sophisticated than that of the tern, a seabird that often nests on rocky outcrops off the Atlantic coast, and then migrates to Africa, Antarctica and South America, before coming home to the precise island of its birth. I migrated to Hog Island because I was looking for an economical Down East vacation, and found it in an Audubon Society Ecology Workshop in Maine, lasting six nights and five days, with 35 hours of field trips and classes on the area's physical and biological environment, evening programs devoted to conservation themes, rustic accommodations and meals included, for $700.
Ecology and ornithology have never been my chief interests; rather, I was drawn to the Hog Island Audubon Camp by its beautiful setting and recreational possibilities like swimming, boating and hiking. So, upon embarking by bus from New York to the town of Damariscotta, Me. (for $52, one way), I felt a little like the predatory cowbird, which drops its eggs in other avian species' nests. Further, I'm hardly a social creature, leading me to wonder how happy I'd be in close and constant proximity to 50 other campers, most of whom were science teachers on Audubon Society scholarships; some had been to the camp before, or attended similar Audubon Ecology Workshops in Greenwich, Conn., and the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming. 
 However, I had no doubt that the place would suit me. The whole of Hog Island, with a 30-acre peninsula on its northeast side connected to the rest of the islet by a narrow isthmus from which you can see both the granite ledges on the eastern shore and swaying spartina grass of Long Cove, is a wildlife sanctuary. It was saved from lumberers around the turn of the century by David Todd, an Amherst College astronomy professor, and his wife, Mabel Loomis Todd, who edited Emily Dickinson's letters. In 1936 the National Audubon Society took over, refurbishing the few 19th-century structures on the peninsula for campers and turning the island into a natural laboratory for teachers, who would then go on to tell their students about "the acute need for conserving our natural resources before it is too late," as the Todds' daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, put it in the May 1937 issue of Natural History.
When the bus dropped me off in front of Waltz Rexall in Damariscotta at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon, a Workshop van was waiting to take me to the Audubon pier on the mainland near the hamlet of Medomak, and staff members handled my luggage. Given the rather warning tone of the Workshop's literature about the very basic nature of the accommodations and facilities, these services impressed me -- as did the quick trip to the island aboard the Puffin III, one of the camp's two launches, with room for about 25 people. You could easily row across the Narrows to Hog Island if you had a dinghy, or swim if your heart didn't stop when you plunged into the 60-degree water.
Actually, if you stood on the mainland and yelled, I bet you could hear it from my window in Room 3 of the Queen Mary, a weathered gray clapboard building half-cantilevered over Muscongus Sound, with a laboratory on the lower level, where an eel slithered in a tank and I later took an algae pressing class. The second floor had a deck, an airy lounge, six wooden sleeping cubicles fronted by curtains instead of doors (occupied exclusively by women), and two toilets -- with two showers up another flight of steps, on the top floor.
My cubicle had little more than two hard, slim single beds made up with old sheets and army blankets, cubbyholes for clothes, a place to hang a few things, two lamps and a bedside table. Sound carried so easily that a flushing toilet sounded like a tsunami -- which is why nobody got much rest on the first night (though after that I took to wearing earplugs, and slept just fine). And, of course, there was no maid service, motivating me to take a broom to the bathrooms about halfway through the week. Despite all this, I still loved the place, mostly because of the water view right outside my window, and my roommate -- a merry woman named Karen from Brunswick, Me., who worked in a toy store and had an infectious laugh. It didn't take long for us to start whispering in the dark about the guys at the Workshop, and No. 3 became known as the gigglers' room -- though, Lord knows, I don't think I've giggled since high school.
The camp has space for 55 participants, lodged in the Queen Mary, the forest-buffered Port Hole (mostly for couples) and the Crow's Nest dormitory, which was empty during my stay, since the session had only 43 campers.
About 20 of us met at the 5 o'clock weather class on the first day, taught by an astonishingly energetic instructor named Rick Ylagan. During the half-hour session, I learned that rainfall is naturally acidic and how to identify sun-blocking alto-stratus clouds. At 6 the dinner bell rang, and we filed into a white frame building called the Bridge for a swordfish dinner served family-style, followed by homemade cheesecake. Entrees on other nights included minute steak, shrimp and vegetable stir fry, Mexican bean casserole, and chicken filets -- almost always accompanied by freshly baked bread. Homemade soups, salads and sandwiches were featured at lunchtime, and in the mornings we were treated to one hearty breakfast standard or another, like blueberry pancakes or scrambled eggs with bacon. All of this was so good that whenever the cook passed a group of campers, he got a round of applause.
BETWEEN-meal snacks were laid out on a table outside the dining hall -- lemonade, deep bowls of fruit and granola bars and leftover desserts. Alcoholic beverages were not supplied, though by the second night a few thoughtful packers produced bottles of wine and flasks of Scotch from their bags -- making them easily the most popular people in the Queen Mary.
After dinner on that first night, there was an introductory birdwatching session led by a teacher named Chuck Peterson who showed my novice group how to focus their "binos," hung like necklaces on the chests of most campers for the duration of the workshop. I didn't have a pair, which put me at a distinct disadvantage. Still, I learned to identify the black-throated green warbler, which sings a song from the top of the island's tall spruces that sounds like "trees, trees, murmuring trees." And after that, everyone gathered for orientation in the Fish House, decorated outside with lobster buoys, inside with a wide stone fireplace and the camp's library. There we were admonished not to take so much as a sea slug away from Hog Island, and were told that it was O.K. to cut class once in a while.
These were the words I wanted to hear. In retrospect, that only shows how foolish I was, because I never missed a class. They made science fun. We mucked around for clams in Long Cove; walked through the island's rare, mature spruce woods, which shaded a whole produce department full of mushrooms in shockingly bright colors, and caught butterflies -- very carefully, with a goblinlike net, a pair of stamp tongs and a fond goodbye when we let them escape back in the blooming milkweed.
Every morning and afternoon there were two or three programs to choose from. I gravitated to those that required physical rather than mental exertion, like canoeing among endless lily pads on the Pemaquid River ($10 a person); taking a cruise around Eastern Egg Rock, where the Audubon Society recently re-established a colony of Atlantic Puffins; studying geology at Pemaquid Point (admission $1), a town park on the mainland (about 20 miles south of camp) with a much-photographed 19th-century lighthouse standing above a sweeping wave of rock, or gazing at snails, barnacles and edible sea lettuce in tidepools on Hog Island, followed by the showing of a video called "Barnacles Tell No Lies."
Between these activities and evening slide shows on subjects like the Puffin Project and the instructor Bonnie Bochan's study of migratory songbirds in the Amazonian jungles of Ecuador, I had little time for more aimless sorts of recreation. We got Wednesday afternoon off, so I hiked around Hog Island, which took about three hours; and I made a habit of rising at 5:30 A.M., so I could sit with a mug of coffee on the rocky point just beyond the Queen Mary, watching spectral islets crowned with pine trees emerge from the fog.
But, for all the natural beauty, it is the people at the camp and their personalities I will remember most -- from the quiet poise of the botany instructor, Margaret Mayer, to the polished social graces of a couple from South Carolina, to the stalwart good humor of Rick Ylagan -- who never cracked under persistent ribbing about his failure to catch a fish.
A WOMAN from Louisville confessed to me that her real name was Carol, even though she always called herself Sally when she was away from home; a young woman beckoned me into her cubicle one evening to discuss her troubled marriage; and on the last day a teacher from Long Island treated us all to an impromptu demonstration she called "Twenty Ways to Tie a Sarong."
By the time the Friday night lobster boil rolled around, I felt I knew and liked a good many of these people. Of course, I also liked the huge lobster the cook plopped on my plate (purchased at the lobster pound right across the Narrows), and the beer we'd taken up a collection to buy. A graduation ceremony followed the feast, with the instructors wearing ridiculous mock mortarboards, covered by seaweed, shells, pine cones and other bits of organic flotsam and jetsam. When they called my name, I rose to receive my diploma -- without doubt, the easiest and cheapest I ever earned.
 
The bottom line
 
 For information on Audubon Ecology Camps and Workshops, contact the National Audubon Society, 613 Riversville Road, Greenwich, Conn. 06831; (203) 869-2017, fax (203) 869-4437.
This summer four six-night ecology sessions were offered on Hog Island during the month of July, for $700, including pickup and dropoff in Damariscotta, lodging, meals, classes and most activities; as well, there were two six-night ornithology workshops in June, for $800, and two 10-night youth camps in August, for $750.
The Audubon Society also has ecology camps in Greenwich, Conn., and the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming.
Accommodations on Hog Island are rustic -- in the Queen Mary, the Crow's Nest dormitory (with toilets and showers inside), and the 16-room Port Hole (which has the only single in the camp, three toilets and a shared bathhouse about 20 steps away). There are no private baths or locks (although rooms in the Port Hole have doors). If you come to the camp with a friend, you can request to be put in the same room or cubicle.
The Workshop sends participants a very comprehensive preparatory packet, which includes driving directions to the camp, details on bus and air travel to Damariscotta, information on how to get graduate credits for attending the workshop, and a packing list. Don't forget binoculars and mosquito repellent.
To reach Damariscotta, I took a Peter Pan Trailways Bus, (800) 343-9999, from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York to Boston for $30; in the Boston bus station I caught a Concord Trailways bus, (800) 639-3317, to Damariscotta for $22. The whole trip took nine and a half hours. Fortunately, a fellow camper from New Jersey gave me a lift to Tarrytown on the way home, where I got a Metro-North train into New York for $5.50.
Alternately, you could take an Amtrak train to Boston, and then get the bus -- but I found train-bus connections to be inconveniently scheduled.
Or you could fly to Portland, Me., and take a Mid-Coast Limousine, (800) 937-2424, to Damariscotta, for $35 one way or $60 round trip.
For information on attractions and accommodations in the Damariscotta area, contact the Damariscotta-Newcastle Regional Information Bureau, Post Office Box 217, Damariscotta, Me., 04543, (207) 563-3176.

His Lessons In Living Will Endure

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
Virgil Thomson is never far from our minds, he perhaps more than his music. Never has anyone written and composed so much and said so little about himself, and still it is the man that we most remember: the charm, wit and sly iconoclasm. We love that reflective shield of his, shining on the world around him but never on himself. The Thomson public persona was an artwork, art by deflection.
So naturally, he became a music critic, words replacing what had been notes. Thomson, that is to say, composed music criticism as well as writing it. His music concerns other styles and other attitudes: "Lord Byron," for example, an opera that explains close to nothing about Lord Byron or how Thomson felt about him. Its hoedown folksiness is an arching of the eyebrows at Romantic pretensions, a little pin stuck in the side of melodrama. It is a review in the form of an opera. 
 When we hear Mahler and Schubert, there are residues of the confessional: music as the opening of a private door. Thomson kept his door closed, standing in front of it with a mirror and adding a wry little smile. This is why we have such a hard time hoisting Virgil Thomson the composer out of the past. But we try.
Thank the Houston Grand Opera and the Lincoln Center Festival '96 for a luscious production by Robert Wilson of "Four Saints in Three Acts," from 1934; it was an endearing, almost cuddly presentation. "Four Saints," with its texts by Gertrude Stein, exalts the non sequitur. Born at a time when psychiatrists, scientists and politicians labored mightily to make sense of their increasingly confused surroundings, it jeers cheerfully at coherent explanation and logical progression. Today that would be like news reporting.
We learn nothing about the four saints themselves, who are surrounded by Thomson's turn-of-the-century American vernacular style. The composer said he had chosen black singers for the original production because he liked the way they sang, but I don't believe for a moment that the relative absence of black singers in opera generally wasn't decisive in his thinking.
That shock, of course, has worn off. Black principals are a major force at opera houses everywhere; "Porgy and Bess," as mandated by the Gershwin estate, uses all-black casts in English-speaking countries. Time has turned "Four Saints" into a provocateur with little to provoke. It, too, is an elaborate piece of music criticism: written in images, tones and rhythms about a cultural and intellectual world that no longer exists.
Virgil Thomson died seven years ago. He was raised in Missouri and lived in Paris and New York. He did not become a practicing music critic until he was 44, but the job defined him. He did it at The New York Herald Tribune for 14 years.
Music reviews have, by nature, a brief shelf life. Posterity has only curatorial interest in them. They are period pieces, which in this case bounced themselves against events that flickered for a single evening at Carnegie Hall or the old Metropolitan Opera House. We read a Thomson review today with little hope of reliving the event and not for his judgments or any prescience; it is a joy in the delivery. Like George Bernard Shaw, Thomson was often wrong. In both cases, it doesn't matter.
Thomson's music is well organized and predicated on surprise. It sought, as he wrote, "novel uses of familiar formulae." As a critic, he understood and promoted music miles from his own: "Wozzeck," for example. Berg, on the other hand, had spoken from his troubled heart; Thomson spoke from Kansas City bandstands and Baptist choir stalls. Deadpan delivery replaced self-revelation.
Thomson also championed music that has worn less well, but his job was to keep composers alive and busy in the then and there. "Writing music is like giving parties," he once said. "You make it as good as you can at the time you are doing it. Making it memorable is not the main objective."
He had the right idea about performers, calmly acknowledging the good and bad in a Toscanini or a Horowitz and happily kicking in the pants those who would go blindly on their knees before them. I never heard Marian Anderson in her prime, but Thomson did not much like her voice and had the courage to say so, this despite Anderson's iconic political stature for upwardly mobile black citizens. Critics accused of antifeminism or gay-bashing as a result of a negative review should take heart.
And this is why Virgil Thomson will survive, not for his operas or his critical pronouncements but for certain lessons in living. Current critics reflexively measure their bon mots against those dry, economical and always gentlemanly put-downs of his. (To chastisement that he ignored church performances, Thomson answered that "such music is presumed to be presented in praise of God rather than in quest of public favor.") When we try to analyze Virgil Thomson, we feel him analyzing us instead: as an enduring presence on the aisle, passing genteel yet acid judgment on our foibles between light naps.
"Lord Byron" is more or less dead. "Four Saints" will never relive its essential self. Virgil Thomson the artwork goes on. In February, Norton will publish "Virgil Thomson: Composer on the Aisle," a 10-year effort by my colleague Anthony Tommasini. What it will say about the "real" Virgil Thomson I cannot guess. I do know it will tell us something about ourselves.

HEADLINE: Miami, the Hollywood of Latin America

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
EVERY WEEKNIGHT AT 10 O'CLOCK sharp, a boyishly handsome young Peruvian named Jaime Bayly enters a darkened television studio in Miami Beach and sits at a desk that is bare except for two glasses of water. Thousands of miles away, in Caracas and Buenos Aires and Mexico City and Santiago, viewers are tuning in, waiting for the affable talk-show host to begin another of his deft interviews with one of the actors, singers, athletes, models, writers and other celebrities who make up the world of Latin American show biz -- known in Spanish as la farandula.
Mr. Bayly has been doing his hourlong interview show in one form or another for nearly a decade, and until February 1995, "El Show de Jaime Bayly" was broadcast from his hometown, Lima, Peru. But when he and the cable channel Sur decided they wanted to expand his horizons with "a talk show for all of Latin America," Mr. Bayly said, they knew there was only one place he could go and be assured of elevating both his ratings and the quality of his guest list. 
 "If I want to do a truly Latin American program and reach an international audience, I have to be where the celebrities are, and that means Miami," Mr. Bayly explained recently. "A good number of them live here, and even those who don't are always coming to work or to visit. So if there is any one place that can claim to be the entertainment capital of Latin America, I would say it is here."
Julio Iglesias, the Spanish crooner who is one of the few figures from la farandula known in the English-speaking world, and Jose Luis Rodriguez, the dashing Venezuelan soap opera and recording star known to his female fans as El Puma, would undoubtedly agree. Both have left their native lands and settled in the Miami area, joining home-grown talent like Gloria and Emilio Estefan and their Cuban exile protege, the singer Albita. So too have such fixtures of the Latin American firmament as the Mexican actress and singer Lucia Mendez, the Nicaraguan salsa star Luis Enrique, the Dominican comedian Charytin and the Spanish singer Raphael, the Monster of Song, who has long occupied the Key Biscayne mansion that was once Richard Nixon's favorite retreat here.
But Miami is much more than just a tropical refuge where the richest and most famous names of Latin American show business can relax, enjoy the fruits of their success and socialize with one another at restaurants and nightclubs eager to treat them like stars. It is also the place where, increasingly, they must come to film television shows, make records, shoot videos, submit to the attentions of swarms of paparazzi and huddle with the executives who control their careers. In short, Miami has become the very heart of la farandula, a Hispanic Hollywood where entertainers from Tijuana to Tierra del Fuego aspire to make their mark.
Both Univision and Telemundo, the two main Spanish-language networks in the United States, have their corporate headquarters in Miami, as do popular cable channels that are beamed all over the hemisphere, like MTV Latino and Gems. Latin America's top-rated television variety show, "Sabado Gigante," is shot in a studio just west of Miami International Airport, not far from the set of the daily talk show of Cristina Saralegui, known as the Hispanic Oprah. And the makers of Mexican, Brazilian and Venezuelan telenovelas, or soap operas, have discovered that their ratings automatically soar whenever they include episodes set here.
In addition, both Sony Discos and WEA Latina, the Latin music divisions of the two largest record companies in the world, are based in Miami, along with most of their competitors and the songwriters, studio musicians and producers on which the industry depends. An affluent Hispanic population and a steady stream of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking tourists eager to spend money mean that Miami also offers Latin America's biggest singers and musicians a ready-made audience that can fill the house at two of its most prestigious concert halls, the James L. Knight Center and the Jackie Gleason Theater.
More than half of the two million people living in the Miami metropolitan area are of Hispanic descent. Cubans, who accounted for 90 percent of the area's Hispanic population 25 years ago, now constitute barely half of a much larger Hispanic population, and there are rapidly growing Columbian, Brazilian, Venezuelan, Central American and Peruvian colonies.
"We moved to Miami first and foremost because of location, location, location, as the real estate people always say," said Sergio Rozenblat, the Argentine-born managing director of WEA Latina, which relocated here from Los Angeles in 1994. For Latin Americans, "Miami is what Rio de Janeiro is to non-Latins, a city that has a magical name, an aura," Mr. Rozenblat added. "Whatever works in Miami is going to influence what goes on in Latin America."
Though the MIAMI Film Festival introduced the actor Antonio Banderas and the director Pedro Almodovar to American audiences and continues to promote Latin American cinema, movies are not really at the core of la farandula, unlike its much more prosperous and better-known English-language equivalent. No studio or producer in Spain or Latin America has the means to compete with Hollywood, where it costs an average of $30 million to make a movie these days.
Of course, Hollywood itself has taken a greater interest in Miami recently, as demonstrated by studio productions like "Miami Rhapsody" and "The Birdcage." Some after-hours socializing between Hollywood luminaries and their counterparts from la farandula also goes on. But in the professional realm, the two are separate universes, and even English-speaking residents of Miami, white and black, are largely oblivious to the entertainment capital springing up around them.
Instead, the real focal points of la farandula are television, both network and cable, and music. "Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall may be more important to you Americans, but the big dreams of Latin artists are here, because whatever they do in Miami has impact in their homelands," said Mario Kreutzberger, the Chilean who, under the stage name Don Francisco, has been host of "Sabado Gigante" for 34 years, the last 10 of them in Miami. "When they go back home, people say to them, 'Oh, you were on "Sabado Gigante" and Cristina and you sang at the Knight Center and the Tropigala nightclub, so you must really be doing well.' "
If the booming Miami scene has a power corridor, it is probably Lincoln Road in Miami Beach. At one end is MTV Latino's corporate headquarters, from whose windows the offices of Sony Discos are visible just down the street. At the other end, just across the street from Yuca, an upscale nouvelle Cuban restaurant and club that has become a favorite spot for show biz types, is the former bank building that now houses the studios where both Mr. Bayly and MTV Latino tape their shows.
Ten years ago, of course, there was very little to point to here. But once Univision and Telemundo decided that Miami's proximity to Latin America and its well-educated, bilingual work force made it the logical center of their operations, the rest of the business was not long in following.
"The fact that both TV networks are here is an amazing advantage," said Mr. Rozenblat. "You can have daily contacts and establish relationships because they are basically just down the block, and that's very important," especially since television soap operas dominate prime-time programming throughout Latin America and getting one of your songs or artists featured in one is the surest road to success.
In addition, with more than 20 countries in Latin America, divided by a host of traditional jealousies and rivalries, Miami is regarded by all as neutral ground, "an entertainment Switzerland," in the words of Richard Arroyo, the first managing director of MTV Latino. "By being here, you avoid a lot of political baggage," Mr. Arroyo's successor, Tom Hunter, explained during a recent interview at the channel's gaudily decorated headquarters. "If you're based in Argentina, the Mexicans are going to think you're an Argentine operation, and vice versa."
JUST AS IMPORTANT, AS Latin American stars and their managers have discovered, are the business advantages of being based here. In Miami, "you don't have the political and economic uncertainties" that have long been a part of life in Latin America," said Frank Welzer, president of Sony Discos. "You don't have to worry you're going to wake up some morning to find that the banks want to seize your accounts or that the currency has been devalued." Nor, several celebrities hastened to add, need you fear that guerrillas are going to kidnap your child.
Whatever the reasons, the increasing Latin American presence has transformed and revitalized the entertainment business here. Criteria Recording Studios, for instance, is famous among American musicians as the place where James Brown recorded "I Got You (I Feel Good)," Eric Clapton turned a case of unrequited love into "Layla" and the Bee Gees hit the jackpot with "Saturday Night Fever." Indeed, the aura of success permeating the nondescript two-story building in a rundown neighborhood of North Miami, attested to by the dozens of gold records displayed on the walls, is one of the reasons many of today's most popular rock groups, like Aerosmith and R.E.M, continue to record there.
But the backbone of Criteria's business these days is represented by Latin pop singers like Julio Iglesias, Roberto Carlos, Ana Gabriel, Rocio Jurado, Luis Enrique and Paloma San Basilio or up-and-coming Latin American rock-and-roll bands like Soda Stereo and Los Tres. At other facilities around town, like Emilio Estefan's Crescent Moon Studios and South Beach Studios, where recent clients include Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Chayanne and Charley Garcia, the situation is much the same.
AT LEAST 50 PERCENT of what we do, if not more, is Latin music," said Trevor Fletcher, the studio manager at Criteria. "Miami does tend to be the crossroads of the Americas, so you've got a lot of bilingual support services here, which is important for someone whose English may be limited. Plus there are a lot of Latin musicians and world-class producers in town, so if you want someone to play flamenco guitar or need four different percussionists to bang a stuffed gourd, that's available."
With the principal record companies and a large number of their top-selling artists now based in the Miami area, more and more record producers, arrangers, studio musicians, songwriters, engineers and music publishers are deciding it is wise to follow suit. Among them is the veteran Argentine producer, arranger and composer Bebu Silvetti, who has worked in one capacity or another with most of the top performers in mainstream Latin pop music, ranging from Luis Miguel and Raul di Blasio to Selena and Daniela Romo.
"The future is here," Mr. Silvetti said during an interview at his home in the exclusive Cocoplum section of Coral Gables. "Yes, for the moment Los Angeles still has many more studios and better engineers and musicians. But I think California is in decline now for Latin music and Florida is ascendant. The big names are not all here yet, but they are coming."
Before moving here last summer with his Spanish-born wife and four of his children, Mr. Silvetti had lived and worked in Los Angeles for a decade. Since his arrival, he has produced an album for Placido Domingo, begun projects with the Brazilian singers Roberto Carlos and Simone, auditioned numerous Latin American bands for the new record label he is creating and come to the conclusion that it is simply easier to work in Miami than anywhere else.
"For me, it was difficult to speak English all day," he said of his years in Los Angeles. "That is definitely not a problem here. Someone like me can live anywhere he wants -- New York, Los Angeles, even Cincinnati. But it is better to live in a place where you feel the most comfortable, and for me, that is Miami."
Indeed, Miami is full of Latin American actors and singers who came here intending to do a single project but have ended up settling down because they find the bicultural atmosphere so congenial. The Mexican star Lucia Mendez, for example, came here four years ago to shoot a soap opera called "Maria Elena." She quickly discovered, she said, that Miami is "a Caribbean paradise full of talented Latin Americans" who have "a vision of the world with more reach" than those who have chosen to remain in their homelands.
"Mexico is always in my heart, but Miami has a very special magic," Ms. Mendez said in an interview at her comfortable Key Biscayne home, as her 8-year-old son, Pedro Antonio, roller-skated out front. "It has all the human warmth of Latin America and the efficiency and professionalism of the United States. If you want to project yourself to the world, Miami is strategic."
Miami is also one of the few places in the United States where a celebrity from Latin America is likely to be recognized and treated as a celebrity and not have to labor under the assumption that as Mr. Kreutzberger put it, "we all still dress in caveman costumes down there." To many here, in fact, Latin stars shine just as brightly as Sylvester Stallone or Madonna, both of whom have bought homes in the area and are seen at many of the same nightclubs and parties as their Latin American counterparts.
"Miami feeds their ego," Robert Behar, a former Telemundo executive who is now president of Hero Productions, whose studios and transmission facilities here beam programming to more than 20 countries around the hemisphere, said of the Latin American stars. "They go to South Beach or Bayside, or they arrive at a hotel or a restaurant, and they get recognized."
Of course, where the stars congregate, the paparazzi will soon follow. So it is hardly by accident the many gossip magazines and numerous "Entertainment Tonight" clones of the Spanish-speaking world now have established a presence in Miami to track the comings and goings, the pairings and unpairings, of actors, singers and television personalities unknown to most Americans but whose names resonate throughout the rest of the hemisphere.
The fan magazine Telenovela has its headquarters in Miami, for instance, and the likes of Hola from Spain, Gente from Argentina and Vea from Puerto Rico all maintain correspondents here. Several new cable channels are scheduled to go on the air here this summer and, this spring's "Premio Lo Nuestro" music awards show televised by Univision was so successful that plans are afoot to stage an annual Grammy-like Latin music show in Miami.
"The best is yet to come," Mr. Bayly, the talk-show host, predicted. "The entertainment business is based on dreams and illusions, and if you're trying to sell those dreams, Miami is the ideal, dreamed-of city for all of Latin America. It is ironic, but in this city with almost no history of its own, even Bolivar's dream of a single Latin America, united under one banner, is becoming a reality."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Hayden Planetarium;
A Remnant of the 1930's, and Its Sky, Will Fall

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE Landmarks Preservation Commission has twice designated as a landmark the 1935 Hayden Planetarium on West 81st Street. But the American Museum of Natural History is moving ahead with plans to demolish its mild, moderne structure -- with the landmarks commission's blessing, but amid dismay and suspicion by some preservation groups.
The American Museum of Natural History opened its first building in 1877, one unit in what was planned as a giant, gridded complex of 12 buildings enclosing four courtyards running from 77th to 81st Streets, between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue. Although the style changed, the museum announced at least three more times -- the 1890's, the 1920's and the 1970's -- that it would complete the original plan. 
 But by 1934 the scale of the undertaking and the Depression left the museum not even half complete. The Hayden Planetarium is the only structure built since that time.
In the 1920's the museum planned a five-story astronomical hall at the exact center of the projected complex. Its crowning ornament was to be a planetarium, a domed auditorium where special projectors could display the night skies. But the project stalled, in part because of money.
The modern projection planetarium was developed after World War I by Walter Bauersfeld, an engineer for the Carl Zeiss Optical Works. A craze for planetariums followed, and the first Zeiss-type planetarium in America was the dramatic Adler in Chicago, built in 1930.
In 1933 the American Museum of Natural History established the Planetarium Authority; its state charter allowed it to receive $650,000 in Federal funds from the Reconstruction Finance Authority. Charles Hayden, described by Time magazine as a "dapper bachelor banker," gave $150,000 for the optics.
The revived planetarium project was shifted to one of the four projected courtyards of the complex. The architects Trowbridge & Livingston designed a severe brick rectangle with Art Moderne grillwork and doors, accented by floodlighting.
Even for the 1930's and even for a completely new building type, the Hayden is a puzzling structure, strangely disconnected from the rest of the museum and not much to look at.
Research by Higgins & Quasebarth, a preservation firm and consultant to the museum, indicates that the planetarium was expressly designed to be enveloped by the future museum complex and was thus, nominally, a temporary design.
BUT it was good enough to fool the writers of the 1939 "W.P.A. Guide to New York City," who described it as "among the most interesting examples of modern functional architecture."
There was no other architectural criticism of the Hayden Planetarium, but its show of 9,000 stars of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres drew rave reviews and millions of visitors, as did its first-floor orrery, with moving models of the planets out to the orbit of Saturn.
Now the American Museum of Natural History believes that the Hayden Planetarium is out of date and wants to replace it by the year 2000.
Dr. Neil Tyson, the director, says that since 1935, the field of astronomy has profoundly changed. For instance, constellations were once a major part of astronomy texts but are now barely noticed.
Dr. Tyson foresees a sophisticated center where a computerized projector can display not just the stars as seen from the Earth, but black holes and other phenomena. The architects Polshek and Partners and the exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum Associates have developed futuristic plans for a huge transparent cube containing a spherical planetarium inside and planetary models suspended in midair.
Another aspect of the design is a three-level parking garage next door -- lines of cars often back up into 81st Street waiting for spaces to open up in the museum's lot.
In 1967 the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the museum complex -- including the Hayden Planetarium -- as a landmark, and it was also included in the 1990 Central Park West Historic District. But last fall the commission reported favorably on the proposed demolition of the Hayden Planetarium, noting that the 1935 structure had received short shrift in previous designation reports. The Municipal Art Society and the New York Landmarks Conservancy also supported the demolition.
But other groups continue to oppose the destruction of the Planetarium and believe the museum has received a kind of preferential treatment for which private owners would not even hope.
The Historic Districts Council pointed out that the commission specifically protected the Hayden Planetarium in its earlier actions, even though it did exclude other museum structures. The council has suggested building the new planetarium on the open parking lot next door, reusing the Hayden and encouraging the use of mass transit.
Both groups, along with local preservationists like Samuel Leff, who lives on West 79th Street, suspect that the American Museum of Natural History is getting the same treatment the Metropolitan Museum of Art received 25 years ago, when its massive building campaign severely altered several landmark facades.
But although other permits are pending, most dissenters think the landmarks commission was the biggest hurdle. John Krawchuk, a spokesman for Landmark West!, a local preservation group, said that the Polshek plan is "a good, solid design" but that the adaptive reuse of the Hayden Planetarium is now a lost opportunity.
"Because of its humility, it bespeaks of an era of economy, and our landmarks need to tell the whole story of New York City," he said. "We feel it is a dangerous precedent."
However, Deborah Sack, a spokeswoman for the landmarks commission, said the commission found that the Hayden "is not a distinguished example of planetarium architecture." She said the commission had allowed the demolition of other individual structures within landmark complexes, like the Central Park Zoo.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Physicians' Offices;
For Doctors, Togetherness Is the New Way of Life

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
DR. MICHAEL KRAMER is an internist and cardiologist who practices on the Upper East Side on Manhattan. But lately he has been spending as much time managing his Manhattan Primary Care medical group and physicians' network as he does with patients.
In the managed-care environment of the 1990's, solo practices are rapidly diminishing. Doctors who have treasured their ground-floor offices on Park and Fifth Avenues are moving out and joining with others in larger spaces to reduce their overhead. 
 "Group practices and networks will be the dominant form within three years," Dr. Kramer said. "Doctors' profit margins are shrinking, and the managed-care systems are using incentives to group people together. The other problem is that there are far too many doctors in this town."
He said there are eight doctors employed by the medical group, which has offices at 90th Street and Madison Avenue and at Central Part West and 83d Street. The network has 120 doctors in a loose alliance that allows them to practice under their own name and does not guarantee them a level of income.
Many who have been watching the changes in the medical business and its real estate consequences say they were overdue. "Doctor and the medical community are now experiencing what corporate America has already gone through," said Josh N. Kuriloff, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield. "They are downsizing and re-engineering their practices to lower their overhead."
"New York is 10 to 15 years behind what happened on the West Coast," said Debra C. Weissman, a practice management consultant based in White Plains. The reason, she said, is that New Yorkers had a greater choice of doctors and hospitals and strongly preferred staying with their favorites until cost pressures became intolerable for employers. "The doctors here looked up one day and all of a sudden they were inundated by managed care," Ms. Weissman said.
With managed care, people covered by corporate health insurance plans are directed to doctors who have agreed to a fee schedule that is less than many had been charging. This put many doctors, particularly those involved in primary care, in a squeeze. Lower fees meant less income for the same amount of work, but those who tried to stay independent risked facing empty waiting rooms.
"Patients were loyal to their doctors, but the companies they worked for joined plans that limited choice," said Paul Wexler, a broker with Douglas Elliman's professional leasing and sales operation. "If the doctors don't join they are not going to have enough business, and if they waited too long they might have trouble getting aboard."
"One of the ways doctors are adapting," said Michael Dubin of Brown Harris Stevens, "is using real estate to achieve economies of scale. If five doctors get together, obviously you do not need five waiting rooms, five receptionists or five X-ray machines. All an individual doctor needs is a consulting room and two examining rooms."
Some established physicians tried to hang on to their prestigious addresses in the face of falling incomes and rising rents by doubling or tripling up. "Just a few years ago it was one doctor to one office," Mr. Wexler said. "Now you have two and three people in the same office."
One doctor giving up his Park Avenue office is Michael C. Bruno, who is also chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital. "My old office is beautiful and I love it, but it is going to be sold," Dr. Bruno said. The three-doctor office is at 535 Park Avenue.
Instead, he will move in with 37 other physicians as managing director of the Madison Medical Group. The group is leasing 60,000 square feet on three floors at 110 East 59th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues. The new facility will be equipped with X-ray and other diagnostic facilities and a testing laboratory.
He said he feels fortunate to have found the space. "Not a lot of real estate operators want a lot of doctors in their buildings," he said.
DOCTORS' offices need a lot more plumbing and generate more garbage than a standard business office, which makes them costly to equip and operate, and they tend to be open at nonstandard hours, like evenings and weekends. There is also the fact that they bring sick people into a building.
"You can build out beautiful space in an office building for $30 to $40 a square foot," said Mr. Dubin, who specializes in medical space. "A medical office will cost from $75 to $125 a square foot, so owners are going to want a long-term commitment."
One of the ironies of the current situation, real estate executives say, is that many of the offices being given up by primary-care doctors are being leased and purchased by plastic surgeons. "It makes sense, because they are not being paid by insurance companies," said Dr. Harry W. Kent, who stopped practicing as a dentist 20 years ago to run the Professional Enterprises Organization in Queens. "People who want to be beautiful are willing to pay the price themselves."
His business, he said, takes advantage of the fact that most doctors are not trained, or inclined, to be businessmen. "We buy buildings, rehabilitate them and equip them for medical uses," he said. "In today's environment, the most successful doctors are the ones who have a businessman to negotiate contracts, buy equipment and so forth."
Another businessman who manages doctors is Philip Villacci, the chief executive of Mid-Manhattan Medical Associates. The group has 25 doctors scattered over 17 locations between 59th and 90th Streets on the East and West Sides of Manhattan.
The group has leased two floors at 654 Madison Avenue, at the northeast corner of 60th Street, and Mr. Villacci said the plan is to consolidate many of the practices at that location as individual leases expire.
He said the financial squeeze of managed care has curbed the once-fierce independence some doctors were known for. "Economics has overcome ego," he said. "Now it is like managing the Yankees. Everybody is a star, but occasionally someone will have to bunt."
The same cost pressures that are pushing doctors into groups are squeezing hospitals as well, touching off a wave of mergers. A survey conducted by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse indicated that as many as 2,000 of the nation's 6,000 tertiary-care hospitals may close by 2000, throwing some pricey real estate on the market.
"It used to be that health care drove real estate, but now it is real estate that is driving health care," said Deborah Kops, a corporate real estate consultant at Price Waterhouse. "The average health care facility has 50 percent of its assets tied up in real estate, so they are simply going to have to manage more aggressively."
Hospitals are expensive because, like medical offices, they need lots of plumbing to deliver water and medical gases and carry away waste water. They also need extensive wiring to serve diagnostic machinery and other equipment.
They must also have advanced air-handling equipment to prevent diseases from being spread, and the ability to quickly isolate an area if fire breaks out. Unlike an office building, where people can be expected to leave under their own power in an emergency, patients in hospitals are essentially immobile.
AS a rule of thumb, hospitals cost twice as much to build per square foot as office buildings, said Charles G. Siconolfi, a health-care specialist with the architectural firm Hellmuth Obata Kassabaum.
It is not clear what will happen to those empty hospitals, experts say. In some cases a sale will involve rewriting history. "A lot of health-care facilities were financed on a tax-exempt basis, so there are a lot of covenants and restrictions which will be hard to disgorge," said Ms. Kops. "It will be difficult to deliver a piece of real estate that looks like a shopping center."
There have been suggestions that as the number of acute-care, or hospital, beds shrinks, the buildings themselves can be converted to non-acute, or nursing, care. But the inherently high cost of operating hospital building, particularly in urban locations, may make nursing-home application impractical, unless there is some kind of subsidy.
"The only people who can operate sub-acute operations economically are the chains," Mr. Siconolfi said, "and they seem to have a formula that involves building on an open site, so they probably would not be interested in taking over an existing building."
