HEADLINE: Founder of Program to Build Students' Self-Respect, and Houses, Wins 'Genius' Grant

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 17

 BODY:
Many of Dorothy Stoneman's friends went south to join the civil rights movement after college. Ms. Stoneman, who graduated from Harvard in 1963, went to Harlem, and stayed for 25 years. She founded a community service program that gave alienated, unemployed young people hope -- and skills -- by putting them to work rebuilding poor neighborhoods.
That program grew into Youthbuild U.S.A., which has become a national model. Today Ms. Stoneman, as president of Youthbuild, was awarded a $325,000 prize by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Ms. Stoneman, 54, who earns about $45,000 a year after taxes, and each year raises $5 million for Youthbuild, whose main office is in Somerville, Mass., said she planned to use the money "on something that might not be funded." 
 "I feel determined," she said in a telephone interview from New York, where she attended a board meeting of Youth Action, the program she started in East Harlem in 1978. "It's sort of my job to produce hope. It's my function to be determined, to never give up, to make sure we don't let anyone turn us back."
Youthbuild, which has 100 programs in 34 states, builds young people's self-respect, teaching them leadership as well as carpentry skills. The students, age 17 to 25, spend alternating weeks going to classes and learning carpentry by renovating abandoned housing for the poor in places like Portland, Me., Eugene, Ore. and York, Pa., as well as Harlem and Boston. They earn $100 a week.
"This mass of young people who have been treated as if they were worthless, and who have been thrown away, and assumed to be without value because they dropped out of school have a deep, very powerful desire to play a constructive role in the world," said Ms. Stoneman, whose organization also gets private and government financing. "You put an ad in the Daily News, you get 500 applications in a week."
Ms. Stoneman, who also helped start a summer pre-school in Harlem, and ran the East Harlem Block Schools, an alternative school, said she learned early on that communities must be given control over their own schools and programs. "Anything that's going to work needs to be accountable to that community, to be rooted there," she said.
Each Youthbuild class elects a committee that interviews candidates for teaching jobs and has the last word on whom to hire.
"It's the adult responsibility to make a path," Ms. Stoneman said. "We're making a mini community in which young people can get the support, the love, the opportunity, the structure, the friends to build their own path to the future."
Ms. Stoneman is married to John Bell, the director of training for Youthbuild. They have two children, Sierra, 20, and Taro, 8. They live in Belmont, Mass.
Each year, the MacArthur foundation awards what are often called "genius grants," to people who it believes have pushed the boundaries of their field. Recipients can spend the grant any way they want.
Twenty other people received grants today:
James Angel, 55, an astronomer in Tuscon, Ariz., who is searching for planets around other stars, $330,000.
 Joaquin Avila, 48, of Fremont, Calif., a lawyer involved in voting-rights cases, $295,000.
 Allan Berube, 49, of San Francisco, a social historian focusing on minorities, $300,000.
 Barbara Block, 38, of Monterey, Calif., an animal physiologist, $245,000.
 Joan Connelly, 42, of New York, an archeologist and art historian, $265,000.
 Thomas Daniel, 41, of Seattle, a biologist whose work combines zoology, engineering and mathematics, $260,000.
 Martin Eakes, 41, of Durham, N.C., director of a self-help organization, $260,000.
 Rebecca Goldstein, 46, of Highland Park, N.J., a novelist with a strong philosophical bent, $285,000.
 Robert Greenstein, 50, of Washington, a policy analyst on issues affecting low-income families, $305,000.
 Richard Howard, 66, of New York, a poet, translator, critic and editor, $375,000.
 John Jesurun, 45, of New York, a theater director and writer who combines media in his performance pieces, $280,000.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Mixed as Dow Posts a Slight Gain

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday as a rally in bonds failed to shake investor concern that profits would fall short of expectations later this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.33 points, to 5,652.78, ending five straight days of losses. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 0.69 point, to 665.16, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 5.54 points, to 1,207.64. 
 In the bond market, expectations of slowing growth, coupled with optimism that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates next month to quell inflation pressures, helped drive the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond lower for a third session. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of a bond's price, fell two-hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.06 percent.
Lower rates, and the prospect of lower borrowing costs, pushed the Dow industrials up more than 28 points at one point late in the day, but fears about corporate earnings pared the gain.
"We're very concerned about the profit outlook," said Kip Wright, portfolio manager at Kirr, Marbach & Company in Indianapolis, which oversees $800 million in investment assets. "We're hearing that business is O.K., not booming. A lot of companies are leery about being too optimistic about the next six months."
The Philip Morris Companies led decliners in the Dow industrials, falling 1, to 104 3/8, after the prosecuting attorney in a Mississippi anti-tobacco lawsuit said six new industry insiders had come forward to assist the state's case.
Semiconductors slid for a third day. Cyrix fell 2 1/16, to 23 1/2, after an analyst at the Southcoast Corporation who recently took over coverage of Cyrix cut the former earnings estimate for the current quarter by more than half.
Intel shed 1, to 72.
Brooktrout Technology Inc. and Smith Micro Software Inc., two small computer software publishers, slid amid concern about the current quarter's earnings estimates, analysts said. Brooktrout fell 5 3/4, to 32 3/4, and Smith Micro retreated 1 7/8, to 11 1/2.
Aptar Group Inc., a maker of aerosols and pumps for fragrance and health care manufacturers, said its second-quarter earnings would not meet expectations because of weak perfume and cosmetic sales in Europe. Aptar fell 3 3/8, to 36 3/8.
Oil shares gained, following crude prices higher. A standoff between United Nations inspectors and Iraq led to speculation that the recent agreement allowing Iraq to sell oil might be delayed or shelved, tightening supplies. Exxon rose 1, to 84 1/2; Texaco rose 5/8, to 84 1/8, and Chevron advanced 3/8, to 60.
Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C.'s American depository receipts gained after analysts said the company would report promising results in the development of a new AIDS treatment at a conference next month. Shares of the British drug maker, the world's largest producer of AIDS medications, rose 7/8, to 27 3/8.
I.B.M. rose 7/8, to 102 1/2, after saying it would begin selling laser printers designed for computer networks, in competition with the market leader, Hewlett-Packard, whose shares fell 5/8, to 99.
Beverage companies, whose profits can grow regardless of the economy's performance, gained amid expectations of less frenetic growth. Coca-Cola rose 3/8, to 46 1/8, and Pepsico added 1/8, to 33 1/4.
First Union rose 1/2, to 60 1/2, after it said it would buy two smaller East Coast banks, Center Financial of Waterbury, Conn., and Home Financial of Hollywood, Fla., for a total of about $715 million in stock.
Center Financial shares rose 1 1/4, to 24 1/8, while Home Financial fell 9/16, to 13 1/16 on the offer.
Kansas City Power and Light rose 1 1/2, to 27 3/8, after Western Resources said it had sweetened its bid for the utility to $31, a share from $28.
Syquest Technology rose 1 7/8, to 11 1/4, after the company said it met qualifications for listing on the Nasdaq stock market, after raising $20 million from investors by selling preferred shares.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Rises Against the Dollar On Yeltsin Showing in Voting

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The German mark rose to a one-month high against the dollar yesterday as Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, led in the first round of balloting.
Prospects for political stability in Russia often help the mark because of the close economic ties between Russia and Germany, Russia's largest trading partner and biggest creditor. 
 "Yeltsin winning this round was a relief for the market," said John McCarthy at ING Capital Markets. "So the pressure the election exerted on the mark last week was quieted."
Also bolstering the mark were statements from Germany's central bank. While calling the mark's recent decline good news for German exports, Bundesbank officials indicated yesterday that the dollar had risen enough. The dollar settled at 1.5204 marks in New York trading, down from 1.5272 on Friday.
The dollar also slipped in New York to 108.98 yen from 109.12 after Japan said its merchandise trade surplus shrank 60.5 percent in May from a year earlier. A decline means Japanese exporters have fewer dollars to sell for yen when bringing profits home.
The British pound rose to $1.5435 from $1.5375.
In its report for June, the Bundesbank said that last year's rise by the mark against the dollar had been reversed. The dollar fell about 8 percent against the mark last year and has gained 6 percent this year.
Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, said in a television interview that the value of the dollar against the mark reflected the two countries' policies and economies more fairly than it did last spring.
"The comments suggest that the Bundesbank is not a big advocate of a stronger dollar," said Kevin Weir, currency salesman at the ABN-Amro Bank in Chicago.
Traders were wary that the persistent sluggishness in the German economy could prompt the Bundesbank to cut its 14-day repurchase rate in coming weeks, which could hurt the mark by reducing the returns on German deposits.
The Bundesbank said the evidence of a recovery was patchy at best. The German economy, Europe's biggest, shrank for the last two quarters. "The Bundesbank, at one point or another, is going to ease," said Lizbeth Goldberg at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank.

HEADLINE: Critics Attack Senate Bill To Aid Timber Company

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Last week, Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska introduced a bill to give a highly unusual long-term timber contract to the Ketchikan Pulp Company, saying the arrangement was vital to the economy of the small town of Ketchikan in Alaska's panhandle.
"I cannot stand idly by and watch the town of Ketchikan die," Mr. Murkowsky said. He said hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs would be lost without the contract, which would guarantee the company timber from the Tongass National Forest until 2019. 
 But the proposed contract has an advantage that Mr. Murkowski did not mention: it would shore up First Bank of Ketchikan, in which he holds more than $1 million in stock and on whose board his daughter sits. The bank does not have a direct interest in Ketchikan Pulp, but bank officials have been pushing for the contract because it would guarantee a robust economy in the region, and in turn would be good for the bank.
Mr. Murkowski, a Republican in his third term, said today that he saw no ethical problem with his role.
"I can't think of a better way to represent my constituents in the State of Alaska than to try and fight for the only year-round manufacturing facility in the entire southeastern Alaska region," he said.
Officials of the United States Forest Service, who manage timber cutting in the national forests, have opposed the extension. But Mr. Murkowski, who is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has significant power over the Forest Service and has been holding hearings on its timber policies, which he has criticized.
Environmental groups have called the bill a special-interest giveaway that would allow excessive cutting of ancient trees that provide the best and most diverse wildlife habitats. And they point to Ketchikan Pulp's history of environmental problems. In 1995, the company, a subsidiary of Louisiana Pacific Corporation, paid $6 million in fines and pleaded guilty to a felony and 13 misdemeanor violations of the Federal Clean Water Act going back to the 1980's.
"Here we have the world's last remaining temperate rainforest and this company that's almost the definition of a special interest," said Steven E. Kallick, director of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign. "Senator Murkowski is apparently unconcerned about the national interest and focused solely on this special interest, which he is far too close to."
The Tongass National Forest is a vast expanse of islands and lush valleys that cover most of the Alaska panhandle. Its 500-year-old hemlock, spruce and cedar trees are among the oldest on the planet, some of them possibly 1,000 years old.
Ketchikan Pulp has been logging in the Tongass since 1954, when it won a 50-year contract with the Federal Government, which offered the long-term deals as an incentive to open up what was then viewed as the Alaskan frontier. One other company was given such a contract, but it went out of business several years ago. Since then, logging companies have competed for short-term rights to cut specific sections of national forests around the country.
Mr. Murkowski's bill would guarantee Ketchikan Pulp 15 more years of logging in the Tongass after its contract expires in 2004.
His proposal also guarantees the company 192 million board feet of timber each year rather than the roughly 160 million it now gets. (One thousand board feet is the equivalent of a 100-foot-tall spruce tree with a 28-inch diameter at chest height.) The proposal also virtually guarantees the company a profit. The most unusual feature, critics say, is a provision that the contract cannot be terminated or changed without Ketchikan Pulp's agreement.
"The Forest Service always has the power to cancel contracts for environmental damage," said Charles M. Clusen, senior policy specialist for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This makes it a one-way street."
Ketchikan Pulp argues that it needs the certainty of a 15-year extension if it is to install millions of dollars of anti-pollution equipment. A decision on whether to remain in the town will be made soon, the company says, and the choice will hinge on whether the extension is approved. About 25 percent of the employment in Ketchikan, home to some 9,000 people, is provided directly and indirectly by Ketchikan Pulp.
Mr. Murkowski, a banker before joining the Senate in 1981, said today that he had inherited the First Bank stock from his parents. Financial disclosure forms filed with the Senate place the value at more than $1 million. In 1995, he received dividends worth $50,001 to $100,000 from the bank, a subsidiary of First Bancorp. His daughter Lisa A. Murkowski, an Anchorage lawyer, is a member of the bank's board.
Mr. Murkowski said the legislation was necessary because the Forest Service had shown that it would not grant the extension on its own. Ketchikan Pulp is in a special situation because the only source for timber in Alaska is the Forest Service.
The bill's importance to the bank was underscored by its president, William G. Moran Jr., last April when he testified at state hearings in Juneau. Without a long-term agreement, Mr. Moran said, lending would slow significantly. "The commercial activity kind of goes into hibernation," he said.
But Mr. Clusen said: "All the other pulp mills in the country don't get this kind of deal. It's undermining the Tongass plan and interfering with the free-market process."

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Agree on Pact To Fight Piracy

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 17

 BODY:
After a month of intense negotiations, China and the United States reached a broad agreement today on how to crack down more effectively on the piracy of music, movies and computer software in China, and Washington halted plans to impose $2 billion in trade sanctions.
In three final days of round-the-clock talks, with today's deadline for United States sanctions looming, the Chinese agreed to new measures to ban the reproduction and sale of pirated intellectual property. The Chinese and American negotiators ended their intricate game of brinksmanship when the Chinese relented slightly on two final issues, announcing they had closed down two more pirate compact disk factories -- bringing the total closed this year to 15 -- and expanded permission for foreign music and movie companies to produce and sell their products inside China. 
 United States officials hailed the agreement as an important step forward in reducing the piracy of music, movies and software. Yet they also portrayed the talks as one piece in the larger political tangle of American-Chinese relations, calling the agreement a successful example of the Clinton Administration's policy of engagement with China.
"What engagement means is that we do not avoid our differences, but that we work together constructively," said Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, as she announced the agreement at a news conference tonight.
China agreed last year to stop illegal production, but failed to carry through with adequate controls. The heart of today's accord involves improved enforcement, and Ms. Barshefsky pointed to a series of steps she said the Chinese authorities pledged to take to make it more difficult to operate as a pirate in China. Although the steps are a clear improvement on paper, they appear to contain flaws that make it hard to tell whether they will be more effective in practice.
In the past, factories that were shut down for illegal copying, for example, have often re-opened after a short period, sometimes operating at night to avoid detection. In today's agreement, American officials failed to obtain approval to verify factory closings independently. Instead, they must rely on the word of local officials, who may be beholden to local interests. In some cases, pirate factory managers have protected themselves by sharing profits with military or local officials.
"Over the long term, the real test lies in the strength of the underlying enforcement regime," Ms. Barshefsky said. "The ultimate test is implementation."
Perhaps the most significant change in this agreement is China's willingness, for the first time, to employ police officers to carry out investigations of illegal compact disk factories instead of using administrative officers, who have less authority.
Police officers carried out several successful raids on compact disk factories in recent weeks in Guangdong Province, but those raids were evidently timed to impress the American negotiators, so it is not clear whether the police will remain as active.
Another advance lies in a new system of verifying that the title of a compact disk to be produced has been obtained legally. From now on, any factory producing a disk must first obtain approval from the National Copyright Administration in Beijing, which can check with the studio where the music or movie originated to make sure its rights were obtained properly.
As a result of the crackdown on piracy in Guangdong Province in recent weeks, Ms. Barshefsky said that 15 compact disk factories -- half of the more than 30 known factories -- have now been closed down, their licenses revoked and their equipment confiscated. She said the closings had been verified by American officials or industry agents and added that she expected more to be closed as investigations continue in the coming weeks.
Another American official said that Chinese negotiators had withheld the names of two of those factories until the last day of talks. The announcement of the two closings, paired with the contentious issue of improved access for Americans to Chinese markets, were concessions that helped Ms. Barshevsky agree to discard the threat of sanctions, the official said.
Market access, or the right of American music and movie companies to produce and sell within China, was cited by Ms. Barshefsky as an area where incremental advances were also made. But the issue of market access was left out of the final agreement, apparently a sign of how sensitive Chinese officials remain about allowing any loosening of control over creative ventures.
Ms. Barshefsky also pointed out that the seven-page document was not a supplement or a replacement for the landmark agreement on intellectual property that was reached last year.
Although this year's talks sometimes seemed a replay, with accusations and counteraccusations on each side followed by a last minute agreement, they were actually much simpler. Last year, negotiators devised a lengthy agreement; this year they debated how to enforce it better.
In its own announcement, the Chinese Government reflected a sensitivity to national pride and tried to dispel any impression that a foreign power was dictating the terms of any international agreement.
"The agreement once again shows that the only way to solve the differences between countries is consultations on an equal footing," the New China News Agency reported. "Sanctions and retaliations will do no good to the settlement of any issues. Instead, they will make the differences more complicated."
The sanctions, formally announced in Washington on May 15, would have raised the tariffs on Chinese textiles, garments and electrical goods by 100 percent. The Chinese announced a reciprocal list of $2 billion worth of American imports to be hit with its own sanctions.
After the agreement was reached today, Shi Guangsheng, the deputy trade minister who sat across the negotiating table from Ms. Barshefsky, announced that China's threatened sanctions would be rescinded as well.
In Washington, officials expressed relief that they had found a way to sidestep the imposition of sanctions, which had been opposed by many American companies that do business with China.
Perhaps with an eye to the election, Administration officials from Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the Commerce Secretary, Mickey Kantor, argued that increased enforcement of anti-piracy laws would translate into jobs in the United States.
"It will help protect the jobs of American workers, open up opportunities for American companies, and promote the integration of China into the world economy," Mr. Christopher said today. Mr. Kantor was equally enthusaistic, inisting that the agreement "went from the abstract to effective, concrete action."
In private, however, Administration officials acknowledged that beyond the closing of the worst-offender plants, which they said was a major accomplishment, it was difficult to tell whether China would keep up the pressure on pirate producers.
The accord was largely hailed by the recording industry, Hollywood and software producers, who said they viewed any form of stepped-up enforcement as progress. Several industry officials noted, however, that the accord only calls for the destruction of some of the pirate firms' equipment, making them wonder whether the compact disk presses that have been seized by Chinese authorities could reappear in other factories.
At her news conference, Ms. Barshefsky accused the New China News Agency, the official Government organ, of attempted piracy by its recent demands that foreign news agencies selling economic information in China turn over their proprietary software and details of their business operations to the agency. Under rules adopted in January, the news agency is meant to supervise, regulate and compete with agencies like Reuters and Dow Jones.
"This is a massive IPR violation scheme," said Ms. Barshefsky, referring to intellectual property rights and adding that she raised the issue with senior Chinese officials. "It is designed to capture the benefits of U.S. software and U.S. data collection abilities without regard to the licensee."
In the end, Ms. Barshefsky said she did not underestimate the obstacles involved in China's attempts to come to grips with the issue of protecting intellectual property.
"Three years ago, IPR enforcement was an abstract concept," she said. "Now, the Chinese authorities are taking concrete and tangible actions.
"Halting piracy is a long-term and complex process, here and elsewhere in the world," she said. "China is certainly not there yet."

THE CLOSING OF COMPACT DISK FACTORIES: People violating intellectual property regulations will now face criminal prosecution, rare for violators in the past, but a necessary deterrent in the eyes of U.S. officials.
 
SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT PERIOD: The police assume responsiblity for the investigation of compact disk factories, and include intellectual property violations in a nationwide crackdown on crime.
 
BORDER ENFORCEMENT: Chinese Customs officers are supposed to better coordinate their enforcement with prosecutors. Customs officials will also work with industry experts on how to watch for and identify illegally made compact disks.
 
MONITORING: China will not allow any systematic on-site verification by U.S. officials. Local supervisors will keep records of regular audits, and show the records to U.S. officials in periodic visits. Each compact disk factory will now be required to obtain approval from the National Copyright Administration in Beijing to ensure that the factory has paid proper royalties. (pg. A6)

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE: THE KINGMAKER;
From War Hero to Populist Politician

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 17

 BODY:
The retired general who came in third in Sunday's presidential race, and whose endorsement is now avidly sought by Boris N. Yeltsin, has been caricatured as a strident nationalist determined to rebuild the Russian empire on the ashes of the old Soviet Union.
But judged by his platform and his manner, Aleksandr I. Lebed is more Colin Powell than Vladimir Zhirinovsky. An Afghan war hero whose face bears the scars of a boxing career, Mr. Lebed is well known in the West for his impolitic prediction that the Soviet Union would be partly recreated. 
 But it is Mr. Lebed's steely independence, his reputation of incorruptibility, and his image of being above the seamy world of ordinary politics that endeared him to millions of Russian voters.
Indeed, during the last several months Mr. Lebed, who received 15 percent of the vote on Sunday, has played down nationalist themes and softened his image.
He has, for example, unveiled a pragmatic program for Russia's problems, which carries the uninspirational title "Ideology of Common Sense."
It is a plan that plays upon many Russians' deep longing for a strong man to fight crime at home and introduce probity in government, without pandering to those who yearn to recapture an empire and punish the rich.
Striking pro-reform themes, the new Mr. Lebed has also called for evacuating the Russian population from the embattled province of Chechnya and giving Chechens the freedom to chose independence; Mr. Yeltsin has spent more than 30,000 lives to keep Chechnya under Russian control.
And Mr. Lebed has denounced Communist economics as "a dead end."
"Without a market and private property, people work much worse," Mr. Lebed declared in an interview with the newspaper Trud.
Mr. Lebed is uneasy discussing the details of economics. But like much American support for General Powell, much Russian support for Mr. Lebed is a matter of mystique rather than specific views. "The caricature is that he is a nationalist," said Michael A. McFaul, a expert at the Moscow-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "But he is not a nationalist as much as a populist. It is clear that he is not against reform. He is not against the course that Yeltsin has set."
The evolution of the 46-year-old Mr. Lebed from a sharp-edged former general to a somewhat gentler authoritarian figure speaks volumes about what Mr. Lebed has learned about politics in the new Russia.
In the December parliamentary elections, when Mr. Lebed made his political debut, he shared a slate with Yuri Skokov, a former Yeltsin aide and head of the nationalist Congress of Russian Communities.
There were tensions over who would take the lead and Mr. Skokov kept Mr. Lebed on a tight leash. As a result, Mr. Lebed seemed awkward and unprepared during campaign appearances and the party did poorly during the election.
But since then Mr. Lebed has become his own man and hired high-powered political consultants, who have crafted a sophisticated and appealing television advertising campaign casting the former general as a crime-fighter and foe of corruption.
This is not to say that the former general does not have his weaknesses.
Many Russians are uncomfortable with the idea of a military man running the country. Mr. Lebed's aides have taken to festooning their campaign offices with pictures of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle to give their candidate a sense of legitimacy.
An alliance between Mr. Yeltsin and the paratrooper-turned-politican would seem to hold decided advantages for both.
It could help insulate Mr. Yeltsin against charges of corruption and favoritism that have dogged his campaign, while giving Mr. Lebed real power, as well as a base to nurture his future presidential ambitions.
Encouraging speculation of an alliance, the former general said that he has ruled out working with the Communists. "We have gone past Communism and left this shore forever," he said today.
But, self-assured to the point of arrogance, Mr. Lebed indicated that his support would not come cheaply. He said he was interested in a post with real decision-making authority in which he could "organize the fight against crime and prevent extremists of left and right from plunging the country into an abyss of bloodshed."
Just a year ago, an alliance between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Lebed seemed to be very far-fetched indeed.
Mr. Lebed grew up in Novocherkassk, a town near Rostov where Soviet troops fired on demonstrators in 1962. In his Trud interview, Mr. Lebed denounced the Communist Party's failure to condemn this shooting.
"In this case, failing to condemn is a crime in itself," he said.
Mr. Lebed joined the army and became a paratrooper. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he rose to prominence when he headed the 14th Army group, which defended ethnic Russians in the Trans-Dneister region of the newly formed republic of Moldova. Although his critics recall that campaign as a defense of the Soviet empire, Mr. Lebed portrays it as an obligation to a beleaguered minority of his countrymen.
The general locked horns with Mr. Yeltsin last year after repeatedly criticizing Gen. Pavel Grachev, Mr. Yeltsin's Defense Minister, over the invasion of Chechnya and over the Government's decision to disband the 14th Army's headquarters.
After President Yeltsin announced Mr. Lebed's resignation last year, the gravel-throated general barely flinched.
"I guess that Yeltsin got sick and tired of me, and I am sick and tired of him as well," he said.

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: Richard S. Lindzen;
A Skeptic Asks, Is It Getting Hotter, Or Is It Just the Computer Model?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
AS climate experts firm up their view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphere, one voice stands out in clarion dissent. It is that of Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a shoemaker's son from the Bronx who has risen through the academic hierarchy as a leading expert on the physical processes of the atmosphere.
Is there truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate? 
 Dr. Lindzen does not equivocate. "We don't have any evidence that this is a serious problem," he says flatly, with precise diction, in a friendly voice that resonates strongly in his 17th-floor office overlooking Boston across the Charles River. A clutter of folders and papers, coupled with Dr. Lindzen's untrimmed black beard and hornrim glasses, suggest the academic theorist he is.
His opinions attacking the formal consensus about climate change have made the 56-year-old Dr. Lindzen a bete noir to environmentalists who trumpet the dangers of global warming and a champion to political conservatives and industrial interests who minimize the threat. Admirers see him as a force for intellectual honesty in a highly politicized debate. Critics fault him for professing unwarranted sureness in a field of research rife with uncertainty. Many say he is simply wrong.
But everyone takes him with the utmost seriousness because of a reputation for brilliance that got him elected to the National Academy of Sciences at age 37. It is in this sense that his voice stands out from the relatively small group of greenhouse scientists who speak out boldly and publicly in dissent.
Last fall, a panel of scientists convened by the United Nations to advise the world's governments concluded for the first time that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are probably responsible, at least in part, for a changing global climate. The panel also predicted that if emissions of the gases are not reduced, the average global temperature will increase by 1.8 degrees to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit -- with a best estimate of 3.6 degrees -- by the year 2100. The predicted warming, according to the United Nations panel, would be accompanied by widespread climatic disruption.
Bunk, says Dr. Lindzen. He says the conclusions are based on computerized models of the climate system so flawed as to be meaningless. Everyone recognizes that the models are imperfect, but Dr. Lindzen goes much farther. "I do not accept the model results as evidence," he says, because trusting them "is like trusting a ouija board." Furthermore, he argues, the physics of the atmosphere permit only a minor and untroubling warming despite the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
His assertions have subjected him to a barrage of criticism from the modeling community and its many scientific allies. Dr. Lindzen has "sacrificed his luminosity by taking a stand that most of us feel is scientifically unsound," said a longtime acquaintance, Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University, which runs one of the computer models Dr. Lindzen scorns. Dr. Mahlman nevertheless describes Dr. Lindzen as "a formidable opponent."
Does Dr. Lindzen feel beaten up on?
"That's a matter of how thick one's skin is," he said over fried calamari at a Cambridge restaurant. It helps, he said, that he gets many calls and letters from silent skeptics in the scientific community who thank him for his stand. They often do not themselves speak out, he says, because it doesn't pay to be a skeptic. "Who needs to be in controversies, who needs any of this?" he said. "And in a time of budgetary restraint, climate has gotten good funding. Why spoil a good thing?"
By the same token, he says, there is a financing advantage in being on the greenhouse bandwagon. Are some people trying to maintain a sense of crisis to get research grants? "Yes," he says, "and it's unconscious and it's natural."
One who says he basically agrees with Dr. Lindzen's view is Dr. William Gray of Colorado State University, best known for his predictions of hurricane activity. "A lot of my older colleagues are very skeptical on the global warming thing," said Dr. Gray. He calls Dr. Lindzen's stand "courageous." While some of the criticisms delivered by Dr. Lindzen may have some flaws, said Dr. Gray, "across the board he's generally very good."
Another atmospheric scientist cited by Dr. Lindzen as a fellow skeptic, Dr. John M. Wallace of the University of Washington, said there are "relatively few scientists who are as skeptical of the whole thing as Dick is." Many more, said Dr. Wallace, take the question of climate change seriously but think that assertions of climate change already in progress have been exaggerated, as he does.
The object of the conflicting opinions was born in Webster, Mass., in 1940, after his parents fled Hitler's Germany. His shoemaker father later moved the family to the Bronx, where, Dr. Lindzen says, "I think we were the first Jewish family in an Irish-Catholic neighborhood." There he developed a lifelong enthusiasm for amateur radio and won Regents' and National Merit scholarships at the Bronx High School of Science (class of 1956). He also acquired the middle-class native New Yorker's hardened "G" (as in Lon-GIH-land) that faintly modifies his otherwise straightforward academic accent today.
The scholarships propelled him as a student first to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and then to Harvard University, where he was attracted by classical physics, and then atmospheric physics. By his mid-30's he had produced landmark work in atmospheric dynamics, mainly involving "tides," or regular changes in atmospheric pressure, and the periodic shift in direction of high-level equatorial winds that affect global circulation patterns. After various academic posts, he joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1983, where he is the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology.
In recent years, while pursuing his main interest of atmospheric dynamics in trying to help "figure out how climate works," he has leveled a variety of criticisms at the idea of serious climatic change, some with telling effect. For instance, he points out, the computer models do not reflect the climate's natural variability very well -- a key shortcoming in trying to gauge the human effect on climate, one that is readily conceded by the modelers.
But the Lindzen idea that has attracted most attention is based on a fundamental point of physics: that carbon dioxide and the other waste gases generate only a small amount of warming. Something has to amplify that warming for the larger amount of warming predicted by the United Nations panel to materialize. The main candidate, whose presumed amplifying effect is built into the computer models, is water vapor -- also a heat-trapping gas, and the most powerful one since there is so much of it and it is so pervasive. The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, thereby increasing the warming even more. Without this amplification, Dr. Lindzen argues, the average global temperature will rise by only about a degree Fahrenheit if atmospheric carbon dioxide is doubled.
"With all due respect to alarmism," he says, "I don't think anyone has argued that's going to be a major change in life as we know it."
The amount of warming produced by the doubling of carbon dioxide has become a standard measure of the climate system's sensitivity to change; the United Nations panel figures it at 3 to 8 degrees. But Dr. Lindzen argues that the models which produced those numbers do not properly reflect the physics of the water vapor question. While it is well known that warmer air generally holds more vapor, he says, "we don't know what determines upper level water vapor," a factor he says is crucial, and central to the predictions of future climate change. He has postulated over the years a number of possible atmospheric mechanisms that might nullify the supposed greenhouse amplification. It was Dr. Lindzen himself who later found the first of these possible mechanisms to be trivial in its effect, but he has advanced others.
Modelers, who insist that the amplifying effect of water vapor is supported by real-world data, sharply dispute Dr. Lindzen on this point and say he has no evidence to prove his nullification hypothesis. But other atmospheric scientists say the issue is not yet resolved. "To be fair," Dr. Lindzen says, "the answer at this stage is that we don't know" what the vapor effect is. And in fact, some important aspects of the issue are left uncertain in the United Nations panel's report.
In the meantime, he is exploring other ways to test the climate's sensitivity to change. One avenue involves volcanic eruptions. If the climate is not very sensitive, Dr. Lindzen says, the cooling effect produced by the haze from eruptions should dissipate quickly; if it is very sensitive, the effect should linger. So far, he says, it appears that the volcanoes are indicating low sensitivity -- bolstering, if he is right, his over-all argument about warming.
To some critics, Dr. Lindzen's confidence about the climate's low sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions embodies more certitude than the facts allow. "I don't know what line from God he has," says Dr. Stephen Schneider of Stanford University, who cites what he sees as the overprecise estimate Dr. Lindzen gives.
Dr. Lindzen replies that he at least gives some reasons for his estimate rather than simply following a "herd instinct" that he says is very common in science. All in all, he says, "I don't think we've made the case yet" that serious climate change is in prospect, and he therefore sees no cause to worry now. To Dr. Mahlman, Dr. Lindzen is saying, "we don't know nearly as much as we need to know, therefore we shouldn't have any concern." This view, Dr. Mahlman asserts, is "deeply fallacious."
Dr. Lindzen traces his decision to begin voicing his doubts to a speaking engagement at Tufts University in the spring of 1989. After he stated his case, he recalled: "One person after another got up, saying scientists can have their doubts but we don't have any. I developed this awful feeling that here was an issue that was running away, developing a reality that transcended the science."
He says he prizes the environment, but that global warming and other issues have prompted environmental groups to go "off the deep end" and produce "a drum roll that gets rid of perspective." One consequence, he says, is that "if you are questioning the basis of global warming, you are definitely treated as someone who hates the earth -- and that's a little bit odd, because it is, after all, a scientific question."
Dr. Lindzen has always been a Democrat, too, but he says the global warming controversy has caused him to change parties. The notion that "extremely weak science" could set into motion policies with long-term implications for the economy made him "queasy" about governmental action, he said. In the academic community, he volunteers, laughing, his turn to the Republicans "must have been like coming out as a gay 25 years ago."
In 5 or 10 years, Dr. Lindzen says, direct observations of the climate's behavior might well make it clearer who is right in the greenhouse debate. Could he turn out to be wrong when all is said and done?
"I think it's unlikely," he said, "but it can happen."

Fe, Fi, Fo, Whoa! The Inner Giant Has Taken Over.

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:

THE SIBLING SOCIETY
By Robert Bly
319 pages. Addison-Wesley. $25.
 As you can discover in any chapter of Robert Bly's new jeremiad, he is outraged by a society in which children grow up without fathers and with rotten schools, their brains stupefied by television, their imaginations squelched by computers, their sensibilities coarsened by rock music and exploitative movies, their dreams corrupted by advertising. Instead of growing into maturity with the help of older mentors who can pass along the experience of generations, they remain in a state of perpetual adolescence: selfish, acquisitive, spiritually flattened, dangerous. Welcome to "The Sibling Society."
The indictment, less original than the label, is a cousin to "Iron John," Mr. Bly's best seller, which generated a sort of men's movement in America. Here again, he draws on myth, religion, fairy tales, poems and even science of sorts for evidence of the wisdom that he argues has been discarded by a society that disdains the past. To borrow his language, we now live laterally, keeping an envious eye on one another, rather than vertically, in the glow of wise authority. 
 The book begins with an elaborate exegesis of "Jack and the Beanstalk," especially the nature of the Giant whom Mr. Bly likens to the primitive human brain, to the nafs, which, he reports, is the ever-demanding soul of Muslim and Sufi tradition, and to the Freudian id, all of which keep human beings in perpetual battle to satisfy insatiable appetites. As for Jack, he "represents all men and women who live in a fatherless and, increasingly, motherless society."
Mr. Bly is an accomplished storyteller, and his affection for the tales of many peoples over many centuries can be catching. But when it comes to the contemporary condition, his propheteering arias seem as out of control as the nafs: "The teen-agers in our inner cities are expressing the presence of the Giant, who is fundamentally opposed to life. He is the one who stabs people in the library and eats children." And beware: "We don't realize that when we put a computer or television in a child's own room, we are sending that child to be alone with the Giant."
Before you know it, Mr. Bly is attributing the growth of armed militias, unemployment and all manner of other ailments to siblingitis. For him, politics is psychology; he finds the roots of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the opposition to affirmative action in societal dysfunction.
Some of the presumable facts he tosses in as evidence of the national disarray are risible. Lamenting the flat language bred by television, he writes: "A poll a few years ago revealed that the average American father talked to his child for about 10 minutes a day. We know by contrast that in certain parts of Russia, earlier in the century, the Russian father spent more like two hours engaging in such talk. Russians have a word for 'soul-talk,' and it wasn't unusual for a grandfather to say to a granddaughter, 'Let's go out by the tree and have some soul-talk.' "
And he combines a vacuum-cleaner approach to the world's problems with a salesman's bent for wildly disproportionate comparisons. After lumping together the slaughters in Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia and Cambodia as expressions of siblingdom triumphant, he adds, "Our sibling society came into existence by different means, but there is a comparable elimination of elders, accompanied by increasing anger on the part of youth."
Toward the end of his new book, Mr. Bly complains that most reviewers, trapped in "the flat, literal or sociological mode in which there is only one world," treated "Iron John" in a simplistic way. But the notable thing about his first book of prose was its success. With help from a Bill Moyers interview on PBS, it stayed on the best-seller list of The New York Times for more than a year, several weeks as No. 1. It was like a second coming of Joseph Campbell. As for reviews, most of those I have read swallowed the whole thing.
Credit for that success must go largely to Mr. Bly's enthusiasm for myth, his talent as a storyteller and the fact that he was onto a serious subject, the pathology of sons without fathers. It also offered the novelty of a men's movement as a sort of counter to or sibling of the women's movement and the promise of self-improvement cultivated by public broadcasting.
"The Sibling Society" has some of the same appeals. It should also please liberals. Noting that "our first thoroughly sibling Congress" is not about to "defend children, nor wetlands, nor blacks, nor women, nor full-growth forests, nor the Alaska wilderness," he concludes, "Some sibling meanness has interrupted the understanding people had in the 1960's that we are all related." Was that really "the understanding" in the 1960's?
If I cannot rouse more enthusiasm for "The Sibling Society," it may be because grandpa never took me out by the tree for some soul-talk. That is probably why I do not share the author's admiration for such hierarchical or God-directed communities as medieval monasteries, mistrust his treatment of history and find his rhapsodies to supposedly more spiritual cultures a touch smoky. ("Native Americans felt horror that white people would take peyote with no elders present, no one to clear the air or protect the souls from invasions by those spirits who do not wish us well.") And generally, the use of myth to make points in political argument strikes me as no favor either to myth or to politics.
The book ends with a charming telling of a great story from Sweden, the "Lind Wurm": When the queen is delivered of a tiny snake, as her first offspring, the midwife throws it out the window, with momentous consequences. Typically, Mr. Bly reduces a rich tale to fit his by now predictable litany: "Because of 'downsizing,' parental neglect and bad schools, almost every member of Generation X, or the Day-Care Generation, feels thrown out the window."
No, don't throw his book out the window. At least read the fairy tales. "The Sibling Society" is by turns engaging and exasperating, suggestive and tendentious, a mix of imagination, scholarship and remarkable silliness. Although he announces, in his take-no-prisoners way, "Television is the thalidomide of the 1990's," I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Bly showed up on PBS again soon.

HEADLINE: A New View On Training Food Experts

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
FOR years, the study of food, often narrowly defined as home economics, has been something of a backwater.
That may change this fall when, for the first time, all aspects of food -- from esthetics to dietetics, from anthropology to food policy -- will be gathered into a single program at New York University. It is an opportunity for the study of food to achieve the recognition it has always lacked in the academic community. 
 "Food has never been trivial, but it has been treated as trivial," said Dr. Amy Bentley, a food historian at the University of Colorado, who will run the undergraduate part of the N.Y.U. program. "Food is an emerging field in the humanities. Food was undeveloped because traditionally it was a domestic thing. History was about wars. Food now is seen as a way to study history."
For the first time, dietitians will have to learn about taste and pleasure, and chefs will have to learn about arteries and saturated fat. Bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees will be offered in food studies. Undergraduates, who will be required to take half of their credits in the liberal arts, will study nutrition, restaurant management, food science, and food and society. Electives will include food photography, Chinese cuisine and catering.
The program was put together by Dr. Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at N.Y.U. "Food is such an important part of society, social life, culture and history," she said. "Home economics has always had a second-class reputation, largely because it was a woman's field, but it was the only option available to women interested in science. All that has now changed."
Julia Child, who has often referred to dietitians as nutritional terrorists, is delighted. "If one can major in photography, the dance, physical education, medicine and architecture, one should certainly be offered the same opportunities in food," she said. "For years, anything to do with food was considered purely artisanal. However, during the last 20 years or so it is being recognized as a real and important part of culture in general, involving not only the culinary arts, but sociology, economics and history. The vast subject of human nutrition alone gives it a very real and vital importance in our world today."
"Besides," she added, "you can eat your work."
Dr. Nestle said a number of chefs had already applied to the school to earn a master's degree. "We are designing just exactly the program we all wish we could have taken," she added.
The idea for the food-studies program has been marinating for a number of years. Dr. Nestle was one of the first scientists to reach across the great divide that separates nutritionists, culinarians and cultural historians. She has a doctorate in molecular biology and a master's in pubic health and was once an associate dean at the University of California School of Medicine and later the managing editor of the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health.
A frequent participant in conferences run by Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, a culinary organization that brings together historians, anthropologists and chefs, Dr. Nestle has had lots of opportunities to talk with people who look at food in different ways: as a pleasurable phenomenon (chefs and food writers) and from a historical and cultural perspective (academicians). "I realized how interesting food was as a way to look at society, economics and industry," she said. "And I realized you didn't have to have two completely separate cuisines: one that tasted good and the other that was healthy."
But it was Dr. Nestle's chance meeting with Clark Wolf, a food consultant in New York, that crystallized her experiences. On a 70-block walk from the Upper East Side to Greenwich Village about a year ago, they began to plot. Both agreed the time was ripe to go beyond occasional meetings of the various food factions. Dr. Nestle asked Mr. Wolf to be the chairman of the Food Studies' Advisory Committee, which helped determine what areas of study should be offered.
"It took me 15 years to learn these things on my own," said Mr. Wolf, who started out as food retailer. "In the food-studies program you are having them handed to you on a silver platter."
In most colleges and universities, these elements are not tied together, although they might be available. It would be possible for a student at Cornell University, for example, to search out the courses in various departments and put together such a program. At the Culinary Institute of America, similar courses are offered, but the emphasis is on cooking. At Boston University there is a master's program in gastronomy, but it has no cooking component.
Not everyone is as excited about the food-studies program as Dr. Nestle or Mrs. Child. Although she praises the program's concept, Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., often described as the mother of modern American cooking, is disappointed with what she sees as a serious gap. "The program needs real emphasis on the agriculture side," she said. "The students should have to go out and grow tomatoes and harvest potatoes."
Dr. Joan Gussow, professor emerita of nutrition at Teachers College at Columbia University, who has emphasized the connection between what people eat, who they are and how they treat their environment, said that she wished she could have taught interdisciplinary courses but that food had generally been viewed in a much more segmented way.
"My biggest misgiving is about jobs," she said. "At this time, education is training: you teach what the market wants."
A similar concern was raised by Dr. John Sutthie, a professor of biochemistry and nutritional sciences at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. While acknowledging that nutrition scientists lack an appreciation of the importance of the taste of food, he said: "It's difficult for me to get enthused about the program. Interdisciplinary is a big buzzword among administrators, and the people who are trained that way are trained to do nothing."
In setting up the program, Dr. Nestle and her advisory committee compiled a list of entry-level jobs that might be available to a graduate with a degree in food studies. They include food writer, stylist or photographer; caterer or cook; research assistant or test-kitchen assistant; food consultant, product developer and broker, and food and beverage assistant.
But will this make people eat better? "It's a great idea for the next generation of food people to be more responsible," said Paula Wolfert, the cookbook author. But she doubts that even better-educated professionals will make the public more aware of food's complex contributions to culture, society and personal nutrition. "I don't think it will make that much difference. Nothing has so far. Most of the country doesn't pay any attention. I don't know how to change it, but I don't think a course at N.Y.U. is going to make any difference."
Others believe the time has come for the creation of such a program. Dr. Harvey Levenstein, a professor of history at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, whose speciality is food history, said that training is often too narrow.
"People who do the science of food have a tendency to ignore the sociological context," he said. "They downplay the kinds of things that can't be measured and shortchange the importance of nonmeasurable factors in human food like choice and taste. And the people involved in the preparation and selling of food tend to be ignorant of and downplay the health and scientific aspects. It's not a bad thing to get them together, along with historians. It's a step in the right direction."
Dr. Adam Drewnowski, the director of the human nutrition program at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where epidemiology has been emphasized, said it was time for people to understand all facets of food.
"In the past we've dealt with food as fuel, and we should be dealing with it as our connection to culture and to land," he said. "The interaction between anthropologists, archeologists and nutritionists is finding a home. Nutrition has become respectable because it is a major tool of chronic-disease prevention. But the issue of pleasure and enjoyment has been very much understudied. A good diet needs to do wonders for physical health and mental health."

HEADLINE: New Windows on a New World;
A Jazzy Decor for Dining in the Sky

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
CAN a meteor, once it hits the ground, soar again? That is the question posed by the reopening of Windows on the World next week, as the restaurant that became the emblem of New York City's revival in the late 1970's, and then went into decline itself, tries to take off all over again.
This time it is costing $25 million, not the $7.5 million it took to do Windows the first time. That is a lot of money, considering that the site is the same, the 107th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center, and much of the infrastructure, like parts of the kitchens and bathrooms, has been carried over from the original Windows. But almost everything the public will see now is completely new and different in myriad ways from what was created in 1976, when the first Windows on the World brought its sleek, glitzy presence to the top of the trade center. 
 The success of that restaurant, opening at the top of New York's most disliked building toward the end of one of the city's most painful recessions, stunned everyone except its creator, Joseph Baum. But when Windows became both a mega-tourist attraction and a destination for New Yorkers who rarely ventured below 14th Street, it seemed to symbolize the change in the city's fortunes.
But as things turned upward for New York in the 1980's, they declined for Windows, which faded as Mr. Baum moved on to other projects, like his restaurant Aurora and his restoration of the Rainbow Room atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza. After the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the building's owner, chose to invite proposals for the restaurant's renovation, rather than reopen it along with the rest of the building. Numerous restaurateurs competed, but Mr. Baum and his associates, David Emil, Michael Whiteman and Dennis Sweeney, won the Port Authority's heart with a promise to create something that would be as much a badge of the 1990's as the original Windows had been to the 1970's. At first, the intention was to re-use as much as possible of the original design. Then the discovery of asbestos, not to mention the gradually inflating ambitions that also affect every homeowner who has ever renovated so much as a kitchen, turned the project into an all-but-new restaurant.
And that is the sumptuous, jazzy and yet relaxed Windows that will open to the public next week. It was designed by Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, the same architect who restored the Rainbow Room in 1987, but this project was more daunting: Windows, which includes a main dining room, a huge bar, reception areas and private banquet rooms on the 106th and 107th floors, not only is vastly bigger than the Rainbow Room, but also has nothing like the admired Art Deco details that provided the architect with a starting point for that design. The banal World Trade Center offers only views, not architecture, and as for Warren Platner's original Windows design, it seemed neither fresh enough to provide direct inspiration nor strong enough to be the stuff of historic preservation.
It did, however, offer a general layout that Mr. Hardy retained: the main dining room, reduced from 250 to 240 seats, fills the northeast corner, with a view to the midtown skyline; a huge bar occupies the southeast corner, and private banquet rooms are strung along the west. The theme of the new design, if there is one, is a kind of generalized fantasy about dining in the sky, which in Mr. Hardy's hands translates into an architectural riff about cities, about urban energy, about the pleasures of texture and color and light, and about recollections of American design from the 1950's and 1960's.
Not that the new Windows is a period piece; far from it. But there is a certain slightly arch tone of homage to the 1950's in some details, like furniture in the bar that recalls the work of the designer Vladimir Kagan and the swooping forms of the green and natural-stain wood veneer and undulating ceilings in the 107th floor banquet areas: the 50's rendered a bit thinner, a bit sleeker and more nimble, as if they had been boiled down to their purest essence.
This is not classical elegance, and it is not Art Moderne or modern or much of anything else easily characterized. The new Windows on the World is a kind of architectural jazz, full of syncopation, its essence a series of allusions to design themes that are played out in a lighthearted yet never too whimsical way: swoops and curves and angular, origami-like surfaces; striped multicolor fabrics on the walls and carpets, with patterns imprinting the street plan of world cities. None of it would seem to work together, but by and large it does, in part because the colors are almost invariably soft and easy, and the juxtapositions subtle and painstakingly wrought.
The bland architecture of the trade center, not grand luxe and not even good modernism, still creates a dull first impression (there is not even a sign outside with the designer Milton Glaser's stunning logo). It gets better off the express elevators at the 107th floor, where visitors tumble out into a lobby that hides the view (deliberately, since on this huge floor the windows are just too far away from the elevators) and sets the tone of fantasy with a huge mural of floating clouds by Mr. Glaser. The mural is duplicated in a layer of glass beads that hang before it, and changing lights allow the mood to shift from crisp to feathery soft.
If the whole place is a kind of jazz symphony, the bar is where Mr. Hardy becomes the most syncopated. Different both conceptually and architecturally from what was at Windows before, it is a sprawling, informal mix of alcoves, banquettes, bars, platforms, nooks, dance floors and performance areas, immodestly named the Greatest Bar on Earth. The furniture, designed by Mr. Hardy (which I saw before it was placed in the space), is colorful, quirky and comfortable, and the space is designed to be part discotheque, part piano bar and part informal dining area, casually sliding during the evening from one identity to another.
If Windows on the World came to be known, particularly in its later years, as a place populated largely by tourists who came for the view, this room is intended as an attempt to bring back the locals. It's not exactly the TriBeCa Grill, but in its somewhat self-conscious casualness it is a lot more downtown in feeling than anything else that has ever been on the 107th floor.
The main dining room is more august, more formal, than the bar, and yet calmer and more relaxed than it was in Mr. Platner's day. Hugh Hardy has made a room that is grand and surprisingly sensuous, with soft textures and just the right amount of whimsy. The colors (but for a wonderful green carpet) are relatively calm, almost neutral, deferring to the extraordinary view, to the intense yellow and blue of Milton Glaser's gloriously spirited plates and to the colors of flowers, food and people that will occupy the tables.
Yet, this is hardly a plain design: there are sections of the ceiling that are folded in and out like origami or twisted versions of geodesic domes; frequent level changes break up the space and increase a sense of closeness to the views. But the overall feeling is one of ease, space and softness without much hauteur.
The ceilings and the floor coverings -- and the furniture -- are invariably the most striking things here: the walls are there for the views. If anything, Mr. Hardy has worked to bring people even closer to the views, removing brass rails near the windows and the pointless half-round columns that Mr. Platner inserted in the mullions between windows in the hope that they would soften the room. There is less effort to deny the architecture of the trade center than there was in 1976 -- a sense that these 20 years have made for some mellowing, and a willingness to go with this foolish building, rather than against it.
And the view itself -- this, too, has mellowed after 20 years. It has changed considerably, growing denser in these two decades; when the first Windows on the World opened, there was no Battery Park City, no World Financial Center, no midtown made more crowded by 1980's overbuilding. There is more to see out these windows now.
But the really striking thing is how this view no longer startles in the same way. When the first Windows was new, it felt like looking at the city from an airplane, almost too high to be real, and you could not take your face away from the glass. Now, this view has been around a while, and the great joy of this new restaurant is not just to look outside, but to turn back inside and take pleasure in the comfort of what has been designed within.
 
Time for a $19.96 Lunch
 
NY96, the summer restaurant promotion, starts Friday and Saturday, with 232 restaurants around New York City serving small plates of food for $3 to $5 each to benefit hunger relief programs run by City Harvest and Citymeals-on-Wheels.
The weekend events will be followed by Restaurant Week, which officially starts Monday and will run through June 30. Restaurants will offer prix-fixe lunches for $19.96, plus beverages, tax and gratuities.
Despite the promotional hoopla, including a tower of 4,000 H & H bagels to be built Friday at Wall and Broad Streets, 50 fewer restaurants will participate Friday and Saturday. And Restaurant Week, which grew from 25 participants in 1992, the year it began, to 125 last year, will have 106 this year.
"I don't get a feeling it has become less popular," said Alan Stillman, who is a member of the event's steering committee, with Joseph Baum and Danny Meyer, restaurateurs, and Tim Zagat, the restaurant guide publisher. "From the standpoint of public perception, I think it has grown. Perhaps more restaurants are doing well and don't feel they need to join the program."
Each restaurant pays $1,500 to participate. Some restaurants are offering $19.96 lunches without joining the promotion.
Though it began as a benefit for visitors to the city during the Democratic National Convention in 1992, New Yorkers, not tourists, are the ones who have taken advantage of the bargain meals.
The majority of participating restaurants plan to continue serving three-course prix-fixe lunches through Labor Day. At some the lunch promotion is available all year.
A list of the restaurants may be had by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to N.Y.C. Restaurants, New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, 2 Columbus Circle, New York 10019. They can also be picked up at the bureau.

HEADLINE: Security Myth Surrounds F.B.I. and Its Files

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is legitimate to question whether the White House had a proper purpose in asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation for several hundred investigative files (editorial, June 17), but the case raises other basic questions, too.
 Should the F.B.I. be in the business of personnel investigations in the first place? It conducts these inquiries (as distinguished from criminal investigations) in numerous contexts for various agencies. It would make sense to turn them over to the Office of Personnel Management, which now conducts many security-type investigations of civilian agency personnel. 
 Of course, any investigation that developed information relating to criminal or subversive activity would be referred to the F.B.I. But the aura and mythology surrounding the bureau and its files evoke a much more hysterical and emotional reaction than would be the case if the files were developed by another agency. And decoupling personnel investigations from the F.B.I.'s high-profile law enforcement functions would allow more proportionate public consideration of episodes like the White House affair.
How useful are the personnel checks anyway? Are they worth the many hundreds of millions of dollars we spend on the investigations, the evaluations, the supporting personnel and the complex procedures for their care and feeding?
Thirty years ago, I did a study of the Atomic Energy Commission's vaunted Q-clearance program, which looked for such information as subversive propensities as well as drug or alcohol abuse, poor credit and, in those days, homosexual conduct or tendencies. Of the 717,000 full field investigations, mostly by the F.B.I., for Q-clearance from 1947 to 1963, incredibly only about 1 percent yielded any significant derogatory information at all.
My figures have never been challenged and, to the best of my knowledge, no one has produced more recent data. But even the most thorough F.B.I. investigation can't dredge up more than a small fraction of the individual's background. Even if it weeds out relatively few people, the system creates a false sense of security if it leads us to believe all is well because the Government has hired, or given White House passes to, only those who are certifiably pure based on F.B.I. inquiry.
It is the very existence of millions of dossiers in the F.B.I.'s hands that is the real threat. The utility of the routine investigations that produce these dossiers, especially in light of the end of the cold war, should be reconsidered. We should use the current episode to pierce the mythology of security and take a realistic view of what we need and how we can get it effectively, economically and efficiently.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Pain Relief Is a Medical and Political Issue

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 18

 BODY:
Everyone in the building knew that the old woman in the first-floor apartment was suffering unspeakable pain. Her screams echoed through the lobby day and night.
The woman, Maria Teresa Nogueda de Acevedo, was dying of lung cancer. The strongest pain killer she could get, Demerol, reduced the awful hurt for a few hours, but when the drug wore off, the pain flooded back. A doctor recommended morphine, but in Mexico it was almost impossible to get. 
 A woman who lived on the eighth floor of the building, a local radio journalist, was so shaken by the screams that she called the Mexican Secretary of Health and demanded he do something. She nagged him on her daily radio program. Finally, the official allowed Mrs. Nogueda's family to bring in morphine from the United States.
She died peacefully a few days later.
That was in August 1990. And even though the Government signed an international agreement to make morphine widely available for medical uses the month before Mrs. Nogueda died, most cancer patients in Mexico except the rich and the well-connected still cannot get the drug, which the World Health Organization has recognized as essential for alleviating chronic pain.
In the West in recent years, doctors have increasingly recognized the importance of aggressively treating pain as part of medical care, and that even powerful narcotics like morphine do not cause long-term addiction problems in most patients.
But in Mexico and many other parts of Latin America, unfounded fears of addiction and the inadequate training of young doctors about medical uses of morphine have meant that it is not readily available, leaving thousands of people to suffer needlessly. Although morphine is not considered expensive, it is used so sparingly in Mexico and the rest of Latin America that the region accounts for only about 1 percent of all the morphine consumed in the world.
There is another important factor limiting the medical use of powerful drugs in Mexico: the worry here that the United States will oppose any attempt to increase the availablility of morphine because it could find its way into the illicit market.
That fear, justified or not, has made Mexican regulators sensitive to signals from Washington about the use of morphine. One doctor even charges that the United States Drug Enforcement Administration has interfered in legitimate drug shipments to Mexico.
Dr. Juan Ignacio Romero, who headed the World Health Organization's Cancer Pain Relief Program in Mexico from 1988 to 1990, said that in 1988, the D.E.A. scuttled a plan to import about 10,000 tablets of a narcotic called Dilaudid. The drug, like morphine, is made from the gum of opium poppies.
"They were afraid we would not be able to control the morphine and that it would end up on the black market in the United States," Dr. Romero said. "That's an insult."
No one at the American drug agency could remember the incident, D.E.A. officials said.
Eventually Dr. Romero, with the help of the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, managed to import about 20 pounds of morphine -- enough for about 650,000 morphine tablets. That represented practically all the morphine used in Mexico from 1987 to 1995.
Current regulations on the use and distribution of narcotics are so restrictive that even Dr. Francisco Higuera, the Mexican Government's chief medical regulator, acknowledges that the system forces most doctors to use Demerol and other pain killers that are less effective than morphine but easier to get.
No matter where they practice, doctors have to come to Mexico City to get special prescription booklets to prescribe morphine. The maximum allowable dosage is usually less than what patients need, and the process has to be repeated every month.
If a patient manages to get a prescription, having it filled is nearly impossible. Most pharmacies do not have the security measures or the university-trained pharmacist that the Government requires.
The National Cancer Institute is almost alone in regularly administering morphine, but most Mexicans outside the largest cities do not have access to the institute's programs. And some here fear that the problem goes unresolved because well-connected people who would have the power to demand change simply fly to Houston for medical attention.
Morphine first came to Mexico in a substantial way during World War II, when the United States encouraged the growth of opium poppies to replace Asian sources shut off by the war. Traffickers still clandestinely cultivate poppy plantations, especially in the states of Guerrero and Chihuahua, where local Indians are enticed or forced to enter the trade.
Scientific studies in the 1940's and 1950's suggested that the medical use of morphine could lead to addiction. But later studies have uniformly shown that the chance of addiction is minuscule, and that the good derived from easing a patient's pain can far outweigh the risk.
Nonetheless, Helen Carvell, a nurse investigator at the National Cancer Institute, said she had given a speech on pain relief at a symposium in December and asked which of the 100 Mexican doctors there had ever prescribed morphine.
Not one hand went up.
"Part of the problem here is the myth," Mrs. Carvell said. "It says that if you are anywhere near the smell of narcotics and something goes wrong, you'll end up in jail."
Dr. Charles Cleeland, director of the Pain Research Group at the University of Wisconsin Medical School and an ardent supporter of the use of morphine for pain, said many American drug companies refused to export morphine to countries like Mexico because they fear it will be diverted to illegal street use.
In December, Mexico finally certified one laboratory, Technofarma, to produce a morphine tablet. Camerino Figueroa Lara, director of sales for Technofarma, said the Mexico City company could produce enough tablets to meet national demand.
But he would not say how many tablets were being sold.
Health officials say they are considering ways to ease restrictions and make morphine more widely available. That could go a long way toward fulfilling the agreement Mexico signed in 1990, but Dr. Silvia Allende Perez, director of the pain clinic at the National Cancer Institute, doubts that the Government has the will to make such changes.
"Countries like Spain and Japan have increased their use of medicinal morphine without any increase in illicit use, and Mexico could do the same," Dr. Allende Perez said. Even Colombia has managed to make morphine more available in recent years without any noticeable change in illicit use.
"But Mexican bureaucrats would rather just restrict the use of morphine altogether and avoid problems," she said. "That means that as always, it is the patients who need the drug who have to be sacrificed."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin's Edge: Fear of the Past

BYLINE: By Richard Pipes; Richard Pipes, professor emeritus of history at Harvard, is the author of "A Concise History of the Russian Revolution."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The world can sigh in relief. Sunday's Russian elections did not reproduce the experience of December 1993, when the party of the chauvinist and anti-Semite Vladimir Zhirinovsky received the largest number of votes for parliament, nor that of December 1995, when the Communists won a plurality. This time, Boris Yeltsin outmaneuvered his opponents.
Employing modern campaign techniques and making the most of his control of television, Mr. Yeltsin succeeded in gaining a slender but incontestable edge. He skillfully confronted voters with a stark alternative: either a return to the past or progress toward the future. 
 As a Russian friend of mine put it, the contest was not over personalities or programs. It was a clash of two emotions: fear and hatred -- fear of losing freedom and hatred of the West. As of now, it appears that fear, and hope, have prevailed.
Mr. Yeltsin's victory was in good measure the result of divisions within the Communist camp. The hard core of the Communist Party is made up of unregenerate Leninist-Stalinists who will be satisfied with nothing less than a return to the old ways in both domestic and foreign policy. Judging by some of his pronouncements, its leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, apparently shares this vision. But aware that a reactionary platform would alienate many voters, he formulated a more moderate program, modeled on Western social democracy.
Mr. Zyuganov's agenda might have enabled him to defeat Mr. Yeltsin had it not been sabotaged by Communist hard-liners who, confident of victory, dismissed it as the party's "program minimum," a cover for its true long-term objective, the "program maximum," restoring full-fledged Communism.
Undoubtedly, the voters' reasonable suspicion that it was the hard-liners who articulated the real goals of the party caused mass defections to Mr. Yeltsin and the dark horse candidate, retired Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, who came out of nowhere to win half as many votes as each of the two leading contenders.
Mr. Lebed, who quit the armed forces a year ago with a reputation of a tough nationalist, shifted toward a more centrist position. He now stresses the need to restore law and order, a very popular slogan. He scorns Communism and supports small private enterprise.
His strength, however, lies not in the promises he makes but in the personal image he projects, which is that of a doer, not a talker. The very act of speaking appears painful to him, since the movement of his lips is unaccompanied by any changes in the facial muscles.
In his new capacity as head of Mr. Yeltsin's Security Council (which deals with both foreign and domestic issues), he will be in a position to tackle bureaucratization, corruption and crime, the prevalence of which in post-Communist Russia has done a great deal to discredit both democracy and capitalism.
He is superbly positioned to step forward as Mr. Yeltsin's replacement should the President, for reasons of health, find himself unable to carry out his duties. Mr. Lebed represents for some Russians a version of Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile, who combined harsh political authority with economic liberalism and a certain measure of intellectual freedom. Mr. Lebed himself has referred to General Pinochet with admiration.
It is likely that Mr. Yeltsin will carry the day in the runoff election because he should be able to attract the votes cast for other pro-reform candidates as well as much of the Lebed constituency, whereas Mr. Zyuganov can at best attract the rather insignificant Zhirinovsky vote. It matters a great deal that Mr. Yeltsin not only win in July but that he win with a solid majority. If his margin is narrow, he will have to shift still further to the right, slowing economic and legal reforms and assuming a defiant attitude toward the West.
But even as one feels relief that Russians have moved away from the extremists, there is cause for worry. Russia appears fairly evenly split between two groups that have little in common and therefore will have difficulty developing a viable political system. One group, with a preponderance of the aged and the less skilled, including a high proportion of farmers, sees democracy as synonymous with crime and capitalism as merely a license to rob the poor. The other, younger, better educated voters like the opportunities that democracy and capitalism provide. The former yearn, first and foremost, for security; the latter are prepared to forgo security for the chance to better themselves.
Moreover, the Communists and nationalists are determined to bring the former Soviet republics back into the fold by force, while the democratic coalition, although not entirely free of nostalgia for the imperial past, is unwilling to jeopardize Russia's reconstruction and foreign connections for the sake of territorial aggrandizement. The differences bode ill for democracy, which requires the voters to share certain basic values. Mr. Yeltsin's alliance with Mr. Lebed may be interpreted as an effort to bridge the gap.
Viewed in broad perspective, Russia seems to be moving toward a fusion of liberalism and conservatism. We cannot tell at this time whether such an uneasy ideological pairing will last.
Personalities, too, are likely to play a part. As Mr. Lebed's handling of some officers' opposition to the dismissal of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has shown, he is not a man to take the back seat or to show sensitivity for those who disagree with him.
But as of now, the cause of democracy appears strengthened, and the prospects for a restoration of Communism dimmer than ever.

HEADLINE: Something Must Be Done

BYLINE: By Richard C. Leone; Richard C. Leone is the president of the Twentieth Century Fund.

 BODY:
Confused? You are not alone. Here's what the experts (sometimes the same one) think.
We must have 6 percent or so unemployment to avoid high inflation, but everyone should be required to work, especially welfare recipients and, soon, people over 65. 
 The rich need more money to encourage them to work harder (as in lower capital gains taxes), but the poor need less (as in a lower earned income tax credit).
We must reduce the trade deficit but also cut the gas tax, thus encouraging consumption of the single largest American import.
The nation had very high rates of growth and savings when top tax rates were very high -- more than 90 percent -- but now we have neither because tax rates are too high.
The overwhelming majority of parents think that their public schools do a good job, but we need to dismantle and privatize the system.
The coming election is about the economic fears of middle-class white men, so unless a candidate has a pro-choice position on abortion, he loses.
Social Security, for the first time in history, is accumulating a substantial surplus in its trust fund, but it is on the verge of collapse.
The Federal Aviation Administration should be abolished in the interest of more deregulation, but why isn't it doing more inspections of new low-cost airlines?
White Americans rank first in the world in longevity, knowledge and income; black Americans rank 31st. But we no longer need affirmative action.
China had a $34 billion trade surplus with the United States in 1995, but we should stop nagging Beijing about human rights or it won't trade with us.
The media get everything wrong and are ruining family values. But we're in trouble because nobody reads or watches the news anymore.

HEADLINE: Spared by Washington's Budget Cutting, Research Universities Still Fear the Ax

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
While Congress in recent weeks has spared leading universities from major cuts in Federal financing for research, those institutions say they increasingly fear that the estimated $13 billion a year they receive from the Government will become a target for reductions in the future.
As a result, the universities have been lobbying Congress to protect their financing, while looking for other sources of money and re-examining the scale of their research efforts. 
 In November the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wooed Congress by releasing a study detailing how its research benefited the nation. That study calculated that the licensing of M.I.T. inventions added more than $20 billion and 150,000 jobs to the economy every year.
Harvard University has taken another approach, streamlining the administration of its research operations, while seeking more support from industry and foundations.
University leaders say the private sector is no substitute for Federal support. Although a few relatively small institutions like Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have been extremely successful in attracting corporate sponsors, the giants, like Johns Hopkins University, the nation's largest recipient of Federal financial support, have been much less so.
Despite stepped-up efforts to attract corporate sponsorship throughout the 1990's, Johns Hopkins drew less from that source last year, nearly $13 million, than it received in 1993, when it obtained more than $15 million. Moreover, the annual totals were scarcely a drop in the bucket for Johns Hopkins, which received nearly $1 billion from the Government last year.
Dr. Daniel Nathans, the interim president, said corporate support for research would never significantly replace the loss of Federal money for an institution like Johns Hopkins, because "it is so different in magnitude and is usually limited to developing specific products."
Research budgets at the top 125 universities have grown virtually unchecked since the early 1950's, when the Government began investing heavily in pure research and research with practical applications. Both categories have generated undoubted, and sometimes unimagined, benefits.
For example, federally sponsored research on heart valves undertaken as a curiosity at the University of California at Berkeley in the early 1970's, led to the development of the inkjet printer a decade later at the I.B.M. Almaden Research Center in Almaden, Calif.
Federally financed research on data compression at the Lincoln Laboratory of M.I.T. in the early 1950's led to the development of the CD player in the early 1980's.
If the Government cuts support for such research, university leaders fear, the United States could have to rely on other countries for innovations in areas like magnetic fusion, biomedical equipment and electric automobiles.
"I'm very nervous," said Charles Vest, president of M.I.T., who has become the unofficial spokesman for the universities. "It looks as if we've done all right this year. But when Congress tries to balance the budget over the next six or seven years, research is likely to be cut so severely that it may compromise America's competitiveness and position as a world leader in innovation."
The fears have been fueled partly because of the widespread perception that all discretionary spending by Congress will be in jeopardy and partly for philosophical reasons.
At the Senate Republican Conference on Science and Technology in March, Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the subcommittee on military appropriations, told more than 20 university presidents that unless Congress and the Administration reached an agreement to insure long-term annual savings there would be no discretionary spending whatsoever by 2010. That could virtually wipe out Federal support for university-based research, he said.
Other legislators like Representative Robert S. Walker, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Science Committee, want to reduce Federal research grants because they have a philosophical commitment to make private industry assume some burdens from the Federal Government.
"We can't go on as we have been," Mr. Walker said. "I'm very strong on the Government's being a major player in scientific research for defense. But in the future, the private sector must take over applied research and product development. That's not the Government's business."
Earlier this year, Congress was threatening to slash the budgets of the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, which dispense large shares of the Federal money to research institutions. But in January Congressional leaders agreed to increase the 1996 budget of the institutes by 5.7 percent and, more recently, to finance the full budget for the science agency.
Sometimes the expenditures on science and technology are easier to justify than others. For example, Representative John Edward Porter, a Republican from suburban Chicago who heads the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Education, had a relatively easy time securing the 5.7 percent increase for the National Institutes of Health this year.
"All the costs of N.I.H. over its 50-year history were paid for by the health-cost savings of just one of its projects, the development of the Salk vaccine," Mr. Porter said.
On the other hand, Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who heads the House subcommittee responsible for the National Science Foundation budget and is also a strong proponent of research, has a much harder time persuading his colleagues that fields like astrophysics, molecular biology and plasma physics are worthy of public support.
In 1994 the largest recipient of Federal funding was Johns Hopkins with $613 million, followed by the University of Washington with $276 million and M.I.T. with $267 million.
Among the most successful in obtaining corporate assistance has been Carnegie Mellon, which receives $40 million a year, or a quarter of its total research budget, from non-Federal sources. And the amount is growing, said Robert Mehrabian, president of the university.
But some researchers fear that a reliance on sponsorships from highly competitive businesses could inhibit the free exchange of information and weaken support for projects not likely to pay off commercially.
Mr. Mehrabian acknowledged that the proprietary interests of corporate sponsors could conflict with a university's ideals.
"We have to be careful in what we accept," he said. "We wouldn't agree to develop a specific drug for a pharmaceutical company. But if they were interested in the next generation of computing technology to predict the structure of a molecule we could go along with that. In general, we have to work on generic problems."
Ultimately, the solution may lie in the creation of an independent financing agency for science and technology. Senator Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that before he retired at the end of the year he hoped to lead Congress to create a medical research trust fund that would draw on a combination of public and private revenue to give $5 billion a year to the N.I.H. Such a fund could become a model for Federal support for research.
Congressional staff members say the idea, even considering Mr. Hatfield's influence as a committee chairman, is unlikely to be adopted this year. On the other hand a university lobbyist asked, "Do we really have to wait for another Sputnik?"

HEADLINE: Turnaround by the F.A.A.

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration's belated decision to ground Valujet Airlines as a safety hazard amounts to an admission of how wrong-headed the agency had been in its previous efforts to regulate the troubled low-cost airline. Five weeks ago the F.A.A. Administrator, David Hinson, and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena rashly assured the public that Valujet was safe to fly one day after one of its planes crashed in the Florida Everglades. Now they have been forced to acknowledge that Valujet is not up to standards, and Mr. Hinson has acknowledged that the F.A.A.'s inspections were not adequate to assure the airworthiness of Valujet's fleet.
Both Mr. Hinson and Mr. Pena, while maintaining that their earlier statements were based on the best information then available to them, have at last taken the first necessary steps toward mending the F.A.A.'s ways and insuring the safety of the flying public. 
 Even before the May 11 crash the F.A.A. had catalogued a spate of Valujet mishaps, none causing fatalities, that added up to an accident rate well above the industry's average. Federal investigations turned up maintenance and other problems, but the F.A.A. judged them not serious enough to ground the airline. Yet now, over the five weeks since the crash, investigators have exposed maintenance problems so severe that the F.A.A. no longer regards Valujet as safe to fly. The obvious question, which Congress will no doubt pose when it opens hearings next week, is why the pre-crash investigations failed to uncover the severity of the problems.
Mr. Hinson admitted yesterday that F.A.A. inspections do not adequately track carriers that contract out most of their maintenance to outside companies. He pledged to correct the weakness. For his part, Secretary Pena will go to Congress to ask for a change in the F.A.A.'s mission so that it is responsible only for safety and not the economic health of the carriers. This is a crucial reform that will relieve the agency of its divided loyalties between the carriers and the public and increase the credibility of its declarations.
Mr. Hinson also, in effect, dismissed his chief safety official, Anthony Broderick, though Congress may want to check whether Mr. Broderick has been scapegoated to take the heat off the rest of the organization. Congress should also inquire whether, as many outside experts have determined, the F.A.A. needs additional inspectors.
Valujet announced yesterday its intention to return to the air next month. But for that to happen, the F.A.A. must first spruce up its inspection procedures so that unsafe practices never again go undetected or uncorrected.
Last month's crash is still under investigation, and its cause is not yet definitely known. Yet the crash exposed serious problems in both the F.A.A. and Valujet. Yesterday the F.A.A. took the first curative steps. Whether Valujet follows suit will determine whether it ever flies again.

HEADLINE: A Prudent Agreement on Chinese Piracy

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has reasonably withdrawn the threat of trade sanctions against China after Beijing renewed its commitment to stop pirating American copyrighted property. The Chinese have violated similar promises in the past, but it is worth testing their word before acting. A trade war would damage both the American and Chinese economies and poison diplomatic relations.
The Chinese agreed last year to close factories that were illegally knocking off American compact disks, computer software, movies and other copyrighted materials, but after a brief lull the violations resumed. The Administration drew up a list of targets last month for steep tariff hikes if the Chinese did not end the piracy. The threat was justified. The hard-fought political consensus for open trade would not survive if Washington tolerated contempt for fair trade rules. Because China does not belong to the World Trade Organization, the United States could not refer the dispute to an impartial jury. 
 The Administration's strategy has worked so far. Over the past few weeks the Chinese have closed 15 factories turning out illegal compact disks, confiscated machinery, prosecuted scores of individuals and shut distribution centers and theaters showing stolen movies. China also agreed to stop exporting pirated intellectual materials, promised to approve joint ventures to produce music and films and said it would maintain no quotas on imported movies, all steps urged by American entertainment companies. The Administration could not persuade the Chinese to allow American inspectors to monitor C.D. factories, but it did win agreement by China's police to enforce the accord.
The Chinese Government has found it difficult to control illegal factories, some of which are run by high-ranking military officers and other powerful officials. The threat of American sanctions may have bolstered Chinese officials who want to live by the Government's commitments. It makes sense for Mr. Clinton to wait and see which forces within the Chinese Government prevail before launching a trade war.

HEADLINE: Technology Issues Fall, With Dow Off 24.75

BYLINE: By The Associted Press 

 BODY:
Technology shares fell sharply yesterday, leading a nervous market lower, as investors grew concerned about difficult market conditions for high-technology companies.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.75, to 5,628.03. The blue-chip barometer held a slight gain until midafternoon, then trailed lower along with bonds as a weak report on new housing construction failed to calm worries about inflation and interest rates. 
 "The market's wallowing in indecision and lack of conviction and rapidly shifting opinions," said Eric Miller, chief strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in San Francisco.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavy with technology stocks, tumbled 24.56, to 1,183.08, its first close below 1,200 in more than a month. Since setting a record high of 1,249.15 on June 5, the Nasdaq has slid more than 5 percent amid a series of warnings by industry leaders about market pressures squeezing profits. The Nasdaq market has been hurt by a shift in sentiment among individual investors, Mr. Miller said. "There was some suggestion last week that the flow of money into technology sector funds had tailed off," he said.
Broader measures also fell, although not as sharply as the Nasdaq composite.
The Big Board's composite index fell 1.34, to 355.58; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.10, to 662.06, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 1.54, to 588.99.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of 12 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 373.3 million shares as of 4 P.M., up considerably from Monday's sluggish pace.
Bonds initially led stocks higher after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 4.7 percent, to 1.43 million, in May. Many analysts had predicted a drop only to the 1.48-million level.
But by midday, bonds started retreating and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a key determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- rose to 7.10 percent from late Monday's 7.06 percent.
Early last week, the yield jumped to a 13-month high at 7.20 percent in the aftermath of the latest in a series of robust employment reports.
Investors have been concerned about recent indications of rising payroll and wage levels, which could translate into too much consumer demand, pushing up prices. Many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in early July to slow borrowing and spending.
"There's still an ambiguity to these releases," Mr. Miller said in reference to the economic reports. "They haven't had a great consistency." That picture may remain cloudy until the first week of July, when the Fed's policy makers meet and a series of key economic reports will be released, he added.
Among technology stocks on the Nasdaq, Intel slid 1 5/8, to 70 3/8; Cisco Systems fell 1 1/2, to 52 7/8, and Microsoft fell 2 1/4, to 122 3/8. In active Big Board trading, Motorola fell 1 7/8, to 62 3/8; Digital Equipment fell 1 1/2, to 44 1/8; Hewlett-Packard fell 1 3/8, to 97 5/8, and I.B.M. fell 1 1/4, to 101 1/4.
Airline stocks rose on prospects for improved business after the discount competitor Valujet agreed to temporarily halt operations. Federal regulators have made allegations of maintenance deficiencies following last month's deadly crash of a Valujet DC-9 in the Everglades.
ValuJet shares tumbled 3 1/2, to 6 1/2, but competing airlines rose, lifting the Dow Jones transportation index by more than 1 percent. Direct rivals benefited the most from the news, with Delta Air Lines adding 3 3/8, to 83 5/8; USAir gaining 3/4, to 18 3/4, and Southwest Airlines rising 1, to 28 5/8.
Shares of Lattice Semiconductor fell 8 7/8, to 25 3/8, after the company cautioned late Monday that lower prices and overstocked customer inventories were hurting sales of its programmable computer chip products. Lattice said revenue for the three months ending June 29 could be off as much as 10 percent from the $53 million in the prior quarter.
Presstek, a maker of printing technology, saw its stock fall 14, to 56, after it revised its first-quarter earnings downward. Presstek said its independent auditors had changed previous advice related to income tax benefits from the exercise of certain employee stock options.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bonds End Lower After Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday, after failing to hold on to early gains on a housing report that showed unexpected weakness.
A decline in the dollar, higher commodity prices and caution ahead of today's Federal Reserve survey of regional business conditions helped cut short the morning bond rally. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 of a percentage point, to 86 15/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7.10 percent, from 7.06 percent on Monday.
Bonds rallied after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 4.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million units in May. The decline, which erased a gain of 4.6 percent in April, suggested that higher mortgage rates had caught up to the housing sector and was hindering growth.
"Investors have been long awaiting the time they could find corroborating evidence that would support the notion that the current higher rates would lead to slower growth," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
The data heartened market participants, he said, by indicating that it would be just a matter of time before other interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy also begin to show weakness.
Another sign that the economy's strong pace might be slowing a bit was seen in the Johnson Redbook weekly report on retail sales, which showed a 1.3 percent decline for the first two weeks of June.
Mr. Chan said that report, as well as another weekly retail sales survey yesterday -- by the Bank of Tokyo/ Mitsubisi Schroder Wertheim -- indicated that consumption was likely to slow in the second half of the year.
Still, he noted, "one of the reasons why the market has not reacted more positively, is that it is difficult to overcome the considerable amount of cynicism that has built up in the market over the past few months."
Also restraining the market, Mr. Chan said, were comments by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William J. McDonough. Speaking at the Institute of Banking and Financial Service at the College of St. Rose in Albany, Mr. McDonough said, "Consumer price inflation, while up slightly during the first quarter of this year, gives no indication that it will accelerate persistently over the months ahead," Bloomberg Business News reported.
But Mr. McDonough also said that the Fed would remain vigilant on inflation, suggesting to some market participants that one or two instances of weak economic numbers might not be sufficient to put the fear of increased interest rates to rest.
Mr. Chan said, "With comments like these, credit markets are likely to focus from one number to the rest without the luxury of drawing any sustainable comfort from one or two weak economic statistics."
Traders said that despite yesterday's reports there was not much upside expected from today's Federal Reserve survey.

HEADLINE: Thomas Kuhn, 73; Devised Science Paradigm

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Thomas S. Kuhn, whose theory of scientific revolution became a profoundly influential landmark of 20th-century intellectual history, died on Monday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 73.
Robert DiIorio, associate director of the news office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the scholar, who held the title of professor emeritus at M.I.T., had been ill with cancer in recent years. 
 "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," was conceived while Professor Kuhn was a graduate student in theoretical physics and published as a monograph in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science before the University of Chicago Press issued it as a 180-page book in 1962. The work punctured the widely held notion that scientific change was a strictly rational process.
Professor's Kuhn's treatise influenced not only scientists but also economists, historians, sociologists and philosophers, touching off considerable debate. It has sold about one million copies in 16 languages and remains required reading in many basic courses in the history and philosophy of science.
Dr. Kuhn, a professor of philosophy and history of science at M.I.T. from 1979 to 1983 and the Laurence S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy there from 1983 until 1991, was the author or co-author of five books and scores of articles on the philosophy and history of science. But Dr. Kuhn remained best known for "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions."
His thesis was that science was not a steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge. Instead, he wrote, it is "a series of peaceful interludes punctuated by intellectually violent revolutions." And in those revolutions, he wrote, "one conceptual world view is replaced by another."
Thus, Einstein's theory of relativity could challenge Newton's concepts of physics. Lavoisier's discovery of oxygen could sweep away earlier ideas about phlogiston, the imaginary element believed to cause combustion. Galileo's supposed experiments with wood and lead balls dropped from the Leaning Tower of Pisa could banish the Aristotelian theory that bodies fell at a speed proportional to their weight. And Darwin's theory of natural selection could overthrow theories of a world governed by design.
Professor Kuhn argued in the book that the typical scientist was not an objective, free thinker and skeptic. Rather, he was a somewhat conservative individual who accepted what he was taught and applied his knowledge to solving the problems that came before him.
In so doing, Professor Kuhn maintained, these scientists accepted a paradigm, an archetypal solution to a problem, like Ptolemy's theory that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Generally conservative, scientists would tend to solve problems in ways that extended the scope of the paradigm.
In such periods, he maintained, scientists tend to resist research that might signal the development of a new paradigm, like the work of the astronomer Aristarchus, who theorized in the third century B.C. that the planets revolve around the Sun. But, Professor Kuhn said, situations arose that the paradigm could not account for or that contradicted it.
And then, he said, a revolutionary would appear, a Lavoisier or an Einstein, often a young scientist not indoctrinated in the accepted theories, and sweep the old paradigm away.
These revolutions, he said, came only after long periods of tradition-bound normal science. "Frameworks must be lived with and explored before they can be broken," Professor Kuhn said.
The new paradigm cannot build on the one that precedes it, he maintained. It can only supplant it. The two, he said, were "incommensurable."
Some critics said Professor Kuhn was arguing that science was little more than mob rule. He replied, "Look, I think that's nonsense, and I'm prepared to argue that."
The word paradigm appeared so frequently in Professor's Kuhn's "Structures" and with so many possible meanings prompting debate that he was credited with popularizing the word and inspiring a 1974 cartoon in The New Yorker. In it, a woman tells a man: "Dynamite, Mr. Gerston! You're the first person I ever heard use 'paradigm' in real life."
Professor Kuhn traced the origin of his thesis to a moment in 1947 when he was working toward a doctorate in physics at Harvard. James B. Conant, the chemist who was the president of the university, had asked him to teach a class in science for undergraduates majoring in the humanities. The focus was to be historical case studies.
Until then, Professor Kuhn said later, "I'd never read an old document in science." As he looked through Aristotle's "Physics" and realized how astonishingly unlike Newton's were its concepts of motion and matter, he concluded that Aristotle's physics were not "bad Newton" but simply different.
Professor Kuhn received a doctorate in physics, but not long afterward he switched to the history of science, exploring the mechanisms that lead to scientific change.
"I sweated blood and blood and blood, and finally I had a breakthrough," he said.
Thomas Samuel Kuhn, the son of Samuel L. Kuhn, an industrial engineer, and the former Annette Stroock, was born on July 18, 1922, in Cincinnati.
In 1943, he graduated summa cum laude from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in physics.
During World War II, he served as a civilian employee at Harvard and in Europe with the Office of Scientific Research and Development.
He received master's and doctoral degrees in physics from Harvard in 1946 and 1949. From 1948 to 1956, he held various posts at Harvard, rising to an assistant professorship in general education and the history of science.
He then joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, where he was named a professor of history of science in 1961. In 1964, he joined the faculty at Princeton, where he was the M. Taylor Pyne Professor of Philosophy and History of Science until 1979, when he joined the faculty of M.I.T.
Professor Kuhn was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1954-55, the winner of the George Sarton Medal in the History of Science in 1982, and the holder of honorary degrees from many institutions, among them the University of Notre Dame, Columbia University, the University of Chicago, the University of Padua and the University of Athens.
He is survived by his wife, Jehane, and three children, Sarah Kuhn of Framingham, Mass., Elizabeth Kuhn of Los Angeles and Nathaniel Kuhn of Arlington, Mass.

HEADLINE: Lucille Maurer, 73, Treasurer of Maryland

 BODY:
Lucille Darvin Maurer, a Maryland legislator whose expertise in public finance led her to the post of State Treasurer, died on Monday at her home in Silver Spring. She was 73.
The cause was a brain tumor, her family said. 
 Mrs. Maurer, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County for 18 years in the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, Maryland's legislature.
The General Assembly elected her Treasurer in 1987. Stricken by her fatal illness, she resigned in January.
Mrs. Maurer, a native of New York City, graduated in economics from the University of North Carolina and earned a master's degree in general studies at Yale.
She is survived by her husband of 51 years, Ely Maurer; three sons, Stephen B., of Swarthmore, Pa., Russell A., of Pepper Pike, Ohio, and Edward N., of Lido Beach, L.I.; a brother, Eugene Darvin of Pearl River, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Starts of Housing Fall 4.7% As Mortgage Rates Climb

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
Builders, concerned that rising mortgage rates would choke off sales, cut the construction of new homes in May to the lowest level in five months, the Commerce Department said today.
Housing starts fell 4.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted 1.43 million annual rate, erasing April's 4.6 percent gain. Starts were down in every region except the South, the Commerce Department said. 
 Analysts said the weaker-than-expected report suggested a moderating economy. It also eased fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next month to slow growth and prevent inflationary pressures.
"The Fed obviously is looking at this number," said David Lereah, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "This gives them cause to pause. A hike at their July 2-3 meeting is unlikely now."
Analysts noted that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose above 8 percent in May, more than a point above the January average. The increase means a $70 rise in the monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage.
"Builders are saying there is some impact out there," said David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. "When they feel that way, when inventory levels are as high as they are, they cut back on starts."
The pace of new construction fell in May to its lowest point since December. As a result, Mr. Seiders said, April's 1.51 million rate "probably was the high point for the year."
Separately, the Labor Department reported that productivity rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter to the highest level in more than two years.
The Labor Department report contained little sign of inflation. It said unit labor costs, typically two-thirds of the price of a product, slowed to a 1.2 percent increase, from 3.7 percent the previous three months.
But it also showed that so far many businesses were not increasing worker pay. Compensation rose at an annual rate of just one-tenth of 1 percent from January through March, when adjusted for inflation.
The Commerce Department report did not offer any hope for a rebound in housing starts in June. It said applications for building permits dropped 1.9 percent in May, to a 1.43 million rate. It was the first decline in four months.
Still, while many analysts expect starts to fall from recent peaks, they predict new construction will remain above the 1.35 million pace last year. For the first five months of the year, starts were 13.5 percent above those of the corresponding period in 1995.
Construction of single-family homes, about 80 percent of total starts, fell 5.9 percent, to a 1.13 million rate, the lowest since November.
Regionally, starts rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in the South, but fell elsewhere -- down 13.7 percent in the West, 8.8 percent in the Northeast and 3.4 percent in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Japan Economic Data Spur Selloff of Dollars vs. Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped against the Japanese yen and hit a two-month low against the German mark yesterday, weakened by news of a surprisingly strong Japanese economy.
The selling was exacerbated by signs of economic weakness in the United States as well as a rising demand for marks, reflecting a growing belief that the German central bank will not further reduce interest rates. 
 Currency traders said most of the dollar's weakness came early in the day after the Japanese Economic Planning Agency said the economy grew at an annual rate of 12.7 percent in the first quarter.
The report stunned the foreign exchange market, where traders had assumed the growth rate would be far less, in line with other evidence of a tentative recovery in Japan after a three-year-long stagnation.
The dollar fell as low as 107.60 yen before settling in New York at 107.75 yen, down from 108.98 yen on Monday and its lowest level since May 30. The dollar also traded at 1.5123 marks, down from 1.5204 marks. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5435.
Many currency traders have speculated that the dollar would continue rising against the yen, partly on the assumption that Japanese interest rates would remain at historic lows while the country's economic recovery slowly progresses.
But after the first-quarter economic report came out, traders scrambled to buy yen on the assumption that rates would soon rise.
The dollar came under more selling pressure when the Commerce Department reported May housing construction fell to the lowest level in five months. The data suggested less inflationary pressure in the United States and aroused speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates next month.
The prospect for lower rates in Germany, meanwhile, continued to dim, helping to strengthen the mark. Edgar Meister, a member of the policy-making council of the Bundesbank, told a German audience that lower interest rates were still possible. But he also said "everything possible has been done by the Bundesbank to shepherd interest rates lower."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Fare Rises Seen After Shutdown By Valujet

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Valujet's sudden shutdown this week will sharply increase fares along the routes previously flown by the low-cost carrier, according to travel agents and others who watch air fares closely.
Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares magazine, predicted yesterday that fares could increase as much as 70 percent in Valujet's former markets, while Blake Fleetwood, owner of Planetarium Travels in New York, predicted those fares would at least double. 
 A recent Department of Transportation study, estimating that Americans saved $6.3 billion last year flying low-cost carriers, also says the low-cost carriers now compete in markets that account for almost 40 percent of domestic travelers. But because they are niche carriers, most low-cost lines have largely carved out markets that do not compete head-to-head with the major carriers, and rarely with one another.
When the big carriers do match their low-cost competitors' fares, they do so with a limited number of seats, and they require a round-trip ticket and a Saturday stay.
If not many corporate travelers flew Valujet, or fly other budget carriers, many self-employed business travelers do. So do other people who can afford the higher fares. Mr. Fleetwood cited the example of Patrick McEnroe, the tennis player, who recently flew to Chicago on short notice. "I told him I could book him round trip on United for $800, or for $200 on Kiwi," Mr. Fleetwood said. "He chose to save $600."
 
On the Road
Some 80 percent of summer vacations will be by auto or other road vehicles, according to the American Automobile Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, and the average summer vacation will cost $126 a day.
A recent round trip by auto between New York and Miami suggests that the $126 average is probably reasonable while on the road, but would require considerable belt-tightening for anyone not staying with family or friends once travelers arrived at their destination. For not only are gas prices still higher than normal, hotels and motels now cost more.
For example, a clerk at a Bass P.L.C.'s Holiday Inn Express in North Carolina sought to justify the property's surprisingly high room rate by explaining that the word "Express" -- the designation for Holiday Inn's economy brand, with rates usually 15 to 20 percent lower than its full-service properties -- referred only to the speed of checking in and checking out.
That aside, motorists should prepare to be nickeled, dimed and dollared to death in many other ways. Here are some examples:
Free road maps have long disappeared from gas stations, replaced by maps that now cost $2.25 to $5.50. (Most state welcome centers still provide them at no cost.) Free air is rapidly becoming another relic at gas stations, where the cost to inflate tires is typically 25 to 50 cents.
Many public telephones charge 25 cents for calls to those supposedly free "800" numbers, while obtaining an out-of-state telephone number can cost almost as much as the call.
A.T.M. machines are popping up everywhere from gas stations to convenience stores, charging fees of up to $3 a transaction. Even many bank A.T.M.'s routinely tack on a service fee in addition to the fee charged by the user's own bank. One enterprising A.T.M. at a bank on Georgia's St. Simons Island stipulates that it will add a fee, but doesn't say how much.
Those "tip cups" that grace counters at almost every coffee shop in metropolitan New York have spread farther afield. A bakery in Cape May, N.J., has a tip cup bedecked with a reminder, "Your tips are precious." A sign atop the cash register of a Kettle Restaurant pancake house restaurant in Jacksonville, N.C., asks customers not only to tip but also to "please give a generous tip."
In addition, the free "Continental breakfast" ballyhooed by motels often amounts to a cup of weak coffee with powdered milk and doughnut. On the plus side, however, many roadside restaurants that feature buffets no longer proclaim "All you can eat," which is often an invitation to waste and gluttony, but say instead, "All you care to eat."
On the other hand, asked why a Shoney's Restaurant in Myrtle Beach, S.C., served 10 fried shrimp when the menu promised a dozen, an apologetic employee said that it was the policy recently decreed by the regional office. A spokeswoman for Nashville-based Shoney's denied any such policy, saying it was simply an "honest mistake or misunderstanding" by one of the company's many employees.

HEADLINE: Albany Democrats Offer Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 18

 BODY:
The Democrat-controlled State Assembly released a welfare plan today that would impose time limits on all cash benefits, but would continue to provide extensive services for recipients unable to find jobs.
The plan came under immediate attack from Gov. George E. Pataki, who said it would not move people off the welfare rolls fast enough. The Governor has called for welfare limits of five years over a lifetime for mothers with children and 60 days a year for a total of five years, over a lifetime, for single adults and childless couples. 
 But today the Assembly Democrats said their plan would reduce welfare dependency in a more compassionate and effective way than Mr. Pataki's proposals. It would impose five-year limits in cash benefits, but those payments would be continued if the economy took a downturn. It would also provide recipients with vouchers for housing and food once their cash benefits are exhausted.
"This is a proposal that makes sense," the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said during an afternoon news conference announcing the Democratic plan. "I do not believe we should balance a budget entirely on the backs of the poor people of this state, as the Governor is."
In releasing their own plan, the Assembly Democrats appeared to be trying to protect themselves against Republican charges that they have been blocking any changes in the state's welfare system. The Republicans have said they plan to turn welfare into an issue in the November elections, when all 211 seats in the Legislature are up.
The Assembly has been slow to release its plan because the debate over revamping the welfare system has threatened to split that house's Democrats between liberals from New York City and conservative upstate and suburban lawmakers.
The plan was criticized by advocates for the poor, who said the Assembly was caving in during an election year. "It's disappointing to see the Assembly Speaker endorsing time limits," said Timothy Casey of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. "This policy violates the basic principle that there is a responsibility to support the needy so long as they comply with the eligibility requirements."
But Republicans criticized the Assembly plan as a half-hearted measure that did not go far enough. "If you examine the Speaker's plan, then you see that there are really no time limits," said Thomas M. Reynolds, an Assemblyman from western New York Statet who leads the Assembly Republicans. "After cash benefits expire, welfare recipients would receive noncash vouchers."
The Assembly plan differed from the Governor's in other ways. The Governor proposed reducing the amount of the monthly welfare check by 26 percent, to about the same level as New Jersey's, to help close a $4 billion budget gap.
But the Assembly Democrats said their plan included no such cuts. Further, recipients would be allowed to continue receiving cash benefits beyond the five-year limit if the economy had so declined that there were not enough jobs available. That would be determined by tracking the number of people who apply for unemployment benefits each quarter.
The plan would also require recipients to work for benefits and look for jobs, as the Governor has proposed.

HEADLINE: Mexico Plans To Repay U.S. $4.7 Billion

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 18

 BODY:
Taking advantage of new confidence in world financial markets, Mexico announced today that it would obtain private financing for $4.7 billion of the money it borrowed from the United States during last year's financial crisis, more than three years ahead of schedule.
Mexico will pay off the loans, which amount to 45 percent of its outstanding debt to Washington by refinancing its loans at lower cost or with longer terms. The first of the operations to privatize its debt to the United States Treasury began today, with the syndication of $3 billion in five-year notes to private banks. 
 The announcement will allow the Clinton Administration to argue that its risky bailout of Mexico has been successful, and that nearly half of the $12.5 billion it lent to the Mexican Government has now been repaid. Last year many in Congress, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, tried to block the rescue package, asserting that the United States would never get its money back. But the early repayment, Clinton Administration officials insisted tonight, defused the Mexican bailout as a potential election issue.
"This is good news," said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers, the architect of the bailout package last year. "The Mexican economy is recovering. Mexico is regaining access to the capital markets. Most important, American interests are being protected as American support is repaid and American exports to Mexico increase."
Clinton officials have also noted that the United States has made money from the deal, since Mexico has paid more than $750 million in interest.
To aid in the refinancing, the United States Treasury has agreed to release its hold on some of the collateral that Mexico provided for the original loan, Mexican officials said.
To guarantee the $12.5 billion it borrowed, Mexico, in an unprecedented arrangement, gave the United States the right to draw on earnings from its oil exports in case of default.
But senior American officials said tonight that the United States would not release all its claims on Mexico's oil revenue yet. Mexico plans to use the rights that the United States relinquished to secure the notes it began to offer today, Mexican finance officials said.
 The moves today may cause some consternation in Europe and Japan, because Mexico is paying off the United States before it pays back the International Monetary Fund, which also contributed to the bailout.
That decision seems tinged in American Presidential politics, as Mexico tries to repay President Clinton for the high-stakes and unpopular gamble he took in February 1995, when he reached into a special currency stabilization fund to offer Mexico loans to avert financial collapse after the disastrous devaluation of the peso and the accompanying severe squeeze on credit.
But particularly in 1996, President Ernesto Zedillo's officials have begun to steady the economy and to regain the confidence of the international markets sooner than most analysts had expected.
And although Mexican wage earners are still struggling with the worst economic recession in six decades, most experts here say that the economy has reached its bottom and that signs of gradual recovery are multiplying.
Among the heartening indicators, Mexico announced today that it had earned $8.04 billion from exports in May, a record.
Mexico has had several successes this year in placing longer-term debt on the markets. Officials are confident that the bonds they began to sell today will generate most of the money needed to repay the United States.
Mexico was not scheduled to make any payments on the loans from the United States until 1997. After a repayment of $1.3 billion in January, it owed $10.5 billion.
Officials here said the timing had everything to do with the recuperation of the economy and the logic of debt management and nothing to do with election-year politics in the United States.
"This deal has all the advantages," Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said in a telephone interview. "It is a clear financial plus for everyone."
The five-year floating-rate note was made available today at 2.125 percentage points over the three-month London interbank offered rate, for an interest rate of 7.655 percent. The Libor, as the London rate is known in the shorthand of credit markets, is a benchmark interest rate that international banks charge each other for loans denominated in dollars. The note issue is being underwritten for $1 billion each by J. P. Morgan and the Swiss Bank Corporation, Mexican officials said.
Mexico will complete the $4.7 billion repayment, to be made in mid-August, with $1.7 billion it earned from two other recent bond offerings.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Roots in Japan, Vision in China

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
The Japanese retailing tycoon Kazuo Wada's latest gamble might seem like a long shot: he has built the world's second-biggest department store after Macy's in New York and stocked it with everything from a fire-engine-red Ferrari to imported cosmetics in this city whose population can mostly just gawk at such luxuries.
But Mr. Wada has always liked to take risks. Inspired by his first encounter with a modern supermarket in America in the 1960's, he returned home and transformed his family's vegetable business into a chain of general stores that competed with Japanese retailing giants. A decade later, he opened a couple of stores in Sao Paulo, Brazil, largely because he had heard that that city had a big ethnic-Japanese population. At about the same time, he tried his luck in Singapore, even though it was still a mostly poor city-state struggling to industrialize. And in 1984, defying the advice of bankers and industrialists, he chose a fishing village rather than a downtown location as the site for his first store in Hong Kong. 
 Not all the ventures succeeded. But enough did to enable Mr. Wada to build his Yaohan group of companies into a retailing, restaurant and property conglomerate with annual revenue approaching $3 billion and interests on four continents, including supermarkets and department stores in the United States and a restaurant in New York City.
Today, he is pursuing his most ambitious project to date, the Nextage department store across the mud-brown Huangpu River from downtown Shanghai. Nextage, built on land on which water buffalo worked rice fields a decade ago, attracted a million people when it opened its doors in December.
All day, the crowds surged across a marbled esplanade, pushing past bowing women in red berets under soaring arches before pouring into the 10-floor emporium. But while Shanghai is a prosperous city by Chinese standards, with a per capita annual income of nearly $2,000, the store's wares were out of the reach of most shoppers.
The Ferrari was priced at $350,000, or 636 years worth of wages for the average Chinese. A black Cadillac Fleetwood could be had for $95,000. Also on prominent display were designer suits, wide-screen Toshiba televisions, Hallmark cards and pricey firming makeup made by Princess Marcella Borghese.
After the curiosity seekers got their fill, traffic plummeted and revenue thinned. But Mr. Wada remains unperturbed. He has always specialized in moving into promising areas just a little too soon -- and then reaping the rewards when his market catches up with his ambition.
"I see China's era as the 21st century," Mr. Wada said in an interview in his opulent Hong Kong home, Sky High, the 42,000-square-foot former residence of the taipan -- or "big boss" -- of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, a building perched on the summit of Victoria Peak. "My philosophy is doing things at the best time. Everyone is pessimistic now, so things are right now."
Mr. Wada's supporters say China's favorable economic outlook supports his investment theory. "Wada-san is looking 10 years into the future," said a Japanese economist who requested anonymity. "They don't have to make a profit for five years. The rich Shanghaiese are increasing every year. In Shanghai, Yaohan only needs 3 percent of the population."
The 68-year-old Mr. Wada cuts a gnomish figure as he pads into his cavernous living room, a gaggle of aides fluttering in his wake. He favors blue suits and dark ties, but his conservative demeanor masks a flamboyant business style. In 1990, in a move without parallel in Japanese corporate history, he shifted Yaohan's headquarters to Hong Kong to escape what he calls his homeland's suffocating business climate.
"I thought that if I stayed in Japan, I would not be able to create an international conglomerate," Mr. Wada explained. "In Japan, the top leader can't make a decision; everything has to come from the bottom." Unless it changes its ways, he adds, "Japan will miss the train."
Enthralled by China's economic boom, Mr. Wada announced plans to move his headquarters to Shanghai this month and become the first big Asian corporation to base itself inside China. He has already opened 23 supermarkets around the country and hopes to create a China-wide empire of department stores, warehouses, supermarkets, restaurants and fast-food outlets.
That is quite a vision for a company that traces its roots to a vegetable shop opened by Mr. Wada's father and mother in 1910 in Atami, a coastal town south of Tokyo. In his youth, Mr. Wada showed little interest in the family business, preferring to join the Communist Youth League and lead a protest at his university over a tuition increase. After his militancy resulted in his expulsion, his mother dragged him to a retreat of the Seicho No Ie, or House of Growth, a religious sect that emphasizes the values of family, fealty and self-awareness.
That experience, Mr. Wada says, awakened him to the idea that running a vegetable business was a respectable undertaking. His second, and far more rude, awakening came in 1950 when the vegetable stand burned down and was uninsured because he had forgotten to take out a fire policy. "I made up my mind to someday own the top vegetable store in Japan," he told a Japanese interviewer in 1994.
He helped his father rebuild the store, but it was his visit to a supermarket in the United States in 1962 that opened Mr. Wada's eyes to the possibilities of large-scale food marketing. Back in Japan, he quickly went about building the family business into a network of stores selling everything from pots and pans to bed sheets and clothing.
But he had to compete against two deep-pocketed Japanese chain-store giants and contend with Japan's endless business regulations. Again, inspiration struck. Impressed by Sony's expansion overseas, Mr. Wada began looking for opportunities overseas. In 1971, he opened his first store, in Sao Paulo.
"A respected teacher of Seicho No Ie told me that there were many Japanese in Brazil and invited me there," Mr. Wada said. "So I went."
He opened a second store in 1973, and business boomed. Then the world oil crisis unleashed hyperinflation in Brazil, and Yaohan's Brazilian operations, based on dollar loans that the company could no longer pay, came crashing down. "I have really learned bitterly about country risk," Mr. Wada sighed.
By then, he had also swiveled his attention back to Asia, where he had opened a department store in Singapore in 1972. Again, his timing was perfect -- he arrived a little bit too early. "The national per capita income was only about $1,500," he said, "but I was convinced the Singapore Government was very firmly established. Singaporeans were hard-working people, and I predicted that economic growth was going to be tremendous."
Once again, he flouted convention, ordering his stores to stay open until 10 P.M. and on Sundays. "This was kind of revolutionary in shopping," he said with a laugh. But it pulled in customers.
He was keeping an eye on Hong Kong but balked at the high rents. Then in 1984, he was offered space in a housing development being built in the village of Shatin in the New Territories, Hong Kong's bit of the mainland. "Everybody I spoke to -- banks, newspaper people, retailers -- said that Shatin would not be a success," he recalled. "People didn't think a small fishermen's village could grow and change the way it would. But I saw this as my chance."
He took the risk, and Shatin blossomed into a parade of apartment towers, parks and its own business district. His department store flourished, and Mr. Wada continued to build department stores, not in the glittery business district or the chrome-splashed malls frequented by Hong Kong's Gucci set, but in the middle-class neighborhoods that were springing up throughout the New Territories. Today, Yaohan has nine department stores across Hong Kong.
Mr. Wada's management philosophy is a mixture of pragmatism and spirituality. He begins and ends board meetings with meditations, "thanking our ancestors and our founder," says Shozo Sawa, Yaohan's personnel manager. And every morning, he requires the recital of the Yaohan declaration at his stores: "Through proper understanding and ever practicing the Truth of Life's Philosophy, we, the Yaohan International Group, resolve to establish the management principles to contribute for the good of people all over the world and to become a model business group in the world."
Although Mr. Wada has built a retailing conglomerate of more than 450 businesses employing 25,000 people in 16 countries, the Shanghai venture has yet to prove itself. And China, for all its spectacular economic growth, still faces formidable obstacles to modernization and is dogged by political uncertainty. Anna Donald, an analyst at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Hong Kong, thinks investment in China may be a good long-term strategy but warns that the Nextage department store is "unlikely to bring in profits for the next five years."
That assessment is unlikely to perturb Mr. Wada unduly. In contrast to the caution of many of his competitors, he has clearly decided that aggressive risk-taking was the way forward in Asia. Combining a belief in the long-term potential of emerging economies with a willingness to defer profits, Mr. Wada has plunged into markets that were scarcely identifiable as markets. Now, with his startling shift to Shanghai, he has signaled his faith in the explosive growth of China and its incipient upper and upper-middle classes.
"Of course people have different views of the same situation," said Mr. Wada, who each morning writes adages suffused with positive thinking in his diary. "One is the brighter side, one is the darker side. I like to take the brighter side. But on the other hand, there is a certain risk."

HEADLINE: Governors Island Historic District Created

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
More than half of Governors Island was designated a historic district yesterday, giving protection to the island's past but leaving its future still unpredictable.
As expected, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated 90 of the island's 175 acres as the city's 67th historic district, covering some 100 buildings dating as far back as the early 1800's. Five structures in the new district, which covers the island's northern half, had already been given individual landmark status. 
 The historic label is appropriate because Governors Island is "an area of the city with a distinct sense of place" and a military history dating to the 1700's, said a commission spokeswoman, Deborah Sack.
While the commission's action offers further protection to historic buildings and their surroundings, it does not answer the biggest present-day question about the island: What exactly will happen when the Coast Guard leaves, which it has said it will do by the end of 1998?
The departure of the Coast Guard from what had been its largest base in the country is expected to open a whole new history whose main characters will be real estate developers and builders. If they want to develop, build or renovate within the district, their plans must be approved by the commission, which would be unlikely to allow, say, a 19th-century building to be demolished to make way for a fast-food restaurant.
The commission held a public hearing in February on the proposed historic district and heard no opposition, Ms. Sack said. The City Council will review the commission's action and could modify the designation.
It is "way, way too early" to envision what Governors Island will look like a few years from now, Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter said yesterday. She heads a task force appointed last fall by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to study the future of the island. Members include representatives of the Economic Development Corporation, the City Planning Commission and the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
No one disputes that Governors Island has appreciated in value since the Dutch bought it from the Manahatas Indians in 1627 for two ax heads, some beads and nails. But Ms. Reiter and the city's planning director, Joseph B. Rose, were wary yesterday of the astronomical figures that have been given for its value.
"People are just grabbing numbers out of the air," Mr. Rose said, referring in particular to a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the island ought to fetch $500 million.
Yes, the island has a great view of the Manhattan skyline, and no one is making any new land around New York. But the island is still just that: a piece of land reachable only by ferry or helicopter.
Legislation to give New York City or New York State the right of first refusal to buy the island has been pending in Congress since last year.
The five landmark buildings within the new district are the early 19th-century Georgian-style Governor's House; the 19th-century block house and the commanding general's quarters, both in Greek Revival style, and two of the city's first forts, Fort Jay and Castle Williams, both erected early in the 19th century.
Troops were stationed there as early as 1755. The Army operated Governors Island from 1821 to 1966, when the Coast Guard took it over. Since then, some 4,000 Coast Guard members and relatives have lived there, with their own nine-hole golf course, bowling alley, movie theater and Burger King restaurant.

Nike's Wages

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Nike and other companies "are drawn to Indonesia like flies to garbage," says Bob Herbert (column, June 14). Such rhetoric plays into the hands of authoritarian rulers who dismiss American criticisms as the product not of empathy but contempt. 
 Questionable too is the idea of banning investment in Indonesia to avoid moral contamination. The pay employees receive from Nike may seem "pathetic," but typically such wages are higher than in comparable jobs elsewhere in the Indonesian economy.

HEADLINE: The Mean Streets That Nurture Art;
A Photographer Finds Support And Community in East Village

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
It was two years ago in March, the month she turned 27, that Meryl Levin resigned herself to the reality that she might never make a living doing what she loves.
She also resolved to do it anyway. At least for now. 
 So, every morning, Ms. Levin climbs down from the loft bed in her 300-square-foot apartment, showers in the bathtub that sits in the middle of her kitchen, pulls on her lace-up boots and jangle of silver bracelets, and sets out to capture corners of the world with her wide-lens camera.
Ms. Levin, who grew up in Rockland County, developing pictures in the darkroom where her dentist father, Stan, processed his dental X-rays, is a long way from becoming a prominent photographer. But she is not toiling in complete obscurity.
She is known to the photo agency Impact Visuals, a cooperative of photographers that accepted Ms. Levin as a member in 1991; to Susan Meiselas and Gilles Peress, the renowned documentary photographers for whom Ms. Levin has worked as an assistant, and to the New York Foundation for the Arts, which in 1994 awarded Ms. Levin a $7,000 fellowship.
These signs of recognition have helped reassure Ms. Levin that she is not completely crazy. Others know she is out there trying to make it.
Living below 14th Street has helped Ms. Levin feel she is not entirely alone. Others like her are out there trying to make it too.
The East Village has long been a destination for emerging artists, offering low rents, cheap restaurants and a creative community. On Ms. Levin's block of East Third Street she knows at least five photographers near her age.
On the surrounding streets, sandwiched between Second Avenue and Avenue D, in unheated studios and overheated apartments as far down as Delancey Street, are painters, sculptors, writers, video artists, film makers and performing artists, many under 30.
They include painters like Ruth Root, 28, whose work is being shown in SoHo, featuring a series of canvases that depict hulking masses of brown hair, inspired by a year of migraine headaches.
Or Andrew Bordman, who has been exploring images of Jewish mysticism with pen on archival paper. His sources of inspiration range from medieval manuscripts to Sears catalogues.
Their distinctive, alternative turf, vibrant with body-piercing shops, people in neon platform shoes and coffee bars like the one named Limbo, is affirming in its freewheeling way.
But lately, as money for the arts has diminished and following the heart has come to seem more foolhardy than courageous, young artists like Ms. Levin sense they may be among a dying breed of dreamers.
"It's an incredibly scary moment," Ms. Levin said. "There is the sort of feeling like, 'Oh my God, how are we going to survive?' And I don't know that it's idealism so much as a brand of stupidity. I mean, the writing is on the wall."
In her walk-up studio apartment, Ms. Levin wakes to the smell of garlic wafting in through her second-floor windows from Mama's Food Shop across the street, and falls asleep to the whistles of drug dealers plying their trade on Avenue B.
She makes the most of her cramped living space by being organized and inventive. Each thin drawer of a squat storage cabinet is carefully labeled: "stamps," "resume paper," "white gloves" (for looking at black-and-white archival prints). The alcove underneath her loft bed doubles as a dressing area and darkroom (she hangs black velvet over the window to block out the light). Her sink triples as a bathroom sink, kitchen sink and photography sink.
"It's that whole, your-sink-is-your-darkroom-sink-do-you-really-want-to-be-cooking-in-it problem," Ms. Levin said.
Though rising East Village rents have sent artists fleeing to other boroughs, many still feel the pull of downtown Manhattan.
"This seemed like the center of the universe," said Ms. Root, who grew up in Miami and helps support herself by painting people's apartment walls. She lives on Orchard Street and works in a studio on Avenue B that she shares with five people: a metalsmith, a writer, another painter, and two wood sculptors who hack away in the basement (Ms. Root plays music to drown out the sound of the saws).
Mr. Bordman, who grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia and works during the day as an administrative assistant at the Rockefeller Foundation, has been sketching in his bedroom on Essex Street while he looks for a studio space he can afford. Part of the reason he has been working with ink lately is that painting with oil so near his bed has made it difficult to sleep because of the turpentine fumes.
He says concern about his finances fluctuates from day to day. "Some days, I'm very worried about it, and I'll eat a slice of pizza for lunch and a slice of pizza for dinner," he said. "Other days, I'll splurge on an expensive art book or a nice pair of shoes."
Ms. Levin supports herself primarily by working for Ms. Meiselas, the photographer, which brings in about $17,000 a year, and through occasional freelance assignments for employers like Local 1199, the hospital workers' union, and The Village Voice.
Ms. Levin said she has managed to keep up with the rent, telephone and electric bills. Nevertheless, she calculates every sandwich and subway token, and saves money by traveling to appointments via bicycle or Rollerblades, which is also how she exercises, since she cannot afford a health club.
There are ways Ms. Levin could be playing it safer. She could earn considerably more money doing commercial work, like fashion photography. She could try to get a steady newspaper job. Instead, she has chosen to pursue long-term projects she is passionate about that may never see the light of day, much less pay the bills.
"I've made the decision that I'm not just going to use my talent to earn a living all the time," Ms. Levin said. "I'm going to do the kind of work that I want to do, and figure out some other way to support that."
Artists in their 40's and 50's say young artists like Ms. Levin are right to give themselves time.
"One of the reasons why you're a young artist at 40, with rare exceptions, is that it takes a while to actually serve your apprenticeship in the arts," said Stephen Westfall, 43, who has exhibited his work at prestigious venues like the Andre Emmerich Gallery and the Daniel Newburg Gallery. "Not just paying the rent and having a job, but finding your own voice and understanding your own sensibility. You're kidding yourself if you think you can skirt that process and be an original in your mid-20's."
Ideally, Ms. Levin would like to publish books of her photographs. She is working on one now, chronicling efforts to seek health care by people in the South Bronx. So far, she has failed to win a grant to support the project -- she has applied for three -- and has yet to show it to a publisher.
But she is proceeding with the work anyway. During the last year, she has followed three people, documenting daily rituals as mundane as rolling up sleeves for blood tests and standing in line to cash welfare checks, as profound as leaving the hospital to die at home.
Ms. Levin has chosen to document a world that many people do not to want to see. She said she feels supported in her choice by mentors like Ms. Meiselas, best known for her work in Central America.
"Meryl knows what she's up against," said Ms. Meiselas, who works out of a studio on Mott Street and is completing a visual history of the Kurds. "She's as willful as I think she needs to be. And whether or not the world will open up to her, as I would hope it would, that's the fate that no one can predict."
While Ms. Levin takes comfort in the company of her compatriots, she said she cannot help feeling competitive. "Everyone and their brother is a photographer," Ms. Levin said. "They all live in this town."
The economics of a photographer's existence have grown increasingly Darwinian, Ms. Levin said. Whereas once photographers could count on living off the resale of their stock footage, now, as photographs go out over the Internet, that nest egg is no longer secure.
All of this has made even the most seasoned of artists newly cautious and many people at Ms. Levin's level downright conservative.
"When I was growing up," she said, "it was the 80's: 'You can do anything you want, it's out there.' And I sort of felt, by the time I graduated, it was 'Well, actually you really can't.' Yet I still sort of feel like somewhere back there I have this drive of, 'But give it a try anyway, and maybe you'll work something out.' "
Other artists, like Ms. Root, seem to live fiercely in the present, refusing to entertain the worst.
"I guess I have doubts, but I don't have the great doubt that would make me become a veterinarian," Ms. Root said. "I guess in New York, especially in this neighborhood where it's like post-apocalypse sometimes, I kind of feel this is my job."
Mr. Bordman, who took premedical studies in college and had a 10-year plan to become a doctor, said: "Now I can't really see that far. I'm just kind of blind about it. I just want to keep working."
Beneath their rational eloquence and street-smart stoicism, one cannot help sensing a basic fear.
"When it's just me not making any money, it's O.K.," Ms. Levin said. "I can figure out how to make it work. But I do want to have a kid and I do want to be a full partner in a partnership and I do want to be able to provide in all kinds of ways."
Whatever happens, whether she makes it work or ultimately decides to move in another direction, Ms. Levin said she cannot imagine doing anything different.
"I have to go through this," she said. "I think I'm sort of down for the count. This is the long haul."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Agreed: It Was a Jungle, In the Bad Old Days

BYLINE: WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
If truth-in-advertising laws were applied to television titles, tomorrow night's edition of "Firing Line" would be in for it. The proclaimed subject, "Resolved: The Marketplace Is Not a Social Enemy," is scarcely on the minds of the affirmative forces led by William F. Buckley Jr., known as Mr. Conservative, or the negatives, led by Robert Kuttner, co-editor of The American Prospect, known as a liberal journal.
All present agree that the American marketplace has been regulated for a century or so precisely to prevent it from behaving as a social enemy. Even Mark Green, a certified liberal and New York City's Public Advocate, grants that "the market is no enemy." And none of his opponents call for a return to the bad old days. 
 There is some banter about the proper amount of regulation, but the main argument is the enduring one over whether the bosses ought to be so much richer than the workers. And even that does not produce a lot of class-struggle heat. Listen to Jerry J. Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, acknowledging that the pay of some chief executive officers is "excessive," and to Mr. Buckley conceding the need for labor unions.
Surrounded by students and others at Bard College and moderated by Robert Shrum (taking over from Michael Kinsley, who has gone off to try his luck in the on-line marketplace), these debaters are a touch too undoctrinaire for the good of their encounter. Edward Luttwak, once an adviser to Ronald Reagan but on the liberal side in this matter, sees "sort of a disturbing consensus here emerging," and David Levy, vice chairman of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, host to the debate, laments with fair accuracy that "we find ourselves repeating each other."
Knockout arguments are absent. Pressed for his approach to the consequences of accelerated globalization, the technological revolution and deregulation, Mr. Luttwak proposes eliminating self-service gas stations as a way of increasing jobs. Mr. Buckley counters with a call for a crackdown on "illegitimacy, crime, miseducation and divorce." Take your choice.
Viewers are also at the mercy of conflicting assertions and rebuttals about current conditions. Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs, says there is still plenty of upward mobility in America; Mr. Kuttner challenges his statistics. Andrew Stern of the Service Employees Union tells Mr. Buckley that his statistics are wrong; Mr. Jasinowski, the manufacturers' voice, tells Mr. Stern that his statistics are wrong.
The exchanges are cordial; the audience is polite. Mr. Shrum, who may want to keep his new job lest he become another statistic, says, "This has been a wonderful debate."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains as Bank of Japan Denies Report of Rate Rises

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies in volatile trading yesterday after the Bank of Japan denied a report that it might raise interest rates as early as July.
Currency traders said the dollar was also helped by new doubts about a Japanese Government report depicting a powerful first-quarter economic surge, the main reason for the dollar's slump on Tuesday. 
 But traders said the dollar's seesaw behavior during the day reflected new uncertainty in the longer-term direction of the currency, which has been on a relatively steady climb against the Japanese yen and German mark for months.
"Right now there's still disbelief and a little bit of confusion," said Joseph Klettner, a technical analyst of foreign exchange at Chase Securities in New York. "As this confusion lingers on, you'll probably get a bit of a choppy market here."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 107.85 yen, up slightly from 107.75 yen on Tuesday. The dollar also traded at 1.5210 marks, up from its two-month low of 1.5123 Tuesday. The British pound was unchanged for the second consecutive day at $1.5435.
The dollar began the trading day by rallying in Asia and Europe as traders reassessed Tuesday's report by the Japanese Economic Planning Agency on first-quarter performance, which showed an annual growth rate of 12.7 percent in the first quarter, the fastest in 23 years.
They said much of the strength was concentrated in Government public works spending and housing construction, not necessarily enough to help Japan pull out of its prolonged slump. Some traders also noted that the report was inconsistent with other evidence of a much milder economic recovery in Japan.
"There's just a realization that it is old data," said Jack Griffin, a vice president of foreign exchange at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. "More recent data hasn't confirmed it."
But the dollar dropped abruptly in early New York trading after the Kyodo news service reported the Bank of Japan had concluded the figures were strong enough to reconsider its interest rate policy, and that it might raise rates next month.
The Bank of Japan quickly denied the report, saying that nothing had been decided and that it was continuing to "carefully watch the recovery situation." Traders who had been selling dollars then began to bid the dollar higher again.

The Shaker-Upper

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Coping with the least of his prob lems moving into a new, fortified residence -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calmed the decorating concerns of his wife, Sara: "They're just not used to what we're trying to do."
That goes for the entire enterprise of the ninth Israeli leader. His own party was not used to his idea of filling the most powerful cabinet posts with outsiders. It promptly rebelled. The way he rolled with the intra-party punching is revealing. 
 Ariel Sharon, who unified the right and enabled Netanyahu to run against Shimon Peres one-on-one, had an ironclad right to expect the post of Finance. When offered the lesser post of Housing, he refused. The man Sharon had persuaded to stay out of the race, David Levy, then refused to accept Foreign Minister, which Sharon had brokered.
At the Knesset lectern for his low-key maiden speech as Prime Minister, Netanyahu looked down at the front row, where two empty seats were as startling as a couple of missing front teeth. The Parliament gasped as he temporarily held those two portfolios for himself.
After a finger-wagging lecture from Peres (whose recovery from a near-catatonic state came two weeks too late for Labor's campaign), the Prime Minister induced Levy to accept the Foreign Ministry by whipping together a new super-ministry -- of "Infrastructures" -- for Sharon. That heavy-set hard-liner is thinking it over, but Levy's quick acceptance lessens his leverage.
A Likud moderate, Dan Meridor, one of Netanyahu's generational rivals, did better after being overlooked. The Prime Minister was forced to name him to Finance, but created a new job for the financial professional he wanted: head of a U.S.-style council of economic advisers that will provide the business-trained Prime Minister the staff he needs to manage the economy.
Upshot: The new P.M. pushed, pulled back, created some new facts on the political ground, bruised some egos, and wound up with more than half the loaf he wanted.
That was the easy part of beginning to create a new mindset; now he has to negotiate one on the world scene. And the place to start is in building a fresh relationship with Israel's key ally, the United States.
When the Israeli comes to Washington, where Moshe Arens may be his Ambassador, he must explain to President Clinton why Arab leaders, European bureaucrats and Russian spymaster-diplomats are treating his election as an offense to world peace. Their dudgeon suits their interests, which are not necessarily our interests.
Egypt, for example, seizes this election as cause for an emergency Arab summit meeting, in a bid to re-establish Cairo as the center of the Arab world. France wants a meeting of the European Union, to castigate Israel and snatch back business from America in the Middle East. And Yevgeny Primakov, Saddam Hussein's friend, called from the Yeltsin Foreign Ministry to urge Netanyahu to accept Russian co-sponsorship of Madrid II, thereby projecting Moscow's influence in the region.
Whoa. This is not the time for Mr. Clinton to say "Ain't summits fun?" Perhaps Mr. Netanyahu can persuade him to suggest to fellow world leaders that the U.S. disapproves of such pre-emptive diplomatic strikes against Israel. Clinton should review U.S. policy toward terrorist Syria, occupier of Lebanon, transporter of Iranian rockets that rain on Israel, home to terrorists attacking Turkey and Jordan, in light of that appeasement's eight-year failure.
The old mindset makes a test of leaving Hebron; the new mindset explores ways to guarantee personal security to Israelis living in the West Bank and job security to Palestinians working there and in Israel. The old permits foreign ministers to visit Palestinian representatives in Jerusalem; the new raises no false hope of dividing Israel's capital.
Mr. Netanyahu should thank Congress fervently for voting to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and startle us all by taking up A. M. Rosenthal's idea of phasing out U.S. economic aid.
We are just not used to what this shaker-upper is trying to do. I am long out of the speechwriting dodge, but can recommend a line of Lincoln's: "We must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves."

HEADLINE: Maximum Wage? Tell It to Movers and Shakers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Corporate Greed, Meet the Maximum Wage" (Week in Review, June 16) refers to a suggested maximum wage for executives at 50 times the minimum wage of the company's lowest-paid employee. Socialism does not work. The profit motive works. The promise of great wealth is what spurs the creators of the world. It drives the economy's engine. 
 People like Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, would not say, "Sure I'll put out the same effort for a lot less money." It didn't work in the Soviet Union or any Communist country. A modified socialism, like tying the wages of executives to other employees, will not work either.
Start a company, invest your time and money and all your effort, and then pay yourself only 50 times what you pay your lowest-paid employee: once you've tried it, perhaps the example of Mr. Gates's successful entrepreneurship will seem to have some merit.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Lose Gains To End Flat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, retreating from early gains after an announcement on next week's sales of new two-year and five-year notes revived concerns about supply.
The retreat erased earlier gains made after a Federal Reserve survey showed that wages and prices remained largely in check even amid a pickup in the pace of growth. Some market participants interpreted the findings of the survey, a compilation of anecdotal reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts, to mean that the Fed would delay an expected increase in interest rates. 
 The price of the 30-year bond ended unchanged at 86 14/32, leaving its yield also unchanged at 7.10 percent.
Bond prices were pressured at the start of trading on a report by a Japanese news service that the Bank of Japan was considering raising interest rates. Such a move would diminish the relative attractiveness of United States Treasury securities. Indeed, a number of investors have taken advantage of the low lending rates in Japan, borrowing there and investing in higher-yielding United States Government securities.
The dollar also dropped sharply after the report, by the Kyodo news service. The report was quickly denied by Bank of Japan officials, and the dollar recovered.
Treasury prices were further bolstered after the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., which complied the Fed survey known as the beige book, said that while "the pace of growth accelerated recently," signs of higher wages "remained scattered."
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, Minneapolis, said the Fed report indicated "that we have a wonderful combination of economic growth and little inflationary pressures."
"So this implies that a strong economic growth doesn't have to lead to higher inflation and interest rates," he said.
Mr. Sohn said he believed that the report damped the probability that Fed policy makers would increase rates when they meet next month. "The beige book report changed very little from April, and so the question is, what has changed since April to warrant a tighter monetary policy?" he asked.
Mr. Sohn says Fed policy makers might decide to give the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, the directive to raise rates between meetings if economic conditions justify. It would better, he said, if Fed policy makers waited until their Aug. 20 meeting to raise rates, when they would have had two more employment reports and second-quarter gross domestic product data to digest.
Bonds were pressured after the Treasury announced the size of its note auctions for next week. While the size of the auctions was unchanged from the previous sale, the prospect of new securities coming to market revived concerns about the ability of the market to absorb them.
The Treasury said that it would sell $18.75 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.32 percent and the five-year note was being offered at price to yield 6.74 percent. The Treasury plans to auction $19.25 billion of new one-year bills today.
Also today, the market will get to see the April trade balance numbers, a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and the weekly initial jobless claims report.
In the corporate bond market, issuance is beginning to heat up, and the largest sale expected this week will be done by an issuer who is no stranger to large offerings, having done a $3.5 billion deal just over a month ago in the biggest high-grade issue ever. The Lockheed Martin Corporation plans to sell $1.25 billion debt securities in three parts this week through underwriters led by CS First Boston.

HEADLINE: Teacher Is Sentenced For Taking a Bribe

BYLINE: The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A New York high school teacher was sentenced to six months in prison and fined $2,500 yesterday for taking a bribe from a student in exchange for a passing grade, District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said.
The teacher, Kenneth D. Cotton, 44, who taught economics at two high schools, was convicted on charges of receiving bribes, falsifying records and official misconduct. Mr. Cotton, whose salary was $62,331, was also placed on probation for four and a half years and is required to perform 500 hours of community service. 
 Testimony showed that Mr. Cotton instilled "fear in a student, who allegedly had excessive absences from his night school classes" at Jamaica High School last year, and that he demanded $290 for a passing grade. The student, 18, informed authorities, who arrested Mr. Cotton last June 22.
Mr. Cotton also taught at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 20.32, but Broader Market Falls

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rose yesterday, but most stocks slid again as bonds failed to improve and investors remained cautious before the next Federal Reserve Board meeting in July, where it issues its verdict on inflation.
The Dow industrials advanced 20.32 points, to 5,648.35, down from a midday gain of 46 points, when the Dow briefly broke free of the narrow, indecisive trading range that has been characterized this week and last. 
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 383.6 million shares, making it the sixth straight session below 400 million, underlining the cautious tone in the market.
Most broad-market indexes ended lower after struggling higher with bonds earlier in the session.
"A lot of people are just pulling to the sidelines and don't want to play," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "Until bond yields fall below 7 percent, I don't see how stocks can make any meaningful advance."
Bonds struggled to advance several times in the session, inspiring some stock buying as interest rates dipped, but then finished almost unchanged. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a key determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- held steady at 7.10 percent.
"It was a really unconvincing bounce," Mr. Rice said. "This is a market that shows no conviction." He attributed some of the early strength in bonds to the Bank of Japan's decision not to raise interest rates, which could make Japanese investments more enticing relative to United States Treasuries.
The Big Board composite index fell 0.26, to 355.32, its ninth straight decline, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.10, to 661.96, the eighth straight decline for that blue-chip measure. The American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.06, to 588.93, its seventh straight decline.
Technology stocks stabilized after Tuesday's slide on growing worries about slack demand in the computer industry.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled nearly 25 points on Tuesday, fell 3.81, to 1,179.27, but several computer-industry bellwethers rebounded. Intel rose 1, to 71 3/8, and Cisco Systems rose 1/2, to 53 3/8.
Compuserve slipped 1/2, to 22 3/4, after announcing a smaller-than-expected loss in the first quarterly report since H & R Block spun off the on-line service. Late Tuesday, Compuserve reported a $1.1 million loss for its fourth quarter, which ended April 30.
Tele-Communications Inc. rose 1/2, to 18 3/8 after its board authorized a spinoff of the unit that holds TCI's interest in the Primestar direct broadcast satellite venture. Primestar leases 36-inch satellite dishes to customers who can then receive cable, pay- television and sports programming. The venture is owned by a consortium that includes TCI, Comcast, Time Warner and Cox Communications.
Shares of HMT Technology climbed 3, to 17 1/4. The company withdrew its offer to sell 4 million common shares and $150 million in convertible notes, citing recent weakness in stock market prices for disk-storage companies.
Since announcing plans to sell the stock and notes in late May, HMT shares have lost nearly half their value. HMT said it was proceeding with expansion plans.
Boeing announced plans yesterday to double production of its best-selling jet, the 737, amid booming demand. The announcement eased concern that 1996 earnings will fall short of last year's results. Advancing with Boeing on the New York Stock Exchange were shares of the Procter & Gamble Company, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company.
Retail shares dropped, leading the decline in the S.& P, a day after the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim reported that weekly same-store sales were little changed in the second week of June.
Among retailers, Wal-Mart Stores slid 5/8, to 24 5/8; Sears, Roebuck & Company fell 1/4, to 49 7/8, and the J. C. Penney Company dropped 7/8, to 51 7/8.

HEADLINE: Survey by Fed Says Economy Is Strong, With Little Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Despite fresh strength in the economy, wages and prices remain largely in check, a survey by the Federal Reserve found today.
The lack of quickened inflation was taken by private analysts as a crucial factor weighing against action by the central bank to tighten monetary conditions at its policy meeting early next month. Stock prices promptly climbed after the survey was issued at noon, while bond prices rose in early trading but finished slightly lower. 
 "Nearly all districts report expanding activity, and several indicate the pace of growth accelerated recently," said the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which compiled this round of the periodic anecdotal reports from the 12 districts. But despite tight labor markets for both skilled and entry-level workers, it said, signs of higher wages "remained scattered."
The poll, which is part of the Fed's preparation for meetings of the Open Market Committee, covered the six-week period through June 11, one marked by statistics that mostly portrayed a resurging economy after a near stall in the early part of the year.
"This confirmed that there was an improvement in the economy since the last F.O.M.C. meeting,"said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank in Pittsburgh. He said the strength came particularly in housing, retailing and even manufacturing. "But it is without any signs yet of worsening consumer inflation or pressures on wages," he added.
Nonetheless, there were the usual geographic variations and contrary trends within districts. For example, while the New York and Boston districts were among the nine showing improved factory activity, these two were said to be the only districts with lagging retail sales.
A second survey published today found 64 forecasters predicting that gross domestic product would grow at a 4 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, up from the 2.3 percent rate in the first three months of the year. This survey, issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, predicted that the growth rate would moderate to 2.4 percent in the second half of the year.
According to the Federal Reserve's survey, called the beige book for the color of its cover, the economy "continued to advance at a moderate pace" during May and early June, with retail business and services generally stronger, factories busier and home and commercial construction also brisker in most districts.
On the other hand, mortgage lending declined, wet weather hampered home building in the Chicago district and elsewhere, and drought seriously hurt agriculture in several districts. Wheat farmers in Kansas and Oklahoma may harvest less than half their normal crop, the Fed was told.
Tourism was especially buoyant, with hotel occupancy in New York City remaining at a 16-year high, strong attendance gains at Florida theme parks, rising gambling revenues in Mississippi and swelling, double-digit airport traffic in Atlanta, site of next month's Olympic Games.
One of the tightest labor markets is the Boston district, the Fed indicated, with businesses finding it necessary to recruit professional workers from other regions and factories being forced to raise wages.
Other of the relatively few signs of wage inflation across the country were some fast-food restaurants in the St. Louis district offering "signing bonuses" of up to $250 and then paying "well above" the minimum wage; higher entry-level wages in Atlanta related to the Olympics, and shortages of workers in Virginia, central Ohio, northern Kentucky and the Upper Midwest.
The Minneapolis district, in fact, reported that a growing number of companies seeking skilled workers have stopped advertising for them because of a lack of candidates. A state official suggested calling this a situation of "discouraged employers."
Still, most districts reported wages essentially contained, suggesting increases no more than about 3 percent, the current 12-month rate of consumer inflation.
The Dallas Fed, echoed by others, found "wage pressures were minimal, except for a few respondents who were concerned about rising costs" if Washington enacted a higher minimum wage, a prospect that has diminished markedly in the last few weeks.
The Dallas district also reported that increased orders for nearly all factory goods with the notable exception of semiconductors, "which continued to plunge" along with prices.

HEADLINE: Navistar to Cut Jobs and Move Truck Production

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
The Navistar International Corporation, North America's biggest producer of trucks and school buses, said yesterday that it would eliminate 3,000 of the 5,000 jobs at its huge factory in Springfield, Ohio, and move its heavy truck production elsewhere by 1999.
Andy Opila, a spokesman for Navistar, said that no decision had been made on where the company would move the heavy truck production. "We are evaluating our options," he said. 
 But Steve Shelton, the president of the United Automobile Workers Local 402, which represents workers at the factory, said there had been speculation at the plant that Navistar would move the operation to Mexico. One of Navistar's rivals, Paccar Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., has just begun establishing a heavy truck factory in Mexico, shortly after shutting one in Canada when workers went on strike.
Navistar, based in Chicago, said in a statement that it was reviewing whether to cancel its agreement to license manufacturing technology to Consorcio G Grupo Dina S.A., a Mexican truck manufacturer, and replace it with a new one "to serve the Mexican market over the longer term."
Mr. Opila said that Navistar already produced some trucks in Mexico for the Mexican market but said that the company was evaluating its options on whether to produce trucks in Mexico for the United States market.
If Navistar does move production to Mexico, the result would be one of the largest single factory losses of jobs since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect on Jan. 1, 1994. The agreement is phasing out over 10 years the previously prohibitive tariff of 25 percent on truck imports from Mexico.
The Labor Department has certified the loss of 74,205 jobs because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the numbers are incomplete because many workers and unions choose not to apply for certification for complex legal reasons. The Clinton Administration and most economists say that the agreement has created far more jobs in the United States than it has eliminated by letting companies take advantage of the economies of scale offered by a North American market with few barriers to trade.
Navistar will continue to produce medium trucks and school buses at the Springfield factory and will invest $200 million to retool the factory for a new generation of medium-sized trucks.
A heavy truck is classified by the Government as a tractor that can pull a trailer of more than 33,000 pounds, while a medium truck can pull 16,000 to 33,000 pounds.
Mr. Opila said that Navistar's plans for job reductions in Springville assumed that the company could negotiate changes in the three-year contract that it reached with the U.A.W. last year. Mr. Shelton said it was too soon to predict the outcome of any such negotiations, adding that while he was grateful the company was planning to invest more money, the scope of the planned job cutbacks stunned him.
About 1,500 employees in Springfield have served for 30 or more years and are eligible for retirement, Mr. Shelton added.
Navistar's planned negotiations with the U.A.W. could prove an interesting test of labor-management relations. The company extracted health care and pension concessions from the union in 1993 by agreeing to place a third of its stock, with no voting rights, into a special trust that is intended some day to supplement the pensions of U.A.W. workers.
If the union fights the movement of heavy-truck production, it would likely hurt the value of the trust fund on which its members depend for their retirement, said Frank J. Prezelski, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann in New York. "The unions are caught between a rock and a hard place," he said.
Jack Laskowski, the vice president of the U.A.W.'s national leadership who oversees the union's relationship with Navistar, was cautious in responding to yesterday's announcement, saying only that union officials intended to meet with the company soon.
Navistar included the announcement of layoffs halfway down a news release about its spending plans. With public criticism of layoffs increasing, many American corporations have been reluctant to trumpet their job cuts.
Darryl Herring, the assistant city manager of Springfield, a community of 70,000 in southwestern Ohio, said that local officials had expected some cutbacks at Navistar. The company's decision to invest more money in the factory partly offsets the pain of the layoffs, he said.
The city has an unemployment rate of 6.9 percent while Clark County, which includes Springfield, has an unemployment rate of only 5.4 percent. But it would be hard to replace the loss of so many jobs at the city's biggest employer, Mr. Herrin said.
"The city, from an economic development standpoint, is very dependent on Navistar and on the work force at Navistar," Mr. Herring said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Teen-age childbearing: the cost is put at $8.9 billion a year.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AN ambitious study issued last week by the Robin Hood Foundation in New York called "Kids Having Kids" will no doubt convince any remaining skeptics that teen-age childbearing is an economic as well as a social disaster.
But the research will disappoint those who assume that anyone going to the trouble to document these costs must have a fix in mind. "We haven't got the slightest idea what to do about teen-age pregnancy," said Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was an adviser to the authors of the study. 
 Nor, for that matter, do social scientists hold out more than a glimmer of hope that public intervention can offset the economic consequences once the teen-agers give birth. The latest findings from Ohio's experiment in using financial incentives to keep teen-age mothers in school, reported last month by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, are only marginally encouraging.
The Robin Hood Foundation, a New York-based charity dedicated to reducing poverty, commissioned a series of research papers on teen-age motherhood and hired Rebecca Maynard, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, to put the pieces together. The story she tells is not pretty.
In 1993 some 175,000 babies were born to girls 17 or younger. Just 3 percent of the babies were put up for adoption. And since fewer than one in six of the mothers were married or well educated, most of the children were left to grow up in impoverished, single-parent families.
To those children, the mere fact that they were born to teen-age mothers will influence the rest of their lives. Extrapolating from recent history,teen-age mothers will be only marginally more dependent on welfare than their socioeconomic counterparts who wait an extra four years to give birth. But their children will be 50 percent more likely to repeat a grade in school, 42 percent more likely to drop out, 13 percent more likely to end up in prison, 30 percent more likely to be unemployed as young adults and 22 percent more likely to bear children themselves before the age of 18.
Ms. Maynard calculates that the problems associated with adolescent childbearing -- as distinct from the general problems of growing up in poor or dysfunctional families -- will cost taxpayers about $7 billion this year. That comes mostly from higher outlays on foster care, medical treatment and criminal justice, plus lost tax revenues. The overall costs to society, including the estimated productivity lost by the mothers, add up to $8.9 billion.
In Mr. Besharov's view these figures undoubtedly underestimate the economic consequences of teen-age pregnancy: parental age may matter, he says, but marital status matters even more. "A married teen-age mother is less likely to go on welfare than an unmarried 25-year old mother," he says.
Ms. Maynard agrees that the numbers are conservative, but for different reasons. A good chunk of the real cost, she argues, is borne by the young parents and their children, and is thus not easily measurable. Much of the rest, the cost to the nation of tolerating chronic poverty in the midst of plenty, is spiritual rather than economic.
By Mr. Besharov's reckoning, that tolerance is less a matter of public indifference than frustration. The common approaches to deterring early pregnancy -- better access to contraception and abortion, intervention to support teen-agers' self-esteem and hope for economic advancement -- are "insufficient to turn the tide."
And what about mitigating the damage, once girls become mothers? Some 20 states now demand that young mothers on welfare go to school. Ohio goes a step further, adding $62 to the monthly checks of those who attend and subtracting $62 from the checks of dropouts.
But the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation's analysis of Ohio's LEAP experiment suggests that the impact has been modest. Compared with a control group, the percent of mothers employed in the previous three months was somewhat higher and the percent on welfare lower. "If the employment rate holds up it's very promising," said Judy Gueron, the president of M.D.R.C. But the high school graduation rate, probably the best single indicator of the economic prospects of teen-agers, rose in only one city, Cleveland. And once mothers do drop out, the evidence from Ohio and elsewhere points to unhappy endings. "You have to do more than change welfare incentives," Ms. Gueron concludes.
The problem of early pregnancy resists easy solution. But surely one mark of a healthy society is that defeat does not lead to defeatism. Hence the virtue of reminding Americans of the dimensions of the scourge. "The real value of looking at the narrow dollars and cents calculation," Ms. Maynard concludes, "is that people will pay attention."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Plan Is to Keep the Kids And Hope for the Best

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
Joe Torre and Bob Watson emerged from the muck and mire of the Yankees-Twins rainout yesterday with two sets of priorities.
Torre, the manager, had to figure out how to get a starting rotation that is thin, young and in one case ailing through a four-game weekend series in Cleveland. 
 Watson, the general manager, has to figure out how to get the rotation through the season while keeping the club atop the American League East.
Because he has most of his "A" team on the disabled list (Jimmy Key, David Cone, Melido Perez) and because Scott Kamieniecki is struggling to find confidence and control in the minors, Watson is concerned about the current situation. Dwight Gooden and Kenny Rogers -- plus lots of crossed fingers regarding the ailing Andy Pettitte and the young and unproven Brian Boehringer and Ramiro Mendoza -- fill the rotation.
He's concerned, Watson acknowledged, "but I'm not concerned enough to do something stupid."
Stupid, as in making the decision, either right or wrong, that will disappoint George Steinbrenner, the owner whose modus operandi assures that he will want Watson to fix what ails Yankee pitching, then will pick over why such means were used to reach whatever end Watson manages.
Thus, the conundrum: Bring a winning team in, but not by blowing Steinbrenner's budget or the Yankees' future by trading kids for veterans. And thus, Watson's conservative approach.
"Right now, our scouts out there tell me that our kids are as good as some of the veterans throwing out there right now," Watson said. "And the price for those veteran guys in terms of money and the talent that I would have to give up is not worth it. That's why we've made the decision to go with the kids right now."
Those kids, Boehringer and Mendoza, are a combined 1-4, with earned run averages tipping the scales at over 8.00. What their numbers will look like after tomorrow could be frightening, considering that those two rookies get to start both ends of a day-night doubleheader against the powerful and defending American League champion Indians.
Stumble in Cleveland and both kids could be made to disappear before Rogers takes the mound on Saturday. Watson knows that just because the owner has been passive thus far doesn't mean he will stay that way. And the g.m. admitted: "It's been a pretty tough sale for Mr. Steinbrenner to have some household names supposedly to come in and do something. But myself, the scouts, Joe Torre and Mel Stottlemyre all believe this is the right way to go.
"The coaches have got to coach. The manager's got to manage. And there's only so much money you can spend and there's only so many kids you can trade. This organization gave up quite a few kids last year in trades and there's not that many left."
One thing that could change the Yankees' thinking in a hurry is the status of Pettitte, one of only two 11-game winners in the league, but a pitcher with tightness in his left elbow. "That's a wild card in this whole thing," conceded Watson, who awaits a workout by Pettitte today that will determine if the left-hander starts on Sunday or heads to the disabled list.
Watson's protective stance over the Yankees' pool of minor league untouchables leaves few other avenues for action. The club could pick over other teams' castoffs. But the Yankees opted not to go near Greg Swindell, a hard thrower both Watson and Stottlemyre were familiar with from their days in Houston. "We just didn't want to go down that path," Watson said of the pitcher the Astros released and Cleveland subsequently signed.
The Yankees did sign Wally Whitehurst after the former Met-turned-journeyman was released last week from Montreal's farm system. Whitehurst is trying to win favor in the minors by outdoing pitchers like the shellshocked Kamieniecki.
But let's face it: The answer can't be Wally Whitehurst, a pitcher who last appeared in the majors in 1994 -- when he and his 4-7 record and 4.92 e.r.a. were released by San Diego. If the Boehringers and the Mendozas aren't the answers, either, Watson will have to go trawling. The waters may look more appealing if that fishing expedition coincides with the inevitable fire sale conducted by noncontenders seeking to dump salaries.
And what if Kansas City decides to unload a Kevin Appier or Cincinnati a John Smiley or Toronto a Juan Guzman? Could any of the above be the next pennant-stretch find, a la David Cone?
"Those are guys in another echelon," Watson acknowledged. "But the thing of it is, I've got those kinds of guys coming back myself -- Key, Perez and, knock on wood, Cone. So I've always told everybody I would listen to anything if it made baseball sense and economic sense. Some of these don't make either."

HEADLINE: Alarm Bells Sounding as Suburbs Gobble Up California's Richest Farmland

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif.

 BODY:
Born and raised in this, the most fruitful farm county in America, David Mas Masumoto sighed as his van passed the pastel swaths of suburbia that have displaced many of the vivid orchards, vineyards and strawberry fields of his childhood.
As if mocking the vanished bounty, the clusters of ranch houses, lawns and new blacktop here in Fresno County bear faux-farm names like Vineyard Glen and Harvest Park. The names brought a sad smile from Mr. Masumoto, a peach grower. 
 "Ironically, it's only a harvest of houses," he said. "Meanwhile, in the last hour, one acre of farmland has been yanked out somewhere in the Central Valley."
The lament over uncontrolled growth is virtually California's state anthem. The signature method of planning -- or failing to plan -- development has always been simple sprawl.
But now that breakneck suburbanization has come to the sunny Central Valley, the incomparable cornucopia of 250 crops that fill supermarket produce sections from New York to Anchorage, it is prompting a new groundswell of alarm. The concern is reaching as far as Congress and as near as individual farmers like Mr. Masumoto.
"If growth patterns don't change, the Central Valley will become another Los Angeles," said Ralph Grossi, president of the American Farmland Trust, a national nonprofit group seeking to protect farmland. "In our view, it's a national treasure, a strategic resource that needs to be protected."
The Central Valley, the 50-mile-wide basin between the Pacific coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada, stretches 300 miles from above Sacramento in the north to below Bakersfield in the south. Agriculture experts say the Valley has the richest farmland in the United States and perhaps the world.
A recent report of the American Farmland Trust, based on the California Department of Finance's projections of current growth rates, found that the Valley's population would triple by 2040 to 12 million and that housing would eat up more than 1 million of the 6.7 million acres of irrigated Valley farmland.
Rudy Platzek, an urban planner, predicts that by 2080, only about one lifetime from now, the Valley will not even be able to feed itself, let alone continue to harvest its current $13 billion in produce each year. Mr. Platzek's work is the cover story for California Farmer magazine this month under the apocalyptic headline, "An Urban Central Valley?"
Such projections have mobilized a variety of groups to start agitating for better protection of farmland, from the first Farmland Protection Caucus, formed in Congress this year, to local groups like the proposed Fresno County Growth Alternatives Task Force.
Last fall, the California Legislature passed a statewide cropland protection program to help compensate farmers who prohibit development on their land, and the farm bill signed by President Clinton this year provides for the first time for Federal matching matching for states with such programs.
The Central Valley is not the only place with the problem of urban sprawl; in South Florida, suburbia is expanding especially rapidly into rich farmland. Nationwide, one million acres of productive farmland gives way to development each year.
The change is most dramatic in places like Fresno, where signs promising inexpensive houses, "from the $90's," or dangling the prospect of "$760 a month and you're home" draw escapees from the nearly New York-level prices around San Francisco and Los Angeles.
In 1994, Fresno County alone turned out $3 billon in agriculture produce, $500 million more than the second-most-productive American county, Tulare, just to the south.
The Valley's population growth stems both from the influx of house-seekers and from the big families still common among the large Hispanic and Southeast Asian immigrant populations, officials say. Its growth has proceeded apace in recent years despite the slowdown in Southern California's economy.
The subdivisions in Clovis, just north of Fresno, are springing up so fast that they leave the likes of Tua Yang, a tenant strawberry farmer originally from Laos, shuttling from one plot to another as houses and streets eat up cropland.
Last year, Mr. Yang said, he grew a healthy crop of strawberries on four acres. This year, that land is occupied by the California Rosewood Collection development, its houses on "extra large lots" sprouting as fast as mushrooms after rain.
The Yangs had invested in fumigation of their land that would have lasted for two years, they said, but they had to move after one. This year's crop, on less productive land, is small and misshapen.
"It gives me a heartache to see that my parents have been pushed out," said Xua Yang, 27, Mr. Yang's daughter. "It hurts."
The coalescing alliances of farmers, conservationists and politicians seeking to protect farmland acknowledge that growth and development in the Valley are inevitable. They say they are fighting for smarter growth and coordinated zoning that preserves active farmland and requires housing to be denser, thus using up less land.
The American Farmland Trust report calculated that if Central Valley developments averaged six houses per acre -- instead of the current three -- 500,000 acres of farmland would be saved by 2040.
That leaves would-be preservers of farmland with the task of persuading the American people to relinquish the four-bedroom, half-acre suburban dream. It is not an easy task, they acknowledge.
"We can't seem to associate quality of life with any development pattern except the traditional single-family house with your fence and your yard,' said Karen Humphrey, Mayor of Fresno from 1989 to 1993 and now a planning consultant.
Many Central Valley cities and towns do draw zoning lines around themselves and try to limit sprawl, but they tend to lack the political will to stand against market pressures.
Advocates of farmland protection are also pushing for "conservation easements," in which private, state or Federal money could compensate farmers who prohibit development on their land rather than selling out for a retirement nest egg. For example, the California measure passed last year created a program to help compensate farmers who write into the deeds of their property that it can be used only for agriculture.
The difference between selling farmland to a developer and selling it for continued farming can be giant, said Bill Allison, manager of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. Around here, farmland sells for $10,000 to $15,000 an acre, while development land goes for more than $50,000, Mr. Allison said.
That gap leaves farmers divided over plans that might keep them from realizing top profit for their land after years of sweat.
Mr. Masumoto, a writer as well as a farmer, whose latest book about his organic farm is "Epitaph for a Peach" (Harper Collins 1995), said many farmers despaired about their prospects for continuing farming when growth encroaches. As the land around the farmers is suburbanized, the competition for water mounts, and neighbors do not take kindly to typical farm activities like the spraying of pesticides and early-morning tractor work.
"It's tough because the battlegrounds aren't on our farms," he said. "They're at public hearings and in politicians' offices, and we're not used to that. We're used to working on our own territory."
It is also a subtle battle that the farmland preservers are waging, one that requires trying to influence thousands of local decisions that, taken together, determine the shape of the Valley's development.
The American Farmland Trust says it is making progress in getting out the word that denser development is better, that states need programs to conserve farmland and that sprawl means scarcer water as well as higher taxes because it saps municipal services.
But old hands like Mr. Allison at the Farm Bureau, wonder whether anything can really stop growth. Fifty years ago, he noted, Los Angeles County, not Fresno County, was the country's most productive farming county; now it is a megalopolis.
Mr. Allison said he did not know who could say, No, you can't build on this farmland. After all, he said, "it's been going on since the white settlers came here."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Brewers localize their ad campaigns to get the down home flavor into their Texas commercials.

BYLINE: By David Barboza 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THE nation's premier brewers are jockeying for position in one of the largest markets -- Texas, and the resulting trend is a three-headed stallion galloping around the bend in advertising's latest sport: regional marketing.
While most major brands start nationwide print and television ad blitzes, large beer producers such as Miller, Budweiser and Coors are increasingly turning toward regionalized marketing -- the use of state and regional themes, icons, mannerisms and even stereotypes -- to take aim at consumers in distinctive states like Texas. 
 For instance, in recent years, the three big brewers have conjured up tornadoes, dust storms, rodeos and Tejano music fests in their television spots, hoping portrayals of such Texas perennials will appeal to native tastes. And while California has inspired Bud Light's "Left Coast, Right Beer" campaign, Texas can boast of having its flag used as the backdrop in beer advertising spots.
"In Texas, we just completed a stand-alone campaign," said Susan Henderson, director of marketing at the Miller Brewing Company in St. Louis, which recently broke its "Livin' Grande" campaign with the Tejano music star Emilio Navaira. "The creative message is increasingly becoming localized and there is no better example than Texas."
While leading brands often supplement their national spots with regional ads in big states like California and Florida, Texas is one of the few states where regional pushes have spawned national campaigns, such as Miller's "Life is Good" theme and Bud Light's "Spot Light" campaign. As a result, brewers say that success here has yielded a variation on Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.'s insight that "all politics is local."
Miller Lite, Bud Light and Coors Light have all adopted the ubiquitous icon of the state of Texas in their campaigns. While Miller frames its neon signs in the shape of Texas, a single can of Bud Light casts a shadow shaped like Texas on regional billboards.
"Texas is a different state of mind," Victor Ornelas, president of Ornelas & Associates in Dallas, an advertising agency that aims at the Hispanic market, said. "And the best way to demonstrate to the consumer that we understand and embrace your life style, your culture and your history is to do this type of advertising."
Although some attribute these Texas-specific campaigns to the pride people take in their culture here, others note that Texans buy nearly 17 million barrels of beer a year, more beer than is consumed in Ireland and Portugal combined, according to the Beer Institute, a trade group in Washington.
With so much revenue at stake, some ad executives say brewers are more willing to invest extra money to supplement national campaigns with Texas spots, or to have an entirely fresh, stand-alone campaign.
"Increasingly, brewers are tending to localize their campaigns," said Benjamin Steinman, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter based in West Nyack, N.Y. "It's the age-old cliche: they want to get closer to the customer."
Mr. Steinman and others also say that while national brewers are extremely competitive, growth has been sluggish. "Everybody's fighting for a bigger piece of a pie that's not growing," he said. "What's really growing at a rapid rate are smaller brewers."
In fact, some suggest that the explosive growth of microbrews has helped expand regional marketing efforts. In Texas alone, sales of specialty beers rose 40 percent last year, and many of those smaller breweries are pushing their homespun Texas ties.
For instance, ads for one of the state's fastest-growing microbrews, Shiner Bock, brewed at the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Tex., proclaim, "For Those Who Wish Texas Was Still Independent."
Meanwhile, ads for Ziegen Bock, the beer the Anheuser-Busch Companies created just for Texas, refer to the microbrew as a "Texas Beer with a German Accent." One print ad, created by Gleason Calise Associates in Dallas, portrays the Texas state flag, using froth and brown lager.
While only a few national advertisers, like the Coca-Cola Company, have substituted regional marketing for national spots, beer marketers insist it is a proven strategy. "The Texas campaign allows us to take it to the grass roots," said Jim Schumacker, director of marketing for Bud Light in St. Louis, who noted that sales of the beer are up 26 percent in Texas this year.
So when Bud Light was looking to translate its "Ladies Night" spots for a Texas audience, it hired DDB Needham Dallas and its Texas-born chief creative director, Jim Ferguson, to develop television spots of its cross-dressing comedians touring Texas and winning a beehive hairdo contest.
Mr. Ferguson, who returned to Texas after 10 years at Leo Burnett in Chicago, said it opened up a burst of creative energy. After viewing the new Texas "Ladies Night" spots on a television monitor in his office, he chuckled and said: "You couldn't do big hair in New York. They wouldn't get it."

Gray Hair And Golden Ambitions

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
GRAY hair. You don't expect to see an Olympic track and field athlete with gray hair, but less than two weeks away from his 35th birthday on July 1, Carl Lewis has gray hair.
Not much. Just some flecks in his black hair that he has been known to dye, but those flecks are gray. 
 "I kind of like that gray hair," he has said. "It ties in with everything else about this year."
Yes, this year, the year he now has made the United States Olympic team for a fifth time, including in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter ordered an American boycott of the Summer Games in Moscow because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.
In his three other Olympic years, it was never a matter of his having to make the team, only how many gold medals he would win. Over all, his number turned out to be eight: four in 1984 at Los Angeles, two in 1988 at Seoul, South Korea, and two in 1992 at Barcelona, Spain.
Most people think of Carl Lewis as a sprinter, but he soared to the gold medal in the long jump in each of the last three Summer Games. He has another two golds in the 100-meter dash, one in the 200 and two in the 4x100 relay.
And last night in the Olympic trials in the new Olympic Stadium, in a long jump that began with rumbles of thunder and flashes of lightning in the Georgia sky, he made the Olympic team again after having missed Saturday in the 100.
He is the first male track and field athlete to qualify for five American teams. Willye White qualified for five consecutive women's teams from 1956 through 1972.
"Once you get to the Olympics, anyone can win," Lewis was saying now. "And even if I make the team in the 200, there's nothing before the long jump for me."
Qualifying starts tomorrow in the 200 for Sunday afternoon's final, but even if he doesn't finish in the top three, as a member of the Olympic team, he could be inserted in the 4x100 relay, a possible 10th gold medal. But for all his gold medals as a sprinter, the long jump has always been his best event.
"And it's my favorite event," he said. "Before high school it was the only event I had success in. It's always been there for me."
It was there again last night, by one inch. Had Mike Conley, the Olympic triple jump gold medalist at Barcelona, not aborted his final jump on the runway after having felt a strain in his left hamstring following his fifth jump, he might have knocked Lewis out of third place and off the team.
Instead, with a leap of 27 feet 2 3/4 inches on his second jump, Lewis made the team with Mike Powell, who soared 27-6 1/2 on his final jump, and Joe Greene, who leaped 27-4 1/2.
In other eras, Olympic track and field athletes seldom competed long enough to develop gray hair. For decades they had to get a real job or exist on what was inside the envelopes slipped under the table by meet promoters.
Jesse Owens, for example, sprinted and long-jumped to four Olympic gold medals in 1936 at Berlin, but upon his return, his financial reward was a virtual circus act: racing a horse.
But the timing of Lewis's career blended with the timing of the change in Olympic economics. Just as he arrived on the scene, the International Olympic Committee woke up to reality. It permitted world-class track and field athletes to keep meet-appearance money and income from endorsements and commercials.
Jesse Owens had to race a horse. Carl Lewis could race a stock tip or a mutual fund or a bank's interest rate.
Win or lose in the Olympics next month, Lewis deserves the victory ceremony he never had for the 100 at Seoul. He was declared the winner there after Ben Johnson was stripped of the gold medal, as well as his world record of 9.79 seconds, and banned for four years after having tested positive for anabolic steroids.
"He was handed his gold medal in an office," said Jim Dunaway, a self-described "track nut" for four decades, who is now an on-line sports columnist on the World Wide Web.
Dunaway has campaigned for an eighth victory ceremony for Lewis. "We owe him that victory ceremony, the one that Ben Johnson robbed him of," he said. "The place to do it is in Atlanta."
And the way to do it is to drape that Seoul gold medal over Carl Lewis's head for all to see, even if that head had some flecks of gray.

HEADLINE: Bill Aims to Bar Iran Investment From Overseas

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today unanimously passed harsh economic sanctions against foreign companies that invest in Iran, widening the split between the United States and its allies over the use of American economic power to force other nations to isolate rogue states.
The White House has already said President Clinton is likely to sign the legislation, which would require the President to choose at least two sanctions against any business that invests more than $40 million in Iranian oil and gas development. Among the more severe sanctions would be a measure barring American banks from lending more than $10 million to the offending companies, and another that would exclude those companies from exporting any goods or services to the United States. 
 The bill also calls for less severe sanctions against Libya for its role in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, which killed 270 people.
A similar bill passed the Senate in December and it is widely expected that the Senate will adopt the House version or something close to it.
The action today was the second time this year that Congress, with the Administration's blessing, has threatened to punish foreign companies in an effort to bring other countries' trade policies in line with Washington's efforts to isolate another nation; the first action was directed at Cuba.
The State Department warned top executives of Canadian and Mexican companies last week that they may be barred from entering the United States because their companies do business with Cuba. The legislation that led to that warning, the Helms-Burton Act, has already caused sharp exchanges with America's biggest trading partners, most recently during a meeting between President Clinton and leaders of the European Union.
Other nations argue that the United States has no right to impose sanctions against companies not based in the United States, and point out that Washington fought such secondary boycotts when Arab nations threatened foreign companies that did business with Israel.
They are expected to repeat those arguments to Mr. Clinton next week, at the annual meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries. The three-day meeting begins next Thursday in Lyons, France.
European officials said today that they were likely to take the United States to the new court of international trade disputes, the World Trade Organization in Geneva, in an effort to force the United States to overturn the legislation or suffer trade sanctions. That would mark the first major showdown over international trade policy at the organization, which the United States fought to create.
But in the interim, some countries may retaliate; Canada is so angry about the Cuba legislation that it is ordering its companies to ignore the American threats.
Cuba, however, is a tiny market. Iran, in contrast, is the site of billions of dollars in European oil investment, and it has been increasingly attractive to Asian companies that want to guarantee their access to oil supplies in the Middle East.
France has been particularly aggressive in investing there, and the Congressional legislation was sparked by a deal that Total S.A., a French oil company, signed with Iran after President Clinton forced Conoco Inc. to give up plans to develop two large offshore oilfields for Iran. The Conoco episode, involving what some analysts valued at $1 billion, led President Clinton to impose an embargo on all American investment in Iran. But not a single ally of the United States has joined the embargo.
It is hard to determine how many companies will be affected by the sanctions because the bill affects future investments in the oil sector, rather than existing foreign-financed operations in Iran. But a number of French and German companies, along with oil-service companies in Japan and South Korea, among other countries, are likely to be the first to face the question of whether to defy the measure.
Today, seeking to deflect criticism from abroad, Administration officials took the offensive, arguing that only the United States has shown the courage to use its economic power against terrorist states.
"You know, when the G-7 meets we all agree that these issues about terrorism are important, and we all ought to do something," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in his office this morning. "And then we are the only ones who do anything."
At the State Department, Nicholas Burns, the spokesman, said: "We think it's very important to isolate Iran economically. And here we have a difference of opinion with some of our allies in Europe, because of Iran's intention to build a nuclear weapons capability. And we are convinced that that is what Iran intends to do." Iran and Libya are both on the State Department's list of nations that support terrorism.
The legislation that passed in the House today is considerably watered down from a bill first proposed last year by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York. He sought to punish foreign companies that conduct any trade with Iran -- rather than those that invest heavily there -- and he sought the most severe punishment Washington can muster: banning them from selling their products in the United States.
The White House argued that that measure was too inflexible, and spent months negotiating with Mr. D'Amato and others on the wording of the bill that passed today, 415 to 0. It gives the President far more discretion to calibrate sanctions as he wishes against companies that invest more than $40 million in Iran in a year. While the figure sounds high, it is considered fairly minimal in the oil business, where the costs of finding and developing offshore oil fields are often staggering.
The menu of sanctions include some that are considered relatively minor: denying loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which helps American companies invest in projects abroad, and denying export licenses for United States goods to companies investing in Iran.
Other potential sanctions, however, are more severe. The President could, for example, bar American banks from making loans of more than $10 million to companies or countries that are sanctioned, and he could bar financial institutions that violate the embargo from serving as primary dealers in United States Government bonds, cutting them out of a very lucrative business on world financial markets. He could also ban the offending companies from selling goods to the United States Government and he could bar all imports from the foreign companies.
Many in the business community, however, say they fear the legislation will ultimately hurt American companies. "It will force many U.S. companies to avoid the international arena," said Robin West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company. Other oil industry executives said they expected the bill would hurt oil-service companies hoping to enter joint ventures with European and Asian companies.
"The Germans are absolutely apopleptic about this bill," Mr. West added. "Throughout Europe, there is a fear that Congress will use this kind of mechanism more and more to preempt the foreign economic policy of other countries."
But in Congress and within the White House, the predominant view is that Europe invited this action by failing to face up to evidence that Iran is still sponsoring terrorism and seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.

Fake Cards Thwart Efforts to End Pinball Scams

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 19

 BODY:
Why is it that every time someone gambles with metal, the Sumitomo Corporation takes a bath? Everyone knows by now of the $1.8 billion loss that was caused by a rogue trader in copper futures. But only a month ago, Sumitomo was in the headlines as a victim of one of the largest electronic crimes in history -- involving, of all things, pinball.
The Japanese fritter away billions of dollars a year sitting in garish parlors playing pachinko, a pinball-like game that is a form of gambling. The infatuation has long been considered a corrupting social force: some parlor owners evade taxes and funnel cash to organized crime, and profits of Korean parlor owners are a big source of cash for North Korea's teetering economy. 
 So it seemed like a good idea when the National Police Agency, with help from Sumitomo and other blue-chip companies, hatched a plan to tame the pachinko industry.
The solution? Get rid of the cash and encourage players to use prepaid magnetic cards, similar to those used in the subways in Washington, San Francisco and New York.
The problem was that counterfeiters figured out how to forge the cards, despite assurances by the card's creator, Japan's main telephone company, that this would be next to impossible. The result: the system meant to deter crime instead created more of it.
When the dust had settled, the two companies that had issued the cards -- one backed by Sumitomo and one by the Mitsubishi Corporation -- reported last month that they had lost almost $600 million, and Japan Inc. had suffered another profound embarrassment.
The pachinko caper echoes far beyond Japan, serving as a cautionary tale as the world moves toward digital cash, with money reduced to ones and zeros on a card or in a computer. It could be far easier to manipulate computer codes than to rob a bank or create counterfeit bills.
"This is a tip-of-the-iceberg problem," said Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI International, a research institute in Menlo Park, Calif. "You are going to put a lot of money out there and someone is going to figure out how to take it away from you."
The forged pachinko cards were "an almost endless source of money," lamented Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi. Its Nippon Leisure Card System Company lost 55 billion yen, or about $510 million. Mitsubishi itself, which owned 19 percent of the card company, set aside 5 billion yen, or $46 million, to cover its share of the losses.
Sumitomo was luckier because its pachinko card subsidiary, the Nippon Game Card Company, focused on Osaka while the forgers congregated in Tokyo. Nippon Game Card lost 8 billion yen, or about $75 million, small enough that it still managed to turn a profit for the last fiscal year.
The losses show the risks Japan's trading companies are incurring as they diversify. Their traditional business is diminishing with Japanese companies now able to handle importing and exporting by themselves. Until the recent counterfeiting headaches, pachinko cards had been a fast-growing business for Sumitomo.
And for Japan as a whole, the forgeries serve as a rude awakening.
Electronic security is not rigorous here, in part out of a general belief that people are honest. But Japan is no longer isolated. Indeed, of the 1,400 people arrested for making, using or selling counterfeit pachinko cards between January 1995 and April 1996, more than 900 were foreigners, many of them members of Chinese gangs.
Experts say it is not too difficult to forge cards that feature magnetic stripes, both credit cards and prepaid cards. But the prepaid cards are widely used -- especially in Japan, where many pay phones no longer even accept coins -- because they are convenient and are less expensive than newer, more secure cards imbedded with computer chips.
The stripes, not much different from magnetic tape, can be copied just as tapes can be dubbed. And just as it is easy to record one song over another on a cassette, with the proper equipment new information can be written on a magnetic stripe, adding value to a card. To forge telephone cards, criminals steal public phones, which have card-writing mechanisms inside, then figure out how to write the desired information.
In most cases, there is only a limited incentive to counterfeit a card. There are only so many long-distance calls one can make or trains one can ride. The only way to turn a counterfeit phone or train card into money is to sell it.
Forged pachinko cards, though, can be converted almost directly into cash. Criminals use the forged cards to get pachinko balls, which, like casino chips, can be cashed in for money. One does not even have to play the game.
Pachinko is basically a vertical pinball game in which the goal is to win more balls.
Because gambling is technically illegal in Japan, the player is not supposed to be permitted to turn the balls in for cash, only for prizes like a box of cookies or a watch. But players in the know opt for seemingly worthless trinkets, which they take to a window in a nearby back alley and exchange for a set amount of cash.
Pachinko is big business. There are more than 18,000 pachinko parlors, each beckoning with neon lights, and 4.7 million machines, or about one for every 26 Japanese. Some 300 million prepaid pachinko cards are issued each month. The parlors' annual revenues are estimated at $300 billion, roughly matching the worldwide sales of Japan's 11 auto makers.
Customers sit shoulder to shoulder on small stools in a haze of cigarette smoke, staring as if in a trance at falling balls. The Japanese, it is said, can find solitude in the anonymity of the pachinko parlor and peace amid the cacophonous din of boinging balls, beeping machines, rock music and constant exhortations over loudspeakers.
Players can easily fritter away $100 in half an hour. And while some players can win hundreds of dollars in a day, the odds favor the house. Players buy balls for about 4 yen apiece but cash them in for only 2.5 yen.
The move toward prepaid cards began in the late 1980's, when the two companies were started to provide cards and card machines, with some former police officials in their executive ranks. The NTT Data Communications Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, supplied the card technology.
Since pachinko operators need police permission to open a shop, it was not hard for the police to persuade parlors to adopt the card systems. Now, 70 percent of parlors have card-reading machines.
Officials of the pachinko industry say they worried about forgeries from the beginning because there had long been a problem with the forging of phone cards. But officials said they were assured by NTT Data that the pachinko cards would be more secure. "Every time we asked they said, 'Don't worry,' " said Mamoru Uchida, secretary general of the Japan Pachinko Hall Industry Association.
They turned out to be anything but secure.
The magazine Weekly Asahi quoted an anonymous boss of a forging ring describing the feeding frenzy at one Tokyo parlor: "About 300 people, all with forged cards and 80 percent of them foreigners, lined up in front of the shop at 6 A.M. When the shop opened at 10, the 'customers' rushed in to get to the card-reading machines."
Another problem was the way the system was set up. Card companies are paid when cards are bought. Then, when a card is used to buy balls, the card company reimburses the shop, minus a commission.
The parlors thus are reimbursed whether the player uses a real card or a fake. Parlor operators not only have little incentive to stop forged cards -- some who tried ended up being stabbed -- but fake cards actually help their business.
In a few cases, parlor owners -- some not the most reputable characters to begin with -- fed fake cards into machines themselves to inflate their revenues.
Ryozo Ohno, an executive at NTT Data, said the pachinko cards have three security features. The card itself, made of a sophisticated magnetic material, is physically hard to fabricate. The data on the card are encrypted. And multiple magnetic levels introduce interference that makes it hard to simply copy the data.
The first two, it turns out, did not help much, he said. Forgers did not need to fabricate cards -- they simply used old ones, filling the punched holes that indicated the card had been used. And the encryption did not matter because the forgers did not need to break the code -- they simply copied information from a legitimate card.
The difficulty in reading and writing data did prevent wide-scale copying for a time, Mr. Ohno said. But people eventually figured out how to build card-copying machines.
To help in the process, counterfeiters stole card-reading machines from pachinko parlors. Some 127 machines were stolen from a parlor in Fukushima Prefecture, north of Tokyo, in what appeared to be an inside job. And industry officials say card machines mysteriously vanished from parlors that collapsed in last year's earthquake in Kobe.
Now, the losses from forgers are on the wane. The card companies stopped the use of cards worth 5,000 yen and 10,000 yen, or about $50 and $100, leaving only smaller denominations in use. And they are getting tougher with parlors that tolerate fake cards.
NTT Data and the two card companies are now working on a new, more secure system that will involve magnetic stripes plus some other technology to insure authenticity.
Other companies hope to enter the field with different technologies.
The Advance Company, a Tokyo maker of encryption technology, hopes to see its encoding techniques used. The American Banknote Corporation, a New York company that prints food stamps, Treasury checks and other value-laden documents, is working with a group of Japanese companies on a system using holography to verify the authenticity of pachinko cards, said Morris Weissman, chairman and chief executive.
The president of Nippon Leisure Card was recently changed. And Mr. Ohno of NTT Data is now sadder but wiser.
"Electronic money, digital cash, the Internet -- it's so convenient and so many people envision a dreamy future," he said. "But once you consider the security, it's quite vulnerable."

HEADLINE: EUROPE, DOWNSIZED -- A special report.;
In Europe, a Wave of Layoffs Stuns White-Collar Workers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
Downsizing is coming to Western Europe's white-collar workers, and fast. It is straining families, communities and politics on a continent on which 11 percent of available workers are already unemployed, double the rate in the United States.
Many of the discarded workers are people in their 50's who take large early-retirement packages and suffer little if any financial hardship, like Heinz Thannheiser, a 57-year-old lawyer and manager at a Munich bank. He will give up his $83,000-a-year job for a lump sum that combined with generous government benefits will assure him a comfortable retirement. 
 But these generous packages are burdening European companies and governments, which provide supplemental benefits for people who lose their jobs. And this is happening even as businesses try to cut their costs and as European nations try to impose a financial austerity so they can meet the strict requirements necessary to introduce a single currency by 1999. As a result, many Europeans expect that future severance packages will be far less generous.
As early retirements prove insufficient for companies looking to cut costs, the downsizing is spreading to younger workers like Daniel Roux, a 33-year-old bond salesman laid off earlier this year by a Paris bank not long after being told how important he would be in the company's expansion. After some looking, Mr. Roux found another job, but the expectation is that such searches will become increasingly difficult.
The swiftness and size of the cuts have shocked many people on a continent where cradle-to-grave security was a given and where companies played a big role in assuring that. A lifetime job is increasingly a thing of the past.
"As in the United States in the 1980's, the cold shower is hitting us," said Kurt Vogler-Ludwig, a labor-market expert at the IFO Institute for Economic Research in Munich. "The net effect on jobs is negative. The positive side is only in share prices. It has gone faster than anyone thought possible."
For more than a decade after downsizing began in earnest in the United States around 1980, European nations were able to resist the tactic because of a web of government restrictions that helped discourage layoffs. Given the difficulty of dismissing workers except in dire situations, European business became exceedingly cautious about adding employees and about taking risks on new investments that might create even more jobs. The result, experts now agree, is that employment growth stagnated and European businesses, including those in technology, telecommunications and finance, developed a hardening of the arteries that threatened to leave them further and further behind in global competition.
As businesses in other parts of the world, including the United States, have streamlined, European companies have become downright uncompetitive. At the same time, they are feeling mounting pressure from shareholders, tempted by higher returns elsewhere, to reduce costs to widen profit margins. Hence the job cuts.
[On Wednesday, for example, shares of the French appliance maker Moulinex soared 21 percent after the company disclosed plans to cut as many as 2,600 jobs, a fifth of its work force.]
European jobs have been evaporating for more than two decades in farming and in industries like steel and mining. The number of people working in these businesses fell by about 15 percent, to about 64 million between 1980 and 1993, when excluding workers in the former East Germany.
Now, however, the cuts are spreading to white-collar employees, previously considered immune, and even at companies that are profitable. In the economically healthy decade ending in 1992, the number of people working in service industries like banking and insurance rose more than 20 percent, to nearly 104 million, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But in 1993, the latest year for which figures were available, the number of service workers fell 3 percent, and everyone agrees the number has continued to fall since then, with further losses expected.
Worsening the problem is that far fewer jobs have been created in European nations than in the United States, meaning fewer opportunities for those cast off. The United States, which has only about two-thirds as many people working as Europe, has added a net total of 24 million jobs to its economy since 1980, while the European Union increased the number of people with jobs by fewer than nine million, excluding workers in eastern Germany. And, as in the United States, many of the new jobs are either part time or of limited duration, with lower pay and fewer benefits than was customary.
Jobs will be the main topic on June 21 and 22, when European heads of state and government leaders meet in Florence. And next month, when the annual gathering of leaders of seven major industrial powers takes place in France, unemployment will be an important subject.
Downsizing is a particularly sticky topic because lifetime employment is so ingrained here. Many economists and business people say that only by giving employers more leeway in firing and hiring can Europe hope to remain competitive. But the idea is still repulsive to many Europeans. Mr. Vogler-Ludwig, the Munich labor expert, said the fundamental questions would be: "With what rules can you construct a flexible system? Where is the optimal point between structure and flexibility?"
 
The Scope
From Olivetti To Big Banks
Hiring continues in some businesses, of course, like software development and entertainment. But in many others, the cuts have been large.
Olivetti S.p.A., Italy's giant office equipment and telecommunications company, nearly halved its work force to fewer than 30,000 employees from 58,000 in 1989 as part of a recovery plan after years of losses. Explaining the job cuts, many of them managers, Olivetti's chairman, Carlo De Benedetti, said the company had "underestimated the rapidity of change in the industry, and the pressure on margins."
And, likening the magnitude of his job cuts to those by American companies, he added, "That is half of the company, the way I.B.M. or Digital Equipment did it."
Olivetti is no longer alone. In Italy, more than 70,000 middle- and upper-level managers have been laid off since 1992. In France last year, 10 of the largest banks and corporations, including Credit Lyonnais and Michelin, cut more than 25,000 jobs, their first significant reduction. In Germany, labor unions are bracing for major job cuts in banking, insurance and telecommunications.
Among the hardest hit have been major centers of financial services like London, where, according to the British Bankers Association, more than 81,000 banking jobs have been slashed since 1991. Others, like Paris, Frankfurt and Munich, are certain to follow.
Large layoffs also loom in telecommunications, where state-owned giants are trimming down for privatization. Already, British Telecommunications, which went private a decade ago, has cut employment by 90,000, or more than a third of the total. In Germany, Deutsche Telekom foresees eliminating 70,000 jobs, or about a third of the total, by the year 2000.
Large mergers, once rare, are becoming more common and costing jobs. The recent merger of two of Switzerland's largest chemical and pharmaceutical companies, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, will lead to a 10 percent cut in jobs worldwide, including more than 6,000 in Europe.
 
The Approach
Early Retirement Versus Layoffs
What distinguishes jobs eliminated in Europe from cuts in the United States is that by far the largest number have come through early retirement, rather than by laying off younger workers. In Germany, the average retirement age is now 57, down from around 60 a decade ago; in France, only one in four employees reaching 60, the retirement age for most, is still employed.
Generous severance agreements assure European employees retirement benefits that most Americans can only envy. The package awaiting Mr. Thannheiser when he leaves the bank on Sept. 1 is typical.
Mr. Thannheiser helped manage the legal department at Germany's sixth-largest bank, Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank. After the fall of the Berlin wall, Hypo Bank, as it is called, joined dozens of other German banks in a rush into formerly Communist East Germany, opening 80 branches. At its Munich headquarters, support services like data processing and legal affairs were beefed up to handle the expected new business.
But the hoped-for turnaround in eastern Germany has been slow in coming, and last year Hypo Bank asked consultants at McKinsey & Company how to cut costs. Part of the answer was to cut 600 of 3,000 jobs at headquarters, including Mr. Thannheiser's.
Under an accord reached with unions (most white-collar Europeans are represented by unions), Hypo Bank will pay Mr. Thannheiser about $170,000 in severance, or about twice his annual salary.
In addition, he will qualify for unemployment benefits roughly equal to 65 percent of his final pay; their start will be delayed by about six to nine months because of the amount of his severance package. Those benefits will support him until he turns 60 in two years, when he will qualify for a monthly pension paid from the Government social security fund, his bank's pension plan, and a labor union pension fund. That payment will be only slightly less than his final salary.
Since his house near Munich is paid off, his wife, a physical therapist, works, and his daughter, 27, a cabinet maker, is independent, Mr. Thannheiser acknowledges that from a material point of view he is well off and, like many such workers, doesn't need to find a new job. Yet, he says: "To put it brutally, I sold my job. And it is a shock to know you're not needed."
As companies decide that early-retirement packages like Mr. Thannheiser's are too expensive, they are looking for younger workers to cut as well. This is what happened to Mr. Roux at Banque Nationale. Hired two years ago when the bank was bent on expanding bond sales and trading, Mr. Roux, now 33 and with two small children, was one of many employees, mostly traders and sales personnel, who found themselves on the street when management decided earlier this year to retrench. Unlike Mr. Thannheiser, Mr. Roux received only several months pay as severance.
 
The Solutions
New Attempts To Create Jobs?
The prospect of younger Europeans like Mr. Roux without employment has ignited an impassioned debate among European leaders about how to create new jobs. There is a growing awareness that Europe's future prosperity, even its political stability, hinges on its ability to allow more Europeans to remain productive longer.
Indeed, companies and governments must bear the growing cost of unemployment and retirement benefits. That merely accelerates the exodus of jobs from Europe to America and East Asia where personnel costs are lower.
In 1995, complains Friedhelm Ost, the chairman of the German Parliament's economics committee, German companies invested $73 billion overseas, while foreign investment in Germany totaled only $10 billion. "The more social costs rise, the fewer jobs there are and the more people have to pay to support the system," he said. "We must intervene to break the cycle."
Britain was the first to do something about this; in the 1980's it reduced the cost of benefits and overcame union opposition in simplifying hiring and firing.
Now, in Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has pledged to cut unemployment by half before the year 2000 with a legislative package designed to create jobs by cutting benefits like paid sick leave, simplifying the rules for part-time or temporary employment, and slashing the thicket of regulations regarding everything from environmental safeguards to the hours bread can be baked on Sundays.
As Germany goes, so often goes the rest of Europe. In Italy and Scandinavia, governments are also looking to cut social costs, clear regulatory obstacles, and allow part-time and temporary work.
Germany's powerful labor unions, for decades Europe's pace-setters in seeking to spawn jobs mainly by reducing the hours individual employees work, have begun a painful process of rethinking their beliefs.
Other countries, regardless of the politics of their governments, are following suit.
In Spain, the former Socialist-led government braved a general strike two years ago to enact legislation that made it easier for companies to fire people. Rigid employee protection laws, a relic of the Franco dictatorship, had given Spain a 23.9 percent unemployment rate, double the European average. The trend has now reversed, with job growth of more than 2 percent and the first drop in unemployment since 1991, to 22.7 percent.
In Italy, industry, unions and the new leftist-led Government are seeking agreement to make pay rates more flexible.
"It is absurd to have the same pay scales in our northeast, where the labor market is saturated, and in the south, where you have 50 percent youth unemployment," said Giampaolo Galli, chief economist of the Italian Industry Association.
Yet politically, Europeans are increasingly using the vote, or labor action, to protect the social safety net to which generations have grown accustomed.
When President Jacques Chirac told the French last year that they would have to brace for years of austerity -- lower pay raises and reductions in benefits, for example -- as the unavoidable cost of restoring economic growth, a wave of strikes forced the Government to backtrack. In Italy, the recent elections producing a coalition government that includes for the first time since World War II cabinet ministers from the once-Communist Party of the Democratic Left reflected concerns for the social net.
Thus many of the contemplated job-creating measures may prove elusive. After all, Europe is still a place with much less of a free-market spirit than the United States.
It was only recently that the German Government, after decades of debate, finally agreed to expand slightly the number of hours stores may remain open; most economists agree that more such liberalization will create jobs in retail trade. In France, protests by independent store owners were met by President Chirac with a pledge to halt by law the construction of large suburban shopping centers. [Moulinex's plans, announced Tuesday, to cut 2,600 jobs touched off a debate in the French Government, with Industry Minister Franck Borotra calling the job cuts unacceptable, but Finance Minister Jean Arthuis conceding that Moulinex "needed restructuring."]
"There's a feeling in Europe that the economy is like a static pie," said David L. Aaron, the United States Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in Paris, which is advising governments on job creation. "If you allow shopping centers in the suburbs, they believe, you won't have spending in the cities. We think you have to focus on increasing the size of the pie."
 
The Damage
Sense of Loyalty Turns to Betrayal
Many middle-aged Europeans leaving their jobs, born and bred in a more caring corporate world, fear abrupt change will strip their societies of the dedication and loyalty that were part of Europe's success.
Antonio Paolo Braghin, now 56, is one of 3,000 employees, many of them managers, who were let go five years ago by Olivetti. He says his hometown, Ivrea, Olivetti's headquarters, in northwest Italy, is a company town, and downsizing has shaken it. He remembers how the company used to runtraining schools and summer camps and donated libraries to the town. "The company that dismissed me is not the same one that hired me," he said.
Some Europeans emphasize that corporate paternalism created a sense of loyalty toward employees that was often repaid with dedication and greater effort. Gianni Petris, an overseas sales manager at Fiat, Italy's giant auto maker, was showing Fiat dealers from Thailand around Turin in 1994 when he got a letter telling him that, at age 50, he had been dismissed. He fondly recalls attending Fiat's day-care center as a child in a smock with "Fiat" embroidered on it.
"We never worked 8-hour days, but 10," Mr. Petris said. "When I took a trip abroad, if my appointments started Monday morning, I left Saturday, to start on time."
Formerly, he said, he preached to his son, Massimo, a student in Turin, "dedication, honesty and loyalty toward the company."
"Today, I have to tell him, 'Look, Massimo, it's all baloney.' "
He drives a Fiat; his son refuses to.
He distributes business cards that say, "Gianni G. Petris, Consultant," but there is little consulting work to be had.
Many of those let go feel robbed of a sense of purpose in their lives, as well as isolation, loss of social contacts and shame.
Gabriella Favero Flecchia, who ran a team of marketing managers at Fiat, lost her job at age 52 after 29 years with the company, and ever since has suffered from severe insomnia. "The next generation will say about us, 'They sacrificed themselves -- but for what,' " she said.
Still, some of the younger generation of Europeans appear to draw different conclusions. In Paris, Mr. Roux said he gives much thought to the future of his profession, and is prepared to accept that he may have to switch jobs, or at least functions, again in his career. After three months searching, Mr. Roux has found a job.
"I am perfectly conscious," he said, "that the old way of thinking is over in France."

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Upholds Law on Violence Against Women

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
For the first time, a Federal District Court judge has upheld the constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, a Federal law that made crimes against the opposite sex a violation of the victim's civil rights.
The judge, Janet Bond Arterton in New Haven, ruled in a case involving a Connecticut woman identified in court papers as Jane Doe. Her husband's lawyers had challenged the constitutionality of the civil rights provision as "an open and sweeping invitation to the Federal Government to intervene almost at will in almost any area of anyone's life." 
 But the judge, after reviewing the four-year legislative history of the statute and the conclusions that Congressional committees reached before the bill went to a vote, concluded that the Violence Against Women Act was "narrowly tailored and reasonably adopted to accomplish a constitutionally permitted end."
The woman suing under the 1994 law moved out of the couple's home in Darien, Conn., last year and now lives in Riverside, Conn. She said her husband repeatedly threatened to kill her, beat her and threw household objects at her. Her suit said he forced her "to be a 'slave' and perform all manual labor."
The civil rights provision allows women -- and men -- to file civil suits for crimes against the opposite sex. Lawyers say this gives women more legal options than they had in the past, when their only recourse was to rely on prosecutors who decide whether to file state charges in rape and sexual assault cases.
Judge Arterton ruled that the Violence Against Women Act does not block those legal remedies for victims of domestic abuse. "It complements them," she wrote, "by recognition of a societal interest in insuring that persons have a civil right to be free from gender-based violence."
Judge Arterton said it was appropriate for Congress to expand protection for victims of domestic violence because the United States House of Representatives had "found that both existing state and Federal criminal laws were inadequate to protect against gender-motivated violence."
Mrs. Doe's lawyer, Deborah S. Chang of Stamford, said the ruling was "a very detailed decision and I think it's important, especially for thousands and thousands of women who've been holding their breaths because of the importance of the statute."
The Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Mrs. Doe's arguments, as did the the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Julie Goldscheid, a lawyer with the fund, called Judge Arterton's decision "straightforward."
"But to us, Congress was acting well within its authority in enacting this law," she said.
Norman Pattis of New Haven, the husband's lawyer, termed the decision "frightening" because Judge Arterton upheld the idea that domestic violence was covered by the commerce clause of the Constitution. He had tried to liken the Violence Against Women Act to the Gun-Free Zones Act, a 1990 law that made possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school a Federal crime. The Supreme Court held that it was an impermissible violation of the commerce clause.
Enumerating her reasons why the Violence Against Women Act was covered by the commerce clause, Judge Arterton quoted a Senate report that said that "gender-based" crimes prevent women from "full participation in the national economy." The report said that to escape abusive spouses, victims of domestic violence often have to quit their jobs and move to quarters they cannot afford. It also said they often face health care expenditures because of the injuries they have sustained.
"The problem with Judge Arterton's decision is it falls prey to the Humpty-Dumpty syndrome: Congress can point at whatever it likes and, voila, it becomes commerce," Mr. Pattis said. "If that's the case, what's the limit of Federal power?"
Mr. Pattis said he would appeal Judge Arterton's ruling, which cleared the way for a trial on Mrs. Doe's original claims. Her lawsuit asserted that her husband had "systematically and continuously inflicted a violent pattern of physical and mental abuse and cruelty" over their 17-year marriage. It said she lived as a recluse from November 1993 to April 1995, "imprisoned in the house against her will, in continual and agonizing pain, with daily physical and mental torture."
The suit said her husband, identified in court papers as John Doe, had violent outbursts several times a week and had threatened to kill her, shouting that he was going to "bury you." It said he later kept a loaded shotgun in the house and threatened to kill her "on a weekly basis."
Mrs. Doe's complaint contended that Mr. Doe had affairs with at least 50 women and had a longtime relationship with a woman described as his mistress. Mrs. Doe also maintained that her husband had refused to have sex with her since 1982.

HEADLINE: New York Arrests 46 City Workers In Welfare Fraud

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

 BODY:
For the second time in a year, prosecutors have charged dozens of New York City employees with welfare fraud, accusing them of illegally obtaining thousands of dollars in public assistance while they were collecting city paychecks.
Forty-six current and former city workers, including several teachers, have been charged with grand larceny, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan and Commissioner of Investigation Howard Wilson announced yesterday. 
 Almost exactly a year ago, 100 city employees were charged with state and Federal welfare fraud. Yesterday's announcement was a result of a similar effort to weed out city employees fraudulently receiving welfare benefits, by matching listings of city workers with listings of welfare recipients. Most of those charged are relatively low-level employees, and officials said there was no indication that any of the suspects were acting together.
"The city's own employees corrupted the city's efforts to aid those in need," Mr. Wilson said in a statement.
Despite the fanfare with which last year's big fraud case was announced, the penalties that resulted from those charges were light. All 73 people who faced state charges admitted their guilt, but none received jail sentences, or even probation. Instead, they agreed to pay back most of the money illegally received -- about two-thirds in all, officials said -- and were barred from receiving any welfare benefits for six months.
In addition, 50 resigned or were dismissed from their city jobs, 11 had some other disciplinary action taken against them and 12 cases are pending.
"These were all people who had no prior records and were working people, and the amounts of money were relatively small," Mr. Morgenthau said, explaining why none were jailed. A spokesman for the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan was unable to give the disposition of last year's Federal cases yesterday afternoon.
Characterizing the economic status of the city employees charged both last year and this time, Mr. Morgenthau said: "They're certainly at the low end generally."
In the new case, besides the city employees, 20 others have been charged with fraudulently receiving subsidized housing, for a total of over $1 million in benefits illegally collected, officials said. Nineteen city employees were charged with receiving both cash benefits and subsidized housing for which they were ineligible.
Some of those city workers charged yesterday were paid as little as $18,988, like Sylvia McClain, an employee of the Board of Education accused of stealing $33,779 in welfare benefits and $24,191 in rent subsidies between January 1987 and July 1995. Officials said Ms. McClain failed to disclose her city income in applying for the benefits.
To be eligible for public assistance in New York State, a family of four must have an income of no more than $15,266, according to the city's Human Resources Administration.
Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Morgenthau, said it would be difficult to speculate on what sort of penalties the latest group of defendants could face, since their previous arrest records have not yet been examined. But Ms. Thompson noted that some of the defendants in the current case are charged with stealing larger amounts -- several are accused of stealing over $50,000 -- and so could be charged with felonies.
The mere fact of employment by the city is not necessarily a disqualification for receiving welfare benefits. Still, Mr. Wilson said, city efforts to weed out employees wrongly receiving such benefits would continue.
"Vigorous screening of city employees for this type of fraud is a continuing part of the Department of Investigation's efforts to fight corruption," Mr. Wilson said. "Hopefully, since a major point of prosecution is to deter others, there will be fewer cases in the future."
Of those charged yesterday, four are teachers employed by the Board of Education. Other agencies whose employees were charged include: the Human Resources Administration, the Administration for Children's Services, the Department of Correction, the City University of New York, the Police Department (no officers were charged), the Department of Health, the Department of Employment, the Law Department, the Department of Homeless Services, the Department of Juvenile Justice, and a seasonal worker in the mayor's office.
In several of yesterday's 20 housing fraud cases, those charged are accused of continuing to collect rent subsidies for tenants who died. William Robinson, an employee of Greater Harlem Nursing Home, told housing authority officials his wife's grandmother was still alive, when she had died in 1988. He has been charged with stealing more than $35,000 in rent subsidies.

HEADLINE: THE TRAIL OF 'THE ZODIAC': THE SUSPECT;
Recluse With Message of Good and Evil

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Gripping a Bible in his hand, Heriberto Seda would stalk around his scarred and battered East New York neighborhood, always at night, always alone. He would stride up to drug dealers in the alleys and on the corners and rail about good and evil, God and the Devil.
"He was always preaching, talking a lot about God," said Jose Martinez, a neighbor on his block of Pitkin Avenue. "He would take on the drug dealers. People he saw dealing drugs here, he would preach to them." 
 Some neighbors said Mr. Seda didn't just preach. He would also call the police with tips about who was selling drugs on the block.
All the while Mr. Seda was conducting his anti-drug ministry, he was also stockpiling weapons, a homemade arsenal, the authorities said: 13 zip guns, 2 pipe bombs and bomb-making materials.
Late Tuesday, they said, Heriberto Seda confessed to being the Zodiac gunman, responsible for shooting eight people, three of them fatally, in two crime sprees from 1990 to 1993.
In confessing to the crimes, he invoked his religious zeal once again.
"He said he had to kill them because they were evil," said an investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"He was very religious," said another detective. "He kept talking about Jesus and good and evil and salvation."
Yesterday, people in the neighborhood described Mr. Seda as a solitary figure whom they hardly ever saw during the day. Tall with longish hair pulled back in a ponytail, he dressed in black and emerged at night, to take walks and rebuke drug dealers. Many people said they did not know him at all, although they knew the mother and half-sister with whom he lived in the three-story brick apartment building.
But as the outlines of Mr. Seda's personality began to emerge, they offered a striking resemblance to the psychological portrait of the Zodiac gunman that detectives had drawn six years ago.
The gunman, a task force of 50 detectives theorized in 1990, would be somebody who spent hours by himself, somebody desperate for attention. He was probably unemployed and had little education, and he probably lived in East New York, Brooklyn, near where three of the shootings took place.
Ultimately, psychologists and the police guessed, the Zodiac gunman, like most serial criminals, would be someone who, at least subconsciously, wanted to be caught.
Mr. Seda dropped out of high school, and nobody in the neighborhood can recall his holding a job. On Tuesday, hours after he was arrested on charges of shooting his half-sister in the back and holding officers at bay for three hours, Mr. Seda gave up a clue that linked him with the Zodiac shootings. He scrawled on his statement to police one of the Zodiac gunman's symbols: a circle and a cross with three 7's, one at the top and at each of the two side points of the cross.
Those closest to him said his strongest characteristic was religious fervor. His belief, they said, seemed to come into sharper focus about two years ago, after the last shooting attributed to the Zodiac gunman.
Early every Sunday for the last two years, Mr. Seda grabbed his Bible and went to Mass at St. Fortunato Roman Catholic Church near his home.
The priest, the Rev. James W. Ryan, remembers the tall young man with the long hair as a regular in the pews, always alone. He was given to lingering after Mass, waiting outside the church to greet the priest as he walked out.
"I always found him quiet and respectful," Father Ryan said. "He'd just say 'Hello, how are you, Father?' And that was it."
Connie Catapano, who lives nearby, said Mr. Seda's religious beliefs seemed to influence many of his decisions. "My friend found him to be really strange, so he asked, 'Have you ever been with a woman before?' " Ms. Catapano said. "He mentioned God didn't want him to have sex yet. He didn't want to until God told him to.' "
Indeed, Mr. Seda told detectives, the crime that led to his apprehension on Tuesday, and later to his confession as the Zodiac gunman, was motivated by his preoccupation with the evils of drug dealers.
He said that he shot his half-sister in the back on Tuesday, and later held the police at bay for hours, because he was concerned that she was falling in with a wicked crowd.
"He was mad at his sister because she was hanging around with the wrong people," Detective Joseph Herbert said. "Drug dealers, trouble makers, and he didn't like that."
Ms. Catapano and another neighbor said that Mr. Seda's half-sister, Gladys Reyes, whose nickname was Chachi, had become friends with many of the drug dealers who sold heroin from the half-vacant city-owned building they lived in.
"Chachi was a good girl," Ms. Catapano said. "But she knew all the drug dealers."
Mr. Seda, whose Zodiac sign is Leo, shared the two-room apartment with his half-sister and his mother. Neighbors said the tight quarters created tension in the apartment. Another daughter lives nearby, while a third lives in Queens. As far as neighbors knew, Mr. Seda's father had no contact with the family.
Neighbors said Mr. Seda's mother worked in Manhattan, possibly for a city welfare office. His half-sister, Gladys, gregarious and spunky, had worked for the last few months at the Ancora Bakery a few blocks away and was studying for a high school equivalency diploma, a bakery employee said.
The Zodiac gunman's three-year shooting spree came as murder and other crimes were at record levels, and few areas were more besieged than Mr. Seda's neighborhood. In 1993, there were 129 murders in the 75th Precinct in East New York.
Mr. Seda's only prior arrest was in 1994, when he was picked up in a crackdown and charged with criminal possession of a weapon.
It was in this still crime-ravaged section of Brooklyn that Mr. Seda built his weapons and began his campaign against drug dealers, one that seemed to land him on the side of the law. The police said yesterday there was no record of Mr. Seda's trying to help them catch drug dealers.
Ms. Catapano said that a friend of hers told Mr. Seda, "They're going to kill you if you keep the snitching up around the neighborhood." Mr. Seda replied: "I'll kill all of them."
For years, Mr. Seda lived one life by day, another by night, always remaining a stranger.
"He always lived here and he never left for anywhere," said Josefina Torres, who lives on the first floor of Mr. Seda's building. "He was never with friends, always alone, very alone."

HEADLINE: THE TRAIL OF 'THE ZODIAC': THE OVERVIEW;
Police Say Zodiac Suspect Admits Attacks That Killed 3 and Hurt 5

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Saying he had to kill them "because they were evil," a reclusive man obsessed with guns and the Bible has admitted slaying three people and wounding five others in two calculated waves that bound many New Yorkers in a fitful terror and became known as the Zodiac shootings, police officials said yesterday.
The stunning admission to the twin crime sprees -- one during a compressed period in 1990 and the second from 1992 to 1994 -- apparently closes one of the city's most notorious unsolved cases, a chilling episode of a killer who, under the cover of darkness, mockingly promised to methodically deliver one death for each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac. 
 Until yesterday, the police said, they never knew with firm conviction whether the two deadly rampages were actually the work of a single person, and they had wondered if a culprit would ever be caught.
Heriberto Seda, 28, who was arrested Tuesday in Brooklyn after shooting his half-sister and engaging in a gun battle with hundreds of police officers, was portrayed yesterday as a withdrawn man smitten with weaponry and the teachings of the Bible and who preached damnation to drug dealers. [Page B7.]
The distinctive way he wrote several letters and a telltale symbol he scrawled on his statement to the police about the Brooklyn gun fight led a police detective to match his fingerprints and connect him to the 1990 Zodiac shootings. During four hours of interrogation, the police said, he then admitted those crimes as well as the latter attacks.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that authorities remained mystified about his motive, and there seemed to be no obvious parallels among the eight victims. An investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, "He said he had to kill them because they were evil."
Two years ago, the police seemingly came within a whisker of linking Mr. Seda to the Zodiac shootings, when he was arrested on a weapons possession charge, his only other arrest. His fingerprints would then have been routinely sent to Albany to be compared with prints stored in the statewide fingerprint identification system. But six days later, before the full set of fingerprints were mailed, the case was dismissed and the fingerprints destroyed.
The happenstance capture of Mr. Seda echoed the manner in which a serial attacker was tied last week through a fingerprint obtained in a subway fare-evasion case to four brutal attacks on women, including the murder of a dry cleaner and a near-fatal beating in Central Park.
As he did in announcing that arrest, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani profusely praised the Police Department yesterday and declared that the latest arrest "gives the victims and their families a sense of justice that helps the healing process."
Richard A. Brown, the Queens District Attorney, said Mr. Seda would probably be charged today in the three deaths and one shooting that occurred in Queens. The Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said Mr. Seda would also be charged with attempted murder of police officers in Tuesday's shootout.
The police said that Mr. Seda, in his rambling statement, offered no insight into how he selected his victims or mapped out the astrological underpinnings of the attacks before dawn. "He doesn't respond to the whys or wherefores," a detective said. "He just got the feeling, he'd go out and select the victim." Seven of the eight victims had a different Zodiac sign, though only one recalled a stranger who asked him about his birth date.
Investigators did say that he mentioned being fascinated by a documentary he watched about a Zodiac killer who stalked San Francisco in the 1960's and 1970's and that he was intrigued by how the killer held a city in fear and eluded capture. He ascribed his lapses in activity, a detective said, to "heat" from the manhunt for him.
According to detectives, Mr. Seda said that he chose his targets randomly, paying no attention to race, sex or creed, and had no knowledge of their astrological signs. But the police discounted that explanation, since he wrote letters alluding to their horoscopes.
Mr. Seda signed a 10-page statement confessing to the eight Zodiac crimes, investigators said. But the confession was slight in details, and so to jog his memory he was driven by the police in an unmarked surveillance van yesterday morning to four of the crime sites. Police said he then signed a second statement that furnished richer specifics.
Late last night detectives searched his house, removing four large paper bags full of evidence, including books, magazines, newspaper articles and a bow and arrow, which the police said had never been used.
Inside his room were more than a dozen plastic models of military equipment including Cobra attack helicopters and aircraft carriers, and assorted gun magazines, including a Remington catalogue and a gun parts catalogue. There were also basketball trading cards, G.I. Joe comic books, a magician's kit and several pornographic videotapes.
The event that led to Mr. Seda's arrest was apparently a warped expression of sibling concern. Authorities said that Mr. Seda, whom they depicted as devoutly religious, was upset because his 17-year-old half-sister, Gladys Reyes, was associating with disreputable friends.
"He was mad at his sister because she was hanging around with the wrong people," said Sgt. Joseph Herbert, the detective who made the Zodiac link. "Drug dealers, troublemakers -- and he didn't like that."
Detectives said that he began a heated argument with Ms. Reyes, whose boyfriend was at the apartment, and then he shot her in the back. She underwent surgery and is listed in stable condition.
Neighbors said that Mr. Seda abhorred drug dealers and used to tip off the police about them. Clutching a Bible, he would also preach to dealers. "He was very religious," a detective said. "He kept talking about Jesus and good and evil and salvation. But he never explained how he made his jump from a Roman Catholic upbringing to a Zodiac serial killer."
Mr. Seda shared a third-floor apartment on Pitkin Avenue in East New York with his half-sister, who worked at a neighborhood bakery, and his mother. He was unemployed, and Mr. Safir said that he resorted to petty crime, including stealing from pay phones. He often wore camouflage pants, and neighbors characterized him as a creature of the night who slept all day.
When he surrendered, Mr. Seda filled three buckets with 13 homemade zip guns. Inside the apartmentthe police said they found two completed pipe bombs and enough materials to build at least nine more.
Detective Herbert, now assigned to the 75th Precinct, had been involved in the hunt for the Zodiac killer, and aspects of the case were imprinted in his mind. After his arrest on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Seda wrote out a confession to his role in the shootout. Then Detective Herbert looked at it.
"The way he wrote his s's and t's, the way he had all these words underlined, I knew it in a second," he said. "He even put his little symbol." That symbol was an upside-down cross overlapping a circle with three 7's, one above the cross and at each of the two side points.
At once, Detective Herbert asked for a fingerprint check through the police computer, and it matched Mr. Seda's prints with one found at the scene of a 1990 attack in Central Park, as well as a print on a 1994 letter mailed to The New York Post.
When the police confronted Mr. Seda with this evidence, a detective said, he stared straight ahead and began to squirm in his chair. One detective told him, "You're going to be a lot better off if you just tell us what happened."
Over the next four hours, detectives said, he did just that.
The police said that he knew unpublicized details of several attacks. For instance, detectives said he told how he had desecrated the body of a woman who was stabbed 100 times in 1992. They said he also told them that the bullets in two shootings had no ridges because they were fired from a homemade gun.
Mr. Safir said that there was ballistic evidence that connected Mr. Seda to the Zodiac attacks.
Until Tuesday, the Zodiac killer had apparently been silent for two years, and the memory of the helpless panic that had swept New York City had long faded.
He wrote before he acted. In November 1989, he sent a letter to the police and boasted of a demented plot to slaughter people, one for each of the dozen astrological signs. He alluded to Orion, also known as the Great Hunter, a constellation bordering the celestial equator. At first, the police thought it was a hoax.
He picked Thursday mornings in the blackness before dawn. He waited multiples of 21 days between strikes. He began in Brooklyn on March 8, 1990, and his victim was a Scorpio. Mario Orozco, 49, was on his way home from his job washing dishes at a coffee shop. He was on Atlantic Avenue, a few blocks from Mr. Seda's East New York apartment, when he said he was confronted by a man in a ski mask clasping a gun. When Mr. Orozco turned to flee, the man shot him in the back. He said the gunman then stood over his crumpled body and pointed the gun at his head. Since he didn't move, he thinks the gunman thought he was dead.
Mr. Orozco walked home, made a cup of coffee and called the police.
Twenty-one days later, the assailant found a Gemini, Jermaine Montenesdro, 33, on Nichols and Jamaica Avenues, again just blocks from the apartment. Mr. Montenesdro was returning home after visiting friends in the Bronx. He remembered being struck on the head and shot in the side. He, too, recovered.
The gunman moved his sights to Queens and to a Taurus. The third attack, on May 31, 1990, made him a murderer. He came upon Joseph Proce, 78, a retired ice delivery worker, as he walked with his cane to buy a newspaper near 87th Road in Woodhaven. The stranger approached and asked for a glass of water. Before Mr. Proce could reply, the stranger shot him and fled. A note found nearby bore a pie-shaped picture with the symbols for the signs of the first three victims scrawled inside it. The note read simply: "Zodiac -- Time to die!"
Three weeks later Mr. Proce died of an infection from the gunshot.
On June 21, 1990, the gunman shot a homeless man asleep on a bench in Central Park. His name was Larry Parham, 30, a Cancer. Mr. Parham told the police that a stranger had earlier asked him about his astrological sign. Mr. Parham also gave some details that allowed the police to release a sketch. They had no idea how the attacker knew the birth dates of the previous victims.
A note, decorated again with the circle but now including the astrological sign of the fourth victim, was found on that park bench. On that note, the police found a single fingerprint that they hoped one day would mean something.
A special police task force was then assembled to find the suspect. People were cautioned to be wary of anyone who tried, no matter how casually, to learn their birth date.
By then, the gunman was writing to the news media as well as the police. In one letter, the police said, he claimed to be the same Zodiac killer who stalked San Francisco between 1966 and 1974 and claimed to have killed some 40 people. That killer was never caught, but the police said that the handwriting of the two killers did not match.
Innumerable calls and leads that inundated the police failed to produce the capture of the man. Fifty suspects were questioned.
Months lapsed, and then years. Nothing was heard from the Zodiac.
And then something was. The second wave came quietly, with nothing drawing attention to the attacks as being related until they were all done. It was a Leo he chose on Aug. 10, 1992. Patricia Fonte, 39, was stabbed 100 times near the reservoir in Highland Park, Queens. She died. The police do not know why he used a knife rather than a gun.
And then, inexplicably, nearly a year passed before he got very busy.
On June 4, 1993, he shot James Weber, 40, a Libra, in the leg while he was walking on Vermont Street and Cypress Avenue in Queens.
A little over a month later, on July 20, the gunman crept up on a homeless man named named John DiAcone, 47, a Virgo, and shot him at point-blank range in the neck while he was walking along Interboro Walkway in Queens. He died.
In the fall, on Oct. 2, Diane Ballard, 40, was also shot in the neck as she walked through Highland Park near Jamaica Avenue in Brooklyn. She survived, but has been left partly paralyzed and still takes daily medication. She walks with a cane. She was a Taurus, the only duplicate sign among the shooter's targets.
It was not until a letter supposedly sent by the original Zodiac gunman arrived at The New York Post in August 1994 that Zodiac fear revisited the city. The writer claimed that he was back and was responsible for five attacks between June 1992 and October 1994. The police were able to confirm that four of the incidents had occurred and were unsolved but found no record of a June 11, 1994, shooting, as the letter claimed.
At first dubious that the letter was from the same attacker, the police concluded that it was not a hoax but were unsure whether it was written by the same person or by someone who knew of the assaults.
And, then, after announcing his return, the Zodiac withdrew again. As far as the police know, that was it. For two years and eight months, whatever drove one man to attack eight strangers in such sinister fashion, stayed quiescent within him. Then he argued with his sister.

HEADLINE: INCOME DISPARITY BETWEEN POOREST AND RICHEST RISES

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
Using new methods of collecting data that it says provide a more accurate picture of incomes, the Census Bureau said today that the gap between the most affluent Americans and everyone else was wider than it has been since the end of World War II.
Looking at five different indicators to measure household income distribution, the Census Bureau has determined that from 1968, when the gap began to widen, to 1994 -- the last year for which complete data are available -- despite some yearly fluctuations each indicator has shown a pronounced increase in the gap between the incomes of the well-to-do and those of the poor and the working class. 
 And, during the first two years of the Clinton Administration the report indicated that the share of national income earned by the top 5 percent of households grew at a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan Administration, which was often characterized as favoring the rich.
But the report said it was difficult to determine how much of the soaring fortunes of the rich in 1993 and 1994 represented real gains at the top of the earning ladder and how much was simply because of changes collecting data.
Census Bureau officials say the acceleration in income inequality is partly explained by the bureau's beginning to use computers for the first time in January 1994 to assist interviewers conducting surveys on household income, employment and other data. Also, in March 1994, the Census Bureau lifted its upper limit on reported income from $300,000 a year, allowing households for the first time to report up to $1 million in earnings.
Both changes tended to boost household incomes reported in the higher income brackets, producing a more accurate picture of income distribution. But the change also made it look as though income disparity was widening more rapidly.
Even discounting the effect of the methodology change, the Census Bureau report, entitled A Brief Look at Postwar U.S. Income Inequality, confirmed a well-known trend. From 1968 to 1994, it noted, the share of the nation's aggregate income that went to the top 20 percent of its households increased to 46.9 percent from 40.5 percent. During the same time the share of income earned by the rest of the country's households either declined or remained stagnant.
Looking at the data another way, the bureau determined that the average income for the top 20 percent of households grew to $105,945 in 1994 from $73,754 in 1968, a jump of 44 percent after being adjusted for inflation. In contrast, the bottom 20 percent of households saw their income go up in constant dollars to $7,762 from $7,202, a 7 percent increase during the same period.
Regardless of the the methodological changes, Census Bureau officials said the rise in income inequality was significant. "Whether it's gone up 15 percent or 20 percent, it's still gone up," said Daniel Weinberg, Chief of the Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division at the Census Bureau. "That's the basic story, and I hope that people don't get misled by this apparent dramatic increase since 1992."
Sheldon Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan, and other scholars using such data say the methodological changes made it likely that past disparities appeared smaller and recent ones larger than they would have been. But they agreed with Mr. Weinberg that income disparity was still showing significant growth now.
The Census Bureau report also underscores the view that the widening disparity in the fortunes of American workers is becoming an entrenched fixture of the economy. Household incomes grew closer from 1947 to 1968. But since then, the household income gap has steadily increased, rising inexorably through booms and busts, inflationary spurts and recessionary troughs, Republican and Democratic administrations.
"Something is going on here that's beyond politics," said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative public policy research organization. "A lot of people have tended to draw the conclusion that we cut taxes in the 1980's, and the rich got richer. Here we've increased taxes in the 1990's, and they still got richer."
The report points out one major incongruity of the last mid-term elections. While the incomes of affluent households seem to have grown dramatically under Mr. Clinton, 55 percent of voters with annual incomes of more than $100,000 voted for Republican Congressional candidates in 1994. Meanwhile, voters earning under $15,000 a year who has seen their household incomes increased at a much slower pace, gave an overwhelming 62 percent of their votes to Democratic candidates.
Among the phenomena that have contributed to the disparity over the long haul are: the shift in the economy away from manufacturing jobs that paid higher wages for relatively low-skilled workers; the decline in the number of workers who are unionized; the increased reliance in industry on the use of computer and computer-assisted technology which places a premium on higher skills and education, and the increasing use of part-time workers.
Also there have been demographic changes that have greatly contributed to the growing disparity in household incomes.
In past eras, some social scientists noted, well-educated, highly skilled men were likely to marry well-educated women who then left the work force to rear children, or who, because of discrimination against women, worked in jobs that were beneath their ability levels. Today, the biggest increase in working wives comes from well-educated, highly skilled women who are married to well-educated, highly-skilled men. Together, they create households with very high incomes.

HEADLINE: Nike Pays Good Wages to Foreign Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to Bob Herbert's June 10 and June 14 columns on Nike's operations in Asia, Nike has been concerned with developing safe and healthy work environments wherever it has worked with contractors in emerging market societies.
Nike has paid, on average, double the minimum wage as defined in countries where its products are produced under contract. This is in addition to free meals, housing and health care and transportation subsidies. 
 Underdeveloped countries must trade or see deeper declines in living standards. History shows that the best way out of poverty for such countries is through exports of light manufactured goods that provide the base for more skilled production.
If we did not produce in the same low-income societies as our competitors, we would be out of business, and our more than 10,000 United States employees would be unemployed. In 1984, our last year of United States production, we lost $10 million on United States-produced footwear.
In South Korea and Taiwan, where Nike has a larger presence than any other athletic footwear company, many workers earn middle-income wages in economies with as much as a 97 percent employment rate. In Indonesia, thanks to Nike and other multinational corporations, real wages have risen 55 percent since 1990.
Nike directly employs 15,500 people in high-wage, high-skill jobs around the world. Add to this the 200,000 people employed by our contractors at the factory level and you have a company that began in my basement and today creates wealth where none existed before. Our global payroll and contracted labor outlay in the fiscal year 1996 amounted to more than $1 billion.
We have an oversight system that works, and we do our best to insure that labor abuses do not occur. Every Nike subcontractor is subject to systematic, unannounced evaluation carried out by Ernst & Young, an international audit firm with expertise in assessing labor practices.
Mr. Herbert has never set foot inside a Nike-subcontracted facility. Is it a better story to compare Michael Jordan, the most famous athlete of our day, at the peak of his fame and career, with people who are paid more than their countrymen but little by United States standards? The contrast is irresistible to reporters who sacrifice enlightenment for hype.

HEADLINE: Stop Inflation Before It Starts

BYLINE: By Stephen S. Roach; Stephen S. Roach is chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Company.

 BODY:
It's back-slapping time on the inflation watch.
A price war in the cereal business, a plunging copper market and well-behaved consumer and producer price indexes all appear to reflect a new era of stable prices. Indeed, the latest beige book, the Federal Reserve's own compilation of economic trends, reports few signs of any inflationary pressures. 
 Politicians are particularly eager to celebrate the death of inflation. With the dreaded beast of the 1970's at bay, they can embrace a pro-growth agenda that eases the angst of the 1990's work force.
Yet for an economy now in its sixth year of expansion, this is precisely the moment to guard against complacency on inflation.
As always, the story starts with supply and demand. That's particularly true in the labor market, where the nation's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent, quite close to what most economists consider full employment.
Any significant lowering of this level could lead to labor shortages, causing rises in wages and then prices.
Just such a possibility is, in fact, quite likely later this year. The reason: sustained and vigorous economic growth. Most economists have been surprised by the economy's strength in the first half of 1996.
But they shouldn't have been. American consumers are spending more in response to their now rising incomes, exports have been supported by a cheap dollar and, in a quest for efficiency, companies have invested heavily in technology.
In addition, the next phase in the inventory cycle is due to start, which should spur further growth. Companies have just finished lowering their inventories, and they will soon begin a new round of restocking, which should increase production, employment and salaries.
If the gross domestic product increases at least 3 percent between now and year's end, as I suspect it will, then the unemployment rate could be as low as 5 percent by early 1997. This might well trigger higher inflation.
Indeed, the Fed's beige book that just saw no inflationary pressure also reported that companies are competing aggressively for new workers. Some fast-food restaurants in St. Louis, for example, are even offering $250 signing bonuses.
There has long been a temptation to view wages as the laggard in the inflation cycle. Workers are thought to demand higher wages only when a sudden spike in inflation deflates their purchasing power.
But there is good reason to believe that this time wages -- which account for 70 percent of business expenses -- will be leading the inflation cycle.
A decade of stagnant wages, accompanied by a spectacular resurgence of corporate profits, suggests that workers have long been underpaid. As the country reaches full employment, a "worker backlash" could force wages ahead of price increases. There is already evidenceof just such a possibility. According to the Employment Cost Index, wages for workers in private industry just recorded their sharpest quarterly increase in five years.
The moment of truth is at hand for the Federal Reserve and the financial markets. The bond market is sending the central bank a clear message. Recent increases in market interest rates suggest that the financial markets are now assuming that the central bank will raise interest rates.
Investors are betting that Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, will do this and stay ahead of the inflation cycle. If the central bank disappoints the market by failing to slow growth, long-term rates will only continue to rise anyway.
Pro-growth politicians are putting predictable pressure on the Fed to lower rates. But it's time for the real Fed to stand up. Inflation is not dead.

Dollar Gains Against the Yen On Official's Remark in Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday after an influential Japanese finance official surprised the market by saying he did not believe Japan's strengthening economy justified a rise in interest rates and a higher yen.
The dollar also got help from remarks by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin in a speech in Washington and a published interview with the German Bundesbank president, Hans Tietmeyer, traders said. 
 Mr. Rubin repeated his longstanding position that the United States wanted a strong dollar, and Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks suggested that the mark might have further room to weaken against the dollar.
"Today we had several comments to support the dollar," said Kosuke Hanao, head of foreign exchange trading at the Industrial Bank of Japan's New York branch. "Demand for the dollar is very good."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.20 yen, up from 107.85 Wednesday. The dollar also traded at 1.5240 marks, up from 1.5210 Wednesday. The British pound cost $1.5380, down from $1.5435.
The catalyst for dollar buying came early in the day when Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the International Finance Bureau of Japan's Finance Ministry, said recent evidence of a Japanese economic rebound did not mean Japan should change monetary policy. Interest rates, which have been at postwar lows since last year, have helped depress the yen's value.
Many traders sold dollars in advance of his broadcast interview in Japan yesterday, believing he would say Japanese interest rates should rise. But after he spoke, the dollar rebounded as traders scrambled to buy dollars and sell yen.
"That was the key surprise in today's market," said Hugh Walsh, vice president at ING Capital Inc. in New York. "You have Sakakibara commenting that the economy, although growing, is still not that strong. He doesn't see signs of inflation, and feels the dollar can go higher against the yen."
The dollar dipped briefly against the mark later in the day after the Bundesbank released May money supply growth data that suggested higher inflation in Germany.
But dollar buyers quickly emerged when the dollar touched 1.5200 marks, considered an important technical support level. The dollar rebound was aided by Mr. Tietmeyer, who was quoted as saying he did not foresee a weaker dollar.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Sleepy Texas Town With an Epic Story

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
THE great, stirring epic "Lone Star" stands as a peak in the career of John Sayles, who already has such admirably serious films to his credit. Long admired for the independence and quiet intelligence of his work, Mr. Sayles this time delivers a vibrant history lesson about a Texas border town.
Gratifyingly complex and beautifully told, this tale explores a huge array of cultural, racial, economic and familial tensions. In the process, it also sustains strong characters, deep emotions and clear dramatic force. Plain and forthright as it looks, "Lone Star" winds up with a scope and overview rarely attempted in American films today, which makes its success that much more exemplary. Every moment of the film, from the quiet foreshadowing of its first scene to a magnificently apt ending, is utterly right. 
 Sometimes decent but didactic in his earlier work (including "Matewan," "Eight Men Out," "Passion Fish" and "The Secret of Roan Inish"), Mr. Sayles this time displays nothing but soft-spoken grace. And he handles this film's dozens of significant characters and the many interwoven strands of its story line with ease. As writer, director and editor of "Lone Star" (the fluid editing is a particular asset, letting the story glide seamlessly between past and present), he assures the viewer that this film's many elements will converge in ways that are meaningful and moving. Indeed, "Lone Star" exists so far outside the province of slam-bang summer movies that it seems part of a different medium and a different world.
The place is Frontera, Tex., a sleepy little town on the Rio Grande. And the film's first sight is that of two Army officers cataloguing fauna in the nearby desert. ("You live in a place, you should know something about it," one of them says.) In the process, they unearth what are probably the remains of Charley Wade (Kris Kristofferson), who in 1957 was the town's bullying sheriff. In the present day, the crime will be investigated by Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper), whose father, Buddy (Matthew McConaughey), was Charley Wade's deputy and is now the prime suspect in Charley's murder.
This crime story, while well told, serves "Lone Star" more as pretext than plot. Sending Sam Deeds off to explore the past, the film also examines Sam's troubled memories of life in his father's shadow and looks at the Frontera where Buddy once wielded great power, especially over its black and Hispanic citizens. Drawn into this exploration are whole families of other characters, and their pasts are tied to Buddy Deeds in ways that are made clear by the film's stunning denouement. In each of these stories, parents and children display stubborn, warring ways of looking at the past.
So Delmore (Joe Morton), the rigid black colonel newly put in charge of the local Army base, is estranged from Otis (Ron Canada), who runs the only local bar where black soldiers feel welcome. Del's attitude is not softened by the fact that Otis happens to be his father, nor is he able to behave less rigidly with Chet (Eddie Robinson), his own son.
As the film moves smoothly among dozens of characters, in a style Mr. Sayles also used somewhat more stiffly in "City of Hope," the viewer also meets Pilar (Elizabeth Pena), Chet's history teacher.
"What are we seeing here, Chet?" she asks sternly, finding her student more interested in drawing cartoons than in studying Texas' violent past. "Uh, everybody's killing everybody else," Chet answers hastily. Pilar can hardly accuse him of missing the point.
It happens that Pilar, as Mr. Sayles gradually lets the audience know, is Sam Deeds's first love, and that as teen-agers they were kept apart by both Buddy Deeds and Mercedes Cruz (Miriam Colon), Pilar's stern, prosperous mother. Shades of the past color the film's portrait of Mercedes as well as its long view of Sam and Pilar, who are able to rekindle their romance with surprising passion. It's worth mentioning that Mr. Sayles films a startlingly tender bedroom scene between these two without nudity or graphic sex and without failing to communicate that they are deeply in love.
In Sam and Pilar, "Lone Star" finds not only a romance, but also an embodiment for its central ideas: about crossing borders, challenging the past, escaping the burden of history. These themes echo everywhere in a film that eloquently weaves together the multi-faceted life of Frontera and grasps the importance of race or privilege or politics in every transaction.
From a parents' meeting at school to negotiations over the town's new jail to Charley Wade's ruthless bullying of local minorities, the film effortlessly incorporates a broad political awareness into its drama. One of its most subtly spellbinding scenes finds Del interrogating a young black private over her drug use, and finding his own view of the Army changed by a single conversation.
This long, spare, contemplatively paced film, scored with a wide range of musical styles and given a sun-baked clarity by Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography, is loaded with brief, meaningful encounters like that one. And it features a great deal of fine, thoughtful acting, which can always be counted on in a film by Mr. Sayles. Though none of the actors are given much screen time, a remarkable number of them create fully formed characters in only a few scenes.
Mr. Kristofferson does a superb, unflinching job as the film's personification of racist evil; Mr. Canada and Clifton James (as the mayor) capture the tensions between Frontera's black and white characters as well as a certain brotherhood under the skin. Mr. Morton and Ms. Colon both illustrate the high price of repressing one's true nature, though nobody here has the two-dimensional nature of a symbolic figure. All the film's characters are flesh and blood.
Mr. Cooper brings grit and dignity to the film's pivotal role, perfectly in keeping with the film's tacit style. The sultry Ms. Pena gives an especially vivid performance as the character who is most unsettled by shadows of the past. The film is greatly helped by the fact that neither of these two looks or acts like a movie star and that they blend effortlessly into the texture of small-town life. "Lone Star" does glimpse flashes of Hollywood magnetism in Mr. McConaughey, who makes a riveting impression even though he appears only briefly. Buddy Deeds is meant to be feared and imagined more than he is seen.
Also outstanding are Gabriel Casseus playing Otis as a proud young black man in 1957, when it was clearly dangerous to behave that way, and Frances McDormand as Sam's jumpy, over-medicated ex-wife. Tiny roles are also memorably etched, as in the brief appearance by Beatrice Winde as the widow of a principal in a murder case, an old lady busily playing Game Boy. Sam introduces himself politely, but she remembers Buddy too well to resist a wisecrack: "Sheriff Deeds is dead, honey. You just Sheriff Junior."
"Lone Star" is about watching a whole town, and perhaps a whole society, emerging from such long shadows.

 "Lone Star" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild profanity, racial insults, brief violence and one very discreet sexual situation.

Mugging Boutros-Ghali

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The U.S. decision to veto the re-election of the Secretary General of the U.N. tells us a lot about the Clinton Administration -- all bad -- and nothing true about Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the talented and brave Egyptian diplomat Washington is trying to eliminate.
"Trying" -- this story is not over. President Clinton can use the veto to override the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council. But the Council then has to agree on another candidate, which the veto-free 185-member General Assembly, overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Boutros-Ghali, can either approve or throw back repeatedly. And, lest Washington forget: In 1950 the Assembly re-elected Trygve Lie despite Soviet vetoes, with the urging of the U.S. 
 U.S. economic pressure -- elect our choice or get no money from us -- may win out. But the sheer outrage of U.N. members could make the U.S. happy to avoid the Lie precedent and accept a half-term -- two and a half years. The Secretary General tells me he put the compromise forward to save U.S. face, and his country's pride, but was turned down.
The veto threat was not made because of international opinion but was dead against it. It was announced -- months early -- for weakling domestic political motives and with phony "reasons."
A Secretary General is chief of the U.N. staff and can bring peace-threatening problems to the U.N. But his strength depends on his background, and skills and the respect U.N. members hold for him. Those qualifications make Mr. Boutros-Ghali the only influential Secretary General aside from Dag Hammarskjold, killed in a Congo air crash in 1961.
He is the most respected professional diplomat to come out of the Arab Mideast. He stood with Anwar el-Sadat at Camp David to help bring Egyptian-Israeli peace. He subjected himself to the same hatreds that murdered President Sadat.
This man encompasses several civilizations -- Mideastern, Western, African. He draws understanding from the Islamic world in which he has lived, the Christianity in which he worships, and the Jewishness of his wife. He is urbane, unabashedly intellectual and numbers French among the languages he speaks perfectly, for all of which some Americans cannot forgive him.
In his five years in office, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has won the support of almost all nations in Europe, the Mideast, Africa, Latin America and Asia -- a great collection of colors, religions and interests. Without the veto threat, he would breeze through the election unopposed.
The Administration threatens veto for fear that the Republican onslaught against the U.N., with him as its Satan-figure, might win some know-nothing votes. Even as front-runner, Mr. Clinton was too flabby to resist the Republican attack.
The U.S. excuse: A new budget broom is needed. Come off it. Mr. Boutros-Ghali was as good an administrator when the U.S. voted for him as his five predecessors, which is not very. But Washington knows that in five years in office he made reforms and pared budgets more -- when allowed -- than all his predecessors put together did in 45 years.
The U.N. is broke because the U.S. chronically owes more than $1 billion. The Republican Congress reneges -- as did the Democratic Congress that Mr. Clinton was supposed to lead. And the whole U.N. membership keeps pushing the organization to bankruptcy with peacekeeping missions by the dozen, commissions and conferences, then orders the Secretary General to pay the bills.
Republicans and the U.S. delegation to the U.N. like to beat up on Mr. Boutros-Ghali because he did not and could not always snap to their demands for military rescue of the Bosnian Muslims -- which Mr. Clinton himself withheld until he caved. Once I read that Mr. Boutros-Ghali is anti-Israel. That comes as news to such strong supporters of Israel as Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, who says it is totally false.
Americans have the right to oppose him, but not to insult him or his people. That is what Republicans do who ape former comics like David Letterman and mockingly drawl his name out -- "Booootros Booootros." The words mean Peter, son of Peter. Funny? Regular thigh-slapper -- like calling Yitzhak Rabin "Izzy" or yelling "hey Mario, whatsamadda," or sneering the honorific of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and hurts as much. Now they know.

HEADLINE: In Congress, New York's G.O.P. Defends Turf

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Goldwater's Coattails" (editorial, June 14) attacks us as having done a poor job of defending New York State in Congress. To the contrary, we have been successful in protecting New York and the Northeast.
These victories include protecting our Medicaid dollars; reviving the low-income energy assistance program; beefing up transit operating funds; protecting Ryan White money for AIDS programs; protecting funds for the elderly; increasing Federal grants for teaching hospitals; working to keep regional veterans' offices and services intact; holding the line on Head Start money; saving the Summer Jobs program; protecting dairy and other agriculture programs, and increasing funds for the Violence Against Women Act and other grants to fight crime. 
 You also miss the bigger picture in ignoring the benefits that a balanced Federal budget would provide for New Yorkers.
Besides lower mortgages, smaller student loans and lower interest rates for car payments, unless we get Federal deficits under control, payments on our national debt will crowd out spending for all other Federal programs, the ones that benefit our region and others. In addition, lower interest payments that come with less Federal borrowing will mean a windfall for states and city governments that have floated bonds.
We cannot overemphasize how dire the straits our region, state and city would face were it not for New York's Republicans at the leadership table.

HEADLINE: Charles Kades, 90, Architect Of Japan's Postwar Charter

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Charles L. Kades, a lawyer who supervised the drafting of Japan's postwar Constitution, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Greenfield, Mass. He was 90 and had lived in Heath, Mass., since his retirement from law practice in New York in 1976.
In a long and varied career, Mr. Kades, a native of Newburgh, N.Y., who graduated from Cornell and received his law degree from Harvard, tackled many complex problems. 
As a Government lawyer in Washington during the New Deal in the 1930's he worked as a counsel for the Public Works Administration, the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. In private practice in New York in the 1950's, 60's and 70's, he specialized in tax, bond, banking, corporate and estate matters; became a senior partner of the firm of Hawkins, Delafield and Wood, and advised Gov. Hugh L. Carey on the creation and operation of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the agency that supervised New York City's recovery from financial crisis.
Yet none of the cases he worked on and none of the deals he made had the impact of one whirlwind, a 10-day effort in February 1946 when Mr. Kades supervised the transformation of Japan from a monarchy into a modern democracy with full guarantees of equality.
Under pressure from the occupying Allies, the Japanese Government had begun the process of revising the Meiji Constitution of 1881 late in 1945, but when details of the drafting committee's work leaked out on Feb. 1, 1946, and were seen to be no more than a light reworking of the old Constitution, there was an immediate outcry.
Although an American directive allowed him to order reforms "only as a last resort," with the first postwar general election just two months away and with an 11-nation commission due to take over the issue of a constitution, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander, intervened.
He ordered his own 24-member Government Section staff to draft a constitution, and on Feb. 4, his aide, Brig. Gen. Courtney Whitney, convened a meeting and declared: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a historic occasion. I now proclaim you a constitutional assembly."
Lieut. Col. Charles Kades, who had been in Japan since a week before Japan's formal surrender the previous summer after taking part in the invasion of France in 1944 and serving on the War Department's General Staff, was put in charge of the steering committee and told to produce a constitution by Feb. 12.
Colonel Kades, a gentle leader who resolved a myriad of debates, worked night and day to accomplish his mission.
The resulting document effectively stripped the Emperor of authority, established an elected government and guaranteed a range of civil rights, including full equality for women.
On March 4, Colonel Kades presided over the negotiations with Japanese authorities that led to the adoption of the American draft, including the famous renunciation of war that Colonel Kades had composed himself from General MacArthur's notes.
The Constitution took effect on May 3, 1947, and proved so popular and so effective in laying the groundwork for Japan's postwar re-emergence as an economic power that Mr. Kades, who was decorated by the Army for his work, also became a lionized figure in Japan.
Mr. Kades is survived by his third wife, Phyllis; a daughter from a previous marriage, Caroline Foster-Bunch of Avalon, Australia; three stepchilren, Jewelle Bickford and William C. Wooten, both of New York, and James H. Wooten of Orlando, Fla.; and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Kept In Check

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Signs of economic strength and concerns over inflation and supply combined to restrain Treasury prices yesterday.
By the New York market close the 30-year Treasury bond was down 1/32 , to 8613/32 to yield 7.10 percent -- unchanged for a third day. 
 Bond prices were pressured after a regional survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia suggested that the economy was expanding at a fast enough pace that would accelerate inflation and compell the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the Philadelphia Fed would report that its general economic index, compiled from a survey of area manufacturers, was 16.3 in June, compared with 16 in May. Instead, the index rose to 25.6 in June, while the prices-paid component of the index rose to 15.5, from 10.2 in May -- an eight-month high.
The data appeared to contradict Wednesday's Federal Reserve survey of regional business conditions, known as the beige book, which indicated that that wages and prices remained largely in check even amid a pickup in the pace of growth.
"We continue to have mixed economic reports with the market fluctuating from statistic to statistic, and today the Philly Fed scared the market about inflation again, reversing the benign beige report yesterday," said Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc.
"We're now in our fifth month of bond market decline, which has been largely fueled by inflation expectation," Mr. Guild said. "And no doubt we'll look back on 1996 like we did 1994 and realize that inflation remained quite low."
Bonds were little changed by the initial unemployment claims for the week ended June 15, which showed 4,000 fewer Americans applying for unemployment last week.
"Despite the most recent downtick in the claims series, initial unemployment claims have established a trend in the 350,000 to 360,000 range," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. That is "a clear departure from the mid-April through May range of 340,000 to 350,000," she said. The unemployment claims data portray a moderating labor market, she said.
The market received something of a boost when the Senate voted to confirm Alan Greenspan for a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The vote was a resounding affirmation of his monetary policy, analysts said.
But market participants remained concerned about the amount of new supply coming to market following an announcement by the Treasury on Wednesday on the size of next week's sales of two-year and five-year notes.
Yesterday the Treasury auctioned $19.25 billion of a new one-year bills at an average rate of 5.56 percent, with decent investor demand. In when-issued trading late in the afternoon, the two-year note to be sold on Tuesday was offered at a price to yield 6.33 percent, while the five-year was offered at a price to yield 6.73 percent.
Adding to the market's concern about supply yesterday was the Lockheed Martin Corporation's $1.25 billion three-part debt offering, which is due to be priced today.
The company set a record on May 26 by pricing the largest-ever investment-grade corporate debt issue, when it sold $3.5 billion of its debt.
The new offering, through underwriters led by CS First Boston, includes $500 million in 2-year notes, $400 million in 8-year notes and $350 million in 12-year notes.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new one-year bill:

HEADLINE: Senate Confirms Greenspan 91-7 for a Third Fed Term

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Alan Greenspan to a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve today, brushing aside arguments from a few Democrats that he had held back economic growth by focusing too narrowly on fighting inflation.
The vote was 91 to 7. The "no" votes came from Democrats representing Midwestern states with strong populist histories of opposition to tight-money policies like those that have distinguished Mr. Greenspan's nearly nine-year tenure at the central bank. 
 The vote means Mr. Greenspan, who is 70, will remain in charge of monetary policy for another four-year term regardless of who wins the Presidency. A Republican, Mr. Greenspan was first named to his job by President Ronald Reagan and was renominated by President George Bush in 1992. With Mr. Greenspan having won the confidence of inflation-wary investors on Wall Street and enjoying support from both sides in Congress, President Clinton renominated him in February. The nomination had been held up since then by a small group of Democrats led by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
The Senate also approved President Clinton's two other nominees to open Fed seats, but not without giving a scare to one of them, Alice M. Rivlin, who has been the Administration's budget chief.
Ms. Rivlin's nomination to be the Fed's vice chairman was approved by 57 to 41, with the surprisingly large opposition all coming from Republicans angry about what they considered dishonest tactics by the Administration in its budget negotiations with Congress.
Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, had led the opposition to Ms. Rivlin, saying she should be accountable for the Administration's proposing long-term spending cuts but then telling the affected departments and agencies that the cuts could be revisited in future negotiations. Mr. Bond and several other senators said they were concerned that Ms. Rivlin had shown herself willing to put politics ahead of good policy.
The Senate voted 98 to 0 to approve the nomination of Laurence H. Meyer, a widely respected economic forecaster from St. Louis.
Neither Mr. Greenspan nor Ms. Rivlin made any comment after their confirmations. Mr. Meyer said he was "delighted that the long delay is over."
Although his previous term expired in March, Mr. Greenspan has continued to serve in an acting capacity. Mr. Meyer plans to be sworn in on Monday. Ms. Rivlin is expected to be sworn in later next week.
Mr. Greenspan, Ms. Rivlin and Mr. Meyer will then join the other four Fed governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks in participating in a two-day meeting starting July 2 at which the Fed will decide whether to raise interest rates to cool down a resurgent economy.
Ms. Rivlin and Mr. Meyer are judged by some economists to be slightly more sympathetic than Mr. Greenspan to arguments that inflation is a diminished threat. But neither of them is likely to push the Fed to diverge in any substantial way from Mr. Greenspan's strategy of attacking inflation early and making price stability the central bank's primary goal, economists said.
Mr. Harkin had held up a vote on Mr. Greenspan's confirmation until the Senate agreed to a full-scale debate, which finally began last week. Mr. Greenspan's critics argued that intense worldwide competition and a weakening of labor unions, among other factors, had made inflation much less of a threat than in the past. They said that Mr. Greenspan was keeping rates higher than needed, limiting the economy's ability to grow and create jobs.
"Raising the living standards and real wages of ordinary Americans is our No. 1 economic challenge," Mr. Harkin said before today's vote. "But time and time again, the policy of the Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan has stood in the way. Under the Greenspan Fed, job growth and the living standards of average Americans have been sacrificed on the altar of high interest rates and slow-growth policies."
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, said Mr. Greenspan "and his friends at the Fed seem to view themselves as a set of human brake pads whose sole mission in life is to slow down the American economy."
But Mr. Greenspan won support from most other Democrats and from all Republicans who voted.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, praised Mr. Greenspan for keeping "a steady hand at the tiller instead of taking the politically expedient course" of giving in to calls for a looser monetary policy.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, called Mr. Greenspan "a national treasure." Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said rejecting Mr. Greenspan would be a "tragic mistake."

HEADLINE: 2 Startling Arrests Capture Growing Mood That New York Is Safer

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
From time to time, a single incident or series of events seems to leap out of the vast variousness of New York City life and come to symbolize some emerging shift in the public mood.
The Zodiac killings in the spring and summer of 1990 became an emblem, in that extraordinarily violent time, of a growing fear among many New Yorkers that the city was out of control. 
 And now, in a time of dropping crime rates, two startling arrests have seized the imagination of a public that had been tentatively toying with the possibility that it might have become a little more safe.
Twice in a week, a combination of old-fashioned police work and newfangled fingerprint-matching technology have led the New York City police to conclude that they have solved an unusually high-profile and baffling case.
In the first instance, the police used a fingerprint from a fare-beating arrest to link John J. Royster Jr. to the beating and attempted rape of a young piano teacher in Central Park, the killing of a Park Avenue dry cleaner and two other attacks.
In the second, the distinctive handwriting of a man who signed a confession in a Brooklyn shootout led a detective to compare -- and match -- the man's fingerprints with prints believed to belong to the Zodiac gunman.
And in a weird parallel, police in Greenburgh, N.Y. said yesterday that fingerprints had enabled them to solve a year-and-a-half-long series of robberies, bludgeonings and killings of elderly people in New York suburbs.
"A particular event is made more or less important by the mood of the city," said Tom Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, a private watchdog group.
"Everybody is saying, 'Gee, they seem to be on a winning streak,' Mr. Reppetto said of the public response to the New York City arrests. "Which fits the mood that things are getting better in New York."
Not everyone agrees that the mood is justified -- or even that the city's spirits are really up. Some suggest the phenomenon is largely a creation of the media, the Mayor and police public relations.
"All this will be shot to hell if the next morning some poor jogger gets it in Central Park or Riverside Park," said Herbert J. Gans, a professor of sociology at Columbia University. "Meanwhile, the city's fundamental economic problems, particularly for the poorer people as the budget gets cut, they're still there."
It is not the first time that a incident in New York City -- often a crime -- has suddenly captivated public attention for what it seems to represent about a direction that the city is headed.
Like the 1990 Zodiac killings, the Son of Sam murders in 1976 and 1977 came amid a rising fear of crime and sense of chaos. The city was near bankruptcy, the subways decaying. When the power blacked out, looters took to the streets.
When Yusuf K. Hawkins, a black teen-ager, was killed during an attack by a gang of white youths in Bensonhurst in 1989, the incident came to symbolize a rising sense in an election year that the city had become polarized along racial lines.
Bernhard Goetz, the subway gunman, became the emblem of people's fears of subway violence. And the fatal stabbing of Kitty Genovese on a Queens street in 1964 while more than 30 neighbors ignored her cries for help came to embody public concerns about the depersonalizing effects of modern urban life.
Why a certain event takes on symbolic value at a certain moment in the city's history seems to depend often on a concatenation of factors including the cast of characters, the location, politics and the media.
Incidents involving New York City archetypes -- the aspiring artist, the immigrant, the tourist -- tend to make powerful symbols. So do incidents that occur in locations like the subway or Central Park.
Election-year politics can increase the likelihood that an event will come to seem to represent the zeitgeist, in part because it may get focused upon, interpreted, perhaps even simplified into a symbol.
Finally, the news media play a role. Some say the media create these events. Others say newspapers and television simply illuminate them, tapping into an already existing feeling.
"The media give it focus, the proper words, the pictures," said Thomas Kessner, a professor of history at CUNY Graduate School who specializes in the history of New York City.
"They dress it up in a certain way, so that people can simplify it into one of several easy perceptions: This place is strange, it's dangerous; or 'Great, we found the criminal.' "
The two arrests in New York City appear to meet many of those criteria.
Mr. Royster's arrest came in a case that involved, among others, an aspiring pianist brutally attacked in Central Park and a hard-working immigrant woman who was killed while opening her dry- cleaning business on the Upper East Side.
Even the attacker's technique -- smashing his victims' faces into the ground -- was symbolic, said Marshall Blonsky, who teaches semiotics, the interpretation of symbols, at The New School. His weapon was "New York itself -- the street."
So an arrest in such a case produces a kind of public catharsis. As Professor Blonsky put it: "When you get someone, it's a jubilee" -- not least of all for a Mayor facing re-election.
"I think that election politics certainly add yeast to this mix," Professor Kessner said of emblematic events in general. "People are looking for easy symbols and symbols they can sell in terms of their own position."
Another factor that can influence the symbolic power of an event is race, said Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, citing the arrest of Mr. Royster, who is black, in the attacks on four white women. "As a result of the location and the interracial dynamics involved, it receives more public attention," he said, comparing it to "equally horrific rapes and attacks that occur in poorer neighborhoods."
By contrast, Mr. Walcott said the media paid little attention to an incident that might well have taken on great significance of its own -- the shooting death of a suspected carjacker, who was black, by three white police officers in Brooklyn last week.
Since media attention focuses public attention and thus has the power to change public policy, Mr. Wallcott suggested that there is a need for "a more balanced coverage of horrific issues that impact on the fabric of life in the city, so it's not just relegated to the richer communities or the white communities."

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Expected to Buy Asset Manager

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley & Company, seeking to expand its asset management business, is expected to reach an agreement as early as this afternoon to buy Van Kampen American Capital Inc. from its controlling shareholder, Clayton Dubilier & Rice, for more than $700 million in cash, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
Van Kampen, which is based in Oakbrook, Ill., specializes in bonds and sells its mutual funds through brokers. It currently has more than $40 billion of mutual fund assets, or just over 1 percent of the mutual fund market, and earlier this year was ranked 20th in terms of mutual funds under management. 
 Philip N. Duff, Morgan's finance director, and Don Gogel, a senior Clayton officer, did not return telephone calls seeking comment late yesterday. A deal will probably not be announced until early next week.
The sale, which still could encounter roadblocks, would be but the latest step in Morgan Stanley's campaign to expand its asset management business, and would increase its assets under management to more than $150 billion. In the summer of 1995, Morgan Stanley bought Miller Anderson & Sherrerd L.L.P., a money manager based in Philadelphia, which then had $33 billion under management.
Like some other big financial companies, Morgan wants to build up asset management, which is generally perceived as a steady business that will provide predictable income in lean times. Managing money requires little capital and generates regular fee income.
Big banks and brokerage companies have eagerly been snapping up money managers. In December 1995, for example, Dresdner Bank of Germany agreed to pay $300 million to acquire RCM Capital Management.
Goldman, Sachs & Company, in a recent research report on the money management industry, predicted considerable consolidation in this industry, arguing that asset managers either have to be very large and benefit from economies of scale, or have to be niche players with particular specialties.
The sale of Van Kampen is expected to give a healthy profit to Clayton, a big investment firm, and its investors, who together control more than 80 percent of Van Kampen. Clayton originally acquired the Van Kampen Merritt Companies from Xerox Financial Services Inc. for about $400 million in 1992. In late 1994, Clayton agreed to acquire the American Capital Fund Group from the Travelers Group and later merged it with Van Kampen to create Van Kampen American Capital Inc.
Earlier this month, Van Kampen filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell $250 million of shares to the public. In recent days there have been reports that Morgan Stanley and the McGraw-Hill Companies were each discussing bids for Van Kampen.
For the first quarter, Van Kampen had net income of $15.2 million.

HEADLINE: To Infinity and Beyond: Is a Radio Deal Too Big?;
Westinghouse Would Own 32% of Top Markets

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Don Imus doesn't have much use for the argument that radio is coming under the grip of a few powerful owners.
"There are 11,000 radio stations around the country," said Mr. Imus, the vinegary talk-show host who is based at WFAN-AM in New York. "I'm on 85 and Howard Stern is on 30. For there to be some kind of monolithic invasion, we'd have to be on thousands of stations." 
 But as yesterday's merger of Westinghouse Electric and Infinity Broadcasting demonstrates, numbers alone do not tell the whole story about power in radio. Consumer advocates and some Federal regulators said this deal -- the largest in the history of the medium -- would give one company unprecedented control over advertising revenue and programming in the nation's largest radio markets, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
In New York alone, Westinghouse would own six stations, with a stable of personalities that range from Charles Osgood, the genteel morning commentator and poet manque on WCBS, to Mr. Imus and Mr. Stern, whose ribald commentary have made him the most famous and controversial individual in radio.
Such diversity has long been a hallmark of the radio industry. But as the Federal Government has loosened restrictions on the ownership of stations, companies like Westinghouse and Infinity have assembled powerful station groups. With the consolidation, critics say, has come generic and homogeneous programming.
"I feel sorry for the listeners," said Robert Unmacht, the editor of the M Street Journal, a radio industry newsletter. "Finding a creative and interesting radio station will be harder because the pressure is on to make them very much alike."
Mel Karmazin, the president and chief executive of Infinity, said yesterday that the $3.7 billion deal would not have happened without the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which relaxed station ownership limits further and set off an acquisition frenzy. Together, Westinghouse and Infinity would have 83 stations in 16 markets and total advertising revenue of $1 billion.
By leveraging its combined power in local markets, he said, Westinghouse could help radio capture a greater share of the ad dollars from newspapers and television.
Robert J. Coen, of the McCann-Erickson advertising agency, whose forecasts of advertising spending are closely watched, predicted that radio would account for $12 billion of the $172 billion in total 1996 spending.
"We think this is the kind of deal that was intended when the telecom bill was passed," Mr. Karmazin said.
Others are not so sure. More dangerous than its national reach, they said, is its potential dominance in local markets. In the top 10 markets, Westinghouse and Infinity commanded 32 percent of the total 1995 radio ad revenue, or $814 million, according to James Duncan Jr., the editor of Duncan's Radio Market Guide, a trade publication.
In New York, where Westinghouse and Infinity own three FM and three AM stations, the companies accounted for 37.7 percent of the ad market. Among their holdings are the city's two major all-news stations, WCBS-AM and WINS-AM; its only sports talk station, WFAN-AM; two FM rock stations, WNEW-FM and WXRK-FM; and a smaller station for Korean listeners, WZRC-AM.
In Boston, where the companies own five FM stations and one AM station, they had 43.6 percent of the radio advertising market. In Philadelphia, where they own three FM stations and three AM stations, Mr. Duncan estimated, the two earned 47.3 percent of the ad dollars.
"Forty percent would be quite a dominant position in a single market," said James H. Quello, a commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission, "We would have to take a hard look at that."
Even radio executives who champion consolidation expressed some trepidation about competing against Westinghouse.
"While you hate to have one company with that many stations, consolidation will make for a better industry," said Jeff Smulyan, the chairman of Emmis Broadcasting, which owns stations that would compete against Westinghouse in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
Consumer advocates said the Government should scrutinize the merger on antitrust grounds. "They clearly have excessive economic and political power in New York and Los Angeles," said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union, a lobbying group in Washington.
The Justice Department is looking into another radio deal: the proposed acquisition of Citicasters Inc. by Jacor Communications. The deal would give those companies four FM and two AM stations in Cincinnati -- stations with more than 60 percent of Cincinnati's radio ad revenue. At issue is whether the Government should weigh Jacor's percentage of Cincinnati's total advertising market or just its radio ad market.
Mr. Karmazin and Michael H. Jordan, the chairman of Westinghouse, said they were confident their merger would not violate antitrust statutes. And several regulatory experts seemed to agree. But executives close to the companies acknowledged that the deal might have a tougher time clearing the F.C.C.
The agency still prohibits a company that owns a television station from owning more than one AM and one FM radio station in that market, though numerous exceptions have been made. Westinghouse and Infinity would exceed that limit in most of their markets. And a company can own no more than eight radio stations in a major market, and no more than five on either FM or AM band.
That means Westinghouse would have to divest itself of three FM stations in Dallas, where it would own nine FM's and one AM. The combined companies would also have to sell two stations in Chicago.
In passing the telecommunications act, Congress directed the F.C.C. to award liberal waivers to companies exceeding the cross-ownership rules. Westinghouse obtained several waivers after it acquired CBS Inc., because the network's television stations put it above the cross-ownership limit in a number of markets.
Noting that the holdings of the merged companies would greatly exceed the cross-ownership limits in markets like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, one executive close to Westinghouse said, "The tricky putt will be getting this past the F.C.C."
Less prone to Government regulation but more important to listeners is the growing homogeneity of radio programming. Mr. Unmacht noted that Infinity has contributed mightily to an industry trend in which stations have shifted their programming -- often in lockstep -- for fear of losing listeners.
Since 1994, for example, five of New York's FM stations switched their format to modern rock. Infinity's WXRK, one of the last holdouts with its classic rock format, joined the crowd earlier this year.
Mr. Unmacht also noted that Mr. Karmazin's emphasis on lean budgets and high profits might clash with Westinghouse, which has spent more on its all-news stations.
In particular, he said, WCBS-FM, a highly rated New York station that plays oldies and has an expensive roster of disk jockeys, might have a rocky ride under Mr. Karmazin.
Other industry experts attribute the sameness of radio programming to a variety of factors other than consolidation: the splintering of music into more narrow niches; the increased reliance of market research; new technology; and even simple human nature.
"Once you have something that's proven, you go with it," said Tom Zarecki, the director of marketing services at Radio Computing Services, a computer software company that caters to the radio industry. "Programming doesn't get worse with group owners, it gets better, because programming concepts get tested more."
Like many others in radio, Mr. Zarecki said he felt a Westinghouse-Infinity merger would improve the industry by making it more profitable, more professional, and putting it on a better footing with newspapers and broadcast television.
Still, the mere success of a company like Mr. Zarecki's speaks to the industry's changes. Radio Computing Services developed the Selector, a computer-software program for radio stations that automatically picks and plays a sequence of songs.
One of his best clients is Infinity, which uses the Selector at WXRK in New York to play a pre-set schedule of modern rock songs.

Westinghouse to Acquire Infinity for $3.7 Billion
Westinghouse Electric will acquire Infinity Broadcasting for $3.7 billion, merging the nation's two largest radio broadcasters in a deal made possible by a new telecommunications law that lifted the limits of radio station ownership.
A merger of Westinghouse, a large industrial company that also owns the CBS radio and television networks, and Infinity, the nation's largest independent broadcaster, would create a radio giant particularly potent in the nation's largest markets. [Page A1.]
Mel Karmazin, widely regarded as the nation's most successful radio executive, has dodged the limelight. Until now. [D5.]
 
Green Light for Greenspan
The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Alan Greenspan to a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, brushing aside arguments from a few Democrats that he had held back economic growth by focusing too narrowly on fighting inflation. [D2.]
 
Rising Oil Prices Push Trade Gap
The highest oil prices since the Persian Gulf war helped widen the American trade deficit as imports and exports climbed to record levels. So far this year, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $98.9 billion, only a slight improvement from the seven-year high of $105.06 billion set in 1995. [D3.]
 
Owens-Corning Asbestos Suit
Owens-Corning, the building-products manufacturer that has been chafing from decades of asbestos litigation, has sued three medical-testing laboratories, contending that they falsified tens of thousands of test results supporting claims against the company. [D3.]

Court Rules on Bargaining
The Supreme Court ruled that it is not an antitrust violation for companies within an industry to get together and impose new contract terms on their unionized employees after labor negotiations have broken down. The decision was a victory for National Football League team owners and has implications for all industries that conduct bargaining on a multi-employer basis. [A1.]

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Up 7.7% In April on High Oil Prices

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
The highest oil prices since the Persian Gulf war helped widen the American trade deficit as imports and exports climbed to record levels.
The Commerce Department reported today that the deficit in goods and services rose 7.7 percent in April to $8.63 billion, after a March imbalance of $8.01 billion. 
 The Clinton Administration, under heavy fire from Republican critics for an ever-widening trade deficit, played down the April increase in imports and stressed instead the growth in exports. It offers proof, spokesmen said, that President Clinton's emphasis on market-opening trade deals is paying off.
"Today's numbers are just one example of a broad spectrum of recently released data showing a healthy economy," Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor told reporters. "The U.S. economy is continuing to expand and provide increasing opportunity for American workers."
Mr. Kantor noted that the April deficit was 20 percent lower than the same month in 1995. Private economists, however, were not as impressed. They said that while there was a narrowing of the deficit from horrendous levels in early 1995, the improvements have stalled recently.
"We are now stuck in a range of monthly deficits of between $8 billion and $9 billion, where we have been since last fall," said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. "Analysts who had been counting on additional declines in the deficit to spur U.S. economic growth this year are going to be disappointed."
So far this year, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $98.9 billion, only a slight improvement from the seven-year high of $105.06 billion imbalance of 1995.
But two other reports today did show some signs of strength in the economy. The Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 last week to 357,000, the first decline in four weeks, and a larger drop than economists expected. Still, the less volatile four-week moving average of new claims rose by 3,000, to 354,250.
And a survey of business conditions done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that economic activity rose significantly in June, with the lag between when goods are ordered and when they can be delivered rising sharply. The Philadelphia Fed said its general economic index, compiled from a survey of area manufacturers, rose to 25.6 for June from 16.0 in May.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, said she believed this Fed survey was "one more reason to expect the Fed to tighten" when central bank policy makers meet on July 2-3.
The trade report showed that imports of goods and services rose 1.7 percent in April to a record high of $78.57 billion, reflecting the jump in oil prices and volume and higher shipments of foreign cars.
Petroleum imports soared 30 percent, to $5.85 billion, as the average price for a barrel of crude surged to $19.33, the most expensive since the start of the Persian Gulf war in January 1991. The price was $17.33 in March, but analysts noted that oil prices had already retreated from the peak as supplies increased.
U.S. exports of goods and services also set a record during the month, climbing 1 percent, to $69.94 billion, reflecting higher sales of commercial aircraft and consumer products.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said today that the first-quarter deficit in the United States current account rose to $35.6 billion, a 16.9 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 1995. The current account is the broadest measure of United States trade because it includes not only the goods and services covered in the monthly reports but also investment flows and foreign aid payments.
The higher current account deficit for the January-to-March period reflected deficits in goods, investment flows and the category that includes foreign aid and a smaller surplus in services.

HEADLINE: A Park on the Hudson River

 BODY:
Few cities are blessed with as much waterfront property as New York. Few have made such abysmal use of it. Now the city and state seem to be coming together on a plan that will turn the depressing expanse of rotting piers along the Hudson into a park that will allow residents and tourists to appreciate what it means to live along the water.
The land between Battery Park and 59th Street in Manhattan has been in limbo since the Westway highway project was abandoned over a decade ago. Opposition from environmentalists doomed Westway. A less ambitious roadway is being constructed in its place. But the 550-acre strip between the new road and the Hudson is still in limbo. 
 The best possible plan for this precious asset would be one that rehabilitates the decaying piers, balances passive open space with ball fields and water-based recreation, and allows for small businesses, like restaurants and marinas, that would encourage the public to visit the waterfront.
Charles Gargano, the state's top economic development official, has endorsed a plan along these lines. But Gov. George Pataki has yet to speak. He must do more than express his approval. The project will not go far unless the state agrees to match the $100 million promised by the city.
The park's architects propose an esplanade along the length of the waterfront, and would convert 13 of the 37 decrepit piers into ball fields, playgrounds and public gardens. Of the 550 acres, which includes the piers, open land and the water between the piers, 49 would be set aside for commercial development. Restaurants and small shops would be permitted in only three areas. Two of them, Chelsea Piers and the maritime district around 42d Street, are already developed. The third, in Greenwich Village, is home to a parking garage. The revenue spun off by the businesses would be used to underwrite maintenance of the park.
Mr. Pataki's commitment is essential. Work on the new highway abutting the east side of the waterfront has already begun. Repair of the piers and construction of the park will be a less costly burden on the surrounding community if the two projects can be done in tandem.
A spokesman for Mr. Gargano said the Governor must be convinced that the park is "something the community wants" -- an allusion to threats of lawsuits if the plan goes into effect. The opponents generally favor a park without any commercial development, even if it amounts to little more than a bikeway and walkway. The fancier the park gets, they argue, the more expensive it will be to maintain, and the more pressure to permit additional business use to generate revenue.
But most of the real open space along the river is on the giant piers. The new plan -- the product of years of work and community consultation by the Hudson River Park Conservancy -- addresses the challenge of fixing the piers and making them useful. It is a good plan, and rejecting it might mean an end to any park for the foreseeable future.
Since the territory below 34th Street belongs to the state, there would be nothing to keep Mr. Gargano's authority from allowing commercial development there anyway, as it already did with the huge Chelsea Piers athletic complex. Chelsea Piers is a popular facility, but the last thing the waterfront needs is uncoordinated development that is not centered on the principle of public access.
Mr. Pataki may be able to get the state's $100 million share of the park's cost from his proposed environmental bond act. Once that critical commitment is in place, officials must still make sure the park plan includes protections that will convince even the most worried opponent that wide-scale commercialization of the riverfront is not on the agenda.

Burning Their Bridges

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
If the racist firebugs in the South had any sense at all they would stop torching black churches. The fires are bad for the racism business. Each church that goes up in smoke generates sympathy for the very folks who have been so assiduously stereotyped and demonized over the last few decades.
The media spotlight is now focused on the fires, and the prevailing image of the black people involved (typically one-dimensional) is that of humble congregants standing in the humid night air with tears streaming down their faces as they watch their houses of worship crackle and burn. 
 There hasn't been such a counterproductive outburst of bigotry since 1963, when the police commissioner of Birmingham, Ala., T. Eugene (Bull) Connor, unleashed his dogs and turned the city's fire hoses on peaceful demonstrators.
A lot of whites looked at photos and film footage of Connor's cruelty and said that's enough. Something similar may be happening now.
Condemning the church fires, President Clinton said: "This tears at the very heart of what it means to be an American. This has got to stop."
His comments were an echo, more than three decades later, of President Kennedy, who said he was sickened by a newspaper photo of a black woman recoiling in fear from one of Connor's lunging dogs.
The arsonists are too dim-witted to get it, but there is hardly a better way to heighten the public's awareness of the true evil of racism than to keep burning down churches.
The fires have even smoked out the Christian right, a symbol of white intransigence on matters of race. "I would not deny," said Ralph Reed, director of the Christian Coalition, "that there was a time in our nation's history when the white evangelical church was not only on the sidelines, but on the wrong side of the most central struggle for social justice in this century. I think that was wrong; I think we paid a price for that."
Discussing the fires on "Meet the Press" last Sunday, Mr. Reed acknowledged that "there were white evangelicals in the South who justified Jim Crow and segregation, and invoked Scripture to do it." He said that his organization, which is raising money to rebuild some of the churches, must "make racial conciliation a major priority" if it is to have "a morally resonant voice" on other issues.
All of this is well and good. Expressions of outrage and repentance from whatever quarters are welcome. But it is important to keep in mind that we are not dealing here with spontaneous combustion. The fuel for these fires can be traced to a carefully crafted environment of bigotry and hatred that was developed over the past quarter-century. The aim of that effort, racist to its very core, was to roll back the gains of the civil rights era and keep blacks and other ethnic minorities socially and economically marginalized.
Expressions of outrage over the burning of churches is not enough to atone for that shameful effort.
As Roger Wilkins said in an interview this week: "I certainly welcome the President's personal concern and his directions to his subordinates to do all they can to solve these crimes. At the same time, I can't avert my eyes from the much larger tragedy of those millions of blacks who are effectively excluded from the economic life of this country, and those thousands and thousands of children whose lives are being consumed in the flames of poverty."
On Wednesday the President met with Southern governors and promises of additional assistance were made. At the same time, volunteers from around the country are working with the stricken congregations in biracial, bipartisan rebuilding efforts. This could be the beginning of a new era of mutual respect and cooperation.
But as Mr. Wilkins noted, there are more urgent problems facing blacks in America than the burning of churches. Black unemployment has been in double digits for more than two decades. The educational facilities available to desperately poor black and Latino children are a scandal. And the effort by those who are well off to set fire to the safety net for the poorest of America's poor continues.
While the nation responds to the burning of churches, the greater tragedies continue to be ignored.

HEADLINE: 9 in Former Javits Center Union Held in Fraud

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

 BODY:
Nine members of a union that used to represent workers at the corruption-plagued Jacob K. Javits Convention Center were charged yesterday with illegally obtaining union health benefits, unemployment compensation and Social Security benefits, as well as with loan sharking.
The charges against members of the Exhibition Employees Union Local 829, including the local president and vice president, were the first connected to the Javits Center since Gov. George E. Pataki announced a major reorganization at the center last summer. The union no longer represents workers there, and the crimes the men are accused of occurred before the reorganization. 
 The Governor's action last year was prompted by longstanding allegations that the center and its unions were rife with corruption and influenced by organized crime. Exhibitors at the huge glass structure on the West Side of Manhattan regularly complained of featherbedding, inefficient workers and exorbitant costs for such simple activities as plugging in extension cords.
The charges announced yesterday by District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau are not directly related to those types of complaints. Indeed, in at least one of them, the loan-sharking charge, the principal victims were union members themselves. Nonetheless, officials depicted the activity as part of a general climate of corruption at the center.
"What we saw at the Javits Center prior to the new administration was an atmosphere of lawlessness on the floor," said Dan Castleman, Mr. Morgenthau's chief of investigations. "It was exactly this type of conduct: loan-sharking and gambling, no-show jobs, manufacturing of false identities to obtain benefits, staged accidents that led to workmen's compensation claims and lawsuits."
The local president, John V. McNamee Sr., and vice president, Paul Coscia, were charged in a scheme to obtain health benefits for a man whom prosecutors said was an associate of the Genovese crime family but not a union member. The two men, along with two rank-and-file members, James McCann Sr. and Thomas Donovan, were accused of submitting false claims totaling almost $50,000 to the health insurance providers, Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Aetna Life and Casualty. Prosecutors said almost $30,000 had been paid.

NEW YORK
 
Math Scores Up at Schools
For the second year in a row, elementary school students in all 32 New York City school districts raised their scores in a standardized test of math skills, and continued a four-year trend of improving math performance citywide, officials announced. While students did not fare as well in reading, officials attributed the results to a more difficult reading test this year. [Page B1.]
 
Central Park Victim Gains
The woman who was severely beaten in Central Park two weeks ago has regained consciousness and begun to communicate with family and doctors, a change her physician described as an "absolutely crucial step" toward recovery. On Wednesday, the 32-year-old piano teacher demonstrated awareness for the first time since the attack by responding to simple questions with a nod or shake of the head and by mouthing her name, said her neurosurgeon. And yesterday, able to move her arms and legs, she sat up in a chair. [B1.]
 
In a time of dropping crime rates, two stunning arrests have seized the city's imagination. [B3.]
 
With her son being arraigned in Brooklyn court, the mother of the man accused in the Zodiac killings speaks out. [B3.]
 
A Fallen Club King Speaks Out
These are bad times for Peter Gatien, the fallen nightclub king of New York's under-25 world. He was indicted for conspiracy to distribute the drug Ecstasy at two of his clubs. He is under investigation for tax evasion. He may lose his liquor license. And he's already losing money. Now, Mr. Gatien, with his lawyer at his side, is on the defense. [B1.]
 
In Defense of 911
While New York City's 911 emergency system has come under scrutiny over a call related to a much-publicized criminal case, the problem may be more a case of citizen irresponsibility. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
A Package Bomb Explodes
A package bomb that resembled four others sent to New Yorkers over the last 14 years exploded when a Brooklyn man opened it, the police said. The man, Richard Basile, 77, of Bensonhurst, was apparently not injured. As in the previous attacks, including a fatal explosion in 1982, the motive is unknown. [B4.]
 
Sticking With Flat Cab Fare
The flat $30 cab fare from Kennedy International Airport, an experiment conceived to keep unscrupulous cabbies from taking passengers into Manhattan by way of, say, Staten Island, has been made permanent -- at least until autumn. [B4.]
 
Union Members Face Charges
Nine members of a union that used to represent workers at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center were charged with illegally getting union health benefits, unemployment compensation and Social Security benefits, as well as loan sharking. [B4.]
 
Indicted on Lesser Charges
A Suffolk County grand jury has indicted a New York City police detective on assault charges, rather than attempted murder, in last month's racially tinged attack on a black man outside a Westhampton Beach, L.I., nightclub. [B5.]
 
Psychiatrist Defends Response
A psychiatrist defended his treatment of a 17-year-old girl, Nancy Blumenthal, left, who committed suicide at the Westchester County Jail last month, saying that the girl did not want to take her antidepressant medication and he could not force her to do so. His comments were in response to a report that criticized his decision to withhold the antidepressant medication. [B6.]
 
REGION
 
S.I. Man Charged in Crimes
A Staten Island man was charged with murdering a 65-year-old Greenburgh, N.Y., homeowner in April, and the authorities linked him to another killing on Long Island and a wave of vicious robberies against elderly people throughout the New York City suburbs. The police said the crimes involved the 31-year-old suspect insinuating himself inside an elderly person's house by offering to do repair work and then pushing his victims down their stairs or bludgeoning them with objects from their homes. [A1.]
 
A suspect, stunned that he was actually arrested, had good reason to believe he was beyond the reach of the law. [B2.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Action Against Lawyers Urged
An ethics committee for the State Supreme Court recommended disciplinary action against lawyers who sought clients after a natural gas pipeline exploded in Edison. The committee said the lawyers violated rules against soliciting business from victims of accidents or disasters. [B5.]
 
Head of Newark Police Charged
A Federal grand jury charged the Newark police director, William R. Celester, with using a departmental investigation fund as a personal bank account, spending the money on items ranging from gifts for his wife to trips to Bermuda to campaign contributions to the Mayor and members of the City Council. [B5.]

Going Nowhere Together

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The good news from the Census Bureau is that the rich are getting richer faster than they used to get richer. The bad news, of course, is that the poor are still either getting poorer or not getting a bit richer.
This is the kind of situation that, if allowed to continue to its logical conclusion, ends with ill-clad soreheads cheering while the flower of the American boardroom goes to the guillotine. 
 Fortunately the logical conclusion is unlikely to be reached in our time. In other words, let future generations look out for themselves, and while you're up get me another Mercedes Benz.
In any event, the well-heeled of that pleasantly distant future will probably not have to face the guillotine. Americans may love capital punishment, but they like it in quiet good taste. When the logical conclusion overtakes those C.E.O.'s of the future, testy American paupers will doubtless prefer to spin them off by lethal injection.
But why dwell morbidly on a future further away than next quarter's earnings report? What matters now is keeping the unrich from becoming disgruntled about their measly lot. Keeping the unrich gruntled constantly occupies our two political parties.
How do they do it? With programs of gruntlement maintenance, or disgruntlement impedance, as for some strange reason it is not called in Washington, home office of mushmouth English.
Whatever you call it, the point is to keep the unrich from turning churlish and rising up against the conspiracy of lawyers and business that is the Federal Government. At present, for instance, the parties are conducting a political campaign distinguished by great heat and little of anything that has to do with the price of eggs, or the price of anything else, including labor, housing, transportation or corporate subsidies.
The goal of both parties is to keep the public's eye off the ball. This purpose is conveniently served at the moment by the Whitewater affair, which is a kind of political version of "Entertainment Tonight," rich in headlines and spicy with topics for gossipy back-fence argument.
It is said to be a vital subject because it goes to the "character" issue. Leaving aside the question of what "character" has to do with conducting tricky affairs of state, note how happily it diverts public attention from the widening split between the rich and the unrich.
Neither party has anything arresting to say about the "downsizing" of the work force, the collapse of union labor, the death of the cities, the decline of health care, the financing crisis in social programs, or much of anything else that truly competing parties might be debating just now.
Whitewater and the "character" issue give both parties something entertaining to snarl about on television. The Roman emperors knew it was vital to provide the crowd with bread and circus both. Democrats and Republicans now provide circus for the crowd while laying on the bread for the moneyed society that keeps them in power.
The value of the "character" issue is the excuse it gives them for ignoring most matters of consequence. This week's report from the Census Bureau illustrates how effective both parties have been at playing Tweedledum and Tweedledee with the public.
Census figures show that during the Clinton Administration the rich have gotten richer considerably faster than the usual rate, yet it doesn't seem to have made much difference with people making over $100,000 per year.
In the 1994 Congressional elections, a majority (55 percent) of them voted for Republican candidates. Among voters earning less than $15,000 per year, 62 percent voted for Democrats. You might conclude from this that while a majority of the rich didn't think Clinton had anything to do with their fattening bank accounts, a large majority of the poor didn't think so either, so felt no anger at him.
The probable truth, of course, is that neither group thought about it one way or the other, because both parties had distracted them with more entertaining matters. Ronald Reagan was the master of this technique. While keeping the crowd hot about "social issues," Reagan did very little about them, but steadily, quietly redistributed the wealth upward.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Strengthens Again On Outlook Abroad for Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened yesterday for the third consecutive day in a rally powered by new signs that Japan's interest rates would remain low and that European rates would fall.
Some traders said the political shake-up in Russia had also helped strengthen the dollar and weaken the German mark, which is vulnerable to uncertainties in Russia because Germany is Russia's largest trading partner. 
 But the main force driving the dollar higher came from Japan, where the central bank took a step to persuade the market that it would not raise interest rates despite evidence that the Japanese economy was rebounding. Higher rates would increase the yen's value but could crimp economic recovery.
The Bank of Japan injected 400.2 billion yen into the banking system during a regular maintenance operation, an amount considered extraordinarily large. The move helped reduce overnight bank lending rates to slightly less than the official discount rate, which has been at a record low of five-tenths of a percent since September. Traders sold yen and bought dollars in response.
"The dollar basically went straight up today," said Seth Cohen, a director of foreign-exchange trading at Merrill Lynch. "I think the market is finally starting to believe the Japanese authorities when they say rates aren't going up anytime soon."
In New York, the dollar traded at 109.07 yen, up from 108.20 on Thursday and the highest level in a week. The dollar also traded at 1.5341 marks, up from 1.5240 on Thursday and the highest level since June 12. The British pound cost $1.5350, down from $1.5380.
The dollar was also helped indirectly in Europe by optimism that Italy's central bank was about to cut interest rates. The increased hopes came from new signs of milder inflation in Italy and Government approval of a more austere budget. Sweden's central bank cut rates earlier in the week.
Though it remains unclear whether Germany will still lower rates, traders said there was some optimism that it could happen when the central bank convenes at its regularly scheduled meeting next Thursday.
Some traders said the mark had come under pressure because of reports of turmoil in the Kremlin. President Boris N. Yeltsin forced out three high-ranking officials on Thursday. Mr. Yeltsin will face Gennadi A. Zyguvanov, the Communist challenger, in a runoff election for President on July 3.

HEADLINE: Treasury Securites Gain; Hedge-Fund Buying Seen

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities improved in light trading yesterday, as talk of hedge-fund buying and rumors of central bank activity in the short end of the market helped support prices.
Traders attributed the rumors in the market to subdued activity in trading coupled with the lack of key economic data ahead of the weekend. 
 Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said the market was never able to capitalize on gains earlier in the week, trading instead in a narrow range with an eye on next week's Treasury auctions.
"Most likely, the front end will soften up a little bit more to lure investors into Tuesday's and Wednesday's auctions," Mr. Burtnick said. With the end of the quarter approaching, he said, most investors and dealers will spend the next week cutting back their positions before the Federal Reserve meeting in early July.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 4/32 of a percentage point, to 86 17/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 7.09 percent, from 7.10 percent on Thursday.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of Government bond trading at Cowen & Company, does not believe market sentiment has been affected. "There was some hedge-fund buying in the five-year sector today, and we did hear of overnight buying in the two- and five-year sectors," he said. "Coupled with options expirations, the market managed to maintain its tone."
He added that "coming supply will weigh on market prices." Mr. Gamba also said that in a skittish market he would not be surprised to see bond prices drop ahead of next week's auctions.
Carroll J. Delaney of Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said most players were out the door for weekend getaways shortly after noon. "At the beginning of today's trading session, there was already the strong possibility that the day would be uneventful, as the only reports out were hardly the type of straws to even slightly stir the drink," he said.
Mr. Delaney added that investors should be concerned about the Treasury market. "Price-yield levels do appear to represent value, but aside from foreign central bank buying of shorter maturities and hedge fund and other leveraged players' purchases of intermediate and longer paper, real end users of the magnitude and duration needed to ignite a serious rally have not appeared," he said
Mr. Delaney said the current market profile was almost a mirror image of the situation six months ago, when Treasuries had significantly less value, but buyers kept marching in. "The lesson here," Mr. Delaney said, "is that because the market is oversold or overbought, doesn't mean that it can't become more so. So while we do see the prevailing yields as attractive, without the approbation of real money investors, they will become even more attractive, especially when confronted with next week's supply."
If the two-year and five-year bill auctions can be "successfully digested and distributed, the potential for a corrective rally is enhanced," Mr. Delaney said.
In when-issued trading late in the day, the two-year bill was being offered at a price to yield 6.32 percent and the five-year issue at a price to yield 6.71 percent.
Separately, the Lockheed Martin Corporation priced this week's largest deal, selling $1.5 billion of debt in three parts through CS First Boston.
The aerospace company, which sold $3.5 billion in debt securities less than two months ago, in the largest investment-grade debt offering ever, priced $500 million of 2-year notes yesterday to yield 6.63 percent, $550 million of 8-year notes to yield 7.48 percent and $450 million of 12-year notes to yield 7.703 percent.

HEADLINE: Rich Control More of U.S. Wealth, Study Says, as Debts Grow for Poor

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 21

 BODY:
Wealth became more concentrated in the United States from 1989 through late 1994 as affluent families profited from financial markets while many poorer families fell deeper into debt, new data from the University of Michigan show.
The most prosperous 10 percent of American households held 61.1 percent of the nation's wealth in 1989 and 66.8 percent in late 1994, the University of Michigan found. At the same time, the average family in the poorest 10 percent of the nation's population had debts exceeding assets by $7,075 in 1994, measured in 1996 dollars, compared with a negative net worth of $4,744 in 1989. 
 The new figures came just two days after the Census Bureau announced that the gap in annual income between the most affluent Americans and everybody else was wider than at any other time since World War II.
While the Census Bureau looked at families' salaries and other incomes, the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, focused on families' net worth -- assets like stocks, bonds, bank accounts, houses and cars, minus debts like mortgages, home equity lines and credit card balances.
The trend toward rising disparities between the rich and poor has been well documented. But the university's data also showed that the middle class in the United States was becoming more prosperous.
If all American families were ranked from richest to poorest, the family in the middle -- what statisticians call the median family -- had a net worth of $62,395 in 1994, up from $47,742 in 1989, after adjusting for inflation. Most of the middle class's net worth came from their homes.
But the latest figures also show fairly little social mobility. Half the families with more debts than assets in 1989 were in the same predicament in 1994, and often even more in debt, said Frank P. Stafford, the co-director of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.
With banks and other lenders becoming more aggressive in pursuing marginal credit applicants, Mr. Stafford said, "it's not too surprising that we see bankruptcies rising at a time of economic expansion."
In its study, the university used figures from its regular surveys of close to 7,000 families, some of which have been in the study since 1968. The university did not include the value of personal belongings like clothing and television sets. The data also do not include accrued pension and Social Security benefits, which are hard to measure reliably. The inclusion of Social Security would narrow the measured gap between rich and poor, but the effect of including pensions is unclear, Mr. Stafford said.
A few economists expressed skepticism when told about the University of Michigan's results. Arthur B. Kennickell, a Federal Reserve Board expert on consumer finances, said that it was inappropriate to use research based on a long-running study of households.
Very rich and very poor families tend to drop out of such studies over time, so that the remaining respondents are disproportionately middle class, Mr. Kennickell said. And too few of the households in the sample are very wealthy, making it hard to reach conclusions about how much money the rich have, he added.
Mr. Kennickell said that his own research at the Federal Reserve was more reliable because extra surveys were done to determine the net worth of rich families, which are often reluctant to tell pollsters about their money.
Mr. Stafford disagreed with Mr. Kennickell's criticisms, saying that the University of Michigan data were weighted to be nationally representative. Mr. Stafford also said that the Federal Reserve had very low response rates on its extra surveys of the rich, to which Mr. Kennickell responded that the Fed had weighted its results to compensate for a response rate that he said was 20 percent.
Timothy Smeeding, an expert on income and wealth distribution at Syracuse University, said that the University of Michigan data were probably not reliable for the wealthiest 1 percent of American families, but that they were a very good measure of the rest of the population. Mr. Stafford said he had decided not to release any figures specifically on the top 1 percent for precisely this reason, presenting data instead on groups of 5 to 20 percent of the population.
The university's Institute for Social Research is best known on Wall Street for its monthly figures on consumer confidence. But it also runs the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a widely cited continuous survey of household finances in the United States.
The National Institute on Aging, a Federal agency, has bankrolled much of the panel's research since 1980 as part of an effort to determine whether Americans are saving enough money for retirement.
The Fed and the University of Michigan are the two best-known sources for detailed data on household assets.
Mr. Kennickell's figures and Mr. Stafford's data show few broad shifts during the 1980's in the overall concentration of income, with the exception that the Fed figures show the top 1 percent becoming considerably richer. But the Fed and University of Michigan analyses differ considerably on more recent trends.
Mr. Kennickell said there was little change from 1989 to 1992, the most recent available years in the Fed data. The super-rich lost ground to the merely affluent, but there was little change in the overall share of the nation's wealth held by the richest 10 percent of the population.
By contrast, Mr. Stafford at the University of Michigan found that between 1989 and 1994, the bottom 90 percent of the population lost part of their share of the nation's wealth to the top 10 percent.
Mr. Kennickell said that it was possible that wealth became more concentrated in 1993 and 1994, two years covered by the University of Michigan but not by the Fed. The stock market climbed during this period, but the bond market plunged in 1994.
Rich people tend to have much more of their money in stocks and bonds than the less well off do, with the most affluent 10 percent of households accounting for four-fifths of American holdings of stocks. Middle-class families have a much higher proportion of their money in their homes. So rising financial markets tend to produce wider inequality of wealth.
Mr. Stafford said that such an explanation was plausible for the University of Michigan's findings, while noting that it would be surprising for wealth to become more concentrated under a Democratic Administration that has at times favored policies to redistribute wealth.

HEADLINE: No Jail Time for Ex-Policeman Who Shot a Fellow Officer

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

 BODY:
The defense, the judge and even the victim came together yesterday in a surprisingly gentle final act to the wrenching drama of a white police officer who mistakenly shot an undercover black policeman on a Manhattan subway platform. They all agreed that the defendant should be spared jail.
In a proceeding so devoid of the usual bile it hardly seemed like a sentencing, Peter Del-Debbio, who mistook his fellow officer for a criminal and shot him five times, was given five years' probation and 200 hours of community service for his conviction on assault charges. 
 Desmond Robinson, the man Mr. Del-Debbio gravely wounded in those moments of panic and confusion two years ago, pleaded for leniency for him yesterday. In Mr. Robinson's few moments on the witness stand in the crowded, quiet courtroom, he spoke of a kind of bond with his assailant. The two men, he said, were both forced out of a profession they loved by the shooting.
Almost from the moment Officer Del-Debbio's shots rang through the subway station at 53d Street and Lexington Avenue on Aug. 22, 1994, the case stirred controversy and anger.
Many black officers said the incident showed once again that their white colleagues were too quick to perceive blacks as criminals, leading them at times to fire by mistake at undercover black officers. Their anger increased when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and William J. Bratton, then the Police Commissioner, seemed to defend Officer Del-Debbio's conduct.
The incident also led the Police Department to review its procedures for reducing the risk of so-called friendly-fire shootings.
As for the two principals, their lives have been shattered by the shooting and its aftermath.
Mr. Robinson is in constant pain, with one of Mr. Del-Debbio's bullets still lodged in his back. And he now faces serious legal problems of his own: he was charged with sexual assault after a night of drinking with a female officer in May. He is unemployed, spending much of his time in physical and mental therapy, and is suing Mr. Del-Debbio and the city for $50 million.
Mr. Del-Debbio was convicted of second-degree assault on March 26 and dismissed by the Police Department. He now works as a laborer, doing street construction.
The incident that linked the two men began when a youth dropped a shotgun on an F train stopped in the station, and it went off.
Officer Del-Debbio, who was off duty and happened to be at the scene, heard the shot and picked up the shotgun just as Officer Robinson and other transit officers approached.
What happened next was remembered differently by both men, fueling the racial tension that arose around the highly publicized case. Mr. Del-Debbio said he had seen an armed man -- Mr. Robinson, who was not displaying a badge -- running toward him, and he fired.
But Mr. Robinson recollected that he had been running alongside the car, not toward the other officer. Prosecutors said two or three of the five shots fired by Mr. Del-Debbio had hit Mr. Robinson in the back as he was falling, or lying on the ground.
Despite the concerns that were raised in the aftermath of the shooting, the trial focused not on race but on the question of whether Mr. Del-Debbio had used excessive force. In convicting him of second-degree assault, the jurors concluded that he had acted recklessly.
The defendant and the victim did not look at each other in court yesterday. But as Mr. Robinson slowly read from a statement, there was no evidence of lingering hostility. Mr. Robinson spoke at first of "confusion, anger, sadness, disappointment, bitterness, understanding."
That last word set the tone for what followed.
"I cannot help but feel a strong bond with all fellow police officers, regardless of whether they are black or white, male or female, active or retired," Mr. Robinson said.
Noting that Mr. Del-Debbio had lost his job because of the conviction, Mr. Robinson said: "Perhaps more than anyone, I can understand the pain and emptiness that Peter Del-Debbio must feel, having been forced to leave the job. I know, from my own experience, that the loss of being able to serve the people of this city as an active member of the N.Y.P.D. is a harsh punishment in itself."
He said that jail for Mr. Del-Debbio "would serve no purpose" and urged the judge to show mercy.
In a seemingly anticlimactic presentation, Mr. Del-Debbio's lawyers then offered lengthy arguments for why their client should not go to jail. "Peter Del-Debbio reacted as a police officer," said one lawyer, Richard Murray. "In that split second, he had to make a decision."
Even the prosecution conceded that Justice Bernard J. Fried's task yesterday was difficult. An assistant district attorney, Raymond Castello, suggested four months in jail, to be served on weekends.
Justice Fried referred to Mr. Robinson's statement, saying: "He believes jail time would serve no purpose. I should listen to him long and hard." He then imposed the sentence of probation and community service.
Mr. Del-Debbio declined to comment, though lawyers said they would appeal his conviction. But the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Lou Mattarazzo, said: "We're very happy with the sentence. I think the judge showed the milk of human kindness."
Still, the 100-odd officers in the courtroom were not jubilant, perhaps reflecting a feeling among many on the force that Mr. Del-Debbio should not have been prosecuted at all. "There never should have been a conviction," said Richard O'Neill, a P.B.A. official. "There never should have been a trial."
But Michael Greys, a vice president of the Guardians, a black police fraternal organization, assailed the judge for not sending Mr. Del-Debbio to jail. Saying Mr. Robinson did not speak for other black officers in seeking leniency, he added, "We are disgusted by this sentence."

F.A.A. Says Kiwi Will Cut Operations
The Federal Aviation Administration said that Kiwi International Airlines had reduced its fleet and its number of flights because many of its pilots were improperly trained and it lacked the personnel to run all its planes. 
 The action against Kiwi came four days after the agency grounded another small airline, Valujet, over maintenance issues. Kiwi has been under scrutiny by the F.A.A. for some time and was effectively grounded for a time in December 1994 because of training problems. [Page 20.]
 
Manhattan Bagel Stock Plummets
Manhattan Bagel stock fell more than 35 percent after the chain said it would lower its first-quarter earnings because of accounting irregularities at its West Coast unit. The company estimated the total amount involved to be about $350,000 on a pretax basis. [32.]

Blue Chips Rise in Heavy Trading
Blue-chip stocks rose sharply in very heavy trading, buoyed by a rebound in the battered technology stocks and the quarterly "triple witching" expiration of option and futures contracts. The Dow industrial average ended 45.80 points higher at 5,705.23, its first close above 5,700 in nearly a month. [35.]
 
Hitachi Has Fastest Supercomputer
A study says that Hitachi of Japan is the maker of the fastest supercomputer in the world. The new machine is capable of reaching a speed of more than 220 billion mathematical operations a second. [32.]
 
Lloyd's Bid to Stay Afloat
Lloyd's of London, in a bid to remain solvent, advised money-losing investors about the size of their final bills and threatened to fight anybody who will not pay. It offered 3.1 billion, or $4.7 billion, to help investors hit hard by the insurance market's huge losses. [32.]
 
Britain to Resume Beef Exports
Leaders of the European Union's 15 member countries agreed today to a plan that would gradually allow the British to resume exporting beef certified to be free of contamination from the so-called mad cow disease, a fatal brain disease. In response, Britain ended a monthlong blockade of the body's decision-making procedures. [1.]
 
Clinton Less Popular in Silicon Valley Four years ago, Bill Clinton successfully won the support of Silicon Valley by soliciting executives' advice and by promising to make high-technology businesses more competitive globally. But their ardor for Mr. Clinton has cooled. And political donations from computer and software companies have dropped, according to Clinton fund raisers. [1.]
 
Copper Futures Plummet
Copper futures fell to a two-year low on fears that big traders would dump their stocks of the metal in the wake of the trading scandal at Sumitomo. Sugar futures surged to a 15-month high; soybean futures jumped because of flooding in the Midwest. [34.]
 
Treasury Prices Up Slightly
Treasury securities prices rose in light trading yesterday, as talk of hedge-fund buying and rumors of central bank activity in the short end of the market helped support prices. Traders attributed the rumors in the market to subdued activity in trading coupled with the lack of key economic reports. [41.]
 
Dollar Stronger Against Yen
The dollar strengthened for the third consecutive day in a rally powered by new signs that Japan's interest rates would remain low and that European rates would fall. [34.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE MONEY;
In Slap at President for Tort Veto, Silicon Valley Reduces Donations

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
Four years ago, Bill Clinton set out to win the support of skeptical executives in Silicon Valley by holding private meetings to solicit their advice and by promising to make high-technology businesses more competitive in world markets. High technology became a frequent theme of Mr. Clinton's campaign to "get America growing again."
The strategy worked. Public endorsements of Mr. Clinton by executives of computer and software companies gave an early and important boost to his campaign against President George Bush. And donations from the executives helped to shore up Mr. Clinton's campaign fund. 
 But Silicon Valley's ardor for Bill Clinton the President has cooled, largely because he vetoed legislation intended to cut down on lawsuits by shareholders, legislation that high-tech companies desperately wanted.
And the Clinton campaign is now feeling the sting. Political donations from computer and software companies, which provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in 1992, have fallen by as much as half, Clinton fund-raisers say. The campaign has had no trouble raising money in other parts of the country, a fund-raiser said, but in Silicon Valley "we're really getting hammered."
As the Clinton campaign works to win back Silicon Valley, its executives are raising an arcane tax issue as a test of Mr. Clinton's commitment to high-technology industries. They have barraged the White House in recent months with demands that the master versions of their software be given the same favorable tax treatment that is given to the master recordings of records, tapes and movies that are exported for reproduction in other countries.
So far, Mr. Clinton and the Treasury Department have refused the requests to handle the matter administratively, saying that legislation to amend the tax code is needed.
"All we ever get from the Treasury Department and the White House is some legal gobbledygook," said Harris Miller, the president of the Information Technology Association of America, a computer-industry trade group that has more than 9,000 members. "Someone has his or her fingernails into this thing and won't let it go."
The President's refusal to intervene on the issue is baffling, Mr. Miller said, because there is no political opposition on the issue. Recently, he said, he was asked to solicit association members to attend the Democratic National Committee's Presidential fund-raising dinner honoring Mr. Clinton. Mr. Miller said he had made little success.
"It is very tough to get people interested or enthusiastic about Bill Clinton when you look at very high-visibility, bottom-line issues and he comes out on the wrong side or doesn't take action at all," he said.
The export tax would save the software industry an estimated $700 million over 10 years, a figure that industry officials argue is insignificant in trillion Federal budgets.
Some software industry officials are closely watching the tax-credit issue for a sign that Mr. Clinton wants to mend fences after his veto of the securities bill.
"His veto of securities litigation reform last December took a lot of high-tech companies by surprise and was a disappointment," said Bill Sample, director of domestic taxes for the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest producer of software. "Certainly he's had positives and negatives with Silicon Valley and the high-tech community. If he doesn't respond to what seems to be a clear-cut fairness issue, the judgment will be harsher."
The securities legislation was by far the more important issue to high-tech companies, and they had been pushing for it for years. Because the high-tech industry is particularly volatile, it has been a frequent target of lawsuits by shareholders who suspect that they were defrauded by inaccurate or or overly optimistic company reports. But Congress overrode Mr. Clinton's veto of the bill, which made it more difficult for shareholders to sue.
To be sure, Mr. Clinton has taken a number of actions on behalf of high technology. In particular, the Administration's high-profile crackdown on the Chinese pirating of software has pleased Silicon Valley, said Kenneth A. Wasch, the president of the Software Publishers Association, an industry trade group with about 1,200 member companies.
"In the first week of the Clinton Administration, we were called over to get a briefing on their economic plan," Mr. Wasch said. "We have had access to the highest levels. I never got a call over to the Bush White House or the Reagan White House."
At issue is legislation passed in 1971 that allows tax credits of about 15 percent for certain products manufactured in the United States for export to other countries. The law specifically names "films, tapes, records or similar reproductions for commercial or home use." Industry officials argue that Congress would have included software if it had existed at the time.
Treasury officials said they had no objection to applying the tax break to software, but they said the law gave them no authority to do so because software is essentially different from films, tapes and records. Unlike films, which are passively played back, software actively drives machines, the officials said.
The companies have been pushing hard for the Clinton Administration to make the change because of the difficulty in getting legislation through Congress. A bill to include software on the list for tax credits would not be particularly controversial, they say, but would inevitably get caught up in the gridlock and horse-trading on Capitol Hill. In fact, the California Congressional delegation has sent a letter to Mr. Clinton urging that he act to grant the credit.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
At a Talk, Union Gives Its Applause To Clinton

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 21

 BODY:
Far from the fracas over F.B.I. files and backwater bank deals, President Clinton hit the campaign trail in front of a friendly labor audience today, reciting a rollicking partisan litany of his Administration's stands and lighting into Republicans as cold-hearted foes of the common man.
"I understand the other side is criticizing us because we have the support of labor unions," the President said at a meeting of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees here, pausing for the effect. "Well, I plead guilty to that." 
 At that, the roomful of public employees at the McCormick Place Exhibition Hall exploded into a standing ovation and loud chants of "four more years!"
Mr. Clinton announced no new programs today and made no effort to make news in the usual sense. Instead, speaking here in Chicago, where the Democratic National Convention will be in August, he was content to be a Democratic disk jockey, replaying a stack of his greatest hits, from supporting an increase in the minimum wage to battling Republicans on health care, education, crime and the environment.
The recital of his accomplishments and the crowd's reaction to it seemed more than enough to energize the President after a week of sour controversy in Washington over how the White House obtained the Federal Bureau of Investigation's files of prominent Republicans and over the naming of his longtime aide, Bruce Lindsey, as an unindicted co-conspirator in a trial of two Arkansas bankers in connection with contributions to Mr. Clinton's 1990 campaign for governor.
Repeatedly referring to the Republicans as "they" or "the other side," the President was stinging in his partisan summing up of the Republican platform. "They believe that the Government is the problem and that what everyone needs is to be told: 'You're on your own. Go out there into the tender mercies of the global economy; have a great time in cyberspace, and we'll get out of your way,' " Mr. Clinton said.
By contrast, he added: "I say we should stand up for the notion that America will be stronger in the global economy of the 21st century if we give our people clean air, clean water, safe streets, a solid education system, if we honor our commitment to our parents and if we decide we're going forward together. It's always worked before. Why won't it work in the global economy of the 21st century?"
For months he has largely refrained from such sharply worded barbs about Republicans, leaving that to surrogates and tough-talking television commercials. But with Bob Dole, the Republican nominee-to-be, keeping up a daily drumbeat of attacks on Mr. Clinton's character, record and judgment, the President seemed more inclined today to mix it up a bit with an underdog's scrappy punch, though he continues to hold a comfortable lead in virtually all public opinion polls.
His next stop is Houston to help raise $2 million for the Democratic National Committee at three fund-raising events tonight and then to Cleveland for a speech to the United States Conference of Mayors on Saturday.
In his speech here, Mr. Clinton mocked Republicans who opposed his 1993 economic plan as unworkable, recalling that Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, now the chairman of the House Budget Committee, had said that if the plan worked he would have to become a Democrat.
"Well, three and a half years later, we cut the deficit by more than half, and the economy has not produced 8 million new jobs, it's produced 9.7 million new jobs," Mr. Clinton said. "Mr. Kasich said if this plan was to work, 'I'd have to become a Democrat.' I expect him to show up at the United Center in Chicago; we'll save a seat for him at the convention."
In a similar vein, the President twitted gun-rights advocates who bemoaned his support for banning 19 types of assault weapons and, as he often does, got carried away a bit in the thrill of the moment.
"They convinced a lot of good, God-fearing Americans -- including some members of this union, I'll bet -- that if those bills were passed they were going to be weakened in their ability to pursue their hunting and sporting interests, somebody was going to come get their gun," Mr. Clinton said. "Well, now it's been two years later and guess what: every A.F.S.C.M.E. member in America that wants to go deer hunting is still hunting with the same rifle.
"In my home state in the fall, in a good year, the ducks are so thick you can hardly see the sky Every Arkansas A.F.S.C.M.E. member who wants to go duck hunting is still hunting with the same rifle, if that's what they want to do."
It is unlikely that many of them do, however, since as even a sometime sportsman like Mr. Clinton should know, ducks are almost universally hunted with shotguns.
 
In His Own Words
 
BILL CLINTON
 
Addressing a meeting of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees yesterday in Chicago:
 
"We're going through a big change, folks. You all know it. You're having to change; you're dealing with it. We're moving from an economy based on big organizations in an industrial age that do mass production, to an economy based on rapid transfer of information and technology in smaller, less bureaucratic, more creative organizations. It's affecting all of us in the way we work and live. We're moving way away from that cold-war world where the world was sort of divided in two, into a world where there is a global society and things are happening so fast we can hardly keep up with it. And that's requiring a lot of changes.
They believe that the Government is the problem and that what everyone needs is to be told, 'You're on your own. Go out there into the tender mercies of the global economy; have a great time in cyberspace; and we'll get out of your way.'
I believe no great nation, at any point in human history, has ever, ever gotten greater without expanding opportunity to more and more people and having responsibility for more and more people to build a strong community. This is the greatest nation in human history because we have built a middle class of people, and average people have had a chance to make it if they have done the right things. And that's what I think we ought to be doing into the 21st century."

 BODY:
The state's unemployment rate dipped to 6.1 percent in May, the lowest rate since December 1990, Labor Commissioner Peter J. Calderone said yesterday. The jobless rate, down from 6.6 percent in April, is still higher than the national average of 5.6 percent. But New Jersey is doing better than most of its neighbors at creating jobs, Mr. Calderone said. The state added 6,800 jobs in May, especially in restaurants and other retail businesses.

HEADLINE: TEACHERS RATIFY 5-YEAR CONTRACT

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
New York City's public-school teachers overwhelmingly approved a five-year contract yesterday, an agreement similar to one they rejected in December. The vote was a victory for the union leadership and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's labor strategy.
Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said teachers had changed their minds, voting 78 to 22 percent in favor, because of improvements from the rejected contract. In addition, she said teachers saw that the agreement, even with its two-year pay freeze, was not so bad in light of the city's financial problems. 
 "The first time around, teachers did not believe there wasn't enough money to provide them with a wage increase in the first two years," Ms. Feldman said. "But as time went by, they began to see the reality of the city's fiscal situation." Winning approval was important to Ms. Feldman, who was embarrassed by the 56-to-44-percent rejection of the contract in December, the first time her 36-year-old union rejected a contract its leadership had negotiated.
The contract approved yesterday greatly resembles the rejected one. Both included three years of job security, a two-year wage freeze and a 13 percent raise over the last three years. The revised contract, like the rejected one, increases teachers' maximum pay to $70,000, from $60,000, and raises starting salary to $31,911 from $28,749.
In renegotiating the contract last month, the union leadership won some changes intended especially to swing experienced teachers and new ones to favor the agreement. The revised contract reduces the number of years needed to reach the maximum salary, creates new incentives for early retirement and scraps a plan to withhold 5 percent of a beginning teacher's salary. It also offers a $3,500 supplement each semester to teachers who volunteer to teach an additional period each day.
City Hall officials maintained that they made no major concessions in renegotiating, saying that the revised accord would cost no more than the rejected pact. They said that whatever improvements the teachers won in the modified contract were financed by concessions.
"They made the right decision under tough circumstances," said Randy Levine, the city's former Labor Commissioner and an unofficial adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "It's good that the ordeal is over and we can get back to improving the education system."
Colleen A. Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, said he was unavailable for comment.
Mr. Giuliani has pursued a labor strategy of offering a few years of job security in exchange for pay freezes, but has not pushed to wrest concessions from unions.
Worried about layoffs, municipal workers in District Council 37 approved this formula, but the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has refused to swallow it. City Hall officials voiced relief yesterday that the teachers accepted the pattern, a move that will reduce tensions with that important union and step up pressure on the police to accept a similar contract.
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said in a statement that he was "delighted that the ratification was completed before the close of the school year."
"I will recommend to the board that they approve the contract before school closes," Dr. Crew said. "The contract contains many of the changes which I believe will be helpful in moving our educational reforms forward."
In the view of many city and union officials, another important factor pushing the 66,000 teachers to approve the contract was that the city's largest municipal employees union, the 120,000-member District Council 37, approved a similar contract in February. That contract also included a two-year pay freeze. Many teachers, these officials said, recognized that even if they rejected the contract, they were not going to win anything more than Council 37 had.
"I voted yes because we need the stability of having a contract," said Mary Ann Sayegh, a teacher at Public School 169 in Brooklyn. "The reality is there isn't a whole lot of money out there. Do I think I deserve more money? You bet. Do I think I'm going to get it now? No."
Another factor in the contract approval, Ms. Feldman said, was that teacher anger had subsided over Mr. Giuliani's announcement in December that he supported a large raise for himself and his commissioners. The announcement came just 10 days after he reached an agreement with the teachers calling for the two-year pay freeze. His relationship with Ms. Feldman soured when she said that teachers would have approved the original contract but for their outrage over the Mayor's raise.
The teachers cast their ballots at their schools between June 10 and 14. The ballots were sent to the American Arbitration Association, a nonprofit group that counted the ballots yesterday. The association said the unofficial result was 46,801 to ratify and 13,438 to reject.
David Kaufman, co-chairman of New Action U.F.T., the main opposition group to the union leadership, attributed the ratification largely to an all-out effort by Ms. Feldman and her lieutenants. He said they distributed thousands of fliers and spoke in hundreds of schools.
Noting that his group had urged a no vote, Mr. Kaufman, a science teacher at Middle School 135 in the Bronx, said: "The money is terrible, everybody knows it. Then there's nothing to make working conditions better, nothing to reduce class sizes, nothing that makes our buildings safer. In the next few years, you'll see an exodus to districts where salaries and working conditions are better."
Many teachers argued for voting down the contract, asserting that if negotiations were pushed into next year they might win more because the Mayor, in a campaign year, might be more forthcoming.
But Ms. Feldman responded that voting down the contract could leave the teachers in a weaker position.
Labor experts said teachers were pushed into voting yes this time by bad economic news, like the Health and Hospital Corporation's decision to lay off 2,800 workers and projections of a worsening city deficit.
Ms. Feldman emphasized improved early-retirement incentives, aimed at persuading 2,000 to 2,500 teachers to retire. Another change that helped sway experienced teachers was one to permit teachers to reach the maximum of $70,000 with 22 years' experience rather than 25 years.
Ms. Feldman also stressed that the revised pact omitted a provision despised by new teachers: a so-called retention incentive, in which the city withheld 5 percent of a new teacher's first-year pay until the fourth year.
City Hall officials said they won concessions in return. Most important, the revised contract will last 61 months, two months longer than one voted down.

HEADLINE: Stewarts Point Journal;
Valuable California Abalone Draws Sportsmen and Poachers

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

DATELINE: STEWARTS POINT, Calif., June 16

 BODY:
On low-tide mornings north of San Francisco, hundreds of cars jam turn-offs along Highway 1. At the Stewarts Point Store, a wood-floored source of "general merchandise" since 1868, customers head for the swim fins, snorkels and weight belts.
Without scuba tanks, they are sport divers preparing to plunge into the frigid, kelp-blackened Pacific Ocean in search of abalone, a legendary local delicacy. 
 Lately, the abalone's fame has spread among chefs from Washington to Tokyo, and the number of divers harvesting them here in Northern California, one of the world's most plentiful sources, has jumped significantly.
That is good news to Archer J. Richardson, 49, the third generation of his family to run the Stewarts Point Store.
April 1, the opening of abalone season, "is the start of my financial season," Mr. Richardson said, adding: "It's April Fools Day. It's crazy."
The store includes a display of trophy abalone shells, each irridescent, slipper-shaped specimen identified by diameter, diver's name and, on a line for the location of the find, cryptic words like "Can't Remember" or "The Rock Ron Was Going To."
Mr. Richardson is not overly fond of abalone, which tastes like the best calamari a shellfish lover has ever had. He said he would rather eat steak.
But the abalone lures 40,000 sportsmen annually, who pump $10 million into the North Coast economy, and Mr. Richardson is happy to turn his store's porch over to divers swapping tales, some of them true. Lately, the talk has been of a threat to the abalone from poachers who illegally use scuba tanks and take more than the limit of four per day.
"They're delicious, and that's the trouble," said Lawrence Halpern, a landscape architect, getting a newspaper. "There are people who come up and get 100 to 200. They sell them to restaurants in San Francisco."
A single abalone, with about one pound of meat, fetches up to $40 on a black market that supplies restaurants, home cooks and buyers as distant as Hong Kong and New Zealand, according to the California Fish and Game Department.
The department has made abalone the top enforcement priority of its Wildlife Protection division. In May, a jury in Sonoma County convicted two leaders of a highly organized ring that poached an estimated 50,000 pounds, worth more than $500,000 wholesale.
This one ring, the worst uncovered since limits were imposed on abalone gatherers, took an estimated 18 percent of the annual legal harvest for the county, according to marine biologists, who warn that poaching could exhaust seed stocks.
In Southern California, where commercial harvesting using scuba gear is allowed, the abalone population crashed in the mid-1970's. (Abalone-loving sea otters played a part, too.) North of San Francisco, where only free diving for sport is permitted, the population is still abundant but fragile, said Konstantin Karpov, a state marine biologist
Mervin Hee, a Fish and Game patrol captain who grew up on the coast in Mendocino, recalled a judge's lecture to a poacher, "When you play with the abalone on the North Coast, it's like comitting murder."
Indeed, along the rocky headlands and foggy coves, the pursuit of abalone clinging to rocks in eerie kelp forests can be what separates hardy local people from the growing tourist hordes. No North Coast home seems complete without pearly abalone shells lined up along a fence or worked into a funky lawn sculpture.
Most divers stopping by Mr. Richardson's store are headed for nearby Salt Point State Park. The luckiest few are friends of Mr. Richardson and his father, 77-year-old Archer R. Richardson, known as Bus, who are members of a ranching clan that owns 25,000 spectacular acres along the coast, which have been in the family more than 100 years.
The Richardsons let a few friends and Pomo Indians cross their land for abalone. Winning this right is a little like being tapped for a secret society.
"Bus Richardson has rules," said Ron Taeuffer, dropping by the store for the key to a private road to the coast. "If you ask for the key, you can't get it. You only get it if you don't ask."
Mr. Taeuffer unlocked a gate and drove through in his 1959 Impala convertible -- "the abalone machine," as it is known.
Mr. Taeuffer, a maintenance worker at a luxury second-home community on the coast, has his name on many of the trophy shells in Mr. Richardson's store.
At 52, he has longish gray hair, broad shoulders and a small paunch, which he squeezed into a wetsuit at the top of a cliff that dropped into the ocean. Below, water churned against the rocks as if in a washing machine. "That's my mistress, the ocean," Mr. Taeuffer said. "She likes to slap you to show who's stronger."
He often dives by himself, which is dangerous and perhaps ill advised, but then, he is proud, opinionated and sometimes sarcastic, qualities that might put off would-be partners.
"Quitting drinking was easy," Mr. Taeuffer, a recovering alcoholic, said. "Getting along with people is the hard part."
He made his way down a precarious trail. At the ocean's edge he put on fins. To his weight belt, Mr. Taeuffer clipped an iron tool like a file used to pry abalones off rocks, and 40 feet of rope attached to an empty salad-oil jug. Once underwater, the tug of the jug could alert him to waves and rips passing overhead.
He slipped into the 48-degree water. As he bobbed on the surface, a harbor seal watched him. Spotting an abalone, he held his breath and disappeared for 20 to 30 seconds. When he resurfaced, he put the prize into a net bag hanging from his jug float.
Soon he had his limit of four and hauled himself back onto the rocks. The the shells were mottled pink, with tiny prayer flags of kelp attached and fluttering in the wind.
"They call me an old man," Mr. Taeuffer said, "but this old man can still dive with the best of them."

HEADLINE: To Buyers, the Spoils of War

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
A BRAWL has broken out for the title of America's best-selling car, and consumers stand to benefit from some special deals for midsize sedans.
The championship, held by the Ford Taurus for four consecutive years, is up for grabs. At the end of May, the Taurus maintained a lead of just 8,000 cars in the current calendar year. The Honda Accord, which narrowly led the race through April, remained in second place. The Toyota Camry, with record sales for May, trailed the Accord by a mere 2,500 cars. The Chevrolet Lumina lagged behind. 
 The manufacturers of all four models are trying to lure consumers with special deals, particularly in the competitive Northeast region.
Nationally, Ford is offering $600 cash rebates, or 2.9 percent financing, on all Taurus models through July 15. In the Northeast, Ford dealers are offering a $214-a-month lease for 24 months through July 2 on the lowest-priced Taurus, the G model.
Honda cut $500 from the price of the Accord DX equipped with the most popular options, giving it a base price of $16,995. In the Northeast, Honda dealers are offering a lease of $239 a month for 24 months on the more expensive Accord LX, and 4.9 percent financing for 48 months on Accord V6's.
Toyota is paying dealers a $400 incentive on each Camry they sell through July 8. In the Northeast, one widely advertised Camry lease costs $229 a month for 36 months with $999 down.
Chevrolet, which has adopted a strategy of pricing its cars below its competitors', is offering 6.9 percent financing through July 16. In the Northeast, Chevrolet dealers are advertising a Lumina lease of $269 a month or 4.8 percent financing.
"The deals are sweet," said Paul Ballew, chief economist for J. D. Power & Associates, the automotive market-research firm. "A midsize car now costs only about 10 percent more than it did five years ago, well below the rate of inflation."
Like the sales race, the deals are far from over, though the current round of incentives expires in June and July. "The auto makers likely will extend the deals they are now offering, though I doubt they'll be any more lucrative," said William Seltenheim, vice president of the Autodata Corporation, a concern in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., that tracks sales, inventories and consumer incentives.
While the deals are likely to continue, the selection of vehicles may dwindle. Although factories are working all out, inventories of the Accord and Camry are low, with some dealers virtually sold out.
Toyota raises the ante in September with the introduction of a restyled 1997 Camry that analysts said would be priced $1,500 below the current model, or for about $15,000, thanks to an aggressive effort to cut production costs. And Honda will redesign the Accord for 1998.
Mr. Ballew of J. D. Power predicts that the midsize battle will intensify in the next few years as the new models reach the market amid lower demand for cars in this class -- largely a consequence of buyers' shifting to sport utility vehicles. In addition, he said, production capacity is likely to remain high.

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
For Social Security, More Gain and Less Pain

BYLINE: By MERTON C. BERNSTEIN; Merton C. Bernstein, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, was principal consultant to the 1982 National Commission on Social Security Reform.

 BODY:
'WILL Social Security be there when my time comes?"
A majority of Americans do not think so. And a recent report from the Social Security trustees reinforces the fear, warning that the system will not survive past 2029 if program financing isn't brought into long-term balance with obligations. 
 How to do this? Some commentators say it requires either "astronomically" higher payroll taxes or severe benefit cuts. But much less drastic measures will suffice.
Social Security annually collects about $50 billion more than it pays, will continue that pace until 2013 and can meet all commitments until 2029 and partial benefits thereafter. To assure full benefits until 2070, it needs additional income of only 2.19 percent of payroll -- half from employees and half from employers. Hardly astronomical. A FICA (payroll tax) increase of 1.5 percent of payroll on both employee and employer starting around 2020 would also be enough.
But the tax need not rise even that much. Legislation could help by:
* Extending coverage to several million state and local employees not now under Social Security, thereby reducing the projected shortfall and improving those employees' income protection.
* Allowing the surplus to be invested in stocks and bonds to increase earnings.
* Countering the wage stagnation many Americans now face; improved educational opportunities, for example, should lift earnings and thus FICA contributions.
* Taxing benefits derived from untaxed employer contributions and fund earnings.
The 1995 White House Conference on Aging overwhelmingly favored preserving Social Security for all generations, characterizing its needed repairs as modest. But there are those who insist that avoiding insolvency requires drastic measures like raising the normal retirement age, limiting benefits to the poor, reducing cost-of-living adjustments or privatizing the system.
Today, one may retire at 65, with full benefits, or as early as 62 with benefits reduced 20 percent. Under current law, the normal retirement age reaches 66 in 2008 and 67 by 2022.
But some want to go higher and faster.Peter Peterson of the Concord Coalition, which lobbies for a balanced budget, urges raising the normal retirement age to 70 and the earliest eligibility to 65 by 2005. That would drastically reduce total benefits.
Huge savings, yes, but at huge human cost. Most people start getting benefits before 65; about half do at 62. A majority have no choice because their job or health disappears or they must care for older relatives.
Some analysts advocate limiting benefits to the needy. But means-testing encourages phony property transfers to make applicants look poor, discourages saving and increases administrative costs.
So instead of means-testing, others support taxing a larger share of upper-income recipients' benefits. But Social Security is not the sweet deal for the rich that many think. High-income recipients pay tax on a major portion of their benefits. And while earning, they pay more payroll tax but their benefits replace a smaller part of earnings.
Some urge cutting the cost-of-living adjustment, saying the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. But the index does not take account of the higher medical care outlays of the elderly and disabled, and the annual adjustment does not compensate for price increases in the preceding year.
The financial industry urges privatization, requiring the employed to divert some or all of their FICA taxes to personal savings accounts. But this would expose millions of people to devastating losses, with increased market risks aggravated by the inevitability that some people would get bad, or even crooked, advice.
To assure long-term solvency, we can expand coverage, raise FICA rates slightly, lift fund earnings and tax more of high-income recipients' benefits. Or we can cut benefits by raising the retirement age, means-testing, reducing the inflation adjustment or privatizing.
In 1996, we will pick the President and Congress that will decide.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
From 'Working Rich' To Endangered Clan

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: WILLIMANTIC, Conn.

 BODY:
DUDLEY BRAND'S father was a carpenter, and the words he chose to guide his son into a blue-collar career were hammered home like galvanized nails driven deep into a plank of fresh-cut timber: "Get a toolbox and you can always get a day's work."
That was 30 years ago, but the words still ring in the ears of Mr. Brand, now 44. Like many working-class boys of his generation in eastern Connecticut, he had entered Windham Regional Vocational-Technical School to learn a trade and follow in his father's footsteps. 
 Last month, Mr. Brand was among some 200 alumni who attended a reunion dinner-dance at Tech, as they call the school, entering from bright sunshine into a building many had not visited since graduation.
Members of classes spanning five decades gathered in small groups on the gymnasium floor, beneath bunches of blue and white balloons and yards of bunting, to exhume adolescent memories of shop routines and classroom pranks. As late afternoon slipped into evening, they also examined their working lives and whether the maxims they learned about jobs and security still held true for their sons and daughters.
"We are the lucky ones, the last of the working rich," said Dave Meikle of the class of 1959, a modest man with a quick smile who has worked 32 years as an electronics technician at the Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine plant in East Hartford. "We still hold good-paying industrial jobs we were trained to do."
But Mr. Meikle, 55, says he will accept an incentive package to leave his job by the end of summer, a program he says is intended to eliminate senior workers at his wage level of $20 an hour. Similarly, Ronald Drouin, 54, a classmate of Mr. Meikle, hopes to get a buyout at the Electric Boat submarine division of General Dynamics in Groton before his job is eliminated in a new round of 2,000 layoffs this summer. He has worked at Electric Boat as a draftsman for 33 years.
"Electric Boat and Pratt were companies a guy who came out of Tech could always find work," said Mr. Meikle, who studied television and radio repair at Tech and then went into the Navy, where he was trained in electronics. "When I started at Pratt in 1964, we had 20,000 hourly workers at the East Hartford plant. Now we're down to 2,500."
For earlier generations, the mainstay of employment was the American Thread Company, a mill that opened in 1854 on the banks of the Willimantic River, a swift-running ribbon of turbulent water that bisects this community of 22,000. At one time, the mill had 2,500 workers tending 30,000 spindles, which turned out everything from Aunt Lydia's carpet and button thread to material used in the making of fire hoses, seat belts and baseballs. The city's identity was so interwoven with the mill that the centerpiece of emblems on police cars was a thread spool.
In 1985, American Thread shut down the Willimantic operation and moved to North Carolina. The abandoned mill still stands like a haunted relic of past economic glory, a chain of sturdy stone and brick buildings dominated by a smokestack with a handsome mosaic design on its blunt tip 175 feet above the ground.
Textiles were already seen as a dead-end industry by the time the new vo-tech school opened in 1956 on the north brow of the shallow valley overlooking the mill. Mr. Meikle and Mr. Drouin enrolled that fall as eager sophomores and signed up for shops intended to feed the growing demand for workers in military-related industries and the home construction trades.
The school they came back to this year again reflects a changing marketplace. Service industry jobs are replacing those based in manufacturing; culinary arts and health care courses have far more students than tool-and-die making.
"There are still small machine shops around, but we have a tough time encouraging kids to go into that line of work," said Paul Manzone, a guidance counselor at Tech for 24 years. "You don't hear them say anymore, 'Dad is going to get me a job in the union and I'll lead the good life.'
"Now you hear them say, 'My parents are divorced and my father is working in Florida and I'm headed south as soon as I get out of school.' "
If they stay around, he continued, many take state jobs; the three largest employers in the area are the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Eastern Connecticut State University in Windham, and a nearby state prison. Otherwise, he said, unless a local contractor is hiring, the only opening may be at Home Depot for $9 an hour.
Many in the gymnasium said the shifting economy had forced them to switch jobs. Mr. Brand quit carpentry to teach at another vo-tech school, a choice he did not regret as the home building boom of the 1980's collapsed in this decade. Horace Geer, 54, used his fingers to pick off the number of jobs he has held since leaving Tech in 1960; he stopped when he got to 10.
"Next week I start work as a janitor at Foxwoods Casino, run by the Indians," he said with a husky voice as "A Teen-Ager in Love" by Dion and the Belmonts drifted through the gymnasium, part of a taped stream of reunion nostalgia. "I don't know how long that will last, but they have good health benefits, which you can hardly get anymore."
Steve LeBel, class of '79, expressed impatience when he heard the older men lament the loss of industrial jobs.
"Trouble is, they've been ruined by industry," said Mr. LeBel, who manages a small machine shop. "They're afraid of the new machines. A lot have been spoiled by union jobs. They didn't have to work hard and got lots of overtime and benefits.
"This guy from Pratt & Whitney comes by my shop looking for a job but he's not versatile and has a lot of holes in his skills. I tell him, 'I'll start you off at 11 bucks an hour and see how it works out. Medical covers you but not your family and there's no pension.'
"He looks at me like I insulted him and walks out," Mr. LeBel said, a quizzical look on his goateed face.
Dave Meikle took issue with that assessment. "I believe we earned our high wages and benefits at Pratt," he said as he prepared to sit down for dinner in the cafeteria. "The trouble is, those jobs are not there for the next generation because the work is being placed with vendors who are either out of the country or don't pay union wages or benefits.
"Like I said, my class from the 50's was the lucky one. We knew what we wanted and it was there for us. It's just not that easy anymore," said the electronics technician, whose daughter, the youngest of his five children, graduated this spring from Yale with a degree in fine arts.
By now, the sun rimmed the western skyline and lengthening shadows chased through the Willimantic valley. The turbulent ribbon of water rushed by the shuttered mill, which had once been a symbol of so much in this New England town, tossing spray in bursts of energy no longer yoked and converted to man's will.
Only the mosaic-tipped brick chimney continued to catch the receding light creeping up its shaft, and in a few minutes that, too, blinked out.

HEADLINE: Testing the Resonance of the American Dream

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:

What's that I smell in the air?
The American dream.
Sweet as a new millionaire,
The American dream.
Live like you haven't a care,
The American dream.
All yours for 10 percent down,
The American dream.
 
From "The American Dream," in "Miss Saigon."
In the 1950's, owning a house with a white picket fence and a car embodied the American dream. As depicted in film, on television and in books, this Norman Rockwell view of America represented happiness and the fulfillment of the hopes of millions of ordinary people, regardless of race, region or stature in life. 
 Even now, four decades later, the prospect of owning a freestanding home remains an enduring element in Americans' aspirations. Spiraling economy, downsizing and the ever-changing nuclear family have not deterred the dream. Yet, more and more people seem to feel their dreams are becoming harder to realize.
The term "American dream" was first attributed to the historian James Truslow Adams, who in 1931 wrote a treatise called "The Epic of America." In it he said, "The dream is not of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which every individual shall be able to attain the fullest stature of which they are capable and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstance of birth."
But was it ever all that? Will it ever be?
For more than a year, Linda Schaffer, a film maker, traveled the country, with camera and microphone in hand, talking with Americans about the so-called dream. The fruit of her labor is "American Dreamers," a 90-minute television special that will have its premiere at 8 tonight on Turner Network Television and will be repeated periodically over the next four weeks.
The program examines what it means to "make it" in America today, using comments from a cross section of celebrities, like Michael Jordan, Mel Brooks, Gloria Steinem and Maya Angelou, and ordinary people. Ms. Schaffer said in an interview that she was surprised to learn that "nobody really feels that they've made it yet." Clips from movies that helped to shape the nation's dream illuminate many of the observations in the program.
Although Ms. Schaffer finds many people who have become disillusioned, there are many more who still see the United States, in spite of its social and economic problems, as the land of opportunity where dreams can come true.
There are, for example, members of the 20-something generation who share their grandparents' vision of the dream -- a house, a family, good health -- and others who speak of being "rich and famous" as the dream comes true.
There are optimists, like Trinh Pham, a high school student in Sacramento, Calif., whose family escaped Vietnam for what he calls "a safe haven" in America and found that and much more.
And there are pessimists, like Alden Naranjo, a Native American whose tribe, the Utes, is based outside Durango, Colo. He says he sees the dream as a kind of "pie in the sky" ideal. "If this is the American dream, then I'm in the wrong place," he tells the film maker.
Ms. Schaffer became intrigued with the notion of the American dream after hearing the term bandied about with seemingly little thought given to its meaning. "What surprised me is that among the young people we talked to, the conventional domestic dream -- a plot of land, a house, a family that's healthy -- is still alive and well," Ms. Schaffer said.
Like life itself, the American dream has changed with each generation. Not satisfied with the house and car, those born in a desegregated America of equal opportunity dreamed of a college education and an income that would meet the monthly payments for the median-price house.
Their children are dreaming large: making it means not one, but two homes; not a station wagon, but a BMW, and vacations in the Caribbean.
Tyrone Belke, 22, a resident of Washington, who described himself as a "young, gifted and out-of-work" architect, said in a recent phone interview, "It's only natural to want to do better than your parents."
Mr. Belke, who is not part of the television program, continued: "I'm not saying I won't get the house and the car and the prom queen. It's just that I didn't think I'd have to work twice as hard as my parents to get it. They always told me that they worked twice as hard to get half as far so I wouldn't have to do the same."
Mario M. Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, who appears in Ms. Schaffer's program, said in an interview that Mr. Belke's ambition is "very much the characteristic of most Americans."
"The more you have, the more you aspire to," Mr. Cuomo said. "For today's generation, economic ascendency is not assured as it was for us. If you worked hard, you would make it. That is no longer true. It's not as easy to go up."
But Dr. John Roth, a professor of philosophy at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif., who teaches a course on the American dream, believes that the dream is necessary for the future of the country.
"Dreaming of a better life has kept this country together," Dr. Roth said in an interview. "If we reach the point where Americans begin to doubt that, then the potential for unraveling American life increases."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
For Reverse Mortgages, a Fannie Mae Imprimatur

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
REVERSE mortgages, portrayed as a way for elderly homeowners to remain in their houses while providing them with an income, have also been criticized as too expensive and confusing. The elderly are often wary of these loans, and because of this, reverse mortgages have accounted for only a small fraction of the total mortgage debt held by consumers.
That may change now that the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, the nation's largest supplier of home mortgage money, has begun to offer its own version of "home equity conversion" mortgages, providing the equivalent of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for reverse mortgages. 
 "This marks the coming of age of reverse-mortgage lending as a bona fide financial service," said Ken Scholen, director of the National Center for Home Equity Conversion, a research and consulting group in Apple Valley, Minn. "Fannie Mae doesn't do things lightly and they don't do things for the short term. The fact that they are bringing out their own reverse mortgage signals that this is no longer merely a curiosity."
And the elderly have been curious, seeing the mortgages as a way to draw income from their houses, whose previous mortgages have been paid off, without having to sell them immediately.
"We receive more mail on reverse mortgages than any other issue," said Bronwyn Belling, housing specialist for the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington. "Many of us would hope to spend our assets down to zero before we die. This is a way you can take it with you while you're alive."
With an ordinary mortgage, a borrower typically receives the entire loan and then pays it back, plus interest, over a period of years. With a reverse mortgage, homeowners can receive a monthly check instead of writing one by borrowing against the value of their houses. Some homeowners receive a line of credit instead and withdraw money only when they need it. The loan, plus interest, is usually repaid when the borrower dies or moves, or the house is sold. The interest rates are comparable to conventional rates.
Although some financial advisers say fees on the mortgages make them expensive, the A.A.R.P. says that if borrowers are informed and understand the costs, benefits and risks, the mortgages can be beneficial.
"A reverse mortgage can profoundly change the quality of life for many old people," Ms. Belling said. "It's a way for them to stay in their homes and have the income they need to pay the bills."
James Longo, an 85-year-old retired musician in Ridge, L.I., obtained a $42,000 reverse mortgage on his $145,000 house last year from Transamerica Home First of San Francisco. He chose a line of credit instead of monthly payments.
"I don't have to ask my daughters for anything anymore," said Mr. Longo, who has withdrawn about $3,000 so far.
Analysts said Fannie Mae's entrance in the market would inspire greater competition among existing lenders, which might lower the costs of the loans and encourage lenders to offer more products.
Mr. Scholen said that reverse mortgages were available in all states but Texas and that competition among lenders was indeed increasing. He said it was imperative that consumers shop for the best deal. Homeowners can get a list of lenders by calling Fannie Mae (800 732-6643) or the National Center for Home Equity Conversion (612 953-4474).
"What you don't want to do is talk to just one lender who's offering just one product," he said, explaining that the best way to compare mortgages was to check the Total Annual Loan Cost disclosure form, which lenders are required to provide to borrowers.
The form contains an estimate of a loan's annual average cost expressed as an interest rate, Mr. Scholen said. That rate, he said, will always be higher than the mortgage rate, because it includes all of the costs of the mortgage. The lower the rate, the better the deal.
The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program of the Federal Housing Administration offers five options for most homeowners over age 62. Under what is called a tenure plan, borrowers receive a fixed monthly amount for as long as they own and live in the mortgaged property. Under a term plan, borrowers are paid fixed monthly installments for a specific number of years. With a line of credit plan, the homeowner borrows against an approved loan amount. There are also combination plans, which blend elements of the monthly payment plans with lines of credit.
The mortgage amount is based on the property's market value, the borrower's age, the interest rate charged and the overall cost of the loan. Like most reverse mortgages, a loan under the F.H.A. program need not be repaid until the last surviving owner dies, moves or sells the property.
But the F.H.A. program has two disadvantages, which have limited its appeal.
F.H.A. guidelines limit the maximum that can be borrowed to $152,000. The loans must carry mortgage insurance to protect the borrower and lender if the value of the property is not enough to pay off the loan. (That can occur if the value of the property falls or if the borrower lives long enough to receive more in payments than the property is worth.) The insurance can cost thousands of dollars.
Fannie Mae's new mortgage, the Home Keeper Mortgage, lessens the first disadvantage and eliminates the second.
Laura Barriere, manager of housing initiatives for Fannie Mae, said that the maximum amount available to borrowers under the program was $207,000, and that mortgage insurance was no longer required.
Ms. Barriere said the program also offered an "equity share option" to allow borrowers to increase the amount of money they could borrow by agreeing to pay an additional 10 percent of the property value when the loan was repaid.
"On average, it increases their monthly check by 30 to 40 percent," Ms. Barriere said, adding that when the program was announced last November, Fannie Mae received more than 35,000 calls in one day.
Despite such an enthusiastic public response, some financial experts assert that reverse mortgages should be approached with caution, if at all. "I view reverse mortgages as the last option to be evaluated after all other options have been exhausted," said Gary H. Schatsky, a lawyer and financial adviser in Manhattan.
In most cases, Mr. Schatsky said, the cost of getting a reverse mortgage is significantly higher than that of a conventional mortgage, a home equity line of credit, a loan against other assets or a loan from family members. Home equity loans, for example, often have lower closing costs and do not require mortgage insurance, but the borrower needs an income to qualify.
"With a reverse mortgage, the origination fee can be 1 to 3 percent of the assessed value, and then you have to add in closing costs of $1,700 or $1,800," Mr. Schatsky said. Moreover, he said, the origination fee, called points, is not based on the amount of the loan, as in conventional mortgages, but on the assessed value of the house, which is always more than the loan. Mr. Schatsky said that could push the fee to as much as 7 percent of the amount of the mortgage.
Features like Fannie Mae's equity share option may make sense if the borrower lives long enough, Mr. Schatsky said, but in most cases extra payments made to the borrower will hardly approach the 10 percent surcharge when the loan is repaid.
"The more bells and whistles you put on a product, the more it's going to cost," Mr. Schatsky said. "And it's the borrower or his estate who's going to pay the extra."

HEADLINE: We Knew What Glory Was

BYLINE: By Shirlee Taylor Haizlip; Shirlee Taylor Haizlip is the author of "The Sweeter the Juice: A Family Memoir in Black and White."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
When I was growing up in the 40's and 50's, my father would pack up the car every August and squeeze in my mother, four children, several dolls and a picnic lunch. It was the time before air-conditioning, and the drive was hot, dusty and, after New York, without bathrooms.
We left long before dawn, because for a dark-skinned man driving a large shiny sedan holding a white- looking wife, the journey from Connecticut to the South was not without peril. It was essential that each leg of the trip be made before nightfall. We knew that safety lay within the homes and the churches of my father's friends and colleagues, the black ministers we would visit. They were our underground railroad. 
 My father was a Baptist pastor who ministered to a medium-sized black church in a Connecticut mill town. His father was a minister who had founded a major black Baptist church in Washington. At the beginnings of their careers, both had led small country churches in North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Later, as popular officers of the National Baptist Convention and known for their dramatic oratory, the two were frequent guest preachers at rural churches throughout the South.
Traditionally, my father and his father before him preached a week of revival services at these houses of worship. After my grandfather died, my father continued to return to the South each year. For him, the churches were touchstones of faith, of culture, of triumph over slavery. For him, they were living, breathing links to the past and an indestructible foundation for the future.
There was more than a spiritual connection. When they were in college, my four uncles, all of whom played musical instruments and had glorious voices, would sometimes join my father and present musical programs of spirituals and the light classics to appreciative Southern congregations, all too often deprived of other cultural experiences.
At other times, my dad, resplendent in a white suit, would offer solo recitals. When he crooned "Danny Boy" or "When I Grow Too Old to Dream" in his high tenor vibrato and with exquisite diction, the fans moved a little faster, the backs sat up a little straighter and the shouts of "Sing it, Rev!" were as heartfelt as they were for his renditions of "Amazing Grace" or "His Eye Is on the Sparrow."
I cannot hear the Three Tenors sing without thinking of my father standing in the pulpit of a spare little church, singing like a melancholy angel.
To reach many of the churches, we drove up deserted dirt roads covered by gracefully arching kudzu-fringed trees. Just when we thought we would never get there, a clearing materialized. There at its edge stood the church, often the only building for miles around, plain as a line drawing in a children's coloring book, more often than not in need of a fresh coat of paint. Never lonely looking, it seemed instead a natural part of the landscape, splendid in its simplicity.
Before the service, with admonitions of keeping our "best" clothes clean fading in our ears, my siblings and I would play with other children, running and jumping, catching fireflies, hiding and seeking in the darkening silver twilight. Each night, the revival crowd would get bigger and livelier. By the end of the week, the church was full, the room was hot and the penitents were saved.
During every service, I watched as my father, in high Baptist style, "picture painted" the stories of Moses and Job, Ruth and Esther. I listened as he moaned and hummed and sang the tales of W. E. B. Du Bois and Frederick Douglass, the Scottsboro Boys and Emmett Till. I clapped for joy as he brought the worshipers to their feet with promises of survival now and salvation later. In that place, at that time, we knew what glory was.
After the service, in the pitch blackness of a muggy summer night, we would drive back to our host's house, listening to parish gossip and ghost stories, accept offers of freshly made iced tea and every once in a while homemade ice cream. Sweetly, another church night had ended.
The best was yet to come. At the close of the week, we celebrated the homecoming, the end of the weeklong revival, behind the church, where picnic benches were felicitously placed among sweet-smelling pines. We ate miles of delicious food and drank lakes of sweet punch.
Usually there was a modest graveyard somewhere near the picnic grounds. We did not play there. Our parents had taught us better than that. Mold-covered gravestones barely hinted at the life stories they marked. The bones of slaves lay side by side with the bones of their emancipated children. All of their spirits were free to be free, at last.
As I grew older, I would learn about the lives of the church members from the comfort of my mother's side. I would grow to understand that there, in that place, every single church member was somebody.
In God's house, if nowhere else, they were C.E.O.'s and presidents, directors and chairmen, counselors and managers. In God's house, if nowhere else, they were women of infinite grace and men of profound dignity. Forever, amen.
With traditions that began in slavery, the parishioners carried forward, bit by precious bit, the dreams of their forebears. In their roles as deacons, trustees, missionaries and choir members, those domestics, handymen, cotton and tobacco farmers and teachers sang and prayed on hard, scrabbly benches, validating and celebrating themselves and one another, warmly and well, week after week, year after year, generation after generation.
Surely their oils and essences seeped into the well-worn pews. Surely the whorls of their fingertips left lovely striations in the wood, at which their grandbabies would stare before they fell off to sleep.
Not only did they tend to the church's business, they looked after the elderly and the infirm, encouraged the young to learn, learn, learn and rallied their communities in times of economic stress, natural disaster or social crisis. It did not escape my understanding that the church encompassed all. Seldom were there outcasts.
For me as a child, those beautiful little structures were places beyond enchantment. As an adult, I understood that the churches were indeed the collective soul of black folks.
I never thought that this particular reality could end. Although I have visited the South as an adult and know that some of those churches have been been abandoned, enlarged or modernized, in my mind's eye all of them remain storybook sanctuaries, testament to my own faith, the faith of my father, his father and the larger black community.
Heartsick now, my soul's light has been dimmed. Church after church in the South has been destroyed by fire, torched by arsonists. I watch the television images as long as I can. Then I hide my eyes behind my fingers, peeking at the screen as if it were a horror film, while hellish flames consume the heavenly places of my youth.
I ask my father across the void, Who will put out the flames, Dad? Where can we go now to be safe?

When It Comes to I.P.O.'s, Is Geography Part of Destiny?

BYLINE: By MARGARET ISA 

 BODY:
IS there something special in the air in San Diego?
Investors may well ask that question after looking at the performance of the stocks of 190 new public companies from 20 cities around the country. The stocks of San Diego companies that went public in the year ended on Thursday outpaced those of I.P.O.'s from every other city, with an average gain of 102.7 percent. That is more than two and a half times the 40 percent average for all new offerings in the period. 
Is it the air? Susan Golding, the Mayor of San Diego, didn't mention that possibility in explaining the success of her hometown companies. But she did talk about the 70 miles of clean beaches the area offers -- maybe the shore stimulates business thinking -- and the many universities nearby.
For new enterprises to thrive, she said, "you need to have a critical mass of skilled and knowledgeable people."
The study, by the Securities Data Company, looked at the performance of initial public offerings made between June 1, 1995 and last Thursday. Only cities where at least six companies had I.P.O.'s were included. Because many new issues today are computer and telecommunications stocks, many cities on the list have large technology industries. Of the 20 cities, in fact, 9 are in technology-strong California.
But a heavy dose of high technology wasn't necessary to do well. No. 2 on the list was Chicago, where I.P.O.'s advanced 70 percent on average. Chicago's nine offerings included several health care companies, and its most successful issue was BAB Holdings, which owns and operates bagel shops.
Two California high-technology centers were near the bottom of the list. The I.P.O.'s from San Jose and Palo Alto finished third to last and second to last, respectively, with returns of 25 percent and 16.5 percent.
Carol Jansen, the economic resources manager of Palo Alto, defended her city as "the heart of telecommunications and research and development in the country." But she ventured that established companies might be better able to thrive there than start-ups.
"One of the difficulties of the kind of super-heated economy we have in these areas is that it's expensive," she said.
Quantity didn't guarantee a high ranking, either. New York had more offerings than any other city -- 33 -- but it was 14th on the list, with an average gain of 33.2 percent.
Of course, the rankings are not watertight. Because the Securities Data figures were not annualized, cities with the newest offerings may be handicapped. Their issues have not had much time to appreciate. (The prices of many new issues, however, steeply decline after the first six months.) Because most cities had fewer than 12 offerings, just one stellar or abysmal stock could make a difference. San Diego owes its top showing largely to HNC Software, whose stock has advanced 500 percent since its debut.
Anyway, geography may be just incidental to performance. San Jose and Sunnyvale sit right next to each other in Silicon Valley, but there is a whopping difference of 33.8 percentage points in their average gains. And the technology-heavy I.P.O. market may be evolving -- and with it the cities that are most active in I.P.O.'s. While investors still like high-tech, other sectors, like luxury retailing, are on the rise, said Ermina Karim, associate editor of Going Public: The IPO Reporter.
There may be trouble for all cities in the long run. More I.P.O.'s are emerging from outside big cities as companies try to save money, said Robert S. Natale, director of equity research at Standard & Poor's.
"There's a need to be close by transportation, especially airports," he said, "but you don't need to be in a city to run a business."

Blue-Collar Training Gets the Black-Tie Touch

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
WHEN Cory Ocasio and his teammates met Delaware public high school rivals in Math League finals last winter, they heard cruel sniggering from the other sides.
"They seemed to be saying we had no right to be there, that vo-tech kids weren't as intelligent as ones from college-prep high schools," recalled Mr. Ocasio, who is 18. 
 The ridicule stopped abruptly when Mr. Ocasio's Delcastle Vocational-Technical School took third place, ahead of six other teams. Blue-collar pride, a casualty in an age of factory layoffs and lowered expectations, had scored a small triumph in an academic arena where vocational students were not supposed to get within sniffing distance of victory.
Take note: a lot more surprises are coming if Dennis L. Loftus has his way.
Dr. Loftus is superintendent of Delcastle and two other vocational high schools in populous New Castle County, which includes the city of Wilmington. In six years on the job, he has transformed the trade schools into what some experts call the prototype of vocational education of the future: training centers capable of producing workers who can compete in a global, high-tech economy.
Like retooling an ailing industry, he and his staff overhauled the curriculum to require the 3,000 students in the three schools to fill their heads with as much academic instruction as vocational preparation.
That means students take four years each of writing, English, math and science -- a standard once considered a waste of time for those destined to work with their hands and whose ability to absorb complex materials was suspect. Many students, in fact, will not be working long with their hands. While some are studying traditional trades and services, like plumbing and cosmetology, others are working with sophisticated equipment and concepts that will take them on to college and careers managing the complex technical systems that are increasingly at the center of industrial processes.
"Our approach is to treat the kids as if they were preparing for college as well as a career," said the superintendent, a 54-year-old educator from Iowa. "If you don't give your vocational students some academic rigor today, man are you going to have a long, tough climb finding skilled work for them in the 21st century."
The approach appears to be paying off. For a vocational system that a decade ago accepted all students sent its way, including troublemakers and truants, the three schools now enjoy unprecedented selectivity. In September, they accepted just 810 of the 1,685 students who applied for admission. Absenteeism has dropped sharply. Scores have shot up on uniform state tests. Students get new respect from peers in traditional high schools. And the graduates appear much more confident and qualified than their predecessors did, with nearly half of those in this year's class going on to some form of post-secondary education, compared with 26 percent of the class of 1986.
"I call it the 'Field of Dreams' syndrome," said Vicki Gehrt, director of instructional services for the schools, referring to the 1989 movie. "Build a vocational system based on high expectations and standards, and they will come."
Across the nation, scattershot school districts are trying to revamp vocational training along models similar to the one installed here. Some may be just as successful.
But most quickly run into financial and other obstacles and settle for half-measures that fall short of the revolution that educators and business leaders say is necessary to build a work force for the future. That revolution, encapsulated in the buzz phrase "tech prep," is built around the concept that vocational training should start early and continue into at least two years of technical post-secondary education.
Without such a radical shift, experts say, vo-tech students will be scrambling for a diminishing number of traditional blue-collar jobs while higher-paying, higher-tech jobs will go begging or leave the country.
Just how many vo-tech students are currently in American high schools is a matter of definition. Of 11.7 million students in 9th to 12th grades in more than 15,000 public schools, fully 97 percent may take one or more vocational courses, typically a home economics or typing class. Those who take two or more advanced courses in a specialized trade number about a million, and most attend comprehensive high schools offering vocational training programs. The rest spend their school days split between academic studies in a regular high school and vocational training at one of 1,400 regional vo-tech centers, or attend some 200 schools like the ones here that provide both academic and vocational instruction.
In addition, nearly six million students are enrolled in some form of post-secondary vocational education, either in community or four-year colleges or at specialized schools that offer certification in an occupation.
A force behind the movement for change is the Southern Regional Education Board in Atlanta, whose vocational education consortium works with schools in 21 states, including Delaware.
The consortium's "High Schools That Work" strategy promotes sweeping changes in the way comprehensive high schools as well as vocational schools operate in most communities. Both forms of schools must require a higher standard of academic training for all students, not just college-bound achievers, said Dr. Gene Bottoms, director of the board's vocation initiative.
Too many students coast through high school in general studies and emerge without marketable skills or intellectual acuity, he asserted. Vocational students may pick up a single skill, he added, but are not exposed to abstract and conceptual ideas, training that will enable them to master the complex technologies increasingly found in the workplace.
"Americans don't believe most students can learn complicated material, even though most parents believe a college degree is still the ticket to success for their children," he continued. "Those are just two of the barriers we have to overcome."
Even those who make it through college lack expertise for the kind of jobs a changing economy has to offer, he added. Government economists predict that the next decade will increase the demand for highly skilled, highly paid workers as the number of professional careers holds steady and unskilled jobs decline.
Part of the problem is money. It costs about 50 percent more to educate a vocational student than an academic student, with the bulk of the added expense going to specialized teaching tools like shop equipment and materials.
But there have also been disagreements in many systems over just how and when to change priorities.
"The question is how to upgrade at a time of low resources and still stay competitive," said Bret Lovejoy, executive director of the American Vocational Association, based in Alexandria, Va.
In Connecticut, which has long had a strong regional vocational system of 17 schools run directly by the state, there is tension between teaching skills for manufacturing industries on the decline but still needing workers, and preparing a work force for high-tech industries the state would like to attract.
"A lot of the trades we taught used to represent Old World heavy-metal trades," said Ted Sergi, the Connecticut Commissioner of Education. "Now the central debate is how much money of a very tight budget should be redirected toward greater training for the vocational student in academics and technology the new world demands."
Advocates of the promised land of tech prep say the contemplated changes are so broad that it may take a generation to put them all into effect. But many stop short of endorsing more Federal participation beyond recent financing programs like the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994, which makes grants available for apprenticeships and other work-based programs. The concern, Dr. Bottoms and others said, is that Federal mandates might slow down rather than hasten the climb out of mediocrity.
"Federal policies since the 1960's were more concerned with access and equity than performance, and directed youths with difficulty in academic studies into vocational training," Dr. Bottoms said. Vocational training, particularly in large cities, got a reputation as a second-class education and a "dumping ground," the polar opposites of what the new concepts envision, he said.
The number of high school sophomores who identified themselves as vo-tech students fell from 21 percent in 1980 to 7.9 percent in 1990, according to a Federal Department of Education study, the same period in which computers started changing the workplace and assigning old vo-tech skills to the scrap heap.
The element of race is not far from any discussion about imposing more academic rigor on vocational education. Critics say that hurts the minority students who need the most help in finding jobs. Advocates counter that special consideration should be given to disadvantaged students but that programs should not be built entirely around their needs.
Some of the biggest gains are taking place in the Southeast, with large numbers of black students participating, Dr. Bottoms said.
Vocational schools are also under pressure to switch from blue-collar to "pink collar" careers in the service industry, drawing greater numbers of female students into courses like culinary arts and health care services. Small numbers of women enter male-dominated fields like the construction trades, but most pursue traditional office and health-sector careers, experts point out.
In the face of all these conflicting needs, what impresses most outsiders about Dr. Loftus's New Castle County Vocational-Technical School District is the swiftness with which it has assembled all the pieces and fit them together.
Certainly, Delaware's small size has been a help. The state has only three counties and one large city. There are only two vo-tech schools outside the district run by Dr. Loftus. All five schools are financed by the state and administered by a board of education appointed by the Legislature, not elected by popular vote.
Dr. Loftus credits whatever success the district has had to a decision he made shortly after taking over in 1990 to draw businesses into the schools as a resource. Du Pont, Hercules, MBNA and scores of other banking and financial institutions are based in Delaware, and he had no trouble getting managers to serve on a task force to study the schools and recommend improvements.
By 1992, he made sweeping changes to give the schools credibility as a career path to skilled jobs. He strengthened academic requirements for all students, "cleaned house" of faculty members who could not adjust to the new system and ordered retraining for teachers who had fallen behind the technological changes in their fields.
The schools not only teach technical expertise, but put it to use.
"We have our own market research programs that are more sophisticated than those at some banks," said William H. Stearrett Jr., the district's research supervisor. The district tracks graduates to see how they fare in the marketplace and conducts surveys to gauge parents' satisfaction with the schools.
Despite higher standards, more students are staying in school and graduating, officials report. "We used to have low-C and D students on average 10 years ago," said Donald C. James, the district director of pupil services. "That has risen to C and low-B students, and at one school, Hodgson, the average is B."
Moreover, voluntary tutoring is offered after school and on Saturday mornings for students having trouble with academic courses. Failing students declined last year to 50 out of the 3,000 in the district, from 144 two years earlier.
Students also receive "employability" ratings based on their attendance, punctuality, cooperation and work ethic. Teachers are evaluated every six weeks.
The number of black students has held steady at 30 percent of the district population, Dr. Loftus said, but he has noted a shift within that group to more female than male students. "Black female students appear to be much more focused and driven than black males," he said. "The same might be said of white female students compared to white males."
More money is available for technical equipment for the shops. In auto repair, for example, a four-gas engine analyzer -- which checks exhaust for signs of trouble -- cost $41,000. A new computerized paint shed has a price tag of $100,000.
"When I was a student here 20 years ago, we were all 'gearheads' who wanted to build hot rods and go to the drag strip," said Paul Davis, an instructor. "Now the kids don't have much interest in cars outside of transportation. They're here to learn a trade that pays a lot of money."
James King, head of the program, added: "Engines are so complex today you can't work on them without the help of machines, and you have to know as much about the machines as the cars. The dim-bulb garage is gone."
Training in trades like masonry and plumbing that involve as much sweat as knowledge are on their way out, other teachers said, and new programs like electronics, information systems and environmental technology are in.
An emphasis on communications skills has moved the New Castle district schools to the top echelon of all Delaware schools in writing scores, Ms. Gehrt said, while the two other vo-tech schools in Delaware remain at the bottom of the 19 districts.
Meanwhile, companies like General Motors and Microsoft are getting involved with training programs that pay students wages as they learn technical skills. A foundation has been created to raise $4.23 million over three years for scholarships and school purchases.
The district will add a fourth vo-tech school next year, and Dr. Loftus is already laying plans for a fifth. "The comprehensive high school should only be for college prep honors courses and special education," he said with a sly smile.
"Everyone else should go to vocational school after being exposed to some vocational training in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades."

HEADLINE: Introspection and Repression;
Why Indonesia Isn't Talking

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
GEN. JOHN M. SHALIKASHVILI, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a historic visit last month to Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, the country with the world's largest Muslim population and a regional military power with a troublesome reputation in human rights.
The first visit of any American in his position was news in Asia. It went practically unnoticed in the United States. But then, so does Indonesia. 
 With important political events unfolding in Indonesia, where demonstrations over the last few days brought violence to the streets, Westerners have almost no context in which to place this news.
John H. McGlynn, one of the few Americans living there who is not in diplomacy, oil or mining, remembers encountering the void. The scholar and translator recalled that more than 20 years ago, at the University of Wisconsin, he discovered that there were "five million-plus volumes in the library, and only about five books on Indonesia."
"That situation hasn't changed that much," said Mr. McGlynn, only half-joking, explaining recently why he and a group of Indonesian writers in Jakarta set up the Lontar Foundation in 1987 to translate into English the poetry, stories and essays of these unknown people. "Given the size of this country and its population there is an amazing disparity in the information that's available on Indonesia today."
Nearly 200 million Indonesians, extraordinary in their cultural diversity, live on thousands of islands stretching from the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific, across not only time zones but also ecological divides. Smoking volcanoes, rare animals, sultans' palaces, mesmerizing gamelan music and puppet theaters, a fast-growing economy that has transformed city skylines -- no dearth of attractions here.
So why does every Indonesian who ventures to the United States have a hard time explaining where and what Indonesia is? And how come tourists can spend a vacation in Bali and never know they are in Indonesia?
In a word, say Indonesians, the answer may be Java. Not the coffee -- or the computer language -- but the island.
The Javanese, an introspective people with an intensely complex language and an arcane social system built around the courts of sultans, account for more than half of Indonesia's people and about 100 percent of its reticence, says Goenawan Mohamad, a writer and editor of Indonesia's most respected news magazine, Tempo, which has been struggling to publish since the government closed it down in 1994. To be Javanese (as he is) means never promoting yourself, your restaurant, your talent or whatever, he said. Bad form.
This drives a lot of other Indonesians to despair. A. A. Navis, a novelist and historian on the neighboring island of Sumatra, says the Javanese have failed to create a positive image or promote Indonesia, in contrast to the Malaysians, who have tirelessly boosted the culture and economy of their country, whose people are closely related ethnically to many Indonesians.
Mr. Navis is a Minangkabau, people known for their devoutly Islamic yet matrilineal culture in which women own the property and enjoy a social stature unique in the Muslim world. He says that many Indonesians do not share Javanese inhibitions and distrust of societies beyond their own. But with cultural, governmental and military power concentrated in Java, along with the capital, Jakarta, there is little that the people of Sumatra, Borneo or other islands can do to open Indonesia's doors wider.
The Javanese dominate the army, which has been the power behind a civilian front for half a century since independence from the Dutch. Under President Suharto, a general who put down what official history records as a Communist-inspired coup in 1965, the Javanese-military complex has grown ever more entrenched in politics and business. Mr. Suharto, now with a former army chief as his vice president, has refused to budge from the presidency for nearly 30 years.
Indonesians are restless. Last week, an opposition demonstration in Jakarta turned violent, with scores injured. President Suharto recently lost his most trusted adviser and wife of 48 years, Siti Hartinah, who died in April of a heart attack. She and their six children had by most accounts amassed huge fortunes, fueling public resentment. But even if events conspire to drive Mr. Suharto from the scene, would Indonesia be that different?
All around the country, people say that the Javanese-dominated establishment has been deaf to criticism. Under Sukarno, Indonesia's first president, Indonesia cast its lot with third-world radicals, alienating Western nations. Mr. Suharto, a consummate Javanese, is best known by many foreigners for the brutal military occupation of the former Portuguese territory of East Timor, which began in 1975, and his subsequent refusal to loosen the occupation by Javanese soldiers who have killed many Timorese.
Java's and perhaps Indonesia's distance from the larger world may be as much spiritual as it is geographical, political or military, judged by the poetry of some of its leading writers. If we find Indonesians aloof and incomprehensible, they often seem overwhelmed, deeply alienated and sometimes repelled by Western culture. They do not emigrate in significant numbers or overstay visas when they travel. They do not seem to crave recognition abroad.
A few years ago, Mr. McGlynn's foundation collected Indonesians' impressions of the United States, many of them unsettling, in a book called "On Foreign Shores." One of the poets, Ajip Rosidi, reacted to New York in a poem titled "Manhattan Sonnet."
 Is it within these strong and rigid walls
one's sense of safety nestles?
All I find here is vigilance, the source of apprehension.
His compatriot Subagio Sastrowardoyo wrote about a city "where life is cheap." New York's greed, he said, "has made this place too confined for prayer or a human voice."
All told, they'd rather be in Indonesia.

HEADLINE: The World;
A Few Good Reasons to Start Caring About Africa

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: BANGUI, Central African Republic

 BODY:
WHEN the United States and France mounted separate military operations this spring to extract their citizens from crisis-stricken African countries within one month of each other the question that underpinned much of the commentary on the news was: Why bother with a continent that never seems able to find its way?
From the perspective of the West, which is focused on crises elsewhere, Africa in the 1990's has virtually become a bad word, synonymous with Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia -- horrible crises that defy solution by well-intentioned outsiders. 
 But for Africans who watched American Marines pull Westerners out of the chaos of Liberia, or Legionnaires do the same in this former French colony, the question to ask was rather different: Why, many wondered, after the West's lengthy, almost obsessive involvement with Africa, are so many voices suddenly calling for something that sounds like abandonment?
It was not so long ago, after all, that Europe and America were sinking billions into African countries, hoping to lock up mineral wealth and markets, and making bedfellows of some of the worst dictators of recent times in the name of battling Communism.
 
 
 
Groping, Yes. But Hopeful.
 Where the West sees a glass half-empty and draining fast, for Africans the rapid spread of competitive elections throughout the continent in this decade, the sweeping economic reforms that have brought renewed growth to most of the continent, and the triumphs of peace in places like South Africa, Mozambique and Ethiopia mean that the glass is half full and perhaps rising -- highly televised wars and famines or no.
This is not the only difference of perspective between a pessimistic West and an Africa still groping for solutions but remaining hopeful. Addressing Africa's chronic economic weakness and political instability requires a searching examination by all of how things got this way.
For their part, Africans have largely abandoned the old diatribes in which they would blame outsiders for every ill; instead, to a remarkable degree they have become brutally honest in examining their own failings in nearly four decades of independence.
Almost simultaneously, however, it has become a fashion in Western capitals to pretend that Africa's problems are uniquely the product of the continent's own failings. Suddenly the self-comforting myth of the White Man's Burden has given way to an even more ahistorical belief: that Europe left Africa in good shape at independence. To believe that is to ask the next question: What is wrong with these people if they can't make modernity work?
Jim Hoagland, the foreign affairs columnist at The Washington Post, wrote of an editorial meeting in which one participant suggested that "the way to deal with Africa was to build a fence around the continent and then peek in 100 years later to see if anything had improved." A recent column by William Pfaff, who writes for The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, took the other extreme, saying that Africa must be placed under some new form of international trusteeship until its immense problems can be worked out.
Not that either approach would work, of course. For a host of reasons, from emigration to epidemics, ignoring Africa and its problems would almost certainly backfire. And there is a moral argument: Africa has contributed about 12 percent of the United States' present population, with deep influence on its economy and culture; such ties cannot go ignored. As for trusteeship, the suggestion fails to ask why, after over a century of miserably presiding over Africa's destiny, the West is any more qualified to do so again today. Nor does it ask how Africans themselves might feel.
In any event, in assuming that Africa was well prepared for independence, both views betray the fund of ignorance that surrounds Africa and prevents even the well-meaning from exploring realistic ways of engaging it. A clearer reading of history would go like this:
After centuries of the Atlantic slave trade, which depleted the continent of millions of its best sons and daughters, colonialism, begun in earnest only about 100 years ago, was an affair of forced labor and captive supplies and markets for Europe. Preparation for independence was so secondary it could barely be called an afterthought. Chad, which at independence in 1960 had two and a half times as much territory as its French colonial master, boasted only three secondary schools.
Europe's treatment of much of Africa in the independence period can hardly be called an improvement. Many of Africa's worst dictators (some still with us) were the creatures of outside powers more eager for malleable allies than for fathers of independence.
Americans, who never colonized Africa, will rightly wonder: Why is this our problem? Liberia, although its origins 150 years ago as a colony of freed American slaves are unique, is a good place to start. As much as United Fruit in Central America, the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company has dominated its economy and politics for much of the period since the 1920's. More recently, to secure intelligence and communications assets in the country, Washington poured in more than $500 million in aid in the 1980's, as Liberia was being destroyed by Samuel K. Doe, one of West Africa's bloodiest dictators.
The links of history don't go back nearly as far, but equally grim stories can be told of American involvement in long-troubled countries like Zaire and Angola.
 
 
 
Business Opportunities
 Rather than simply seeking to apportion blame, however, many advocates of a reassessment of American ties with Africa say Washington should be prospecting for mutually profitable ways of dealing with it.
If the French and British rarely stop to ask the question, "Does Africa matter?" it is because their business people have long known what the late Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, was preaching to American companies shortly before his death: If the risks of doing business are higher than in most places, the rewards, in the form of average corporate profit margins of 25 percent, are the highest in the world.
In a recent study, Salih Booker, Africa Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, found that for all the despair about Africa, southern Africa's $7 billion in trade with the United States in 1994 roughly equaled America's total trade with all of the former Soviet countries. North African trade surpassed all of this country's commerce with Eastern Europe, and West Africa trailed that amount by only a small margin.
Paradoxically, just when Africa presents the richest opportunities, Americans, who account for only about 7 percent of the world's trade with the continent, seem strongly deterred by the images that steadily stream from a handful of traumatized lands.
"The United States runs a trade deficit with the continent, while most of the European allies run a surplus," said Mr. Booker, who added that until this year, Africa was the only region of the world for which the United States had no official trade policy.
"The U.S. could have a much bigger share of African business if it worked at it," he said. "This would mean more development and stability for Africa, but it would also mean jobs here at home. Isn't that what foreign policy is about?"

HEADLINE: Why So Resilient?;
A President Who Can Absorb Body Blows

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKEBy WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT'S probably the most puzzling question in the 1996 Presidential campaign, and one that is no doubt confounding Bob Dole: Why is it that as more and more whiffs of scandal have swirled around President Clinton, he has invariably emerged unscathed in the polls?
No President in modern history has demonstrated such resiliency in the face of one ominous headline after another: A sexual harassment lawsuit by a former state employee in Arkansas; the suicide of Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel; the resignation of Mike Espy as Agriculture Secretary amid allegations of impropriety; the White House travel office debacle and, of course, the Whitewater land deal, which has dogged the First Family for years. 
 Lately, the swirl has more resembled a twister. Nine days ago, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation denounced the White House for improperly obtaining F.B.I. files on more than 400 people, many of whom worked for the Bush Administration. Embarrassing hearings on the matter got under way last week on Capitol Hill. On Whitewater, Senate Republicans issued a blistering report accusing Hillary Rodham Clinton and White House aides of impeding their inquiry. To cap it off, Federal prosecutors described Bruce Lindsey, a close adviser to the President and one of his closest friends, as a conspirator in an illegal scheme involving Mr. Clinton's last re-election drive as Governor of Arkansas.
 
 
 
Keeps on Ticking
 But by the end of the week, the polls showed not the slightest erosion in Mr. Clinton's double-digit edge over Mr. Dole, the presumed Republican nominee. An ABC News-Washington Post poll conducted June 14-18 found that 55 percent of respondents would vote for Mr. Clinton, while 35 percent favored Mr. Dole. And new polls in three large states, Texas, Florida and California, found Mr. Clinton comfortably ahead.
If Ronald Reagan was the Teflon President, then Bill Clinton is the Timex President: He takes his lickings, keeps on ticking.
"To have withstood so many legitimate questions about one's conduct without the public appearing at this point to take notice is a puzzling phenomenon," said Stanley A. Renshon, a psychoanalyst and political scientist at the City University of New York. "He seems to be doing everything possible to test the limits of the public's patience."
Scandals aside, Mr. Clinton's popularity no doubt has been shored up by factors that have traditionally immunized incumbents past: a relatively robust economy and encouraging quality-of-life measures like the declining crime rate.
But ultimately, the cumulative effect of so many accusations and disclosures could become too much for voters to bear. And Republicans can take solace in that they have nearly five months to make the "character issue" stick to Mr. Clinton.
While the Summer Olympics in Atlanta may dominate news coverage before the August party conventions, ethics issues are not about to disappear: The House and Senate inquiries into the F.B.I. file transfers have only just begun; so has the second Whitewater trial in Little Rock, involving Mr. Lindsey; and the special prosecutor for Whitewater, Kenneth W. Starr, now has the F.B.I. file affair on his plate as well. The Republican Party is sure to keep the questions alive in other ways; already, it is running TV ads reminding voters of the sexual harassment suit against Mr. Clinton and portraying him as a draft dodger.
 
 
 
Tolerance
 But for now, the President is benefiting from an understanding, though hardly sympathetic, public and from a far more tolerant political climate than in 1988, when Senator Gary Hart of Colorado abandoned his Presidential campaign amid revelations of his extramarital involvement with a woman on the yacht "Monkey Business."
Last weekend, hoping that he had finally broken through, Mr. Dole touted a CNN-Time poll that found Mr. Clinton's lead had slipped to 6 points from 22 points a months earlier. But the poll-taker has since conceded that the survey probably caught Mr. Dole at an unusually good moment: the day after his emotional resignation from the Senate. On Friday, a new CNN poll found that Mr. Clinton held a 19-point lead, even though most people said Mr. Dole was more honest and trustworthy.
In fairness, there is not a trace of evidence that Mr. Clinton has stolen public money, carried on with women in the White House or ordered wiretaps of his enemies. A joke making the rounds on the House floor is that Mr. Clinton amassed the F.B.I. files not out of sinister motives but because he was so eager to win friends, he wanted to send state-dinner invitations to his opponents.
"It's a drip, drip, drip type of thing," said Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. "But the Republicans still haven't produced anything. The old saying, 'Where's the beef?' I would say, 'Where's the crime?' "
Yet voters know they did not elect a saint in 1992. From his initial appearances before wide national audiences, when he spoke of his past marital discord and bobbed and weaved on the draft, Mr. Clinton sought to inoculate himself against the character issue. His mantra during the New Hampshire primary four years ago was: "If you want a perfect candidate, vote for somebody else."
So far, the tactic has seemed to work. Many voters do not particularly like, or trust, the President. But that does not mean they won't vote for him. Voters have become so disillusioned about their politicians that they have low expectations about them.
"The idealism of the electorate has suffered, and the Clinton popularity is an index of the acceptance of lower standards," said former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who was angrily rebuked by Mr. Clinton when, at a candidates' debate during the 1992 primaries, he raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's business dealings.
Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who coined the term "Teflon-coated Presidency," said: "People are just scandal-overloaded. They know that Bush was involved in the Iran-contra stuff. They know that Reagan was not really in charge. What people are saying is the last President who they really thought was a conscientious guy was Carter -- yet he wasn't at the time getting straight A's from people."
 
 
 
The Dole Contrast
 As the accusations pile up, the public remains unmoved. Even the guilty verdicts in the Whitewater trial against the Clintons' business partners did not bring character questions to the forefront. Seventy-seven percent of Americans polled by The New York Times and CBS said the verdict brought no change in their opinion of the President.
Mr. Clinton has also benefited by the contrast with Mr. Dole, who many voters believe has yet to formulate a compelling rationale for his candidacy. Another advantage for Mr. Clinton is that the longest controversy, Whitewater, is impenetrably complicated to most Americans -- and difficult to boil down into a 30-second ad.
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, accuses the media of glossing over Mr. Clinton's troubles (the White House certainly disagrees) and warns that the Administration's efforts to play down the gravity of its troubles could backfire. "Do not underestimate the impact when people are told over and over, 'There is not much to this,' " Mr. Barbour said.
Mr. Clinton's political fortunes could change, of course, and they could change overnight if the small drips turn into bucketfuls of questions. If there is one more indictment, one more scandal, or -- in Watergate parlance -- a smoking gun with Bill or Hillary Clinton's fingerprints, Mr. Dole might finally find the key to victory in November: The character issue could become too big for voters to ignore.

Unholy Fires on Hallowed Ground

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
IN America, where people rank among the most religious in the industrialized world, to burn a church is to commit an act of a singular profanity.
Its violence lies in the attempt to disrupt a community of believers, desecrate their altars and smash the spiritual rhythm of their lives. The arsonist attacks not just planks and shingles but the space where life's most important transitions are marked, where babies are baptized, marriages celebrated and the dead eulogized. 
 It is this recognition that has caused the growing sense of horror and outrage of many Americans, as night fires have gutted an increasing number of church buildings belonging to predominately black congregations in the rural South and beyond. Early Thursday, a church in Portland, Ore., was damaged by arson.
Church burnings register on a "soul-deep level," where even the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom seems imperiled, said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches. "You begin to ask," she said, "can one not go to a church of one's choice and worship free of fear?"
The council, which represents 33 Protestant and Orthodox Christian churches, has lobbied the Clinton Administration to step up the Federal investigation of the fires. What makes these acts especially insidious, Dr. Campbell and other say, is that they have occurred in black churches.
Deval L. Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, who is co-chairman of the group investigating the fires, called the burnings "an epidemic of terror."
In the last six years, Federal authorities have investigated 216 fires and desecrations in houses of worship and solved about a third. Half of the 216 incidents, Mr. Patrick said, have occurred in the last 18 months -- about 70 percent of them in Southeastern black churches.
Most have happened since December; most of the people arrested have been white. The attacks have sometimes come in clusters. On Monday night, two churches in northeastern Mississippi, less than five miles apart, were destroyed within minutes of each other.
From the days of slavery through the civil rights movement, religious congregations have provided an important meeting ground for blacks, who could gather outside the gaze of whites. Black churches formed in the face of the bigotry of established churches, which either barred blacks from membership or limited their participation, often segregating them in balconies.
 
 
 
A Nerve Center
 Rosetta E. Ross, associate professor of ethics at Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, who throughout her childhood worshipped at a small Methodist church in rural South Carolina, said such houses of worship provided "the only place that African-Americans could gather and be in safe space, that is, in space that African-Americans could govern."
The local church served as a nerve center, where people learned news of their community and the society around them, said Professor Ross. In rural areas, she said, "There's still a sense of the church being the place that helps to hold the community together."
Black churches have long nurtured political and economic leadership, as well as providing spiritual uplift. Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Jesse Jackson were all ordained ministers before they were seen as national figures.
"The church in the black community is the symbol of our advocacy," said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. "It is the cultural-spiritual-political matrix in the black community. It is the site of mass rallies and marches."
If someone wanted to send a vicious message to black Americans, Mr. Lowery said, "they would want to target the one symbol of black aims and aspirations."
During the civil rights years, churches were routinely chosen for nocturnal firebombing. Sometimes the violence proved lethal: In 1963 a dynamite bomb segregationists placed in the stairwell of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Montgomery killed four little girls preparing for Sunday school.
Senator Bob Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, spoke out early against the church burnings. President Clinton denounced the incidents in his June 8 radio address, and a few days later visited a South Carolina congregation that was dedicating a new building to replace one destroyed by fire. On Wednesday, he met with a bipartisan delegation of Southern governors and law enforcement officials.
Last week, the House unanimously passed a bill that would make it easier to pursue cases of church arson. The Senate is expected to approve a similar bill.
The burnings have also had an effect, outside Government circles, unintended by those who hoped the arson would terrorize rural blacks.
Public desire to help the congregations affected has cut across sectarian lines. Rebuilding funds have been launched by Christian groups, black and white alike, and by local synagogues and national Jewish organizations.
On Tuesday, the Christian Coalition, a conservative political organization that has supported legislation often in conflict with the views of black religious leaders, said it would ask churches on its mailing list to take up a special collection to raise $1 million. Two days later, the National Council of Churches announced that eight foundations had contributed $2.7 million to the council's Burned Churches Fund, to be used partly for rebuilding, partly to develop programs to combat racism.
Dr. Campbell said the council has also received offers from people who want to send money, lift boards or hammer nails in the effort to rebuild.
But beyond the crimes and the generous public response, there lies the more elusive problem of why the violence is occurring.
Mr. Clinton, in his meeting with the Southern governors, said he did not believe a conspiracy was at work, but he said many of the incidents appeared to be racially motivated. His comments reflected a lack of evidence to link the suspects in the few cases in which arrests have been made.
Dr. Campbell and Mr. Lowery attributed the burnings to a broad racial hostility simmering throughout the country. Dr. Campbell, who has visited 11 of the arson sites, said several pastors of burned churches blamed "hate radio," racially charged broadcasts on the airwaves that attributed the bulk of social ills, from downsizing to crime, to blacks.
Religious people, she said, should work to "change the climate," by pushing the cause of toleration, civility and respect for one another.
Mr. Lowery, on the other hand, said he thought the burnings had a broader source, in an "attitude of hostility" toward legislative gains made by blacks. Such hostility, he said, found inspiration in such efforts by politicians as rolling back affirmative action programs.
Still, church burnings represented a special kind of rage. "There is a hatred there," he said, "there is a lunacy there, that thinks they can shake their fists at God without consequence."

MEDIA
 
What's Hot? Radio!
 
With all the talk about "new media" -- zapping the brain with the latest in electronic fare -- plain-vanilla radio is doing just fine. Ad revenues are growing fast, perhaps because of today's car mania and mega-commutes: unless you tempt fate surfing the 'Net as you steer, you're stuck with radio. So Westinghouse's $3.7 billion plan to buy Infinity Broadcasting made perfect sense -- a deal that would create a radio giant with 83 stations nationwide, dominance of many big markets, and, yes, Howard Stern. The deal is a direct result of Congress's recent loosening of telecommunications law, but because of its sheer size it could still face antitrust scrutiny. Critics also wonder whether it will hasten the day when you flip through the dial and find nothing but pounding, rat-a-tat news and sports, pounding rock music or the verbal pounding of the "shock jocks." Mozart? Hmmm. Must pitch for the Mets.
 
AVIATION SAFETY
 
Perfectionism Aloft
 
Every day, hundreds of people die terrible, untimely deaths -- from cars, crime, AIDS, alcohol, cigarettes, you name it. With most killers, our Washington protectors try, with varying success, to whittle at the toll. But whittling isn't enough for the Federal Aviation Administration. It wants perfection: zero fatalities. That may seem optimistic, with airplane deaths only blips on that fatal radar, but they do come in headline-grabbing bunches. Reflecting its new craving for this safety paradise, the F.A.A. grounded Valujet last week, citing "serious deficiencies" -- the agency had clearly changed its mind since its upbeat appraisal after the May crash. And as a quick encore, it said it wanted to scrap a dual, conflict-prone mission: promoting aviation with its right hand, keeping it safe with the left. From now on, both hands are to be safely on the wheel.
 
STATISTICS
 
Clinton Millionaires
 
Here's a puzzle. Democrats love to point smugly at Reagan-era statistics, the ones showing the rich gobbling ever more of the pie. But guess what? The latest numbers show that in the Clinton years, not only is the gap still widening, but the rich are grabbing even more of the national wealth. The top 20 percent of households, the Census Bureau said last week, now devour 46.9 percent of the income, up from 40.5 percent in 1968. So is Bill Clinton really the greater villain? Maybe not. The numbers, naturally, come bearing footnotes, and one is worth noting: until March 1994, the Census Bureau didn't account for income above $300,000; now the limit is $1 million. Considering all the obscenely large salaries paid to mere mortals these days, that could certainly skew the averages.
 
INFLATION KILLER
 
The Mighty Greenspan
 
It's a rare and heartwarming sight to see New York's two Senators agree so enthusiastically, but there they were last week -- Alfonse M. D'Amato praising Alan Greenspan's "steady hand at the tiller" and Daniel Patrick Moynihan calling Mr. Greenspan "a national treasure." The occasion? Mr. Greenspan -- no surprise -- was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate for a third term as Fed chairman. The vote came a day after a Fed report that has become a familiar drumbeat: the economy's doing fine, and inflation -- that brute! -- has still not struggled to its feet since the central bank beat it to a pulp years ago. So the Senate vote had a clear message: steady as she goes, and keep your foot firmly on the brute's neck.
 
TRADE
 
Rogues and Super-Rogues
 
It's an imperfect world. Some countries will always do unpleasant things. Even, dare one say it, the United States on occasion. But never mind that -- we're talking about the other ones, the bad ones, the "rogue nations." Is it our business to police them? True, it often makes sense to withhold America's welcome wagon -- on, say, trade -- but is it a bit much to demand that other nations enforce our lofty principles? Washington is already trying to whip up the world to join its anti-Cuba frenzy, and last week the House voted harsh sanctions against foreign companies that invest in Iran. But the rest of the world is balking, so on this issue, at least, America may itself become the "rogue nation."
 
AUTO PRICES
 
Terror on the Car Lot
 
Round numbers can be scary -- as in turning 50 (though it didn't seem to bother Donald Trump recently). Or exhilarating: as in breaking three hours in a marathon. But they are always potent, as the Commerce Department discovered when it calculated, two years ago, that the average new-car price had broken $20,000. A sobering number indeed, saddling cars with an image that auto makers didn't like at all: that of a costly luxury. So Detroit protested, and sure enough the Commerce Department now says that the earlier figure was not really precise -- and as it happens, the average never did hit $20,000. In fact, the agency says, average prices have actually fallen in the last year or so, to about $18,000, as more people choose cheaper cars and prices rise less frequently. Feel better?
 
MOVIES
 
50.5 Dalmatians?
 
 
Blockbusters here, blockbusters there. No, it isn't your imagination: anyone with a day job could not hope to keep track of all the movies opening these days, much less actually see them. Good news, though: relief is in sight. Disney has for years been firmly in the more-is-better camp, turning out 35 to 40 films a year -- partly to fatten up its library. But last week it said it would slash that to about 20, focusing more on "family films" -- but also keeping an eye out for projects like "The Rock," its current hit. The cuts make sense to one studio head, who said there's no glut of movies, just a "glut of Disney movies" -- the endless sports or teen-age comedies that have done so dismally. Now, only the cuddly or the huge will survive.
 
THE OLYMPICS
 
Torch by Madison Avenue
 
If you can walk through Atlanta this summer without getting an overwhelming urge to drink a Coke or a Bud, buy a Swatch watch or a G.M. car -- well, you're sadly short of modern-day Olympic spirit. You probably have idealistic notions about excellence, triumph, sweat and world records. What a quaint idea. The most visible world records so far are being set by the Brobdingnagian advertising displays -- the six-story Coke bottle, the submarine-size Swatch. Even as you make your way along Atlanta's streets, you'll probably walk on "official Olympic pavement" with "the official Olympic sun" beating down. So have advertisers found paradise, a land without limits? Sadly, no. In Olympic Park and much of downtown, ads can be no more than 35 feet high.
 
DIPLOMACY
 
A U.S.-China Deal
 
China agreed last year to stop its piracy of American music, movies and software, but then, apparently, kept turning them out anyway. So it was back to the drawing boards, with the United States threatening $2 billion in trade sanctions. Last week, again, there was a much-trumpeted deal to crack down on this piracy, the air filled with upbeat talk of "engagement" and "working together constructively." And, yes, there are new enforcement tools. But if, say, a compact-disk factory is closed, can American officials verify that it stays closed? No, not part of the deal. And, yes, the Chinese police have made several raids on pirate factories lately. But will such vigilance last?

Haves Over Have-Nots, Again

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

 BODY:
The rich getting richer? That seemed to be a staple of the Reagan Administration. But as a new report from the Census Bureau points out it seems a staple of almost all administrations since 1968.
Last week the bureau said that the gap between rich and poor continued to grow, and may have accelerated, during the first two years of the Clinton Administration. At the end of 1994, the top 5 percent of households earned 21.2 percent of total national income -- the biggest share of the income pie since the end of World War II. 
 Part of the growth in household income inequality stems from new ways the bureau measures income disparities, which make the rich look richer than ever before. But the report also indicates that larger trends like the growth in the number of highly paid women who marry highly paid men have more to do with the growing disparity than any Washington policies.
A new University of Michigan study also showed wealth concentrating from 1989 through late 1994 as affluent families gained from financial markets while poorer families fell deeper into debt. STEVEN A. HOLMES

Defusing the E-Bomb

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
President Clinton flies to France this week for the annual G-7 meeting. Here's the speech he won't be giving to the gathering of Japanese, Canadian and European leaders:
Gentlemen, as we gather here this year, it's clear that we have no agenda. The reason is obvious: We are moving in opposite directions on the economic front. In this election year, the U.S. is moving from what Richard Gephardt calls an era of "deficit politics," focused on reducing our huge government debt, to an era of "income politics," focused on lifting the wages and lowering the taxes of workers. At the same time, though, you Europeans and Japanese are moving from an era of income politics, during which you swaddled your workers in lavish pension, health-care and retirement benefits, to an era of deficit politics, in which you've discovered you can't afford all these entitlement programs anymore, are trying to cut back, but your workers won't let you. I saw those protests in Germany and France on CNN. 
 The fact that we are moving in opposite directions is going to be a serious problem for all of us, and it's what we really should be discussing. From the American point of view, we are deluding ourselves if we think we can go back to the Reagan era of income politics, where the Government ran up huge deficits as it cut taxes and refused to cut entitlements. Unfortunately, though, my opponent, Bob Dole, is already planning to unveil a massive, Reagan-like tax-cut plan, with no serious deficit reduction. And I'm just as guilty. I've been throwing out proposals for tax deductions for college tuition, assisting first-time home buyers and resisting any deep cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.
If either of us carries through on such promises we will be headed back to the huge deficits of the 1980's. But as all of you know, the international financial environment that sustained the Reagan deficits of the 1980's, and made them relatively painless for the U.S. public to absorb, no longer exists. The dirty little secret of Reaganomics was that it worked, and was sustainable, because the Japanese, the Arabs and the Germans all had surplus savings that they were ready to use to buy our Treasury bills, and thereby finance our deficit, so that we wouldn't have to raise interest rates sky-high. But times have changed. You can't save us anymore. The Japanese have their own banking crisis and have to finance their own aging population; the Arabs are broke, and the Germans are busy trying to finance their own deficit, run up by the cost of unifying East and West Germany.
As Thomas Gallagher of Lehman Brothers Global Equity Research points out, the longer we wait to downsize our entitlement programs the costlier it will be. He says that if we Americans decided today that we wanted to put Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on a firm financial footing that would take us well into the next century, it would require a 15 percent tax hike across the board. If we wait until the next century, it will require a tax hike triple that amount. We all know those are politically unsustainable numbers. Which means we have no choice but to cut entitlements.
So here's the situation: We're all desperately in need of entitlement reform, but we American politicians are running away from it and our people are following us over a cliff. You European and Japanese leaders are at least running in the right direction, but none of your people want to follow. This is going to be trouble, or as Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs International recently said about the G-7, "Our common failure to reform dramatically expanding entitlement programs is the ticking time bomb underneath us all, and the longer we wait to defuse it, the bigger the explosion will be."
Which gets me back to this meeting. G-7 summits can't change the world, but they can give us each a bit more courage to face our common problems, and a bit more credibility with our own publics by making clear that we are all in the same boat. Let's make this the Entitlement Reform Summit -- the one where we all pledge to begin defusing the "E-bomb." Because if we don't, the result will be turmoil. We will have intercontinental conflict, as we each try to suck up the other's savings to finance our deficits, and intergenerational conflict, as our children discover they have to pay for our negligence.

HEADLINE: Europe Attacks U.S. Bid to Bar Investments in Cuba and Iran

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: FLORENCE, June 22

 BODY:
Leaders of the 15 European Union countries, four of whom will meet next week with President Clinton in France, expressed strong criticism today of United States legislation that would impose economic penalties on foreign companies that invest in Cuba, Iran or Libya.
The European leaders registered "deep concern" about the Helms-Burton Act, which would restrict non-American foreign investment in Cuba, and similar legislation being sponsored by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, that would penalize foreign companies that made large investments in Libya or Iran. 
 The European Union, its leaders said today, threatened to retaliate against these or other American attempts to impose what they called an extraterritorial secondary boycott against the target countries. Europe, like most of the rest of the world, does not support the American economic embargo against Cuba, and maintains what it calls a "critical dialogue" with Iran despite continuing American pleas to stop trading with it.
President Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act despite reservations about provisions that would threaten foreign companies with lawsuits and exclude their executives from American soil if they used any Cuban property that was ever confiscated from someone who is now a United States citizen.
Senator D'Amato recently wrote to the French oil company Total S.A., warning it that proceeding with a $600 million acquisition of two Iranian oilfields from Conoco could threaten Total's ability to conduct business in the United States.
American diplomats in Paris said earlier this week that they did not expect the new legislation to cause much trouble at the meeting of the leaders of the world's leading industrial democracies, which starts next Thursday in Lyons, France.
The leaders of four countries that will be represented in Lyons -- France, Italy, Germany and Britain -- were among those who unanimously approved today's statement in the name of the European Union. Another opponent of the legislation, Canada, will also be at the Lyons meeting.
European officials said that they expected the United States to draw its own conclusions about how it would apply the legislation, given their opposition.
But the European leaders aligned themselves closely today with United States positions on the Middle East and Russia, urging all parties in the Middle East to search for peace and expressing support for the consolidation of democracy in Russia with a successful completion of the presidential elections there.
Like the Clinton Administration, most European governments were surprised by the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu in the recent elections in Israel.
Their statement made clear that they hoped that Prime Minister Netanyahu would resume negotiations with Syria despite his previous insistence that, unlike his predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, he would not consider giving up territory in the Golan Heights to reach a peace agreement with the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad.
Meeting here in a conference center in a 16th-century fortress that was designed to protect the Medicis from their Florentine subjects, the European leaders earlier resolved a three-month political crisis over their worldwide ban on British beef exports because of the so-called mad cow disease.
Britain stopped blocking European decision-making procedures after the group's approval on Friday of a plan to permit the gradual resumption of British beef exports once experts certified them as free of the disease.
So it was "business as usual" today, as the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, put it.
Still, there was no progress on an outline of revised procedures and treaty provisions to allow the group to take in central European countries early in the next century. The Europeans now expect to hold a special informal meeting in Dublin this fall to speed things up.
The leaders also conceded today that the common European currency they want to put in place could be introduced no earlier than 1999, assuming that any country could meet strict budget-deficit limits by the end of next year.
They also issued another in a series of almost ritual statements pledging to fight unemployment, which has now risen to an average of 10 percent, but without approving any European funds for programs to reduce the jobless rate.
Mr. Clarke pointed out that in previous meetings of this kind, the leaders pledged $10 billion through the European Investment Bank to build a new high-speed European rail network, but that political and environmental opposition, not lack of funds, had delayed them.

HEADLINE: Iraqis, Hurt by Sanctions, Sell Priceless Antiquities

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Browsing the antiques markets of London a few years ago, McGuire Gibson, an expert on Mesopotamian art and archeology at the University of Chicago, found some of his worst fears confirmed. In the stalls of Portobello Road and the shops of Bond Street, dealers offered him antiquities probably smuggled from Iraq, a modern nation in distress that sits astride the remains of several ancient civilizations.
Cylinder seals, which were once used on tablets of wet clay in something like an ancient version of notarization, were for sale by the bagful. There were clay tablets with cuneiform writing from as early as the Babylonian period and other objects of uncertain origin. 
 "For decades, the Iraqis kept a very tight lid on stuff, and there was very, very little getting out," said Mr. Gibson, a professor at the university's Oriental Institute and a leading archeologist who conducted digs in Iraq from 1964 until the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
"After the war, the selling started. Now stuff is just pouring out. They are selling everything. If this continues, there won't be an archeological site left that won't be damaged."
With stringent economic sanctions against Iraq in place since 1990 and little relief in sight, art experts and archeologists say precious artifacts from some of the world's oldest civilizations -- Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian among them -- are pouring into the international market mainly to raise cash in hard times.
Experts say they cannot estimate the total value of Iraqi antiquities reaching the market illegally, but given that even small individual pieces can be priced at $50,000 in some cases, and that there are so many objects involved, the figure probably runs into the millions of dollars. Mesopotamian antiquities exported legally from the 19th century until the 1960's have fetched high prices -- in one case $12 million paid for an ancient palace relief.
Experts at Sotheby's and Christie's, auction houses that are careful to authenticate objects and know their origins, say they have not encountered pieces from the new wave of illegal exports.
While some of the sellers of Mesopotamian antiquities are middle-class families parting with heirlooms and Iraqi traders unable to sustain themselves because of an embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, looters and grave robbers working with international smugglers are doing most of the damage, some experts say.
There have been reports of hundreds of looters swarming over archeological sites, perhaps with semiofficial complicity, and a truckload of cuneiform tablets intercepted on the way to Saudi Arabia. So successful is the largely illegal trade in Iraqi antiquities that a thriving business in Mesopotamian fakes is also growing.
 
So Many Artifacts So Easily Removed
Diplomats, collectors, dealers and university experts -- most of whom do not want to be identified, so their future work in the region will not be disrupted -- disagree on some details about the boom. Some believe that individuals, including Government employees, are taking the best pieces out overland through Jordan; others think that most of the smuggling is done by professional rings operating through the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq into Iran.
As might be expected, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's envoy to the United Nations and an architect by training, blames the Kurds, who are in a permanent state of rebellion against central authority. But he also says Iraq is unable to guard all its archeological sites, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, and some objects are so close to the surface that they are easily removed.
Mr. Hamdoon said that many pieces had disappeared from provincial Iraqi museums after the war. American scholars and collectors have varying opinions about the value of missing museum pieces. But several said they believed that the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, which they described as one of the world's finest, had survived with most of its collection intact.
Constance Lowenthal, executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research in New York, which with the independent Art Loss Register monitors stolen art and antiquities, said Iraq had been vigilant in watching over its major museums and helpful in compiling lists of missing objects.
But questions remain about how some objects, especially large pieces, get out of the country undetected. In the current issue of Ms. Lowenthal's newsletter, IFAR Reports, John M. Russell, an art historian and archeologist at Columbia University, reports that parts of three large reliefs from the throne room of the Sennacherib Palace in Nineveh that he photographed in 1990 are now on the international market.
Iraq has laws against exporting antiquities, and selling illegal imports is a crime in the United States. But this trade is new, and many items are small and easily concealed.
Bonnie Goldblatt, a senior agent of the United States Customs Service who specializes in art fraud in New York, said law enforcement officials had not yet seized any illegal Iraqi objects. She added that such items were often camouflaged as goods from another country.
A collector in New York described a lot of the early museum pieces pilfered during and just after the gulf war as "rubbish" but concurred that many very valuable objects began to appear later from other sources, including the private collections held by families who, Iraqi and American experts say, have also sold off their modern art, antique carpets, furniture and wooden doors to stay afloat financially.
Sympathy for these Iraqis seems widespread among collectors and archeologists in the United States, who are critical of continued sanctions against President Saddam Hussein's Government. They say the sanctions are hurting cultured families and intellectuals more than Iraq's leaders and soldiers, some of whom may be involved in trafficking in antiquities for profit.
American Government officials, who acknowledge that sanctions have caused Iraqis to sell off a lot of their private wealth, including art and antiquities, nevertheless say that President Hussein need only meet his promises to destroy his weapons of mass destruction to end the hardship. Officials also say the Iraqi leadership has shown its contempt for history by tampering with ancient sites.
"Saddam Hussein's regime has chosen consciously to build luxury palaces on significant archeological sites near the ruins of Babylon," said James P. Rubin, spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations.
"And by refusing to meet the demands of the international community," Mr. Rubin added, "he is forcing his own people to sell their artwork, compounding the economic and material hardships with psychological and cultural suffering."
 
Videos, Delivery, Service With a Smile
Experts agree that London, New York and Tokyo have become the prime centers of the Mesopotamian antiquities trade, with Asians often paying the highest prices.
Professor Gibson of the University of Chicago said that dealers were sometimes sent videos of objects from Middle Eastern sellers, with offers to bring pieces to a prospective buyer anywhere in the world for inspection.
With the slump in stocks, property and artworks in the 1980's, the market in antiquities was already on the rise when objects from Mesopotamia began to appear in larger numbers a few years ago. The exploding market for cylinder seals -- the Mesopotamian equivalent of Chinese chops or European signet rings or raised stamps to press into sealing wax -- has been the most extraordinary.
These seals from the Fertile Crescent are tiny columns of semiprecious stones, precious metals or occasionally clay, carved around the outside in concave relief and then rolled, not stamped, on clay tablets (or later, wax) to make identifying marks. They may have identified the tablets' owners and been buried with them, sometimes in large numbers, in tombs that date to 2500 B.C. or earlier.
 
Stealing History, For Beauty's Sake
"Cylinder seals are special because they are very small, and to carve them takes extraordinary skill," said Professor Gibson, who has edited a catalogue of objects presumed stolen from Iraq. "They are spectacularly beautiful things."
"Except for the Assyrian reliefs with battle scenes and ritual scenes carved into them, there is nothing as wonderfully narrative or varied as a cylinder seal," he said.
"Because they are so small and are often made of semiprecious stones -- really wonderful stones -- they have taken on a value way above most other artifacts. Unfortunately they are easily transportable, easy to carry around and get out of the country. The biggest one would be something like three inches high and, say, an inch and a half in diameter. Most of the seals are an inch long and half an inch in diameter."
Ancient amulets are also small and easy to steal and smuggle, a New York collector said. Many were also carved from semiprecious stones and worn on a string. Scholars believe that engravings on them indicate that they could have been intended to ward off illness or evil. Professor Gibson has seen one that says, in effect, "This is to scare away demons." They may also have been used to protect a household.
Ancient graves in Iraq, including the royal tombs at Ur, contain many other objects illustrating the daily life of succeeding civilizations. At Nippur, where Professor Gibson had been working, archeologists found 17 layers of cities built atop one another, tracing human settlements from around 5000 B.C. to 800 A.D.
"Mesopotamia is the first place in the world where what we call civilization does pop up," Mr. Gibson said. "This is the first place where you get monumental architecture on a really grand scale, the first place you get an organization of people along craft lines, the first place you get monumental art."
"By 3500 B.C. you have already laid in certain motifs that will stay there right through Mesopotamian civilization and beyond it," he added, stressing the region's importance to the study of subsequent ancient history.
"Here we see the relationship of rulers to gods, the relationship of people to the ruler and in certain ways the relationship of people to nature. That was a tremendously strong tradition, and some of it found its way through Alexander the Great into Greece, influencing both the Western and Eastern worlds."

HEADLINE: New York City Studies Bid For Olympics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is forming a task force of city officials and business leaders to look for ways to bring the lucrative Summer Olympics to New York City in 2008.
"The Mayor thinks that New York would be the perfect place to hold the Olympics," said the Mayor's press secretary, Colleen A. Roche. "The Mayor is assembling a team right now of city officials, key advisers and business leaders and they will be examining the feasibility of having New York host the Summer Olympics in the year 2008." 
 Holding the games in New York would create thousands of new jobs in the city. New arenas and stadiums would have to be built and the city's infrastructure would need to be improved. And once the games began, the tourist industry would reap the benefits of over a million visitors.
"The Olympics have a huge economic impact on the city that hosts them," said Daniel Doctoroff, an investor who has just completed a preliminary study of the advantages of bringing the Olympics to New York. "And they can really be a catalyst for getting things done. In Atlanta they built a new international arrivals wing at the airport, upgraded their mass transit and created the largest new urban park in America."
But the competition to hold the games is fierce, often rivaling the competition of athletes on the field.
Cities must demonstrate that they have funding commitments from both the public and private sectors, adequate ground and air transportation and enough stadiums, arenas, housing for athletes and hotel rooms for tourists. Cities must first persuade the United States Olympic Committee that they are ready for the games. Then they must compete with the rest of the world before the International Olympic Committee.
"New York would be a phenomenal city for the games, but it does have some serious issues to work out," said Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp, a sports consulting firm. "It is an international city, a media center, it would be a great backdrop to the games," he said. "But it has a lack of physical facilities for the games and would need to find places to house the athletes. And the ground transportation logistics become a very serious matter."
Past attempts to lure the Olympic Games to the city have failed. In 1984, a similar coalition of business leaders and elected officials, led by the businessman Richard Ravitch, tried to bring the games to the city but lost out to Los Angeles. And a 1992 effort by Donald Trump to attract the 2004 Olympic Games to the city had little effect.
But now the city is preparing to stage the 1998 Goodwill Games, the international sporting competition conceived by Ted Turner, the media executive.
If the Goodwill games go well, their success could whet the appetite of the United States Olympic Committee to make a bid to hold future Olympic games in New York.
"The main thing is facilities, facilities, facilities," said John Krimsky Jr., the deputy secretary general of the United States Olympic Committee. "And the core infrastructure to accommodate the visitors, to house and move the athletes and coaches."
This summer's Olympic games in Atlanta, which have a $1.7 billion budget, are expected to draw more than one million visitors, 10,000 athletes, 5,000 coaches and trainers and 8,000 journalists.
And the new Olympic stadium, which cost $216 million to build, will become the new home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team when the games leave.
Talk of the Olympics comes a few months after Mayor Giuliani proposed building a new stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan. If the city decides to make a full court press for the Olympics, it could improve the chances for the new stadium to be built. Mr. Doctoroff said his group would study ways in which a baseball stadium could be incorporated in the Olympics.
One factor that could work against New York City as a host is that the United States has staged so many games in recent years. The games were held in Los Angeles in 1984, and will be held in Atlanta this summer and in Salt Lake City in the winter of 2002. "The International Olympic Committee does like to spread it around the world," Mr. Krimsky said.
But Mr. Doctoroff said that he thinks New York has a fighting chance. "It is a symbol of the Olympics," said Mr. Doctoroff, a partner of the Texas investor Robert Bass.
"New York is the world's second home," he said. "Twenty-eight percent of the city is foreign-born, 40 percent don't speak English at home. This is a place where the various ethnic communities actually mix."

HEADLINE: Transit Official, Casting Doubts on Metrocard, Suggests Keeping Tokens

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
A year away from the scheduled elimination of the transit token, the Transit Authority's budget director has questioned whether it makes sense to do away with the token, leaving the Metrocard as the only way to pay a fare.
The doubts raised by Harvey Spector, the authority's budget director, are the first signs of dissension about the plan within the agency's top ranks, after an intensive three-year campaign to promote the Metrocard and clear the way for the token to be phased out by July 1, 1997. Mr. Spector, who is regarded by his colleagues as a sober judge of finances, expressed those doubts to Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of the Transit Authority, in a May 1 memo that was mailed anonymously to The New York Times. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Reuter defended the plan to do away with the token and said the timetable would not be altered. He said the concerns raised in Mr. Spector's memo either were misplaced or were being addressed.
Mr. Reuter also said that the Transit Authority plans to begin, "fairly shortly," to sell $1.50 or $3 Metrocards, good for one fare or two. "We have developed it," he said. "We're testing it."
The lowest-priced card now available costs $5, which some critics say is out of reach of the poor or impractical for people who use the transit system only occasionally. After buying a Metrocard, a rider can have value added to it at some token booths. Metrocard was supposed to be a boon to riders, who were to get an array of discounts, and to the transit system, which was to use it to make money in a variety of ways. But as Mr. Spector noted in his memo, both sides of that equation have collapsed. And, referring to the trouble the system has had in getting subway and bus passengers to accept the card and businesses to sell it, Mr. Spector questioned whether it would even be possible to eliminate the token.
"It's a pretty breathtaking statement that Metrocard is a flop," Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, said of Mr. Spector's memo. "And if Harvey Spector, who is a smart guy about these things, is worried, maybe we should be."
The memo is, in part, a frank admission of some of the problems that have plagued Metrocard since it became available in 1993 -- most notably, the lack of acceptance by the public. In April, it accounted for just 6 percent of all fares paid, though that figure was rising quickly, with riders spending three times as much on Metrocards in May as they did in December.
The card is accepted on all Transit Authority buses and at 200 of the 468 subway stations, with the rest due to accept it by early next year.
The price for the Metrocard system will exceed $700 million. Officials note that the biggest expense has been new turnstiles, which they say were badly needed and have helped cut fare-beating. Still, they have long fretted about the need to show some benefit from such a large investment.
As envisioned since the early 1980's, the Metrocard was supposed to entice riders with discounts like lower per-trip rates for spending more money on the cards, or flat-rate monthly or weekly passes. As recently as late 1994, the Transit Authority and its parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, promised such discounts.
Because of those incentives, Mr. Spector wrote, "Metrocard penetration rates were expected to soar, allowing for the orderly phase-out of the token (customers would have a real economic reason to move away from the token)."
But in early 1995, it became clear that declining city, state and Federal aid would cause the system financial trouble, and the discounts -- which would cost the M.T.A. money -- were shelved indefinitely. Since then, the M.T.A. has raised the transit fare to $1.50, just to keep up with cuts in Federal aid.
One incentive that appears to have survived is the elimination of two-fare zones, or areas where commuters commonly take a bus and a subway, paying two fares for one trip. The M.T.A. chairman, E. Virgil Conway, has promised to do away with two-fare zones by the middle of 1997, and an electronic fare card may be the only practical way to do that. Ending two-fare zones may be the only reason left for the card, Mr. Russianoff said.
Mr. Reuter argued that other discounts, like monthly passes, are merely dormant, not dead, and that Metrocard is essential to reviving them. "If you don't have the technology in place, you lose that flexibility long-term," he said.
Transit officials believe that for Metrocard to succeed, particularly among bus riders, it must be available at thousands of neighborhood businesses. So far, the cards can be bought at 1,600 shops and newsstands, but they are hard to find in many areas.
"If we don't have a robust out-of-system sales network, we won't be able to eliminate" the token, Mr. Spector wrote.
That worry, Mr. Reuter said, is misplaced. "We are putting into place a plan to develop an out-of-system sales network," he said, but he would not elaborate.
Some transit officials have argued that a one- or two-trip fare card would make the cards more attractive to riders and, therefore, to merchants.
For years, the M.T.A. devised plans to make money from Metrocard, primarily by marketing it as an all-purpose debit card that could be used at tens of thousands of businesses for small purchases like magazines or T-shirts.
But this year, three years after the M.T.A. concluded that it needed a partner with greater financial expertise, lengthy talks with Chase Manhattan Bank collapsed. Officials say it would take at least a year to put together a partnership with another company. In the meantime, other banks and telephone companies have jumped into the new debit card business, and some M.T.A. officials fear that they have missed their chance.
In his memo, Mr. Spector wrote: "Without a venture, token elimination is not essential."

HEADLINE: Medieval Fortress of Spirituality;
Cloaked in Mystery, Brooklyn Nuns Do Their Work: Prayer

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The basketball sailed over the high stone wall along St. Johns Place in Brooklyn, just missing the statue of Mary and the baby Jesus that rises forlornly above a block of graffiti-scarred row houses.
The ball's 13-year-old owner walked cautiously to the black iron gates of the Monastery of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, pressed a button and retreated to the street, watching until the gates groaned and a slice of daylight showed. From within, an unseen hand rolled his ball back onto the sidewalks of Crown Heights. 
 "I've never seen anybody come out," said the boy, Terrence Daniel. "Who does live in there?"
It is a question Brooklynites have asked for nearly 90 years now when they pass the corner of St. Johns and Bedford Avenue, where the monastery of a remarkable group of cloistered Carmelite nuns sits like a medieval fortress.
But even for those who know who lives inside -- the priest who celebrates Mass for the sisters at dawn, the parishioners who bring them fish and fruit and speak with them occasionally -- there has always been almost as great a sense of mystery. Because unlike other cloistered orders, the Brooklyn nuns have remained perhaps America's last practitioners of the oldest way: a life of complete isolation rooted in the 16th century.
This means that even those who have visited the whitewashed Italianate monastery for decades have never once seen its inhabitants.
No one can say for certain how many nuns live in the cloister, with the guesses ranging from 9 to 17. Even the priest who visits them six mornings a week, Monsignor Guy J. Puglisi, is unsure of their number and has no idea of the range of their ages. "It's a good question, but I can't answer it," he said. They remain hidden to visitors, communicating only through a barrel-shaped revolving wooden cabinet called a turn, first used in the Middle Ages to pass goods into monasteries without violating the cloister. In the few other American cloisters that had them, turns disappeared as part of Vatican reforms in the 1960's.
"Brooklyn is in a class all by itself," said Sister Constance FitzGerald, a Carmelite in Baltimore and an authority on the order's history.
To enter the turn room on St. Johns Place is to step back in time. Parishioners bearing handwritten pleas for prayer or bags of groceries that the nuns depend on are buzzed through the gates, buzzed into an anteroom and buzzed again into a tiny parlor. They place items for the nuns inside a polished 4-by-2-foot oak barrel half submerged in the bricks, and, like a secret revolving bookcase in a mystery movie, the barrel is spun around so a sister on the other side can take the contents.
Usually, a soft, muffled voice offers thanks or asks a question through the wood and a conversation is struck up. But it is always brief. Above the turn is a hand-lettered sign: "In the House of God, talk of Him or do not talk of anything."
In an era when nuns have become increasingly active and are working hard to change their image as escapists or innocents -- using models like Sister Helen Prejean, the death-row counselor portrayed in the film "Dead Man Walking" -- the Brooklyn nuns work as hard to remain changeless. Only by shutting out the world, they believe, can they be devoted to their sole mission: prayer.
Their concessions to the centuries since St. Teresa of Avila reformed the order in the 1500's are few and grudging. They have elecricity, but appear to use little of it, Monsignor Puglisi said. Others who glean details of their hidden lives from letters or snippets of conversation say they recently abandoned wearing veils and using straw sack mattresses, switching to thin foam-rubber pads on flat boards because straw was too difficult to maintain.
Even as they ward off encroaching technology, they are eminently practical. Monsignor Puglisi recalled that he once asked a sister behind the turn if he could use a phone. The barrel whizzed around and inside was a cordless handset. "I was a little, like, 'Well!' " he said. "The mother superior explained to me that she used it so she could work while she took calls."
But the sisters still wear thick brown wool habits like their predecessors, who founded the monastery in 1907, and they always wear sandals. Although nearly all other cloistered convents have done away with turns and metal grilles -- Sacramentine nuns in Yonkers took their grille out with an electric saw in 1969 -- the Brooklyn nuns still talk with visitors, even priests and family, from behind the turn or an opaque screen in the chapel.
While other convents have posted home pages on the World Wide Web and have bought cars to attend conferences, the Brooklyn nuns have never had so much as a television or radio and they do not leave the grounds even for visits of the Pope, but only for medical emergencies. When they die, they are buried in a crypt beneath the altar or on the grounds, thick with sycamores and maples.
"I've known people who have been in and out of there for 60 years, and never saw a sister, just the voice," said Pete Brennan, a retired banker who is part of an association of former neighborhood residents who raise money for the monastery. "When you were a kid it was a little scary: you're talking to a barrel, not a person."
The monastery was founded by six young nuns who traveled to Brooklyn from a convent in Port Tobacco, Md., near Baltimore. Established in 1790, the Maryland cloister was the nation's first, and from the earliest days, the Carmelite order evinced the quiet, steely resolve inherited by the Brooklyn nuns of today. According to one story, Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, the first American bishop, badly needed teachers. Without consulting the sisters, he obtained the Vatican's permission for them to abandon seclusion and start a school. The sisters insisted on remaining cloistered. The bishop relented.
The Brooklyn cloister began in a ramshackle clapboard house improbably called the McCann Mansion at St. Johns and Bedford, in what was then a solidly Irish and Italian Catholic neighborhood. The current monastery, three stories tall, with a bell tower, a steeple and a block-long enclosed garden, was built in the late 1920's by Helen Morton, the daughter of Levi P. Morton, a governor of New York and a vice president under President Benjamin Harrison.
According to the official history, Miss Morton provided the money after her dying sister, Alice, had a vision of St. Teresa, who dropped a pink rose on her bed and asked, "Will you build my monastery?"
Time has not been kind to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The stained-glass dome over the chapel cracked and had to be boarded over, and a section of wall tumbled onto Bedford Avenue last year. As the stark neighborhood's economy declined and crime rose over the past 30 years, security became an ever-present worry. Special Mass in the ornate chapel became rare after a mentally disturbed man barged in during one service and ran away with the monstrance.
The outer wall is topped in parts with glass shards and razor wire. The wall is also now covered with technicolor scribbles and words like TERROR and ESCAPE! "In the old days," said Mr. Brennan, 61, who was born on St. Johns, "we were all very intimidated by the place. God forbid you should even throw a ball against the wall."
Inside, the nuns appear to keep up their prayers unperturbed. They usually rise before 5:30 to say the morning portion of the Divine Office, which is intended to make the entire day holy, Monsignor Puglisi said. They attend Mass at 6:30 and receive communion through a small gold door in the chapel wall. Then they spend the rest of the day in nearly complete silence, responding to letters, doing chores, but mostly praying together or alone in their rooms, called cells. They pray for priests and nuns, for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other elected officials, for disaster and crime victims and for hundreds each week who mail or deliver requests for sick relatives, barren couples or out-of-work friends.
They are bound by their vows never to ask for anything and so do not receive help from the Brooklyn-Queens Diocese. Instead, they depend on the kindness of the dwindling group of former and current parishioners of nearby churches. James Quitone, a nurse who began to visit them when his father fell ill 14 years ago, often loads his car with cases of orange juice and tomatoes and Italian bread and drives over from Sheepshead Bay. "For those few tomatoes I bring you would think I bring the world," he says. He once took a couple of kiwis and the sister at the turn asked, "What are these fuzzy things?"
"No matter how many times I ask them what they like to eat," he said, "they always tell me whatever I bring is strictly up to the intervention of the Holy Spirit. The only way I figure out is to watch and listen and see what they don't return." The sisters seem to enjoy sweets, perhaps following their patron, St. Teresa, who once said when criticized for eating a big meal that there is "a time for penitence, but there is also a time for partridges."
Among the 65 monasteries of fellow cloistered Carmelites around the country, the Brooklyn nuns are sometimes regarded as relics or worse because of their stubborn resistance to change. While reluctant to criticize on the record, several Carmelites interviewed recently said they believed such seclusion and self-denial is unhealthy and unnecessary to keep up a life of prayer. "Some of us say that this 20th century has enough of its own kinds of hairshirts," said Mother Joseph, prioress of a convent in Terre Haute, Ind., that has a fax and a station wagon.
But the nuns' supporters believe prayer is being forgotten in the Catholic Church, and the way to restore its importance and rejuvenate shrinking religious orders is to return to the old ways. "People give me arguments about this, say those nuns are in there wasting their time, but I say that they're in there working," Mr. Brennan said. "Prayer is hard work."
Echoing Monsignor Puglisi -- who is fond of saying, "People don't know how powerful a place that monastery is" -- a priest from nearby St. Teresa's Church wrote of the nuns in the summer of 1942: "That which saves society is not that which can be seen upon the surface of things. It is not the power of industry, of war, of genius, of letters or arts. It is what touches its depths in a silence called the silence of good things."

HEADLINE: Andreas Papandreou Dies at 77; Fiery, Ambiguous Premier Dominated Greek Politics

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

 BODY:
Andreas Papandreou, the former Prime Minister of Greece and a maverick who towered over Greek political life for more than two decades, died early today at his home in Athens. He was 77.
The cause was a heart attack, his doctors said in a statement. Mr. Papandreou had open-heart surgery in 1988, though that did not keep him from winning an election in 1993. 
 But during 1995, his failing health prevented him from performing his dutiesm leaving Greece flailing. Yet even as his fiery voice had thinned to a near whisper and he walked with great difficulty, Mr. Papandreou refused to step aside or name a deputy to run the Government.
Finally, in January, his Socialist Party named Costas Simitis Prime Minister, and Mr. Papandreou had not been seen in public since his release from a hospital on March 21.
Few other politicians in modern Greece have inspired as much love and loathing at home and as much bewilderment and irritation abroad. The tall figure with bushy eyebrows fascinated Greeks with his compelling oratory and his unpredictable and volatile ways, and he remained hard to fathom even for his friends.
He was successful at home because he appealed to Greece's thirst for change, and his nationalist polemics appealed to the Greeks' perennial feeling of being misunderstood and unappreciated.
Abroad, Greece's Western allies were regularly befuddled as the undoctrinaire Socialist took positions diametrically opposed to theirs on issues ranging from Serbian aggression in Bosnia to the role of NATO.
Above all, the United States loomed large in his life, for that was where he had served in the Navy, graduated from college, worked, married twice and had four children; it was his source of funds and the nation that he first admired and later railed against obsessively.
The core of his foreign policy was to end Greece's status as "a client state of the West." As a result, he refused to condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and variously threatened to pull out of NATO, the United Nations and the European Union, although he accepted the Union's generous funds.
He blocked European credits for Turkey, Greece's enemy. While others shunned Libya and Yugoslavia, he improved his ties there. In the Bosnian war he supported Serbia, a longtime ally, and opposed sanctions against Serbia. He was reluctant to condemn Serbian atrocities, even in the face of ample evidence.
Mr. Papandreou thrived on being contrary; he described this as "tightrope diplomacy." Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was especially skillful at extracting funds from fearful Western governments that wanted to protect Europe's southeastern flank in the Communist Balkans. But despite his polemics, he remained pro-Western.
Although he was always passionate about politics, his life was made up of very distinct parts.
The only son of Sophia and George Papandreou, Andreas George Papandreou was born on Feb. 5, 1919, on Chios, while his father served as governor general of the Aegean Islands. When Andreas was five, his parents divorced. But he stayed in touch with his father, who rose in politics and became a powerful and popular leader, eventually becoming Prime Minister.
In 1937, when Andreas entered Athens University Law School, Greece was ruled by a right-wing dictator, Gen. Ioannis Metaxas, and his father and other liberals were banished to the island of Andros. Andreas, by now a Trotskyist, joined a resistance group that distributed underground newspapers and pamphlets, for which he was arrested and tortured.
Shortly before Mussolini's troops entered Greece, Andreas Papandreou left for New York, where he arrived in May 1940 with $14 in his pocket. He enrolled at Columbia University and took odd jobs to support himself. He married a Greek-American, Christine Rassias, in 1941 and earned a doctorate in economics at Harvard University in 1943.
The marriage ended in divorce a decade later. Dr. Rassias, a psychiatrist, said she often felt bullied by her husband, that he was a "ruffian" and "lied all the time." She wrote an unpublished autobiography in which she described Mr. Papandreou as cruel and dishonest.
In an interview last year, Dr. Rassias was asked why the book had not been published. Speaking of Mr. Papandreou, she said: "He paid me $90,000 not to publish the book because he was running for office then. He was afraid it would damage his political chances." She accepted. "I needed the money," she said.
After becoming an American citizen, Mr. Papandreou joined the Navy for two years of wartime service, much of which he spent as a clerk in the Bethesda Naval Hospital. When World War II ended, he started his career as a lecturer in economics, first at Harvard, then at the University of Minnesota and Northwestern University. He eventually became a professor and the chairman of the department of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, until he resigned in 1963.
Meanwhile he had met Margaret Chant, of Elmhurst, Ill., a former journalism student. After both obtained divorces, they were married in Nevada in 1951. They settled down in Berkeley, raised three sons and a daughter and became actively involved in liberal American politics.
It was with the help of American funds that Mr. Papandreou returned to Greece. Supported by Guggenheim and Fulbright grants, he spent 1959 studying the Greek economy. He went to Athens again in 1961 to set up the Center for Economic Research, this time with financing from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.
He handed back his American citizenship in 1964 to run for Parliament under the auspices of his father, the Prime Minister. Later that year his father named him Deputy Minister of Economics.
But King Constantine, who distrusted both men, dismissed the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The period of instability that followed led to a right-wing military coup in 1967, and both Papandreous were arrested. The younger man was kept in solitary confinement for eight months.
Again the United States loomed large. Pressure from influential Americans, including the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, led the military junta to release Andreas Papandreou and other political prisoners in 1967. But from his exile, first in Sweden, then in Canada, Mr. Papandreou organized a coalition of opposition groups and denounced the American Government for "complicity" in the military coup. He remained convinced that Washington quietly supported the 1968-74 military dictatorship.
In a 1972 article in The New York Times, he wrote that the United States approved prime ministers, interfered in elections and in military promotions and "controlled the Greek Intelligence Service."
In 1974, when Greece was traumatized by Turkey's invasion of Northern Cyprus, he and many others were convinced once again that Washington knew about the Turkish military plans and could have stopped them. The belief that in general Washington favored Turkey over Greece in their perennial squabbling fed more anti-Americanism.
The party he founded in 1974, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, changed Greece's political landscape. It brought him -- and the left -- to power in 1981. Describing himself as a "non-dogmatic Marxist" he quickly introduced social reforms that benefited low-income groups, promoted workers' councils and farmers' cooperatives, abolished censorship and lowered the voting age to 18; prompted by his American wife, he brought legal equality for women.
As soon as he took office after the 1981 elections, Mr. Papandreou tweaked the West by opening a Greek Embassy in Cuba and granting diplomatic status to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Behind his neutralist gestures, Mr. Papandreou's foreign policy was cautious, almost conservative. He kept Greece in NATO, but refused to take part in some exercises. He preserved Greece's membership in the European Union, thus obtaining important agricultural subsidies. But he also gave Washington what it had not been able to obtain from his right-wing predecessor: a five-year renewable agreement to retain four military bases and a number of smaller installations on Greek soil.
At home, many Greeks applauded him because he established civil marriage and legalized divorce and abortion. But his economic policy remained so full of contradictions that no one quite knew where he stood, and critics said that he squandered the power and the funds he had to modernize the country.
For all his calls for change and the generous funds from the European Union, Greece remains the Union's poorest nation. Of the $12 billion the Community lent Mr. Papandreou in the 1980's to modernize, diplomats in Brussels said, 80 percent was spent on consumption and salaries for political featherbedding.
As opposition leader and as Prime Minister, he lashed out against the corruption of his predecessors, but his own government unraveled in the late 80's in a series of scandals involving fraud and phone-tapping.
His prestige also suffered because he publicly flaunted his affair with Dimitra Liani, a flight attendant half his age, while he was still married to his wife of 38 years. After humiliating publicity, Margaret Papandreou, the mother of his four adult children, agreed to a divorce in 1989.
By late 1989, he could no longer withstand the cascade of scandals and he lost the elections. Parliament indicted Mr. Papandreou and ordered him and four of his former ministers to stand trial on charges including bribery and embezzlement. He repeatedly protested his innocence, saying that American agents were trying to "destabilize" Greece and that his political opponents were out to destroy him politically.
Mr. Papandreou was narrowly acquitted in 1992, but two of his ministers were convicted.
Yet on Oct. 10, 1993, Mr. Papandreou made an astonishing comeback. Even though he had had a heart operation; taken Ms. Liani, his mistress, as his third wife; built a mansion costing more than $1 million, and never quite shaken off corruption charges, he won election for the third time.
This was perhaps his most remarkable trait, the ability to change position and survive scandal and even indictment without loosing popularity.
"He was an amazing politician," said Nicholas Gage, author of several books on Greece and a former New York Times correspondent there. "He made ordinary people feel they mattered. Above all he was a master at tapping the mood of the moment and at adapting his views to that. Basically, he was politically amoral."
Behind his charm, there was also a man known for being autocratic and wanting total control.
Epiminondas Zafiropoulos, an opponent and member of the 1989 parliamentary investigation into Mr. Papandreou's conduct, said the leader was essentially "an insecure man" who "wanted to be the master of all the games."
During his 10 years in office, he modernized Greece, but not enough to pull it from the doldrums. Rather than cutting back the country's enormous and rigid bureaucracy, he bloated to capture votes. Although Mr. Papandreou inherited a patronage system where a politician is expected to provide a job for every supporter, many economists agree that he did little to change this; some say he expanded it.
Some of Mr. Papandreou's supporters believe that his successes and his strong leadership in balancing an unruly society have been unfairly overshadowed by his governments' financial scandals and by troubles involving his wives.
Although extra-marital affairs are common in Greek politics, Mr. Papandreou broke the rules by publicly displaying his liaison with Ms. Liani. Greek women, in particular, did not pardon this affront to his wife, a strong voice for social reform and women's rights.
In 1995, he was relentlessly criticized by supporters and opponents for naming his new wife director of his office and giving her much power over access to him. He caused further outcry by saying he would support her if she had political ambitions.
The fallout was intense. One result was that his longtime ally, George Kouris, publisher of the newspaper Avriani, staged a smear campaign and regularly published nude pictures of a young Ms. Liani, hoping to undermine the Prime Minister and to block Ms. Liani's political career.
Last year, friends said, even as his health was waning, Mr. Papandreou aspired to become President -- a largely ceremonial post -- when Constantine Karamanlis's term expired in May. But the struggle to succeed Mr. Papandreou as party and Government leader was so fierce that he reportedly feared a breakup of the party and renounced his aspiration.
Over the years, he published a number of articles and books on economic and political themes, including the succesful "Democracy at Gunpoint" and "Paternalistic Capitalism."
In addition to his wife, Ms. Liani, he is survived by his four children from his second marriage, to Margaret Chant: George, who is Greece's Minister of Education, Sophia, Nicholas and Andreas.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Is Burning

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger; Paul Goldberger is the chief cultural correspondent for The Times. His most recent article for the Magazine, about Jerusalem, appeared in September.

 BODY:
The real question is whether Atlanta sold its Southern soul to get where it is, or whether it had one in the first place. Forget Tara. Atlanta is what you would have if Detroit got its act together.
The reality of Atlanta is that it has become the ultimate American city, born of a marriage of outsize boosterism and hard-nosed business. It may be in Georgia, but with every passing day it is less and less of Georgia. The Atlanta that is about to become the most watched city in the world, as 1.4 million athletes, spectators and journalists descend on it for the 1996 Olympic Games, is a place that has invented itself in what can only be called a stunning combination of civic determination and public relations hype. The city has trained for this moment in its history with as much focus, and as much tenacity, as any athlete has prepared for the Games. 
 Only one aspect of Atlanta is truly Southern, and that is its ability to sugarcoat its ambition: Atlanta has manners, unlike, say, Houston, which was the last American city to try to vault from regional city to international metropolis on the strength of its own ambition. But Atlanta is less brazen, and determined not to fall on its face the way Houston did when the oil economy collapsed. This city is not above trying to charm its way into the circle of major cities -- but builds a mass-transit system and one of the world's biggest airports, just in case. Atlantans see the Olympics much less as a chance to make money, as Los Angeles did in 1984, than as a sign from the rest of the world that their city has been accepted into the fraternity of big-time urbs.
"How did we get the Olympics? Confidence and salesmanship -- after all, it's not like we had great architecture and the Mediterranean," says Joel Babbit, an advertising agency head who once served as the city's chief of marketing -- a title that in itself says something about Atlanta's priorities -- under Mayor Maynard H. Jackson. "We have always marketed this city like a product. Atlanta's business is self-promotion. We have always sold first, then kept the promises afterward."
Assertiveness, of course, is only one quality of great international cities. It's a precondition, necessary but not sufficient. Truly great cities possess not only ambition and money but also a kind of energy that has nothing whatsoever to do with business. Every great city has an ineffable style, a sense of a physical presence that is very much its own, which joins with its cultural ambitions to make the place sizzle. The greatest cities in the world have the ability to create culture and not just consume it -- and if that makes daily life a little more difficult, well, the success of these cities is based on the belief that the trade-off is worth it. That's why Barcelona and Berlin and Los Angeles are greater cities than Frankfurt and Dallas and Denver, which for all their economic might are really just big business centers.
So far, for all its success, Atlanta is still firmly in the latter category -- a great place to do business rather than a great city of the world. Atlanta sprawls, and its downtown, for all its gleaming skyscrapers, seems less and less of an urban nexus than a kind of weak center surrounded by ring upon ring of suburban development. True, downtown has the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, organized around King's tomb and nearby birthplace, and CNN Center, the Cable News Network's headquarters (tours offered daily). But the place that really seems to dazzle the tourists is World of Coca-Cola, a mini theme park in which visitors can spend $4.50 to explore what is really no more than a three-story commercial for Atlanta's richest corporate citizen: not exactly high culture.
The next decade will tell whether Atlanta, having successfully elbowed its way into the company of great marketplaces, can make it all the way into the club of great cities. It's hard not to think of the city as organized for convention-goers as much as for international travelers, as a business center whose best product is ease -- of access, of operation, of living. Nothing to laugh at, particularly given the quality of life in most American cities. But those qualities don't make a place into Barcelona, however well it sells itself.
Modern Atlanta has been shaped by corporate power since the 1920's, when Robert Woodruff of Coca-Cola first put together the coalition of businessmen and politicians that has governed the city ever since. Woodruff believed that a corporate agenda and a civic agenda were much the same thing, and that joining the two would somehow make it possible for Atlanta to preserve a sense of community that was felt to be Southern and to transcend the limitations of the South at the same time: Southern charm mixed with Northern aggressiveness, you might call it. It is a belief that Mayors like William B. Hartsfield, Ivan Allen Jr., Maynard H. Jackson and Andrew Young, each a powerful personality in his own right, have deferred to.
Middle-class Atlantans worship at different churches, but the Chamber of Commerce is sacred to all. This attitude has worked wonders in selling the city as a kind of middle-class dream, a place where the good life can be lived by anyone, white or black, who makes a decent living. It doesn't hurt, of course, that the city's climate and scenery are far above the norm: Atlanta is 1,050 feet above sea level, higher than any other major city besides Denver; it was once entirely forested and still has a dense green blanketing most of its neighborhoods, a color broken only by the white and pink blossoms of the dogwoods that make many of the city's residential streets look like botanic gardens for the long and early spring that follows each year's mild winter.
Downtown Atlanta, though it struggles for dominance with the growing clusters of office towers outside of town, has a stunning skyline, its pointy-topped skyscrapers as gleaming a sign of 80's prosperity as those of any city in the country. Most of it is second-rate post-modernism, to be sure, although there are a handful of first-class buildings, like Philip Johnson and John Burgee's I.B.M. Building, a sumptuous tower of granite that won the admiration of critics when it was finished in 1987 and then, in true Atlanta fashion, spawned several nearby imitations.
But it is the work of John Portman, the architect and developer whose Hyatt Regency Atlanta Hotel downtown was completed in 1967, that made Atlanta architecture -- and Portman -- famous around the world. The Hyatt revolutionized hotel construction with its atrium and glass elevators, and its success inspired Portman to go on to build Peachtree Center, a multi-tower grouping that brought tremendous activity to downtown, but all of it, unfortunately, indoors and off the city streets. Portman saw his mission as making the city safe and palatable for the middle class, and he did so almost too well, for he filled Atlanta with buildings that brought a kind of suburban mall mentality to the center of downtown.
It seems right that Atlanta was the birthplace of a whole generation of urban buildings that turn inward, as malls do. This is a city in which the suburban sensibility predominates, a city in which making daily life feel smooth is generally a first priority, and where people are most comfortable sticking with their own. Atlanta strives to provide modest doses of visual stimulation, cultural activity and urban energy but is careful not to let things get out of hand, as if it feared that too much culture and energy could turn the place into New York or Los Angeles, something few Atlantans could abide: these cities are harsh, something Atlanta never wants to be. When it comes to a choice between dogwoods outside the window or a good symphony downtown -- well, sophisticated Atlantans would like to have both, but if forced to choose, there would be no contest.
Historically, Atlanta never did have much to sell, other than itself: it didn't even have a normal reason for being, since it started not as a trading settlement or a harbor or a factory town but as the end point of the Western and Atlantic Railroad's new lines in 1837. (The city's original name was Terminus.) Its arbitrary location in the middle of the forests of northern Georgia seems oddly fitting now, in an age in which technology makes it possible to conduct almost any business from almost anywhere and location becomes a matter of choice. For as cities located the old-fashioned way, on rivers and in natural harbors or valleys, struggle to survive, the capriciously sited Atlanta booms.
Atlanta grew mighty as a transportation hub, a banking center and the headquarters of the corporation that grew up around the city's most potent invention, Coca-Cola, first served in an Atlanta drugstore in 1886. Yet today the city is at least as well known for being the headquarters of CNN. Since its founding in 1980, CNN has beamed the name Atlanta 24 hours a day onto television screens around the world, proving that a media center can be wherever someone -- in this case Ted Turner -- declares it to be. A generation ago it would have been unthinkable for a media venture as ambitious as CNN to have started outside New York or Los Angeles, if only for credibility. Today this hardly matters, and CNN, far from needing credibility from New York, confers it on Atlanta.
Atlantans are fond of comparing their city with Birmingham, Ala., just 135 miles west, and the comparison tells much. As late as World War II, the cities were roughly equal in size and economic strength. In the view of Atlantans, it is their pragmatism, their commitment to business and their willingness to open their city to outsiders that caused their economy to take off like a rocket, leaving Birmingham in a strife-filled dust. While Birmingham protected its insularity, Atlanta was trying to build the airport that eventually became the world's second-busiest and would turn the city into a transportation hub with few equals in the world. And while Birmingham was putting all of its resources into a violent fight against integration, Atlanta was putting together a coalition of business and civil rights leaders to oversee peaceful desegregation of its public accommodations.
"Atlanta always said, we will be different, we won't make the same mistakes as other cities," says Maynard H. Jackson, the city's first black Mayor. "When Birmingham had fire hoses and cattle prods in the street, Atlanta went to the bargaining table. We knew that cattle prods are bad for business."
In Atlanta, appearances have always counted for more than ideology -- which is why, for much of the city's business community, integration was less a moral issue than one of sheer pragmatism. Boycotts, riots and demonstrations meant lost business, cost money and made the city look ridiculous. Atlantans knew in the 1960's what the rest of the nation thought of places like Selma, Ala., and Birmingham, and even those with a private preference for segregation bit their tongues rather than see their city held up to national ridicule. The Atlanta way was to keep things quiet and trust in appearances.
Not that civil rights in Atlanta has been only a matter of appearances. The city's commitment to using business as a vehicle for social progress has made it something of a national showcase for affirmative action, an effort that began in the mid-1970's, when Mayor Jackson insisted that contractors building Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport take on minority partners. The Olympic procurement contracts, worth $387 million, have been viewed as Atlanta's biggest affirmative action opportunity of all: at the insistence of city leaders, 35 percent of the construction contracts have gone to minority companies, which have helped design and build virtually every Olympic structure.
And yet, while its political and commercial worlds have been gradually integrated over the last generation, Atlanta remains almost entirely segregated socially. Its neighborhoods are almost all either black or white; blacks meet whites at large public functions but only rarely in smaller, more intimate settings.
Neighborhoods like the Cascades, a tree-filled cluster of grandiose mock-Georgian villas and French Provincial chateaus on the South Side, are occupied almost entirely by prosperous blacks. While their haute-suburban luxe stands as a reminder of the economic opportunities Atlanta has afforded African-Americans, these neighborhoods underline the fact that Atlanta, for all its vaunted racial progress, remains a bastion of segregation. And the city's poorer neighborhoods, needless to say, are no more integrated. Residents of the Cascades do not have to look at the South Bronx or the South Side of Chicago to know how far they are from poverty; traveling a mile or so down Martin Luther King Jr. Drive will show them just as much urban despair.
Segregation has always been the rule in Atlanta. True, the city points with well-deserved pride at the size and strength of its black middle class, buttressed not only by a strong economy but also by Atlanta's position as the historical center of black higher education, with six colleges guaranteeing a continual flow of educated, middle-class blacks into the city's job pool. Yet white Atlantans historically were so determined to separate themselves from their black neighbors that most of the long north-south streets running through the city were given different names as they crossed the border from black to white areas, lest there be any confusion as to where they were. After all, it would never do for a white family to have an address on Moreland Avenue; it had to be Briarcliff Road.
Interstate 85, the main north-south route, was laid out to take a wide loop around the east side of downtown, a circuitous route that effectively separated the business district from the black neighborhood to the east. There were no black policemen in Atlanta until 1947, and even then, the first cadre of black officers were required to restrict their patrols to black neighborhoods and to change in the basement of the YMCA so as not to integrate the locker room of Police Headquarters. (The city's current Police Chief, Beverly Harvard, is a black woman.)
And blacks were no more welcome at public events in Atlanta than elsewhere in the South. One of the city's proudest celebrations, the premiere of "Gone With the Wind," in December 1939, attracted cast members like Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland -- but not Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen, who were emphatically not invited to the segregated event. As late as 1964, when Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize, the city was in a tizzy over a proposal that Atlanta pay him tribute at an interracial dinner in one of the city's major hotels; it was only after Robert Woodruff, the longtime chairman of Coca-Cola and the dean of the city's business community, sent word of his approval that tickets for the event began to sell.
Gary M. Pomerantz, a reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, summed up the situation in postwar Atlanta in his book "Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn": "A fast tempo in business in Atlanta was considered a godsend. But in race relations, it was not."
Those days are long gone. Yet the Olympics, for all the success of affirmative action, have not brought Atlanta to an era of complete racial good will. Most events will be concentrated downtown, which ought to be a good antidote, symbolically at least, to the city's increasing sprawl, but the downtown focus has caused new tensions with the city's poorer residents. While Olympic planning has brought splendid cosmetic improvements to some of the residential neighborhoods, most of the improvements have been directed toward soothing the eyes of visitors -- making sure, for example, that as tourists walk from stops on Marta, the city's transit system, to the Olympic gyms and stadiums, they will see trees, new street lighting, small parks and elegantly paved sidewalks instead of decrepit streets and rubble-strewn vacant lots. To some critics, this amounts to little more than an attempt to hide the city's poverty from public view during the Olympic festivities.
Empty the Shelters, a local advocacy group for the homeless, has claimed that 1,676 families have been displaced from public housing around the city to make way for the Olympics. The group has tried in proper Atlanta fashion to make its case in the form of a catchy public relations campaign, built around a sour-faced cartoon character, Spoilsport, a female response to Izzy, the city's saccharine Olympic mascot. Spoilsport has written a short, dyspeptic guidebook to the city that is nothing if not a counterpoint to the rest of the city's relentless boosterism. "Atlanta, known as 'the city too busy to hate,' might more aptly be called 'the city too busy to care,' " snarls the guide. There is little evidence that anyone pays Spoilsport much attention.
Where have the displaced residents gone? Not to other housing in downtown Atlanta. While there has been much talk for years about building new housing downtown, relatively little of it has actually gone ahead, even with the Olympic boost; the 2,000 units in the Olympic Village, which have been built to house Olympic athletes, will become dorm space for Georgia State University after the Games, not housing for Atlanta residents. In April, Spoilsport's creators gave their Big Boot Award to Mayor Bill Campbell, calling him "the individual who has demonstrated outstanding performance in the field of displacing and removing Atlanta's poor residents, in an attempt to hide the face of poverty in our Olympic city."
People who can afford it, both white and black, have increasingly fled to the suburbs, pushing the borders of the booming Atlanta metropolitan region farther and farther out, and separating themselves not only more and more from the city's old downtown but also from any sense of responsibility for its future. Paradoxically, the area is full of people who eagerly describe themselves as coming from Atlanta when they are far from home; once back, however, they think of themselves as residents of Sandy Springs or Roswell, with barely more feeling of connection to Atlanta than to Savannah. The city's "urban fabric," such as it is, consists increasingly of new office buildings, shopping malls and hotels out on the interstate, miles and miles from the city center.
The problem of conflict between Atlanta and its surroundings is getting worse, not better: when the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, one of the first major corporations to ride the Atlanta boom, relocated its headquarters from Portland, Ore., in 1982, it built a huge granite skyscraper near Five Points, the historic center of Atlanta's downtown. But the biggest corporate move of the last few years was made by the United Parcel Service, which told the world it was giving up Greenwich, Conn., for Atlanta but actually set up shop on a huge, wooded campus 12 miles away in Perimeter Center. For all its fabled success, the city is now looking more and more like the hole in the center of a doughnut, facing the same battles with its surroundings that embitter other large metropolitan areas.
That's much more than an issue of black versus white, though, since as more and more blacks have achieved middle-class prosperity, they have chosen, like whites, to slip across the border. Living in the Cascades in the far southwest corner of town may be a shining example of black success, but huge numbers of Atlanta's prosperous blacks now live beyond the city limits altogether and have become a part of the suburban constituency. The city's historic black centers -- Auburn Avenue on the East Side (the "Sweet Auburn" of Atlanta lore) and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive near the black colleges on the West Side -- increasingly have the kind of relationship to the African-American community that Little Italy in New York has to prosperous Italian-Americans living on Long Island.
The disappearance of the center of the city will be the issue as Atlanta faces its future after the Olympics. There is now a proposal to build a second ring road, even farther out than I-285, the beltway that Atlantans call the perimeter but that increasingly feels like the center. "If that road gets built, Atlanta will sprawl all the way to Chattanooga in one direction and the Atlantic Ocean in the other," says Michael Lomax, a former chairman of the Fulton County board of commissioners whose hopes of becoming Mayor were dashed by Maynard H. Jackson's decision to attempt a return to office in 1989. "The region is pushing another perimeter road, which will make this place more like Southern California. Will we be willing to invest in more mass transit so we can be a well-planned city around a central core? Unlikely."
Lomax is black and hard-edged; Leon Eplan, who as Mayor Jackson's budget and planning commissioner oversaw much of the city's planning in the 1970's and returned to office as the city readied itself for the Olympics, is white, older and more connected to the city's old-style mentality. In his case, that translates into the belief that Atlanta can still turn itself, physically at least, into a viable urban center and moreover, that it is on the verge of doing so. His vision of urban greatness is not an Atlanta built on the model of Los Angeles but a cosmopolitan city, almost European in its character.
"The 20th-century automobile city isn't working, and I'm convinced that major transportation for the 21st century will be rail," Eplan says. "I'm convinced that all of north Georgia will converge back again on the central city. It is exciting to be here now -- it feels like Chicago must have felt in 1893, with the World's Fair laying the groundwork for a great city of the 20th century. Well, with the Olympics, we are doing it for the 21st."
Trish Deb, a spokeswoman for Empty the Shelters, says: "The problem with Atlanta is that the corporate agenda has replaced a civic agenda. Atlanta has turned over its power to a coalition of corporations." Deb misses the fact that this is how business has always been done here: indeed, it was Robert Woodruff's notion that a corporation's goal was to convince the city that its interests were the city's own. Community service of an old-fashioned sort is somewhere next to godliness here.
But can business leaders themselves make a world-class city? They have never done so anywhere else -- it takes the money and ambition of business people, combined with the vitality (and often the contrariness) of a potent cultural community. And while no one should underestimate the effect of CNN and a slew of universities on the cultural fabric of Atlanta, this is still in every way a community driven by business, not by culture: a city still mainly attuned to bringing the good life to suburban middle managers and convention-goers.
Livability is not to be sneezed at, but urban greatness often coexists more comfortably with friction. Atlanta's success at making life smooth for the middle class may, paradoxically, be something that holds it back from the top tier of cities, rather than pushes it forward. The problem of Atlanta may not be that it is too difficult but that it is too easy.

HEADLINE: An Anglo-French Corner of Quebec

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BEESON; PATRICIA BEESON is a writer who lives in Toronto.

 BODY:
ESTRIE, meaning kingdom of the east, is the official French-Canadian name bestowed in 1981 on the Eastern Townships region in southeastern Quebec. About the size of Massachusetts, it lies roughly, west and east, between the Richelieu and Chaudiere Rivers and, north and south, between the former seigneuries (feudal domains once owned by French nobles) along the St. Lawrence River, and the northernmost New England states.
Late last spring, my husband and I drove east from Toronto to North Hatley, our favorite village in Estrie. The land had emerged from the long Quebec winter with an almost audible sigh of relief. There were still a few patches of snow on the high hills, the most northerly outcrops of the Appalachians, and the winter winds had worn thin the paint on some of the clapboard farms. We looked forward to a long weekend sampling some of the places to stay in the region, including Manoir Hovey, a lakeside hotel with lovely gardens, and two bed and breakfasts -- the chic La Raveaudiere and the folksy Cedar Gables. 
As we approached La Raveaudiere, we drove through landscape that reminded us of Vermont, its wooded hills, lakes and meadows. Indeed, most of the area's earliest settlers were Americans loyal to the British crown who entered the Eastern Townships over the Vermont, Maine or New Hampshire borders after the Revolutionary War. They were followed, in the early 1800's, by a large wave of British, and a distinctive Anglophone region developed within the French-speaking province.
But around the 1850's, economic forces -- the overflowing farms of the seigneuries, the need for labor in the lumber industries and the construction of a railway from Montreal -- brought in French-Canadians, who today constitute 90 percent of the population in Estrie.
North Hatley, on Lake Massawippi about 30 miles north of the Canadian border, is still something of an English holdout. But it too is changing; Anglophones now represent only a little more than half of the community.
La Raveaudiere, an elegant bed-and-breakfast up the hill from the long and narrow lake, is owned by two French Canadians. Our room was one of three on the third (top) floor, with sloping ceilings, bathrooms and air-conditioning. Of the four bedrooms on the second floor, all with private bathrooms, one is air-conditioned and three have large handsome overhead fans. Our room, with its pale honey walls, green-painted floor and fresh flowery fabrics, looked out toward both golf course and garden.
In the living room we found glasses and bottles of port and sherry on a small table. Magazines were invitingly heaped on the floor next to big sofas set into a large bay of windows overlooking the garden. We gravitated into the bar, at one end of a long fir-green room, which was also the elegant kitchen when we last visited.
Since then a new kitchen has been built from the former laundry room, and the old kitchen has been transformed into a dining room where the owners, Serge Raveau and Simon Marcil, now serve northern Italian food to their guests. Friendly and chatty with guests inclined to talk, our hosts seemed pleased at our interest in their eclectic array of paintings.
At the back of the house is a brick-paved terrace, where breakfast is served in summer. The mornings were still cool when we were there, so we ate breakfast -- eggs, croissants and fresh fruit salad -- indoors.
There's a lot of cool weather in Estrie, which really has only three seasons: a long winter, a mere passing sigh of a spring as the land leapfrogs into summer, then, usually, a lovely and lingering fall. In late spring and summer, the Pilsen Restaurant and Pub in North Hatley is filled with a high-spirited crowd that spills out onto its long river-level veranda, a congenial gathering place with geranium-filled window boxes and red-and-white-striped umbrellas.
Set beside the bridge over the Massawippi River, which flows out the pointed north end of the lake, the restaurant, at street level, was jammed by 7 P.M., so we descended to the pub, where the young staff switched seamlessly from one language to the other, bustling to and fro with immense plates of breaded chicken or hamburgers nesting on mountains of chips. Upstairs the food has more pretensions, but was still good pub fare and very reasonable. The chef's special -- veal, walnuts and apples, assorted vegetables and french fries or rice, followed by chocolate cheesecake with raspberry coulis -- came to $38 for the two of us, coffee and a half-liter of wine included.
The Massawippi River, which we could see from our table, splits North Hatley into two. East of it are most of the village's few shops and behind them, some handsome 19th-century houses climb up the hill toward La Raveaudiere. To the west, hugging the lake, is the lion's share of the most affluent homes -- rambling clapboard or shingled residences. There, too, are its two distinguished hotels, Manoir Hovey and the Auberge Hatley (formerly called Hovey Manor and Hatley Inn till Quebec law ruled all signs must be in French).
From the veranda of the Auberge Hatley -- one of only four hotels in Quebec to be members of Relais and Chateaux -- we could just see the lake below the lawns and trees of the hotel's perfect garden and turquoise pool. We had dinner in the tranquil, split-level pink and green dining room overlooking the garden. We began with a little entree of goat cheese, shrimp and slivers of salmon, with a green sauce of arugula and watercress -- a visual delight, which delivered what it promised. This was followed by the tenderest slices of pork and spinach, with a little cake of potatoes served separately. For dessert, my husband enjoyed a glorious chocolate confection.
After coffee, we asked Vincent Chabert, the maitre d'hotel from Grenoble, France, to show us some of the 25 guest rooms. Still calm and attentive after a long day, he gave every appearance of pleasure in doing so. Each of the four rooms we saw was different, fresh with stylish fabrics and paintwork -- one in shades of terra cotta and tobacco, with glossy white woodwork and striped fabrics, another in a flowered deep blue and white. Liliane and Robert Gagnon, the owners, are largely responsible for the interiors, which along with the service and cuisine attract Canadians of both tongues, as well as guests from Europe and the United States.
Americans have summered in North Hatley for a very long time. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, wealthy Southern families, who had formerly escaped the heat in New England's resort areas, passed by the lands of their erstwhile adversaries and went farther north to Canada.
The first to "summer over" in North Hatley is reputed to have been a Dr. Powhatan Clarke, from Baltimore, who, traveling north with his family in 1886 on the new spur line from Newport, Vt., to Lennoxville, Quebec, fell in love with Lake Massawippi when he saw it out the window. Many of these wealthy summer visitors built imposing houses around the lake, some echoing the architecture of the South.
ONE of these, then known as the Birches, is now the Manoir Hovey. It was built in 1900 by Harry Atkinson, owner of Georgia Power in Atlanta, in imitation of Mount Vernon, on a handsome property bordering the lake. Manoir Hovey still feels like a substantial country home. The house, with its brimming flower beds, pool and pillared front, looks out onto the lake and the garden.
In addition to the rooms in the main building, the hotel has turned several of Atkinson's former outbuildings and staff quarters into appealing guest accommodations, creating a total of 35 rooms. Our room was on the second floor of one of these outbuildings, with latticed paper, white wrought iron beds and flowered fabrics. But, while the staff is obliging and diligent and the meals excellent, the country house decor in the main building, including the dining room and adjacent book-lined library, has a disappointingly tired air.
About half way between Manoir Hovey and the village center is Cedar Gables, a bed and breakfast overlooking the lake owned by Ann and Don Fleischer, longtime expatriates from Ohio. Ann spins, and Don's home-brewed beers and wines are much esteemed. The five rooms are clean but no effort had been made at color coordination, and the walls over our bed were filled with family photographs in a way that made us feel somewhat intrusive. But the good-heart edness of the Fleischers has enthusiastic fans, evident from their guest book, and our $68-a-night room price included a substantial breakfast, complete with home-baked muffins and jams.
About 25 miles south of North Hatley on the east shore of Lake Memphremagog is the delightful small village of Georgeville, where the Anglophone presence seems, to an outsider anyway, little diminished. A small old hillside graveyard is full of Murrays and Bullocks and Perkinses going back to the late 18th century. Down the steep hill past the pink and white Auberge Georgeville and the immaculate oxblood-red Murray Memorial Center is a grassy square flanked by houses straight out of Woodstock. And the jolly people lunching on Maison McGowan's informal little terrace were almost exclusively English-speaking.
A plain turn-of-the century fishermen's inn, Maison McGowan is set on the east shore of the 27-mile-long, narrow Lake Memphremagog, which extends south into Vermont. Immediately in front of the 12-room inn are the pier and boat slip, where we watched small boat launchings and the arrivals and departures of the local scuba diving center. Our simple lunch of chicken salad was good, as was the tempting selection of desserts, and the staff very agreeable and friendly. The crowd on the terrace was mainly older, with casual straw hats, assured tones and clothes of faded khaki and denim.
Outward appearances in Estrie may suggest New England. But this is not New England. It's certainly not Ontario either, the nearest Anglo province, nor even the Quebec beyond its boundaries. Trying to define it, the Quebec Government guide book describes it as being "a celebration of bicultural existence possessing a discreet Anglo-Saxon charm blended with 'quebecoise' joie de vivre."

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
A Neglected Corner Of Picasso's Legacy

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
"TO MAKE A DOVE, YOU must first wring its neck," Pablo Picasso once said, explaining how he shaped clay into some of the most memorable ceramics of the 20th century.
Picasso produced several thousand pieces of pottery over the last four decades of his life. Among them were vases that look like fat owls or voluptuous women and pitchers, plates and tiles painted with fauns, radiating suns, bullfights and men's portraits. 
 Though Picasso's ceramics represent a rich artistic legacy, they are among the least known of his works, for a very simple reason: he kept most of them in his own collection. Vases and bowls were piled on the floors, around the fireplaces and on mantels and table tops in his home and studio in the South of France. Photographs from the 1950's show Picasso in a cavelike room surrounded by the great variety of ceramics he produced at the Madoura pottery workshop in Vallauris, near Antibes.
Picasso's ceramics are more complex in their forms and decoration than the thousands of reproductions that were made with his authorization by Madoura's potters and painters. There are other differences. The original ceramics are dated but not signed; the reproductions, in contrast, are sometimes numbered and always stamped with "Edition Picasso, Madoura," "d'apres Picasso, Madoura" or the like.
At his death at 91 in 1973, Picasso owned 3,222 pieces of pottery. For years, some of the artist's ceramics have been on view at the Picasso Museum in Antibes. But once his estate was dispersed, under the direction of the French Government, to museums and to heirs, the ceramics were exhibited beyond the Vallauris area. In 1980, 12 pieces were exhibited with his paintings and sculpture in "Pablo Picasso: A Retrospective" at the Museum of Modern Art. Larger selections were displayed at the Picasso Museum in Paris after it opened in 1985.
Now, some of the artist's favorite ceramics are on view in the first exhibition of his pottery in the United States, "Pablo Picasso -- Unique Ceramics," at the Hammer Galleries on 57th Street west of Fifth Avenue, through July 26. (It will be at the Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, L.I., in November.)
The show consists of 45 ceramics made between 1948 and 1969. Etienne Sassi, an art dealer in Paris and Vallauris, bought most of the pieces in 1989 from the estate of Picasso's widow, Jacqueline Roque Picasso. He and his brother, Dominique, were childhood friends of Jacqueline's daughter, Catherine Hutin-Blay. "Her house was just two blocks from ours in Juan les Pins," Mr. Sassi said. Dominique Sassi, a master painter at Madoura in the 1950's and 60's who decorated the Picasso reproductions, also knew Jacqueline when she was a saleswoman at Madoura, before she married Picasso.
Mr. Sassi had the ceramics hung unconventionally in roughly carved picture frames in the Spanish style. The frames are included in the prices for the ceramics; two works on tile, for example, range from $38,000 for an image of a faun's head to $1.8 million for a still life of a vase of flowers.
The show includes examples of most of the themes -- animals, portraits, bullfights and still lifes -- that Picasso returned to again and again in his ceramics. He began working in clay in 1946 when he visited Madoura and took delight in creating clay figures of animals and people. When he returned a year later, he brought sketches of the pieces he wanted to make. As his friendship with Georges and Suzanne Ramie, the owners of Madoura, grew, Picasso continued to have his works fired there, even after he moved 20 miles away to Cannes in the late 1960's.
PICASSO SINGLEHANDEDLY revived the moribund ceramics industry in Vallauris, an activity that had been a mainstay of the local economy for 800 years. Defying all conventions of the craft, Picasso handled clay in ways professionals discouraged, twisting and pulling jugs and pitchers into anthropomorphic shapes and pinching the center of a vase to create the wasp waist of a woman. The fresh approaches he took brought new energy to the craft. And he encouraged other artists to work in pottery, which he viewed as a medium that combined sculpture and painting.
Some of the pieces on view display the wit for which Picasso was known. The image of a tall thin man in a bicorn hat astride a horse confronting a bull is painted on a shaving plate that is pierced with two holes. The work is probably a visual pun on the story of Don Quixote who hung a shaving plate around his neck to serve as the breastplate of his suit of armor.
Several other works are embellished with bullfight scenes that appear to have been sketched quickly by the artist. A more unusual study of an artist in his studio is boldly drawn in black on a white pitcher. On one side the artist is painting a nude model; on the other he is sculpturing her. Painter and sculptor depicted on pottery? Perhaps it's another of his self-portraits.

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
Immigrants' Tales, in Subtle Shades of Gray

BYLINE: By Sanford J. Ungar; Sanford J. Ungar, dean of the School of Communication at American University in Washington, is the author of "Fresh Blood: The New American Immigrants."

 BODY:
SAM DEEDS, THE CRUSADING sheriff of Rio County, Texas, in the film "Lone Star," has crossed the border to investigate the death years ago of Eladio Cruz, a Mexican-American who used to smuggle friends into the United States by hiding them among the watermelons in his pickup truck.
In a sleazy town just inside Mexico, Sheriff Deeds encounters one Senor Montoya, "the tire king," a grizzly old cynic who lived north of the Rio Grande himself for 15 years. As they talk in the yard of his tire warehouse, Montoya takes a Coke bottle and draws a line in the gravel. He challenges Deeds to step across the line. 
 "A bird flying south, a rattlesnake," the tire king says to the earnest, somewhat tongue-tied sheriff, "you think he sees this line? You think halfway across that line they start thinking different? Why should a man?"
Deeds protests that the Mexican Government itself has often found the border to be a convenient device to define its authority. But Montoya is not impressed with the role of government on either side of the river. "I'm talking about people here!" he shouts. "Men!"
The confrontation becomes a galvanizing moment in "Lone Star," John Sayles's rich new border drama, which stars Chris Cooper as Sheriff Deeds, Elizabeth Pena, Kris Kristofferson, Matthew McConaughey and Frances McDormand. Trying to solve a complex mystery involving previous sheriffs, including his own father, Sam Deeds encounters the many forces that artificially divide people from one another.
In the film, which opened on Friday, we see old immigrants who express contempt for new immigrants, "Anglo" parents who resent a teacher's efforts to explain how the Texas settlers took land from the local Mexicans, politicians who prey on the public's fears to push construction of an unnecessary new county jail, and black people caught in the middle of it all. In this context, the border seems like just one more contrivance, albeit a uniquely symbolic one.
Mr. Sayles's latest movie is compelling for many reasons, but an important one is that it speaks honestly about immigration along our southern border. Until relatively recently, the Federal Government did not even count as immigrants the people who crossed that line -- or, for that matter, the northern one -- on foot. It was assumed there would be a continuous two-way flow, regulated by economic forces and the desire to unite families.
Even now, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's own estimates, fewer than half the illegal immigrants living in the United States crossed the Mexican border to get here. Most came by airplane on valid student or tourist visas and simply overstayed them. Yet the southern frontier is the primary theater of battle for the increasingly militarized struggle to control what has become known as the immigration "problem." It is the place Presidential candidates go to utter sound bites on the subject, the place the Government brandishes its new night-vision scopes and computers.
Thanks to Mr. Sayles and others, film has become one of the few places where one can
find reliable information about and meaningful insight into the immigrant experience. While politicians bash immigrants, film makers -- and novelists along with them -- tell us gripping immigrant stories, recording them before they disappear.
Immigration has long provided grist for movie makers, of course. During the silent era, humor was found in the antics of the awkward, newly arrived outsider. The 30's brought films like "Angels With Dirty Faces," about gangs of toughs, most of them Irish (who were themselves only emerging from pariah status). By 1961, a gang of Puerto Rican immigrants could be found duking it out with the home-grown variety in the movie "West Side Story."
Many films about Jewish families, including Barry Levinson's "Avalon" and Paul Mazursky's "Enemies: A Love Story," based on a novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer, have been grounded in immigrant memories and behavior. And Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather" and its kin recorded the traditions of Italian family life even as they drew on the tribal rituals of the Mafia.
But in recent years the theme of immigration has been used in more explicit fashion and handled in a far more complex and subtle way. "Little Odessa," James Gray's 1995 film set in the Russian immigrant neighborhood of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, dealt with a Russian mob hitman and his family relationships.
In Mira Nair's 1992 film "Mississippi Masala," immigrant motelkeepers from India struggled to come to terms not only with Southern white power structure but also with the local black culture. In her 1994 film, "The Perez Family," Ms. Nair took up the strains between the old-line Cuban immigrant establishment in Miami and the Marielitos, who arrived in the 1980's to disturb their peace and prosperity.
Another film that expanded the view of the American immigrant experience was Wayne Wang's "Joy Luck Club," based on Amy Tan's best seller about four Chinese immigrant women and their assimilated daughters. Even Tom Cruise was thrust into the immigrant action in Ron Howard's "Far and Away," a 1992 epic that portrayed new arrivals from Ireland joining the western land rush in the 19th century.
From abroad, evocative films have also emerged: Hanif Kureishi's "My Beautiful Laundrette," about Pakistani immigrants in London, or Mathieu Kassovitz's "La Haine," about strife and social dislocation in the housing projects of suburban Paris, or Gianni Amelio's "Lamerica," about Albanians who long to migrate to Italy. From north of the border, Canada, comes "Double Happiness," Mina Sum's 1995 film about a Chinese girl who rebels against her traditionalist immigrant parents.
The proliferation of immigration-related films may reflect the banality of much of their competition as well as the desire of immigrants and their children to tell their family stories. But it is a relief to discover heroes and villains in the barrios and the ethnic enclaves instead of just on horseback, in nuclear-powered submarines, or in the courtroom and the war room (not to mention the newsroom).
One of the best of the recent crop is last year's "Mi Familia," the tangled tale of three generations in a Mexican immigrant family in Los Angeles, directed by Gregory Nava and narrated by Edward James Olmos, who also has a starring role.
THE FILM OFFERS AN alternative, if not revisionist, view of certain aspects of American history and values in the 20th century. When young, pregnant Maria Sanchez -- a United States citizen -- is picked up on a Los Angeles street in 1933 and deported by train to central Mexico without so much as a chance to go home and tell her husband and children, it is not mere movie-making hyperbole. It is precisely what happened to thousands of people during the Depression in Southern California and some northern cities.
Two years later, Mrs. Sanchez and Chucho, the son she was carrying in her womb when she was deported, return to California on foot. It seems only fitting that Chucho should grow up to tell his parents, in a moment of crisis over his drug-dealing, that "money is all they respect in this country, and they don't care how you get it." And with children who run the gamut from radical ex-nun to petty thief to rich lawyer, the Sanchez family finally seems about as American as apple pie -- and fajitas and bagels and pizza and egg rolls.
The paradox here may be that even as the restrictionists in Congress vote to enlarge the Border Patrol and cut back the access of legal immigrants and new citizens to Federal programs, we go to the movies to observe how hard immigrants actually work. As has been the case at many previous moments of economic uncertainty in American history, there is widespread popular support today for new controls on immigration, yet immigrants are as much in demand as ever.
The diligence of the immigrant in the face of frustration is the theme of "Nueba Yol" (1996), directed by Angel Muniz, about a confused Dominican's economic hardships and absurd experiences in New York City. The film, which stars Luisita Marti, a popular Dominican comedian, has been seen primarily so far in the Dominican Republic (the source of New York's largest community of new immigrants today) but is beginning to be more broadly distributed here.
Although many of the recent immigrant movies are steeped in sentiment, they remind us of the courage and fortitude required of immigrants both on their journeys and after they arrive. The films elaborate their joys and hardships in a way the public dialogue does not.
Yet another case in point is "Someone Else's America," by the Yugoslav director Goran Paskaljevic. Any congressman or senator tempted to vote for the latest restrictive "immigration reform" bill pending on Capitol Hill should spend 96 minutes watching Mr. Paskaljevic's film, which swept through European film festivals last year but got little attention in this country.
The director tells the story of Alonso, a legal immigrant from Spain, and his trusty sidekick Bayo, an illegal immigrant from Montenegro -- an odd couple if ever there was one.
Alonso (played by Tom Conti, who happens to be the son of Italian immigrants to Scotland) owns a bar in Brooklyn, where Bayo is allowed to sleep in return for cleaning up. When Bayo's elderly mother arrives in the United States after much stress and duress, she finds that America is not the promised land she expected. "I don't know how to live here," she complains. "It's someone else's country."
But true to form and tradition, it is one of Bayo's sons, a churlish but ambitious fellow, who makes the country his own. He masters English, turns Alonso's fading bar into a booming ethnic restaurant and marries a young Chinese-American from the neighborhood who was born in the United States. Thus he gets his green card.
Not everyone lives happily ever after in this film, but these immigrants work hard and take care of one another. The distinctions between legal and illegal, so critical in the political debate over immigration, become almost laughable.
"Someone Else's America" also helps us understand that the frenzy over multiculturalism and the effort to enshrine English as an "official language" are mere distractions from the long-term project of making this country work as what it has always been -- an ever-changing mix of people from everywhere else.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: $72 Million Renovation of Former Bloomingdale's;
For UConn in Stamford, a New Home

 BODY:
In the fall of 1997 the Stamford branch of the University of Connecticut will move from smaller quarters in the north end of the city to a prime downtown location in a former Bloomingdale's department store.
"It's going to be a tremendous improvement in our ability to serve the area," said Mark Swanson, director of UConn-Stamford. "It has been made clear to us that Fairfield County wants UConn to have an increased presence here." 
 A $72 million transformation of Bloomingdale's is under way, almost tripling UConn's size, from the current 55,000 square feet to 155,000 square feet.
The growth will permit a doubling of the present student body of 900 undergraduate and 480 graduate students.
The renovation will provide new amenities such as a conference center, fitness center, student lounges, food court and extensive computer networking.
Perkins Eastman Architects of Manhattan has designed a building with expanses of glass that Aaron B. Schwarz, a principal with the firm, described as "focused on linking a state-of-the-art university with the city."
"The three-story, glass-walled concourse along Broad Street will be open to the public," Mr. Schwarz said. "Videos will occasionally be beamed out to the street, and glass spines that cut diagonally through the building from roof to ground will admit light to all of the areas that it passes through."
Anticipation of the purchasing power of more than 2,500 students has awakened interest in a 106,000-square-foot parcel of vacant land opposite the former Bloomingdale's site on Broad Street.
"We could build up to 250,000 square feet of retail and commercial space there," said Tom Rich, a second-generation member of the Rich family, which redeveloped downtown Stamford 20 years ago.

WAKING THE TEMPESTS
Ordinary Life in the New Russia.
By Eleanor Randolph.
431 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $26.
WHAT Americans already think about Russia usually determines what they see there. Certainly this has been true of many American correspondents who have returned from their stays in Moscow to write books. 
 Eleanor Randolph is different. A former Moscow correspondent for The Washington Post and now a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, she has been careful not to judge the extraordinary changes she witnessed from 1991 to 1993 -- the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the introduction of economic shock therapy by President Boris Yeltsin -- through Western biases or cliches.
"Waking the Tempests" is a portrait of the ways in which ordinary Russians survived "as their government, economy and society changed virtually overnight." For two years Ms. Randolph traveled across Russia, from Moscow to the Arctic Circle, from the Far East to the southern farmlands, talking to people we don't usually hear from -- psychics and priests, ecologists and sexologists, mail-order brides, gay activists, pensioners, prosecutors, women entrepreneurs and preschool teachers. Through firsthand experiences, conversations and friendships, she captures the hopes, fears and general confusion of people who are being asked or compelled to enter a world of profound uncertainty. "Looking at the life rather than analyzing the system," Ms. Randolph believes, is "one of the few ways to gauge the enormity of what happened in Russia in the last few years."
She visits decaying hospitals and new sex clinics, old communal apartments and luxurious suburban developments, deteriorating public schools and plush private academies. She explains the workings of the mail-order bride business and the juvenile justice system. She examines who is giving business to faith healers, Mafia thugs and environmental activists. If there is a central theme running through this largely bleak picture of life in the new Russia, it is that of the age-old Russian conflict between order and freedom being waged at almost every level of life.
The most striking aspect of "Waking the Tempests" is Ms. Randolph's compassion for the losers in post-Soviet Russia's increasingly polarized society. Her book is free of the triumphalism and the ideological assumptions so often found in American accounts of Russia's so-called transition period. It is therefore a useful antidote to the many books and articles that depict Russia's development as a general, if erratic, success story. If the human costs of economic shock therapy were as fully and thoughtfully recounted in news reports as they are in Ms. Randolph's book, readers would have a better understanding of Russia's current political landscape. Only rarely do newspaper or television reports explain how Russia's fragile middle class, once the main constituency for political reform, has been ravaged by Mr. Yeltsin's program. Nearly a third of the country now lives below the poverty line, according to Government statistics. "Freedom is wonderful," an elderly and impoverished couple explain to Ms. Randolph, "but you can't eat words."
One of Ms. Randolph's most memorable encounters is with three formidable babushkas, or elderly women, in a bakery. Survivors of World War II, the women were confident that they would withstand the trauma of newfangled shock-therapy economics. Several months later, Ms. Randolph learned, "reform" had wiped out their life savings and turned them into despondent street peddlers.
Ms. Randolph's visits to disintegrating public hospitals expose other human costs of what the Yeltsin Government and its Western supporters call reform. Forty-two percent of the country's hospitals in 1993 had no hot water, 12 percent had no running water, and all suffer severe shortages of disposable syringes, vaccines and modern equipment. (In contrast, Ms. Randolph tours a well-equipped private hospital that is doing a brisk business catering to the new rich.) The long-term consequences of deteriorating health care are clear: an unparalleled and precipitous drop in life expectancy, especially for Russian men, who in 1991 lived, on average, to 65.5 years, but by 1994 lived only to 57.3. At the other end of life, infant mortality figures are up, and the birthrate is down. Just last month, a leading Russian newspaper ran the headline "Is Russia Dying?" over a roundup of the country's latest health statistics.
Although the elderly have borne the brunt of the economic turmoil, political and psychological changes have led Russians of all ages to new religions and faith healers. In sometimes darkly funny prose, Ms. Randolph describes the arrival of the Hare Krishnas on Moscow's streets. The Mormons, the evangelicals and the Bahais soon followed. Psychics fill stadiums with followers and broadcast weekly programs to millions of believers. When Ms. Randolph left Moscow in 1993, America's Christian right groups were beginning to find Russian converts.
Ms. Randolph also has some sobering things to say about the sexual revolution in Russia today, which is, as she rightly reports, less a liberating experience than a mixture of exploitative commercialism and degradation. Incidents of sexual violence and discrimination against women have soared, according to the Government's own inadequate statistics. And although sex education is practically nonexistent, just the proposal to introduce it into Russian schools has created a hotly contested political and moral battleground, one that would be familiar to Americans. Indeed, many of the social problems afflicting Russia -- juvenile delinquency, inadequate educational and health systems, alcohol abuse, growing inequality and poverty -- would be familiar to us.
Ms. Randolph has a keen eye for the details of Russian life, but she is an observer, not an interpreter. I finished this book having been moved, but wanting to know what went wrong in Russia after 1991 in the name of markets and democracy, and why. Two conflicting answers have emerged in Russia and in the West. One blames mainly the legacy of seven decades of Communist rule for the country's current woes. The other finds the fault primarily in unwise and rapacious policies pursued by Mr. Yeltsin's post-Communist Government. Ms. Randolph barely raises this crucial question. For answers to it, readers will have to look elsewhere.

Travels with a Hungry Bear
A Journey to the Russian Heartland.
By Mark Kramer.
320 pp. Boston:
A Richard Todd Book/
Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.95.
The manner in which Russians wrest food from their soil has been the despair of visiting and knowledgeable foreigners for centuries. Carl Augustus Koefoed, the Danish agriculturist who helped Prime Minister P. A. Stolypin make his agricultural reforms from 1907 onward, wrote of the practice of Russian farmers that "for them, it was enough that it was Russian, and therefore indisputable -- something holy." 
 In much the same spirit, Mark Kramer, touring collective farms almost a century later, hears the dean of a Soviet agriculture college lay down the orthodoxy to an aspiring private farmer who complains that he cannot cover his costs while he receives fixed low prices for his produce. The dean "was shouting, enunciating his words one by one: 'Listen to me, sir: the low price represents the voice of the people!' "
The dean was right: the people did like low prices (which people does not?). Successive general secretaries kept prices low for fear of popular rage -- and when they were allowed to go up at the beginning of 1992, the reaction swept away the Government that had raised them and helped revive a discredited Communist Party.
Mr. Kramer's is thus a very large subject, but "Travels With a Hungry Bear: A Journey to the Russian Heartland" is an often irritating book. The author, a professor in Boston University's journalism and American studies departments, philosophizes, strikes attitudes and gee-whizzes with amiable exasperation about the people he meets. He is not a man to miss a chance to push a reminiscence on you -- his eyes mist over with sentiment at times -- yet when he isn't being emotively correct, he is worth reading. He has worked on farms and written about farming for much of his life, and he knows that he cannot get his point across by writing a treatise. So he can be very interesting about, say, comparative milking methods.
In a series of travels during the late 1980's and early 1990's, he saw what ailed the self-enclosed continent that was Soviet agriculture. In large part, it was the infrastructure -- the fact that the state and the collective farms, no matter how much new (often foreign) equipment they managed to acquire, and no matter how efficient they became in this or that process, were caught in a system with slovenly work, terrible transportation, vastly wasteful storage, no signals of demand and a huge and overlapping bureaucracy that poked into everything and had to be placated and bribed at every level.
One of Lenin's most malign bequests to the Soviet economy in general and Soviet agriculture in particular was the utopian mind-set. Lenin believed -- at least until it was too late -- that the operation of an economy was merely a matter of adopting modern technology and setting it to work under party control in order to turn out socialism at the end of the production line. The successor versions of this mind-set saw Soviet officials grasp for a new technique -- and then introduce it everywhere, in the belief that it, and it alone, could change everything.
For example, Mr. Kramer talks to Fyodor Trofimovich Morgun, who introduced the "minimum tillage" system (which he had seen in Canada in the early 1970's). It is a way of plowing the earth that stirs the ground rather than flip it over and that can, under some conditions, be more efficient than other methods. As he tells it, Mr. Morgun fought for this system through layers of prejudice and conservatism, and finally had it adopted in the late 1970's. He saw it as a revolution. Mr. Kramer sees it for what it was. "It suggested something that party authorities . . . actually came to like: a mere technical fix could make the food problem go away." Such technical fixes were also the stuff of Mikhail Gorbachev's economic reforms -- though they did, accidentally, help Communism go away.
Soviet farming survives into the post-Soviet era substantially unreconstructed, with the private farmers still held at bay by people like the dean -- no longer for the sake of low prices, but for the preservation of bureaucrats' jobs. In addition, a peasantry that could rise to the challenge of private farming seems to have been effectively wiped out. Collective farming remains a "holy" matter: the walls of that temple will only slowly be breached.

TRAGIC FAILURE
Racial Integration in America.
By Tom Wicker.
205 pp. New York:

COMING THROUGH THE FIRE
Surviving Race and Place in America.
By C. Eric Lincoln.
157 pp. Durham, N.C.:
Duke University Press. $17.95.
The year was 1968. Reporting on the causes of the recent urban riots, the National Commission on Civil Disorders, popularly known as the Kerner Commission, concluded: "What white Americans have never fully understood -- but what the Negro can never forget -- is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it." In his introduction to the widely read paperback edition of the report at the time, Tom Wicker praised it for making plain "that white, moderate, responsible America is where the trouble lies." So he believed then and so, as he makes clear in "Tragic Failure," he still believes today. And more: he still believes that it is white America where the solution lies. 
 In that same fateful year, Christopher Jencks and David Riesman published "The Academic Revolution," a survey of American higher education that included a chapter entitled "Negroes and Their Colleges." Liberals, yes, but as skilled sociologists, they had set themselves a task of description. Their candid conclusion, sympathetically stated, was that "Southern Negro colleges are, with a handful of hopeful exceptions . . . near the end of the academic procession in terms of student aptitudes, faculty competence and intellectual ferment." Furious black educators immediately cried racism; this being 1968, open discussion was at an end.
C. Eric Lincoln's memory burns hot even to this day. In "Coming Through the Fire" he declares: "Each generation produces a new spate of Jencks-and-Riesman scholars" who "climb out of the ivy to reassure us that . . . the gap between black performance and white achievement is still an ordinance of nature." This is an unfortunate slander, done all too casually, of good and decent men. But so steeped is Mr. Lincoln in the memory of racial affliction that he loses sight of certain useful distinctions -- for example, the one between a candid friend and an implacable foe.
In 1996, this is a distinction that is vitally important to maintain. The moral authority of the aggrieved black just ain't what it used to be. Collective memory of the brutality and inhumanity of racial caste in American history is fading. Passionate evocation of that "strange fruit" that used to swing from Southern trees leaves today's undergraduates as cold as the new American political majority is left by Mr. Wicker's calls for massive programs of social intervention to bring the inner-city poor into meaningful participation in the commonwealth.
These are two Southerners, both venerable warriors on behalf of racial justice, both now in their eighth decade. But this is not their time. As many decades separate us from the 1950's and the onset of the civil rights era as separated Thurgood Marshall's oral argument in Brown v. Board of Education and the founding of the N.A.A.C.P. If de jure segregation is dead, de facto segregation, by class as well as color, lives on, and we are at a loss about how to go forward.
C. Eric Lincoln, a distinguished African-American scholar of religion and culture at Duke University, has literally "come through the fire." The notebooks into which he had been pouring his observations and reflections on racial matters for some 50 years were destroyed, along with nearly all of his personal possessions, in a tragic blaze. So this slender volume -- often eloquent, sometimes moving and only occasionally sanctimonious -- is an effort to salvage for public consumption something from a lifetime of remembering.
At its best, "Coming Through the Fire" is a plaintive, elegantly rendered cry for transcending the irrational racial essentialism that has marred this republic for centuries. "The notion of race," Mr. Lincoln writes, "is the hydra-headed monster which stifles our most beautiful dreams before they are fairly dreamt, calling us away from the challenges of normative human interaction to a dissonance of suspicion and hatred in pursuit of a fantasy that never was."
Mr. Lincoln ends his book with a call for "no-fault reconciliation -- the recognition that we are all of a kind, with the same vulnerabilities, the same possibilities and the same needs for God and each other." This is precisely right. Sadly, this is not all he has to say. Fixation on racial injury leads him into a dangerous and unproductive sentimentality. When discussing inner-city violence, for example, he issues an all-too-familiar, and deeply problematic, refrain: "The high incidence of destruction of Blacks by Blacks reflects the low esteem in which black youth (taking their cues from society) hold themselves and each other. . . . Bang! Bang! You're dead. But you were born dead! And so was I." Writing of allegations that surfaced during the O. J. Simpson trial about the Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman's "routine falsification of evidence," he says that "skewed statistics on black criminalization. . . originate at the point where the Fuhrmanization of law enforcement and the Fuhrmanization of justice come together in a synthesis of doom. Black doom. This is true victimization."
No, this is true nonsense, made no more palatable for having been stated by a gentleman of consummate civility. If indeed we are all created in the common image of God, then the problem of social pathology is at bottom a problem of sin, not of skin. These urban predators, like the violent racists who terrorized rural Alabama blacks in C. Eric Lincoln's childhood, have no excuse.
Still, it is a fair surmise that there might be fewer predators if there were more opportunity in the urban ghetto. Our inability to create this opportunity is the "tragic failure" that concerns Tom Wicker, a former political columnist for The New York Times and the author of nine novels and five books of nonfiction. He sees the failure as purely a political failure, and the key to success as obvious. It is jobs, and in his view only a newly invigorated left-wing politics can deliver the kind of job programs likely to make a difference to the most disadvantaged youths.
His radical proposal for how to engender such a movement is for blacks to abandon the Democrats en masse. This would destabilize the two-party system, and out of its ashes might then arise a new, ideologically liberal political party, "one truly committed, not just paying lip service, to economic opportunity and social justice for all." He elaborates: "The program of such a party . . . would promise opportunity to the poor, even to those presently lost souls in the inner city . . . to become useful, self-supporting and respected citizens with a stake in community and country."
Mr. Wicker writes with a reporter's eye for detail, using the words of his many interview subjects to tell much of his story. His dedication, "To my grandchildren -- may they live in a better world," reflects the dispirited tone of his essay; one finishes it seriously doubting that he believes a "better world" is likely to arrive any time soon. He never reveals why he thinks the new-party strategy could work, given the modest results of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's two recent Presidential candidacies. But it is a reflection of Mr. Wicker's frustration in the face of Republican electoral successes over the last two decades that he is driven to such a farfetched prescription.
Frustration and righteous anger do not a politics make. Mr. Wicker and Mr. Lincoln's central premise is flawed: the race problem in America today is no mere continuation of age-old sins. Rather, it is deeply connected to the problems of the underclass, and to the absence of a sense of shared purpose transcending racial and ethnic boundaries -- what Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called "the disuniting of America." There is a disturbing lack of black agency, outside of the political arena, in the visions of both men. That was an error in 1968, and it is an even greater error today. Americans should not forget the crimes of the past. But the act of remembering, and being outraged by memory, is no substitute for formulating an effective political and communal program.

THE POWER OF BEAUTY
By Nancy Friday.
589 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $27.50.
Was sex better in the 60's? There seems no other explanation for the charming and extraordinary Nancy Friday. Ms. Friday is a product of that peculiar decade of -- as she sees it, the wonderful, brief period after the pill was first marketed and before "matriarchal feminism" cast a pall on the sexual revolution. And for the past 20 years she has been promoting sex with a road-to-Damascus fervor that is often startling, but is enormously fun to read. 
 Ms. Friday is extremely successful as sex gurus go, probably because she combines salacious anecdotes with an innocent, therapeutic earnestness. Sexuality in a Nancy Friday book is something to be worked on, like self-esteem or a positive attitude in the office. She writes about the subject in a way that is both hopelessly 60's and quintessentially American: sex can make us happy, and because it makes us happy as individuals it can change society as a whole. She is a one-woman love cult who sincerely believes that if we could only learn to love our genitals, most of the world's problems would be solved. "It is a terrible waste of natural resources that we don't go out of our way, especially in these strained, difficult times, to educate more women to beam postorgasmically upon the world," she writes in her new book, "The Power of Beauty."
"The Power of Beauty," Ms. Friday's seventh book, is nominally about the effect that looks have on our lives, but that's not the half of it. It is also a hymn to genitalia, a j'accuse aimed at prissy mothers, a paean to the adorableness of men and a plea for the return of the codpiece. In addition, it's a catalogue of everything Ms. Friday believes has gone wrong with America because of feminism: Sperm banks. Breast envy. Strippers don't enjoy their work like they used to. And nobody is masturbating enough.
Ms. Friday's central point is that beauty matters. Face and body beauty, that is -- no "inner beauty" nonsense. "Beauty is a player," Ms. Friday cries in her inimitable fashion, "stalking the streets bare-breasted, stiletto heeled, fly unzipped." Ms. Friday likes the idea that beauty matters -- she can't stand feminists like Naomi Wolf who find beauty's power politically suspect -- but she wishes women would stop pretending that looks aren't important, and start competing openly. Ms. Friday is an emotional capitalist, and what she objects to about the way women deal with beauty and sex is, in effect, unfair trading practices: banding together in groups within which it is understood that no one woman shall have too much sex or be too beautiful. "The Power of Beauty" is her manifesto for a sexual antitrust movement.
Of course, the fact that beauty matters gives rise to various problems, Ms. Friday acknowledges, ranging from mundane adult envy all the way down to the roots of self-esteem. But, according to Ms. Friday, all of beauty's problems are traceable to mothers. Extrapolating from her own experience (as a daughter), she maintains that mothers think genitals are repulsive and dirty, and ingrain in all of us the feeling that we're ugly and sex is bad. The solution, therefore, is for fathers to participate equally in child-rearing. (Ms. Friday's father left her mother before she was born, and Ms. Friday ascribes most of her own life's problems, and thus life's problems in general, to this fact.)
It makes sense, of course, that such a change in parenting arrangements would have a profound effect of some sort. The same idea has been suggested by, among others, Dorothy Dinnerstein in her excellent 1976 book, "The Mermaid and the Minotaur." But Ms. Friday's reasoning depends on an idealization of men so extreme and so specific that it's not so much wrong as simply odd. For instance, she imagines that men's relationship to the important pre-Oedipal stuff like feces and genitals is vastly different from women's -- that while all women are revolted by these things, men unequivocally embrace them.
This bizarre idealism crops up throughout the book. Ms. Friday considers male rivalry, for instance, to be some kind of perpetual cricket game -- invariably concluded with handshakes all around. "Men's lips don't get mean and narrow, as ours do, from sucking in all the swallowed venom," she writes. And for rapists, Ms. Friday has sympathy. "When men . . . force us into sex, they are carrying out women's opinion of them," she declares. Women say no when they mean yes, men get confused -- and "meanwhile, the ugly penis, which is bigger than both of them, demands its reward, not unlike the troll that lived under the bridge."
"The Power of Beauty" is part cultural critique and part memoir, and the two are intertwined, to say the least. It's one of those "we" books, written in the first person plural -- a rhetorical device that neatly appropriates both the irrefutability of an eyewitness and the scope of a historian. Ms. Friday's mind works in a way that might be described as synecdochic-paranoid: everything is connected by a chain of associations and everything leads back to Nancy Friday herself. Beauty, sex, penises, clothes that Ms. Friday has worn, world history, more penises, all blur together. Fortunately, Ms. Friday is at her ebullient best when recounting the story of her life.
After growing up homely in South Carolina, she tells us, she moved to New York in the early 60's to find that she had suddenly become dazzlingly attractive. But her triumph came too late: inside she was still the plain girl from Charleston who didn't trust male attention. "When too many eyes focused on me in my sea-green Pucci dress, and offers of love reversed the rejections of adolescence, up from the unconscious swam infantile grandiosity," she confesses. "I was terrified that the telephone in my apartment would never stop ringing, would bring me so many suitors that I would soar too high. . . . Then, when all eyes were on me, I would be unable to handle the adoration and would spot my dress, humiliating myself."
Sex also was terrifying for Ms. Friday back then, since she suffered terrible cases of "post-sex enslavement" and lived in constant fear of getting pregnant -- imagining, as she memorably puts it, her "ravenous cervix, always hungry for the intrepid do-or-die sperm fighting their way upstream like crazed salmon." Since her marriage to Norman Pearlstine, now the editor in chief of Time Inc., her life seems to have calmed down somewhat, but she hasn't lost her signature sparkle. Anyone who deals with Mr. Pearlstine professionally will be delighted to discover that he and his wife have bought a pair of men's shoes with a large pink penis painted on each foot, to each of which is attached two large pompoms.
MS. Friday writes in a kind of what-fresh-hell-is-this stream of consciousness, as though she keeps her computer running all the time and types paragraphs into it whenever she thinks of something new and outrageous. She seems always to be writing about something she saw just the previous night or the week before. For the most part this style comes off as breezy and spontaneous, but every now and then it begins to border on lunacy. Take this passage, for instance, from a section on foot fetishism: "Just thinking about Bettelheim's image of Cinderella's tiny slipper as a virginal vagina . . . I am reminded that women today don't look or act like Cinderella, being neither in economic need of a prince, nor virginal, nor do women even require a prince's penis, given the local sperm bank. When you also factor in the ever-earlier onset of menstruation, meaning that adolescent girls are larger of body, it should be noted that they also walk on larger feet." There follow a number of other thoughts on the subject, and then, at the bottom of the page, we arrive at the denouement. "Sooner or later," Ms. Friday concludes darkly, "the shoe, the vagina and the penis are going to have to sit down together and have it out: What does it all mean?"
What does it all mean -- the nearly 600 pages of "The Power of Beauty," filled with recollections, speculations and eccentric apercus? Nothing so coherent as a theory of beauty, perhaps, but instead a kind of Dadaesque verbal collage, in which are visible the contours of the curious, exuberant and fascinating Nancy Friday herself.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Municipal Art Society Awards;
Honoring Those Who 'Inspire Others'

 BODY:
In a ceremony held in the Governors Island movie theater -- part of New York City's newest historic district -- the Municipal Art Society handed out its annual series of awards last Tuesday to New Yorkers and New York organizations that, according to its president, Brendan Sexton, "light creative sparks" and "inspire others."
Mr. Sexton presided over the group's annual meeting, at which the award recipients included former Mayor John V. Lindsay, honored for his lifetime support of cultural and environmental causes; William Aguado, head of the the Bronx Council of the Arts, and Robert Blackburn, who founded the Printmaking Workshop in 1948. 
 The Queens Borough Public Library, which for the last 10 years has had the highest circulation of any library system in the country, was also honored, for its outreach and its special collections in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Arabic and the South Asian languages.
New York State's Chief Judge, Judith S. Kaye, accepted an award for the Midtown Community Court, a system of community service sentencing, counseling and job training handled in a renovated court building at 54th Street and Eighth Avenue.
The Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, which sponsored the "recapture" of the abandoned Morrisania Hospital in the Bronx, turning the 1920's hulk into 132 subsidized apartments, was honored, as was Brooklyn's West Indian American Day Carnival Parade on Eastern Parkway. The architect Hugh Hardy presented an award to the city's School Construction Authority for "consistently hiring quality architects and designers."
The Municipal Art Society held the meeting on Governors Island because the group is concerned about the island's future when the Coast Guard leaves. Whatever use the island is ultimately put to -- Mr. Sexton suggested veterans' housing, a marina, a military museum and a conference center as possibilities -- the society would like to see significant public access.

HEADLINE: A Massachusetts Farmer-Developer Sows Housing

BYLINE: By MICKY BACA 

DATELINE: GRAFTON, Mass.

 BODY:
FORTY years ago, says John Magill, he "fell into" the housing development business in this historic New England town 40 miles southwest of Boston after rebuilding the barns destroyed by fire on his family's dairy farm.
Hundreds of homes later, the farmer-turned-developer has set Grafton's close-knit neighborhoods of colonial homes abuzz with a plan to turn 350 acres of his family's 500-acre farm into a $20 million golf course and housing development. Despite some controversy over its traffic and environmental impact, his plan is expected to go forward. 
 Most residents here know Mr. Magill as a local boy who made good. Some even recall his plowing snow on early winter mornings when he could barely reach the pedals of his father's tractor. The 62-year-old Mr. Magill, who now lives in a sizable home on one of the town's more scenic hills, has done 99 percent of his housing construction in his hometown where, he says, "people got to know me and know I'll give them a fair price for their land."
Mr. Magill is proposing to build the 18-hole golf course surrounded by 160 single-family homes just minutes from the early 19th-century buildings and pristine white churches nestled around the community's shady village green. With no other such development in the area, Mr. Magill says he expects an eager market for the $250,000 to $400,000 colonial homes he plans to build.
Called High Fields of Grafton, the project is getting mixed reviews from residents, some of whom worry about the traffic it will bring to the winding roads that surround it. Others in the neighborhood have raised concerns about the cost of running town sewer lines out to the area to accommodate the Magill project and what impact the golf course will have on water quality and supply, according to Town Planner Megan DiPrete.
On the other hand, Ms. DiPrete said, there is a "sense of excitement" about the idea of a golf course coming to town and the hope that it will enhance this "steady, well-run and desirable" town of 13,000 10 miles southeast of Worcester.
"If something has to go in, at least a golf course will have open space," says Mildred Bean, chairman of the local Historical Commission and a neighbor to the proposed golf course. "As far as John is concerned, I'm glad it's a small-town boy making good. It could have been a developer from Boston."
But Mrs. Bean said that residents of her native town -- a quintessential New England community that served as the location for the filming of Eugene O'Neill's "Ah, Wilderness!" in 1935 -- would have ample opportunity to air their views on the project in perhaps a year and a half of public hearings and scrutiny by town and state officials.
The town's Planning Board is now conducting public hearings on whether to grant a special permit for the overall project and then consider the subdivision proposal. The local Conservation Commission will have its say on Mr. Magill's plan to disturb about one acre of wetlands and various state agencies will look at its environmental impact, said Ms.DiPrete.
Five other developments with a total of 184 houses are currently under construction in Grafton, Ms. DiPrete said, some that will take several years to complete. In fact, said Sean Padgett, the planning board's chairman, there is more development here than ever before, even during the boom years of the mid-80's.
"People were just discovering Grafton when the bottom fell out," he said, referring to the recession of the early 90's.
Now, Mr. Padgett says his town is on the edge of a development front moving out from the Worcester area as well as from the high technology complexes along Route 495 to the east.
WHAT'S more, the state's Department of Transportation is scheduled to build a commuter train station linking Grafton to Boston in the next few years. And, said Ms. DiPrete, the private, nonprofit Worcester Business Development Corporation, in conjunction with the town, will begin construction soon of a biotechnology park on 120 acres near the station site.
"Frankly, I'm a little nervous that it might bring too much development," Mr. Padgett says.
Mr. Magill, who owns and operates the Grafton Inn, which has been welcoming guests to a restaurant and rooms overlooking the Grafton Common since 1805, said the town could not stop the growth. "I'm for everything really, I like things to grow," said the former farmer.
Mr. Magill conceded that it would be a "sad day" to see the cows leave his family's Silver Spruce Acres farm. He said he hadn't decided whether to retain the remaining 150 acres not used for the golf course development as a dairy farm. If he does, he said, he would likely reduce the herd of 300 that he now maintains, he said.
Mr. Magill's father, Henry, who was a herdsman for a state hospital in Rutland, Mass., bought the farm and moved his family to Grafton in 1942 when John was 9. Back then, Mr. Magill said, there were some 30 farms in the town.
Founded in 1735, Grafton was a self-sufficient farming community for more than a century before it became known for its local industries of leather, bootmaking, textiles and clockmaking. These days the community, which was once a summer place for wealthly city dwellers, is more of a bedroom town for Worcester and Boston, though some industry thrives in its northern section, Ms. DiPrete said.
Currently there are only three remaining farms, Mr. Magill said. He has not lived on his farm in years, but his three employees live there and operate it, he said.
Mr. Magill said he discovered his building talents while restoring his father's fire-ravaged barns in 1955. Before long, the 22-year-old made the jump from building barns to putting up a single-family home here and there to building his first major project, a 25-lot subdivision on the town's Pigeon Hill.
From single-family homes, Mr. Magill branched into building condominium developments at the height of the market in the mid-80's. He built some 300 units, selling as many as 10 a month during the housing boom.
Mr. Magill said he had borrowed money to finance his first phase of condominiums, but had financed all subsequent developments on his own. He hopes to finance High Fields himself as well, he said.
Mr. Magill will not say how much money his company, Magill Associates, earns or how much he is worth personally.
While he owns two of the most historically significant buildings in town, the Inn and a bank building dating to 1840 that houses his offices, Mr. Magill said he was not a "historian." He bought the Inn in 1983, renovated it under the guidance of local historians and has his daughters run it, he said, because "I'm interested in making money."
Despite his millions, Mr. Magill still projects the image of a dairy farmer. Residents say he often does business with a simple handshake, finds the bureaucratic red tape of today's development world frustrating and has a formidable temper. He is more likely to be seen driving the company dump truck or backhoe than the family Mercedes.
"My family were working people;" Mr. Magill says, "we're still working people."

 BODY:

JOE PAPP: An American Life
By Helen Epstein. Da Capo, $18.95.
Born Joseph Papirofsky, one of the great innovators of American theater emerges in this biography as scrappy and uncompromising, a loyal champion of causes who attracted enemies as well as friends. His "final portrait . . . might have been jointly painted by Goya, Whistler and Francis Bacon, so hard is it to categorize," Benedict Nightingale said here in 1994.
 
INDEPENDENCE DAY
By Richard Ford. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
The recent winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and selected as one of the best books of 1995 by the editors of the Book Review, this novel continues the story of Frank Bascombe, the hero of the author's 1986 novel, "The Sportswriter." Having abandoned journalism for the real estate business, Frank is beset with vague longings for his ex-wife and for a better life, though he often feels that his emotional detachment makes such quests impossible. "Frank Bascombe has earned himself a place beside Willy Loman and Harry Angstrom in our literary landscape, but he has done so with a wry wit and a fin de siecle wisdom that is very much his own," wrote our reviewer, Charles Johnson. Vintage Contemporaries has also restored to print two of Mr. Ford's earlier works. WILDLIFE ($11) is the story of a teen-age boy in Great Falls, Mont., witnessing the unraveling of his parents' marriage, as his father loses his job and his mother lapses into an affair. The novel "is shot through with nuance and minute observation," Sheila Ballantyne said in these pages in 1990. ROCK SPRINGS ($12), a collection of stories, also explores the themes of love and betrayal among a variety of men and their families. The finest of the tales "achieve luminous moments, moments with potential to change how the reader sees," John Edgar Wideman said in the Book Review in 1987.
 
RIVER OF TRAPS: A Village Life
By William deBuys and Alex Harris.
University of New Mexico, $24.95.
The village is El Valle in northern New Mexico, where Mr. deBuys, his wife, Anne, and Mr. Harris moved in the 1970's. But the book is less a portrait of a place than of a person, Jacobo Romero, an elderly Spanish sheepherder and erstwhile bootlegger who became his young neighbors' friend. "The poetry of the text is matched by Mr. Harris's photographs," Barbara Kingsolver said here in 1990.
 
THE SUMMER BEFORE THE SUMMER OF LOVE
By Marly Swick. Harper Perennial, $12.
Loss is the theme of many of these stories, whether it is the death of a child or a lover or the departure of a parent or a spouse. Portraying confused feelings rather than clear epiphanies, "Ms. Swick's clear and unobtrusive prose defines an intricate emotional landscape," our reviewer, Michael Gorra, wrote last year.
 
KIDDING OURSELVES: Breadwinning, Babies, and Bargaining Power
By Rhona Mahony. Basic Books, $15.
The author argues that women will never achieve economic equality with men as long as mothers continue to bear more responsibility for child rearing than their partners do. Offering suggestions for changing marital dynamics as well as the workplace, the author has written "a groundbreaking book," Susan Chira said in these pages in 1995. THE HITE REPORT ON THE FAMILY: Growing Up Under Patriarchy, by Shere Hite (Grove, $14), is based on a survey of more than 3,000 men, women and children. Like Ms. Hite's earlier works, the book draws conclusions -- in this case, surprisingly optimistic ones -- from personal testimonies. Many of her subjects "provide revealing and moving reflections," Susan Jacoby wrote in the Book Review last year. Patriarchy is not so much lamented as longed for in FATHERLESS AMERICA: Confronting Our Most Urgent Social Problem, by David Blankenhorn (Harper Perennial, $14). Maintaining that fathers are necessary, not optional, the author "makes a persuasive case," Ellis Cose said here in 1995.
 
THE BLACK BOOK
By Orhan Pamuk. Translated by Guneli Gun.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $15.
An Istanbul lawyer searches for his wife, who has suddenly disappeared. As he seeks her, he becomes enmeshed in the life of her half brother, a newspaper columnist who is also his cousin. The result is "something much beyond a mere mystery novel," Robert Houston wrote in these pages last year.
 
A GOOD WALK SPOILED: Days and Nights on the PGA Tour
By John Feinstein. Little, Brown, $13.95.
If a good walk is spoiled by golf, not much else is, the author concludes. Chronicling 15 months in 1993-94, he finds professional golfers remarkably drug- and ego-free. Last year our reviewer, Michael Bamberger, praised Mr. Feinstein as "a dependable, thorough and honest reporter." Some of the same terrain is explored fictionally in THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life, by Steven Pressfield (Avon, $12). Bagger Vance, a caddy with a taste for the mystical, reveals the secret of the Authentic Swing to his disciple, a glum war hero playing in a tournament with Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. "Mr. Pressfield's portrait of a Savannah seaside resort in 1931 is as bright as the life he brings" to certain characters, Dave Kindred said here last year. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: NEW URBANISM;
Helping to Shape The Inner City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Herbert Muschamp's account of the recent Congress for the New Urbanism (C.N.U.) Conference in Charleston, S.C. ["Can New Urbanism Find Room for the Old?," June 2] begins with a powerful endorsement of our organization's mission and accomplishments to date, designating it "the most important phenomenon to emerge in American architecture in the post-cold-war era" and "the only nationwide movement of consequence initiated by baby-boom architects." 
 Although Mr. Muschamp mentions a recent "important enlargement of scope" in C.N.U.'s commitment to "saving America's aging inner cities," he devotes most of the article to rectifying a perceived slight by C.N.U.'s founders toward their modernist predecessors and to a "skirmish" over "esthetic" issues that punctuated the congress's closing session. In making his case, Mr. Muschamp cited the group's "limited grasp of the history of suburban culture."
Had Mr. Muschamp attended the organization's prior three congresses, he would have seen that those pastures have been well tilled both in theoretical and pragmatic terms (the New Urbanists have been ardent students of the suburbs, learning from both their failures and successes).
Unfortunately, Mr. Muschamp's reporting of the most recent congress failed to mention several significant inner-city initiatives that were advanced at the congress. One such initiative was the formation of an inner-city task force with Mayor John Norquist of Milwaukee and Ray Gindroz of UDA Architects in Pittsburgh as co-chairmen.
Mr. Muschamp also neglected to mention a keynote address delivered by Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Cisneros's remarks included passages from C.N.U.'s newly adopted charter; he enthusiastically signed that document at the close of his talk, which mentioned sweeping new HUD programs designed to reconfigure troubled inner-city high-rise and superblock projects into more pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use neighborhoods connected with the larger urban context.
This appropriation of New Urbanism principles by a major shaper of American urban policy is surely worth noting. Its potential impact on the quality of inner-city life goes far beyond issues of esthetics.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
How Istea Refreshes Some of the Island's Byways

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
WERE it not for a Federal highway law that authorized funds for the enhancement of local roads, many projects now in progress -- from the creation of bike and pedestrian trails to the restoration of historic buildings -- might never have been undertaken.
That is the consensus of Long Island and state officials on the so-called "transportation enhancement" program known as Istea (pronounced ice tea). Twenty-seven projects have just been awarded their third -- and possibly final -- round of financing. 
 "We all too often forget that bicycles and walking are among the best modes of transportation," said John B. Daly, the Commissioner of the state's Department of Transportation. "This enhancement program has focused attention on worthwhile projects that could otherwise be overlooked in the press for improving roads and bridges and getting more asphalt down."
Istea is the acronym for the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, a $151 billion transportation law signed into law in 1991. Under one of its provisions, states must set aside for enhancement work 10 percent of Federal funds ticketed for roads other than major highways.
In New York State, $92.3 million was set aside for the program, with $17.36 million apportioned to Long Island. The state used up its allotment for this year and 1997 for this year's awards, so this round could be the final one, unless Congress extends Istea when it expires on Sept. 30, 1997.
Local municipalities or state agencies must sponsor enhancement projects and must agree to pay for at least 20 percent of their cost. In-house services, bond issues, fund-raising and other methods are used to generate local contributions.
Liberal guidelines allow a wide leeway on how the money can be spent. Eligible proposals have included the restoration of historic buildings, revitalization of ponds and streams and the acquisition of scenic easements.
"What Istea has really helped facilitate is a sense of place for Long Island," said Robert B. MacKay, one of 21 members of the Long Island Transportation Enhancement Advisory Committee panel formed to select local projects. Mr. MacKay is also director of the Society for Long Island Antiquities, a preservation group.
"It's that sense of place that is going to be vital to our economic future if we are going to continue to be both a tourist destination and an attractive place to live, work and play," he said.
The 27 projects on Long Island that are among this year's award winners will receive a total of $8.53 million in Federal financing, to be augmented by about $1.8 million from local sources. Most of the projects selected over the last two years are already under way, said David Glass who coordinates the Long Island program for the state's Department of Transportation.
T HE 1996 awards, which Gov. George E. Pataki announced May 25, include funds for the restoration of a historic church in Cold Spring Harbor, for revitalizing the Freeport waterfront and for a walkway along Greenport's harbor that the village's mayor, David E. Kapell, said would be "the fulfillment of a dream that began 30 years ago."
The largest award, $1.293 million to Freeport, will permit the acquisition of a 3.75-acre waterfront parcel and the construction of a boardwalk. The village will contribute an additional $431,000 to the project's $1.724 million cost.
The parcel, at the foot of Miller and South Ocean Avenues, had once been approved for construction of a 40-unit condominium that was never built. Instead, it will become a park, with benches, walkways and a gazebo. The proposed boardwalk, which will stretch from Woodcleft Avenue west to the Miller Canal, will cross the property.
The village received two previous Istea awards for its so-called Nautical Mile, which extends down Woodcleft Avenue, a thoroughfare lined by boatyards and other marine-related uses, as well as by restaurants and shops. The Federal money, together with local funds, is being used for walkways and bicycle paths.
There has been an ongoing effort to turn the Nautical Mile into a major tourist destination, and the Istea funds will be vital in achieving that goal, said Eric Hemphill, executive director of the village's Community Development Agency.
In Greenport, a waterfront revitalization plan has been given a $503,000 Istea award this year. The village will contribute $126,000 to the $629,000 project to construct a 1,650-foot long bicycle and pedestrian path along the shoreline of Greenport Harbor. An international design competition will be used to select an architect.
"We view our harbor walk and the whole revitalization project as bringing the Greenport economy out of the doldrums," Mayor Kapell said.
Another waterfront project, this one in Stony Brook, will use a $144,000 grant to improve pedestrian access between the Museums at Stony Brook and Stony Brook Harbor.
The City of Glen Cove is planning to link its downtown area to its waterfront at Garvies Point with walkways and bicycle paths. The rejuvenation of a mill pond next to the firehouse is part of the $731,000 project made possible by a $570,000 Istea grant and $161,000 from the city.
"Some people don't even realize we are a waterfront community, and this will remind them that we are," said Patricia A. Bourne, executive director of the city's Community Development Agency.
And in Islip, which received two Federal grants totaling $415,00, streetscape improvements in downtown Bay Shore costing $287,000 will include opening up water vistas. The town will contribute $57,000 to the Bayshore project and $47,000 to the townwide sidewalk and bicycle-path improvements.
Historic preservation will also benefit from this year's awards.
I N Cold Spring Harbor, the former Methodist Church on Main Street will be restored with the help of a $115,000 Istea grant.
The Gothic-style building dating to 1842 will become the new headquarters of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, which will pay the balance of the more than $600,000 cost of acquisition and restoration.
The Town of Riverhead received two awards totaling $313,000 for historic preservation, which it will augment with a contribution of $78,000. One will be used for improvements on and around the 62-year-old Suffolk Theater on Main Street, now undergoing renovations as an arts center.
The other will further enhance the Hallockville Museum Farm on Sound Avenue. The plan is to move additional 18th-century buildings to the complex, and to create "something akin to a Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts," said Andrea H. Lohneiss, Riverhead's Community Development Agency director.
Other awards include one for an $867,000 project sponsored by the Nassau County Department of Parks and Recreation under which a $507,000 Istea grant would be used to help acquire the 92-year-old Jackson-Malcolm farmstead on Route 106 in Jericho.
The property, which includes a barn that the county already owns, adjoins the county's Jericho Preserve. It could be commercially developed, said John B. Kiernan, Nassau's parks commissioner. "Without Istea, I wouldn't know of any other funding source that would allow us to buy it," he said.
A historic building in Brookhaven, the Davis house in Coram, will be restored with a $330,000 grant. The pre-Revolutionary War structure was used as a meeting place for town trustees for almost 100 years.
But for many people, perhaps the most meaningful legacy of Istea will be the network of bicycle and pedestrian paths that is being created all over Long Island.
Brookhaven was the sponsor this year of a project that, using a $736,000 Federal grant, will construct 36 miles of new bikeways connecting parklands from the Atlantic Ocean to Long Island Sound. In the Town of Southold, $393,000 will be used to implement safety measures for cyclists and to create new trails through public and private lands. The Suffolk County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, in conjunction with Nassau County's parks agency, will mark a historic trail along 25A from the Queens County line to Port Jefferson.
"I would like to see pedestrian and bike space included in every project done by the Department of Transportation," said Nancy Manfredonia, president of the Greenbelt Trail Conference, a group that creates and maintains hiking and biking trails. "There is now more understanding of that need because Istea has helped promote the idea that cyclists and pedestrians matter."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
More Care-Free Living Choices for Empty-Nesters

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
OVER the last four years Mart and Sharon Vaarsi scoured northern New Jersey for a residential community that would offer them an easier way of life as they head into their empty-nester years. Recently, their search ended.
The couple, who have two grown sons, the youngest a junior in college, put down a deposit on a home in Darlington Village at Rio Vista, a complex of 62 single-family detached houses in the Bergen County community of Mahwah. All the outdoor maintenance -- from mowing the lawn to shoveling the snow -- will be done for the Vaarsis. 
 Their current house, a bilevel elsewhere in Bergen County, "does not suit our living arrangement as well anymore," said Mr. Vaarsi, a Manhattan lawyer. It was time, he said, "to have someone else take care of the maintenance."
Darlington Village is among a spate of projects being built by developers hoping to attract empty-nesters such as the Vaarsis, who want to cast off chores, but do not want to compromise on space.
A few of the projects involve detached single-family homes only. Most include large town houses, which have bounced back from their recessionary slump. Eighteen such projects, totaling over 1,800 units, are under way in the state's 14 north and central counties, according to the New Homes Division of Coldwell Banker, a brokerage based in Short Hills.
Yet with prices in excess of $250,000 for the town houses and more than $350,000 for the detached houses, the projects are designed to appeal mostly to prosperous empty-nesters. Developers say professesional couples and trade-up buyers are other markets they will tap.
As of the first quarter the median sales price for existing one-family homes in the state, including town houses, was $150,000, up from $146,100 the same time in 1995, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison.
"Such projects fill a need in a niche market," said David J. Schoner, vice president of Coldwell Banker's New Homes Division. "These are people who live in large houses within a 10-mile radius of the new communities and buy because of the security and lifestyle they offer."
He said the market would grow as the wave of baby boomers came of age and entered their peak earning years after the turn of the century.
But the lack of suitably zoned land will temper the pace of construction of such projects, which usually require a higher-density zoning. (Indeed, many current projects are a result of a zoning change to help towns meet their obligations under the State Supreme Court's Mount Laurel doctrines to provide housing for low- and moderate-income people.)
And since buying is more a choice than a necessity for empty-nesters the market is limited to financially strong developers able to ride out the longer sales program.
That follows the downward trend in new residential construction in the state, which for 1995 showed 7 percent fewer housing permits than the previous year's total of 26,986. A Rutgers University report also showed that the number of permits was unlikely to top 30,000 for each of the next four years.
The dearth of new construction in the near term is helping projects for empty-nesters now under way. But to be successful they must provide features buyers want, such as two-car garages and large master-bedroom suites on the first floor, said Mr. Schoner. Most important, he said, they must be in upscale locations with records of appreciation.
That is the case in Cedar Grove, where K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank is is developing Reservoir Ridge, 80 detached homes offering a condominium form of ownership on 45 acres on Mountain Road. The site borders Upper Montclair..
"The focus groups we held identified that the maintenance-free lifestyle would be appealing to move-down buyers in the area," said Gabriel M. Pasquale, senior marketing adviser for Hovnanian's northeast region. "Not everyone wants to live in a traditional single-family home."
The houses have 1,860 to about 3,000 square feet of space and include, among other features, two-car garages. Base prices range from $330,000 to $370,000; the monthly maintenance fee is $175. In the 14 months since sales began over 60 percent of the homes have been sold, said Mr. Pasquale.
Darlington Village in Mahwah, where the Vaarsis intend to live, is also finding a demand among buyers because it offers "an alternative," said Joseph M. Minetto, a principal at Darlington Associates, which is developing the 40-acre site. It is at the core of the group's larger project on what was once part of the 1,110-acre Darlington estate of George Crocker, son of Charles Crocker, one of the four founders of the Central Pacific Railroad. Later it was used as a seminary by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.
OF the 62 houses, contracts have been signed or are pending on 14 since sales started two months ago, said Mr. Minetto. The houses, averaging 3,000 square feet, are priced from $459,000 to $525,000; the monthly maintenance is $225.
In Bergen County, a town-house complex is expanding and a mixed-housing community is about to begin. By mid-July construction is to resume at the incomplete Bear's Nest project in Park Ridge, where former President Richard M. Nixon once lived. Building there halted two years ago after 76 of the original 182 units were sold.
Pinnacle Communities Ltd. of Short Hills, which took over the 46-acre project last year, will complete the last 106 units and add 14 more on adjacent land. The new units will have the same Tudor exteriors designed by Eleanor Petterson, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. But they will be widened, creating 20 to 30 percent more space on the first and second levels for a total of 3,000 to 4,000 square feet. Some 2,000 more square feet will be in the basement and third levels.
Prices for the homes, with the master bedroom on the first floor in some models, are to start at $450,000 to $560,000.
Brian M. Stolar, a principal at Pinnacle, called northern Bergen County "ground zero location" for such housing.
"A high percentage of its population has lived in the area a long time, is well-off and is looking for something different," he said "They are buying a lifestyle."
At the Village of Old Tappan in Old Tappan, site work has begun on Orangeburg Road for a condominium project. As now envisioned, It will have 83 apartments 1,700 to 2,000 square feet of space in 23 buildings.
There will also be 7 detached homes with 2,900 to 3,500 square feet of space and 41 town homes, with 2,100 to 3,000 square feet of space. Nine Mount Mount Laurel units are planned, but the developer is negotiating with the town to have them developed offsite.
"We saw a need for bigger town homes," said Patrick Kalian, president of the Kalian Corporation of Red Bank, the developer.
"Empty-nesters want to stay in the area in a home requiring no maintenance," said Mark Bellin, the company's executive vice president, "but there is not much available and there appears to be a pent-up demand."
Prices of the apartments average $245,000 for the apartments; the town houses range in price from $334,950 to $449,950 and detached houses from $500,000 to $600,000. The monthly maintenance fee, not yet set, will be plus or minus $200 depending on the unit. Since sales began two weeks ago 32 deposits have been taken.
The entire project "is catering to more than one market" said Mr. Kalian.
IN Hunterdon County, Sterling Properties of Livingston is turning 12.5 acres on McCansmill Road in the historic Potterville's section of Tewksbury Township into a 26-unit town-house project, a first for the area.
The units at Lamington Falls will be in six free-standing buildings, designed to blend into the community. Twenty-two will have 2,400 to 3,000 square feet of space; four, custom designed by buyers, will be larger. A 2,100-square foot structure on the site will house three low- and moderate-income apartments, with income-based rents.
Prices on the for-sale housing start at $380,000 to $425,000, with the custom units costing more. The monthly maintenance is $175, said Joseph Forgione, a Sterling principal. Sales start today and reservations have been taken on three units, he said.

HEADLINE: COVER STORY;
Often Scarier Than 'Bambi': 'Nature'

BYLINE: By WILL JOYNER 

 BODY:
IT'S 8 o'clock Sunday night. Do you know where your children are?
 
 Even if they're teen-agers, there's a good chance they are at home with you, tired from weekend escapades and apprehensive about the next day's duties. And even though this is 1996, long past the era of the family viewing hour, there's a good chance everyone is indeed together in front of the television, trying to agree on a show - which is not easy.
 "The Simpsons" is an acquired taste, even for the hippest. "Murder, She Wrote" has always been proudly geriatric. "Lois and Clark" presents an awkward generation gap. The answer for many families, and for many other Sunday-evening viewers, is "Nature," the natural-history documentary program that has been a hit on PBS for 14 seasons.
 "Nature" is by no means the choice of least provocation. Its film makers are the best in the business and they travel to Earth's most picturesque reaches, so the photography is always gorgeous and innovative. But each episode of "Nature," which is produced by WNET, tells a story about animals or plants, and the story, being true, inevitably makes vivid the cruel and private facts of life as well as its splendors.
 "We don't script our films ahead of time," says Fred Kaufman, the executive producer of "Nature." "We go out and shoot, and what we get we edit into films. There are some people out there who turn on 'Nature' and they just want to see a sanitized world for an hour."
 "Nature" does not provide a sanitized world. In South Africa, spotted hyenas prey on zebras at night. In Tanzania, jackals stalk ailing wildebeests. In Scotland, the ruthless goshawk though the theme of a "Nature" episode is almost always a positive one - nurturing and survival, for instance - the characters sometimes do struggle violently and die. They also have sex.
 This month, "Nature" is repeating its six-part series "The Nature of Sex," which was first broadcast in 1994. The series spends time with crabs and walruses, but it also progresses, tastefully, to an open if never explicit protrayal of human relations. Before "The Nature of Sex" was first broadcast, Mr. Kaufman and George Page, the creator of "Nature" and its narrator and executive editor, were certain that the series was in no way exploitative, but they were anxious enough about its content to ask PBS to show it at 9 P.M. instead of 8. As it turned out, they were worrying needlessly.
 "I was astonished," Mr. Page said recently, sitting in his office at WNET in Manhattan with Mr. Kaufman. "The thing got huge ratings - a lot of people were watching - and I don't think we got a single letter saying someone was offended."
 The explanation for this has a lot to do with Mr. Page. His ruggedly handsome face and deep, soothing voice (equal parts Walter Cronkite, John Wayne and Walt Disney) give "Nature" much of its character as a serious but accessible science program. "It's sunrise on the Serengeti Plains of East Africa," says Mr. Page at the start of a typical "Natural" segment, "and a herd of Thomson's gazelles is already wide awake." In just a few words, information and drama are linked.
 Learning of nature's mysteries as Mr. Page speaks is a lot like sitting at the knee of a beloved granfather, and a great many people of all ages feel a personal bond to "Nature." the program has broader age, economic and ethnic demographics than any other prime-time program on PBS. Its ratings have always been strong. (In 1995, it was among the three highest-rated prime-time programs on PBS.) And in spite of greater competition in nature programming with the advent of the Discovery Channel, those ratings have actually gone up in the last couple of years.
 Nothing is ever certain in public television, but as they gather 14 or 15 new films for their 15th season, with solid financing from Canon and Ford, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Page are confident of success. It was not always so. In the early 1980's, Mr. page wasn't sure what he would come up with when he was asked by his bosses at WNET to develop a new science program.
 "I looked at what was already being done on PBS," he says "It was the 'Nova' series, which would include an occasional natural history film, and it was the National Geographic specials, which shifted between PBS and commercial television. I also, witha cold eye, looked at the ratings when a natural history film was on PBS, and it was always a spike."
 Mr. Page decided that natural history was the way to go, and he went looking for enough good films to create a first season. He found them at the BBC natural-history unit, which he credits with inventing the genre about 30 years aog.
 "About two weeks before the series was to go on the air, " Mr. Page says, "some of our programming colleagues at PBS in Washington, after seeing the first three programs, called in a panic and said: 'These shows are not going to work. Nobody's going to watch. They're too slow.' Well, what those three programs were was 'The Flight of the Condor.' which is now regarded as a classic. The public loved it."
 Over the years, Mr. page and Mr. Kaufman, who took over from David Healy as executive producer in 1991 after being the program's series producer for nine years, have progressed from simply acquiring films and adding narration to participating in the films' planning and creation as co-producers. The cost of a single film has increased greatly, to as much as $700,000. One new area that they want to explore is the field of human-animal relationships.
 The constant is a rare breed of film maker: adventurer, naturalist and technician all in one.
 "I used to say you could count the world-class natural history film makers on one hand," says Mr. Page. "That's not true anymore, but it's still a very small, elite group."
 This group includes more Americans than it once did because of the influence of "Nature," Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Page believe. It still includes Hugh Miles of Scotland, a veteran whose three-part "Kingdom of the Ice Bear" involved 16 trips to the High Arctic over two years. In a "Nature" special on its film makers, Mr. Miles sums up his professional purpose in this way: "If I can transport the audience for one hour from their living rooms and make them have the impression at the end of it that they've actually experienced what I have experienced, then I've done my job. If they actually learn something about the animal, that's a bonus, and if they're entertained, better still."
 As a weekly presence in its viewers' lives, "Nature" has a comparable sense of purpose, and one aspect of this is to benefit the environment without preaching.
 "Sometimes it's tempting to do that because we do care about the environment, and we think it would be a good idea for the planet to survive," Mr. Page says. "But our philosophy is that our series is here for people to learn how the natural world works, and if they understand it, they are likely to care about it, and if they care about it, they are likely to want to protect it."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Tottenville;
Way Down South on Staten Island

BYLINE: By JANICE FIORAVANTE 

 BODY:
TOTTENVILLE, the Staten Island community farthest from Manhattan and the southernmost point of New York State, escaped the frenzy of building after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964.
It remained more rural than perhaps any other part of the borough, with old Victorian houses, wooded areas and its own Main Street. 
 But Tottenville was discovered a decade ago and now town houses, semi-attached and custom homes have given parts of Tottenville a suburban look. And with development have come suburban problems, among them school overcrowding.
The wave of development began in the mid-80's when a Tottenville builder put up six custom homes, causing other builders to move into the area.
"In the early 80's, builders could buy land for about $2 a square foot," said Thomas Maira, the owner of Maira Real Estate. "By the late 80's, land cost from $5 to $7 a square foot."
The coming of sewers helped, too. In 1990 and 1991 sewer lines connected Tottenville to a sewage-treatment plant in Eltingville. Thus septics were replaced, making the area more appealing.
Surfside Village, begun in 1986 and one of the community's earliest town-house developments, won approvals because it included its own sewage-treatment plant. The complex, on Raritan Bay between Loretto Street and Sprague Avenue, now has 296 town houses with an additional 60 still to be built.
Eighty percent of the new construction has taken place between Hylan Boulevard and Raritan Bay, what Mr. Maira calls "below the Boulevard."
"Fifty percent of that property consisted of small bungalows improved to be year-round homes," he said. "Of the other half, about 36 percent are custom homes, costing in the $400,000 range. The rest are semi-attached, not in rows, but scattered, two here, another two down the street."
He described the custom homes as predominantly center-hall colonials with two-car garages and one-bedroom apartments above the garage.
One-family, semi-attached homes are priced from $179,000 to $199,000 and semi-attached, two-family homes from $189,000 to $219,000. Among older homes, mostly two-story Victorians and colonials, prices range from $170,000 to $220,000. Prices of two-families range from $180,000 to $230,000.
While many newcomers feel that the rash of construction means progress, others feel the community has been overbuilt. "Tottenville, like almost all areas on the South Shore, has been town-housed to death," said Lydia Ragucci, owner of Ragucci Realty and a member of the land use committee of Community Board 3.
NEW zoning laws are being phased in and are helping to change the picture. "Over the past three years," Ms. Ragucci said, "most of the area has been rezoned to allow only detached one-family homes on a minimum of 35- by 100-foot lots." Jean Timberlake, community liaison for the Staten Island office of the Department of City Planning, said the last of the zoning changes were being implemented.
Priscilla Raccuglia-Carollo, president of the Tottenville Civic Association, called the building of town houses and semi-attached homes "overdensifying," resulting in classroom overcrowding in the public schools.
(The overcrowding is a result of a 41 percent surge in population in Tottenville from 6,486 in 1980 to an estimated 11,000 today. A third of the increase is in residents under the age of 18, according to the Staten Island Office of Economic Development.)
"Now P.S. 1 is so overcrowded, the third-grade classes are being bused to a building on the grounds of Mount Loretto," a nearby property owned by the Archdiocese of New York, Ms. Raccuglia-Carrollo said. "The school lost its computer room, library and gym to make more classrooms."
Bernard Campbell, principal of Public School 1, said that despite the problem, more than 70 percent of its 753 pupils read at grade level or better. "When the school board leased the old school on Mount Loretto," he said, "we got back our gym, library and two science labs," which had been used as classrooms. But, he added, they had to be used as classrooms again as more building of new homes meant a further increase in pupils.
Our Lady Help of Christians, a Roman Catholic school with 250 students from pre-kindergarten to grade 8, is building two new classrooms to house the 25 percent increase in enrollment in the last three years, according to the principal, Nancy Lucas.
The community's 1,100-student I.S. 34 is ranked No. 1 in reading scores among New York City intermediate schools, said Frank Moschella, the principal. He credited the supportive community and education-oriented parents.
One such parent is Diane Silverman. Three of her four children (the youngest is 2-year-old Bree) attend Tottenville's public schools. "Every aspect of the education in Tottenville public schools is great, except for class sizes," she said. Page is 7 and in second grade at P.S. 1; Jena, 12, is in seventh grade at I.S. 34 and Rian, 14, will enter Tottenville High School's Science Institute this fall.
Tottenville High School, a few communities northeast in Huguenot, has about 3,400 students, of which 87 percent go on to higher education. Its Science and Humanities Institutes offers Latin and college-credit courses. Earlier this month, the school's Tottenville Pirates baseball team won its second straight Public School Athletic League championship, at Yankee Stadium.
The bungalows below the boulevard tell the story of Tottenville as a summer getaway and fishing enclave. In 1886, 300 to 400 of the community's 2,800 population made its living in oystering and fishing. This attracted shipwrights who built sailing vessels. Shipyards and oystering were among the area's most profitable industries.
The community adopted the name Tottenville in 1869 for Gilbert Totten, an 18th-century settler. He and his descendants were instrumental in building the Bethel United Methodist Church, completed in 1841. It was the community's first house of worship.
The neighborhood had been called Bentley Manor, named by Capt. Christopher Billopp for his ship, the Bentley, after he was granted land on Staten Island in 1668 by the Duke of York.
Billopp built a two-story stone house beginning in about 1680, which came to be known as the Billopp House. A conference held there on Sept. 11, 1776 after the Battle of Long Island, in which Continental Congress representatives rejected a call for surrender, gave it a new name. The Conference House is now a national and New York City historic landmark.
A ferry run by the Staten Island Railroad from Tottenville to Perth Amboy, N.J., began operation in 1867 and ended in 1963. But proximity to New Jersey still lures shoppers from Tottenville, as does that state's lower sales tax. Malls, discount, chain and warehouse stores there and in Staten Island have posed problems for Tottenville merchants.
A consultant, Joannene Coppinger-Borock, helped establish a local development corporation with Paul Kidder, president of the Tottenville Merchants Association, who is now president of the development group. The development corporation, supported by grants from private industry, is working to strengthen Tottenville's three commercial strips, Main Street, Amboy Road and Page Avenue.
The 123d Police Precinct station house is found on Main Street, along with the Post Office and the Richmond Country Savings Bank. Amboy Road, with its art gallery, bakery and ice cream parlor, is also the site of the Tottenville library, dedicated in 1904 and the first to be built on Staten Island. Among Page Avenue's stores are a pizzeria, bagel bakery and a florist.
Mr. Kidder said the organization would work with landlords to help a variety of businesses come into Tottenville.
The corporation sponsored a parade and fair on June 9 called Heritage Day. This event, which drew about 3,000 people, presented line dancers in cowboy hats and boots and demonstrated that the country is not far away.
A 110-acre undeveloped area and wildlife sanctuary called Long Pond that is in the final stages of becoming a park, Mrs. Timberlake of City Planning said. Guy V. Molinari, the borough president, called it an ideal addition to "strengthen the small-town qualities of Tottenville."

CONFERENCE HOUSE PARK: The 227 acres along Raritan Bay now known as Conference House Park has been attracting people to its shores since prerecorded history. "It's quite clear that this was a summer spot for Native Americans from up and down the East Coast because we have found cross-cultural artifacts," said Joanne Jackson, a consultant working for the Department of Parks and Recreation who is writing a landscape architectural report. The park contains 72 burials, 50 reported pits with hearth materials and pots, as well as arrowheads. The report will recommend making this an archeological preservation zone to discourage amateur archeologists from disturbing the burials. "We want to increase awareness that this is an archeological site," said Ms. Jackson. "But when I see evidence of recent beach parties, I can't help but smile -- they've been going on here for a good, long time."

HEADLINE: FARM LIFE -- Protecting the crop.;
Farmer Makes a Choice on the Use of Pesticides for His Fruit

BYLINE: By JANE JULIANELLI

 BODY:
AT first it looked like a vintage flying machine, two huge aluminum booms swinging out from a center carrier, attached with vinyl curtains to deflect the wind.
A sprayer for crop protectants, designed and built by John Halsey at a cost of $5,000, funny looking as it appeared, did the trick. By putting the chemicals directly on the leaves and branches of the tree, rather than blowing it up through the tree, Mr. Halsey said, he could use 30 percent less chemicals than by using a conventional sprayer. 
 Mr. Halsey will be spraying his 20 acres of apple trees in Bridgehampton from April into early September, like most farmers in Suffolk County. Such spraying continues to run into opposition from those who object to anything other than natural forces to control the destiny of the crops.
As farmers educated in the latest methods of pesticide use and in fastidious record-keeping, the Halseys, a 12-generation Long Island farm family, feel strongly that controlled use of pesticides is essential to protect their crops and their livelihood.
"To produce the quanity and quality of food that our citizens in America demand and deserve, we as growers are going to have to use crop protectants," Mr. Halsey said, "and we'll use the most appropriate amount of the most efficient product."
This translates into making applications against funguses from April into early September, depending on humidity and temperature, and against insects, depending on temperature, between May and June. Mr. Halsey changes products with weather changes, using 10 or more products to mix up the cycles so that one insect won't become resistant to one product. He follows the label recommendations, which tell how much he can put on per acre and how often it can be applied.
"Then we balance that against the need," Mr. Halsey said, "and not always put on as much as the label says."
Some of the controversy over agricultural pesticides is being played out in Albany, where farming advocates and legislators often clash.
For instance, the Long Island Farm Bureau in Riverhead, which represents the interests of farmers, believes there has been no scientific evidence to substantiate the fear that pesticide use by farmers is a cause of breast or prostate cancer on Long Island.
"I disagree with the statement that there is no evidence," said Assemblyman Steven Englebright, a Democrat of Setauket, who is a sponsor of the Pesticide Use and Registry bill. The bill would require private and commercial pesticide applicators to file an annual report with the Department of Environmental Conservation in Stony Brook.
"There's a great deal of evidence that suggests that pesticides do affect the human immune system and the human sexual hormone system," said Mr. Englebright.
"There is a library of information documenting the ill-health effects. And a recent study suggests that pesticides in combination with one another can have a dramatic effect, as much as 1,000 times more powerful than an individual pesticide."
Assemblyman Englebright, who is vice chairman of the Legislative Commission on Toxic and Hazardous Substances and who grew up on a farm in Evansville, Ind., said the Pesticide Use and Registry bill was an effort to develop a data base that will enable health researchers for breast cancer and other afflictions that may be linked to the use of pesticides, to keep a record to determine if there is a cause and effect relationship.
William Sanok, county agent for the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, said that the public's perception of pesticides was in many cases not based in fact.
"My No. 1 gripe is when people start making laws that are based on emotion rather than the facts," he said. "I'm involved with the breast cancer task force at Cornell. A lot of the people that are anti-pesticides say that breast cancer is highest on Long Island. No. 1, it's not highest on Long Island. No. 2, it's less prevalent on eastern Long Island than it is in the rest of Suffolk County."
Mr. Sanok, calling himself the Mr. Kimble of "Green Acres," added: "I've been in this business for 30 years and I've seen some tremendous changes in the evolution of use of pesticides. For example, we used to use DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) for almost everything, and found out it didn't work on everything. And because it had such a long residual effect on the environment we stopped using it."
Mr. Sanok said that of the 600 farmers in Suffolk County, many were preparing a new generation that is better educated, like Jennifer and Amy Halsey, who go to school to learn integrated pest management and potential alternatives to pesticides.
This generation will work with new products that have to go through a great deal of testing before they're approved, he said. "The major changes have been away from the long residual, broad-ranged type of pest chemicals such as DDT and Chlordane," Mr. Sanok said. "We're using things like Bt (Bacillus thuriengensis), which is a naturally occurring bacteria manufactured into a commercial product."
Dave Rosenberger, associate professor of plant pathology at Cornell University and the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Ulster County, who covers most of eastern New York, called the new pesticides less persistent.
"Those persistent pesticides were phased out in the 1960's and early 1970's." he said. "And the products registered now are all very short-lived in terms of having any persistent effect on the environment. The new products are different from DDT and Chlordane in that they are metabolized or broken down into harmless compounds relatively quickly.
"'So Mancozeb fungicide and other fungicides and insecticides we use generally disappear within two to three weeks after application at the most, and some of them a lot quicker than that. What made DDT dangerous was its persistence."
Assemblyman Englebright disagreed. "I cannot have a universal agreement with that perspective and I would only point to the incidence of Temek," he said. "Temek was applied broadly in the farming regions of eastern Long Island just a very few years ago. It was supposed to break down based upon tests that were done in other states and not be persistent within the ground water and the environment.
"As a result it did not break down in Long Island well water. It contaminated over 2,000 wells on the East End and was an economic calamity. It is still in the ground water in a large part of the South Fork and North Fork as a significant contaminant."
On an optimistic note Assemblyman Englebright said that many of the farmers he had met, with whom he empathized, were reasonable and thoughtful and were struggling to find ways through this issue.
Back at the Halsey farmstead in Bridgehampton, John Halsey was standing in the barn by his sprayer, wearing a hat to protect him from mischievous barn swallows nested in the rafters. Jennifer Halsey was home for the summer from the Cornell School of Agriculture and Life Science to run the Integrated Pest Management program on the farm.
The program is considered by all sides of the pesticide issue to be gaining broader acceptance and reducing significantly some of the past problems in terms of broadcast spraying and the impact upon non-target organisms and the general environment.
"IPM is all about scouting for insects, which reduces the use of crop protectants and pesticide sprays," Ms. Halsey said. "People, when they associate the word pesticide, they associate it with a bad thing and it's really not.
"What it's doing is protecting the crop from an insect, from a fungus. There's several different insects, such as European lead mite, leaf minor and leaf hoppers that will chew on the leaves. Because leaves are green, they are photosynthesizing and you need that for the apples to grow. So you want to reduce that.
"But there is a threshold point where it can be too much or too little," she continued. "And once you meet that point you have to come out and treat the trees. So what I do is I come out and find whether the trees are at that threshold point or not and then I come back and I tell Dad whether he has to spray or not."
She continued: "What he used with his father was, when they went out in the potato field and saw a couple of potato bugs, that was it. They went out and sprayed.But now that there's such a reduction in spraying I wait until the threshold point."
One basic difference between John Halsey's approach and Jennifer's approach, Mr. Halsey, said was "I'm impatient but Jen will count the bugs."
"She's been trained and I give her the time to go out and look at enough leaves on enough trees and count the insects that she's looking for," he said. "The research publications have indicated how many insects of a particular kind can be on the trees before they'll do economic damage. She will do the counting to determine that threshold level."
Ms. Halsey showed her father a piece of paper on which was what appeared to be eight minuscule fragments of steel wool. They were bugs.
"It's all based on the design on the wing. Also, the apple maggot has a white speck on its back," said Ms. Halsey, describing what was undetectable to the untrained eye. "There's also a cherry fruit fly in here. But what we are really concerned with is the three apple maggots, as well as some other fruit-feeding insects."
Mr. Halsey said: "The rest of them she questions. Because Jen is studying carefully the differences in the insects, she identified three that were harmful and five that were not. I would have identified eight that were harmful and gone out and protected the crop against them needlessly because there's not enough there."
Mr. Halsey hung 18 traps, looking like red apples, covered with a plastic bag smeared with glue. These go around the perimeter of the orchard where apple-maggots over-winter.
"During the height of the season," Mr. Halsey said, "July and early August, Jen will go twice a week and count them and in that period of time if she finds -- what's the number Jen?"
Ms. Halsey referred to her textbook: "If a total of five apple maggots are caught, then you should apply a crop protectant." Mr. Halsey described their spreadsheet graph, carefully listing every trap, and the date Ms. Halsey looked at them.
"Just take for example, trap No. 1," Mr. Halsey said. "She didn't find any for a month. So we wait on that."
As for more natural ways to control pests, Mr. Halsey said: "Our Integrated Pest Management program is taking into account any predatory insect of the damaging insect. Ladybugs are a major part of our pest control program in the orchard. The new products are being developed so that we don't kill the ladybugs when we kill the problem insects. Last year we had very good control of aphids by ladybugs."
Mr. Halsey said that in addition, they consider organic farming every day they operate. Organic farming, Mr. Halsey said, is "the growth of a food crop with a product that is safe for the environment and safe for humans."
"Most of the organic fruit is being grown in Washington State which is an entirely different growing climate than ours," he said. "I'm working with some people who are trying to develop organic-type products for this area but so far the fungus is a big problem."
So as the humidity of the maritime climate sets in this summer over eastern Long Island, the controversy over pesticides goes on. Will there come a time when it becomes virtually impossible for the farmer to make a living because of the restrictions and costs?
"Boy, I sure hope not," Assemblyman Englebright said, "and I don't think so because we're all working together. The best soils in the world are in eastern Long Island. And with the long growing season, it's essentially a state and national treasure."

HEADLINE: Back to Vietnam: Past Meets Present

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: THORNWOOD

 BODY:
THAO THACH missed her graduation ceremony from New York Medical College in Valhalla last month. Instead, she was visiting clinics in the rural provinces of Vietnam, bringing medical supplies to the country she fled by boat in the dark of night 15 years ago.
To return to Vietnam was not easy. Dr. Thach was 16 when she left Danang with her father and sister, setting out on a perilous journey during which she and her family spent 12 days being buffeted on the ocean. Their small boat ran out of gas, and there were days when she fainted from hunger. At one point, a boat from China stopped to give the stranded party water before moving on. Another paused long enough to steal their jewelry but gave them rice. Finally, a third boat towed them to Hong Kong. 
 The journey that took her back to Vietnam was longer still. After a year in a refugee camp in Hong Kong, the family moved to California. She mastered English, at the same time holding jobs in a department store and at a supermarket. Dr. Thach attended high school in San Jose, junior college also in California and, eventually, transferred to the University of California at Davis, where she earned a B.S. in biochemistry. This spring, she earned her medical degree in Westchester.
Throughout the years, and despite the horrors she saw during the fall of Danang -- an experience she said she still could not discuss -- she longed to return home.
"The minute I left Vietnam, when I was on the boat, I promised myself I would come back," Dr. Thach said. "I just felt it was a sad thing to leave a country, and I had so much resentment. I wanted to come back, and I wanted to help people."
She found that opportunity through an organization called Project: Hearts and Minds, a nonprofit agency, which seeks to foster reconciliation between citizens of the United States and Vietnam by providing medical aid to Vietnam. The agency, whose New York chapter is based in Thornwood, organizes two relief missions a year, in which groups take medical supplies to Vietnamese hospitals and clinics.
The project was begun in 1991 by two Vietnam veterans from California. Groups traveling to Vietnam have included veterans who sometimes visit the areas in which they served in combat. Tom Conlin, the group's president, who lives in Thornwood, said the experience has provided psychological healing to veterans who are able to return to the country peaceably offering aid.
Not all members of the group are Vietnam veterans. Mr. Conlin was a conscientious objector during the war. Participants run the gamut of the political spectrum and include those who enlisted, those who were drafted and those who supported the war.
Dr. Thach's visit represented two milestones for Project: Hearts and Minds. First, she was the first Vietnamese refugee to return to her country with the organization. Second, Dr. Thach, who is now an American citizen, was one of six women who traveled to Vietnam this spring as part of the first all-female group.
The women delivered medical supplies to four sites: Chu Lai Hospital, Son Tin/My Lai Hospital, My Tho Women's and Children's Hospital and Go Cong Tay Hospital. They also visited the Ha Tan District Hospital to see if it was suitable for future support. The group brought syringes, antibiotics, dressings, latex gloves, needles, rehydration kits and intravenous equipment.
"In terms of their needs, it's everything from the smallest stuff -- like having enough soap and water -- to the bigger and more expensive items, like ultrasound machines, anesthesia machines, dental equipment and CAT scans," said Gail Moroso, a group member and nurse who coordinates a perinatal H.I.V. transmission study at Women/Infants Health Care at SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn.
She added that second-hand equipment, which had been donated in the past, was breaking down and that replacement parts were nearly impossible to get.
Ms. Moroso was stationed in Nha Trang, Ban Me Thuot and Long An from 1968 through 1970, working for the United States Agency for International Development, which was part of the State Department. She worked as a nurse adviser in Vietnamese civilian hospitals, where her assignment was to help the Vietnamese upgrade their medical nursing care. But conditions were very different from what agency planners envisioned, Ms. Moroso said.
"Our program wanted us to do some very sophisticated things in terms of changing their nursing care," Ms. Moroso said, "but we were busy trying to get the chickens out of the ward and stopping the patients from cooking under the beds and get them to get running water in their recovery room and get the toilets working, so it ended up being a lot of very practical stuff."
Returning to Vietnam for the first time in more than 25 years, Ms. Moroso said that while some things were considerably changed, the primitiveness of the medical care was surprisingly the same.
"Unfortunately, the hospitals did not look that much different from how I remembered them and that was sad," Ms. Moroso said. "Of course, the big difference was that there was no war going on. There was no shelling, no military trucks and no tanks. At first I kept trying to figure out what else was missing, and then I realized it was the sandbags."
Vietnam remains one of the poorest countries in the world, and the group described a lack of the most basic medical equipment. Latex gloves and syringes -- both meant to be disposable -- are routinely washed and reused. Dispensary cabinets are rusted and broken, mold grows on surfaces in the operating rooms and water is not distilled.
At the clinic at Chou Lai, a metal-frame bed is provided, but patients provide their own mats and bring their own pajamas. In general, hospitals will provide food for a fee; otherwise, families bring their own. Families also do much of the basic patient care like washing, turning, walking and feeding the patient.
"It's a combination of economic and cultural forces," said Dr. Cathey E. Falvo, chairwoman of the board of Project: Hearts and Minds and part of the group which visited this spring. "Nurses do specific things like give you medicines, but you don't let strangers bathe you. Hospitals can't afford to provide what amounts to nurse's aid care."
Dr. Falvo, also director of International and General Public Health at the Graduate School of Health Sciences at New York Medical College, said that Vietnam also faces severe problems with malnutrition, malaria and dengue fever (a virus transmitted by mosquitoes). Cholera and typhoid have also been rampant.
She said that Vietnam was particularly strong in public health education and observed that posters urging H.I.V. prevention, encouraging breast feeding and good diet and promoting population control were graphically presented and widely distributed.
Members of the group said they were struck by the beauty of the country and the graciousness of the Vietnamese people. For Dr. Falvo, a high point came after the group trudged eight kilometers through rain and mud to reach an outlying clinic and were met with iced bottled water, delicious fruit and, in the midst of great poverty, overwhelming hospitality.
Ms. Moroso rode on a small pole boat on a tributary of the Mekong River and reflected that when she had last been in Vietnam the area had been overrun with the Vietcong. Twenty-six years later, she spent an afternoon singing songs and exchanging addresses with Vietnamese students.
For Dr. Thach, the memories were more painful. She said that she could not describe how Danang had changed since she left because she has suppressed most of her memories.
"I didn't have the courage to go back to my house in daylight," Dr. Thach said. "I saw it in the dark. It's too upsetting. It was my parents' dream. They worked really hard to build that house. It is painful to me how much a human can endure."
Project: Hearts and Minds is planning another relief mission in October. Medical supplies are donated by medical-supply companies and hospitals. Continental Airlines donates transportation for mission participants as well as shipment of supplies and equipment in and out of Manila. Each person traveling can take 140 pounds of medical equipment. Those interested in the project or in donating medical supplies should call 747-2176.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Elaine Zimmerman;
Looking Out for the Needs of the Children

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK

 BODY:
ELAINE ZIMMERMAN, executive director of the Connecticut Commission on Children, combines a missionary's zeal with a mother's determination in her work representing the interests of children. She must look after their needs from prenatal to age 21. To spread scarce money as efficiently as possible Ms. Zimmerman has emphasized the importance of prevention and the needs of the youngest Connecticut citizens.
"In the last five years there were significant budget cuts," she said. "Children's needs were increasing in terms of learning, safety and health. It became clear that with limited dollars and increased needs it was wise to invest in prevention." 
 She said that she is often frustrated. "The truth is that children are off the political agenda," she said. "What children's policies there are, are secondary to other agendas, such as welfare reform ." She said that she worries about the implications of this shift in social policy.
"Right now the country is very confused about the role of mothers," she said. "We want poor women in the work force and middle-class women home. We blame different classes of women for different ills in society."
Recently Ms. Zimmerman discussed a few of the issues and programs administered by her department. Following are exerpts from that conversation:
Q. What is the state of children in the State of Connecticut?
A. They are not doing very well. We are seeing children increasingly fearful of not having anyone to take care of them while parents work or job-train. Not just poor children.
Many children are doing well, many are not doing well. Often this breaks out by class and race. In many instances the gaps in public policy that are facing children are not just segregated by class, for example, in child care. In Connecticut two-thirds of moms are working but our supply of child care is both short and not quality. Parents are unable to afford a care-giving environment so they are forced to rely on neighbors or patchwork arrangements.
We're seeing children in up to seven arrangements in one day. One thing this does for a child is it never allows enough backdrop of safety and certainty to begin to play or explore. It hurts the developing psyche and it hinders the imagination.
In the health arena, around 10 percent of our children -- 70,000 -- don't have health insurance. They are the ones who end up in hospital rooms. They are the ones who end up missing school. Of the children who are not school-ready in our state, one out of seven is in poor health.
Q. Is poverty the reason for these serious problems?
A. We have a significant number of poor children located in pockets of Connecticut. We have higher numbers in our urban areas and significant poverty in our rural areas. For children in poverty the dropout rate is twice as high. The lead poisoning rate is three to four times greater. Teen pregnancy is five to seven times more likely.
We have 110,000 children in poverty. These children are on A.F.D.C.
What we need to do particularly with welfare reform is to make sure that these children have quality environments to go to when their parents are in job training or working. Parents worry if their children aren't in safe environments. The parents have trouble concentrating and they worry that their children aren't getting their fair share. They won't benefit the same as children in "Cadillac" programs. They are right because we now know that the quality of care giving influences language, social skills and learning.
Q. What is the commission's current priority?
A. Prevention, beginning with the earliest years. The core focuses of the commission are prevention with interest in early intervention, capacity building to help people work substantively on issues both on the state and local level and service integration so we are not cutting the baby into 20 pieces.
Q. What is service integration? Why is it so important?
A. Because of marginal funding we have a host of programs that address children's needs but they aren't integrated. So one program deals with health, another with child care, and another with after school. Current policies encourage the fragmentation of service delivery which isn't how children thrive. I think with the increasing budget cuts that we are going to see, the day of service integration is about the hit us.
Q. How serious a problem is teen pregnancy in Connecticut?
A. There is a significant correlation between teen pregnancy, school failure, welfare dependency and unemployment. Teen moms lose their ladder to career and opportunity. Often the child of a teen mother is at risk because of low birth weight and poverty. The baby doesn't get parental guidance and nurturing. Two generations end up being hurt.
We have the highest rate of teen pregnancy of any Western industrialized country. In Connecticut we have one of the highest rates of teen births. At 23 percent the rate of teen births in Hartford in 1993 was more than double that of New York City. We have the highest incidence of teen pregnancy in Hartford, Windham, New London and Bridgeport.
Q. Are teen mothers responsible for the majority of social problems afflicting the state's children?
A. Teen moms are not the cause of our nation's ills; rather, it is the opposite. It is emblematic of our society's abandonment of children. People blame teen parents for many of the social ills in the United States. That's overdone. Our teen pregnancy rate has actually gone down. In 1990 there were 4,026 teen births. By 1993 it had declined to 3,655.
We are seeing repetition of the pattern with teen parents giving birth to children who become teen parents. There are multiple causes. One is a sense of no future. The severity of violence and the sense that one won't live for many years is increasing the number of urban children who feel one way to have a sense of future is to have a child. There is a higher incidence of teen pregnancy among families in poverty.
We are in terrible shape in this state in terms of statutory rape with 66 percent of the fathers being over 21. We are doing nothing. We recommended to the Governor that we seriously enforce statutory rape laws and that we target Hartford because it has the highest incidence.
Q. How serious a problem is lead paint in Connecticut?
A. Lead levels are high. People don't know that high lead levels affect I.Q., hearing and growth. Lead paint is found both in urban and rural areas because Connecticut has an old housing stock. If you have an old house you should pay attention. Be careful to avoid children's exposure to paint chips and paint dust. People need to get advice from their local health department before beginning renovations.
Q. Where do you stand on the issue of family values?
A. We do need a return to family values but I think that actually means a return to the social contract. Mass Mutual did a study of what the public meant by "family values." It was not about abortion or not abortion. It wasn't about the structure of the family -- two wage-earning family or single parent. It was about the social contract.
It was about whether or not you give to me and I give to you when we're in trouble. It was about whether or not you pick me up and I pick you up when we each fall. The public is concerned that there has been a decline in the social contract. We are simply not teaching good citizenship in a deep way, what someone else might call religious values.
What we really need to do is get back to caring about one another and caring for community. Parents want to make sure this is happening and fear it is not. We also hear from people that work in the state systems that they fear parents are not paying enough attention to this. This is crucial. When we see kids thrown out of windows of housing projects because they will not steal candy, something is very wrong.
The decline in the social contract has nothing to do with class. On the wealth end we have people just absolutely forgetting their family responsibilities, not being home, having au pairs. The number of children not being held and missing out on the routine, daily music of parents, is very high in this state. We're not getting back to basic values and basic caring.
Q. How can you get parents more involved in the fate of children?
A. We launched a Parent Leadership Institute. They had lots of good ideas but invariably they would say, "Who are we? We're just parents."
Parents are the untapped jewelry box in this state in terms of a key constituency to determine what needs to happen. They don't feel they have the right to be involved and they don't have the skills of democracy to know how to influence and effect change in government for children. The institute is in its fourth year and we have waiting lists because parents are so eager to participate.

HEADLINE: Legislators Pass Bill Assessing Property

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE

 BODY:
A BILL to have Westchester reassess all its property and establish a system that shifts the burden of taxation away from homeowners has cleared what may be its last major hurdle.
The bill, advocated by a bipartisan coalition of county and state Legislators as well as County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, was approved last week by the Democratic-controlled New York State Assembly. Earlier in the month, it was approved by the Republican-controlled State Senate and was endorsed by the County Board of Legislators. 
 If signed into law, as is expected, by Gov. George E. Pataki, the bill will be subject to approval by the County Board a second time. In the vote earlier in the month, the board was divided 10-7.
"This has been a long time in coming, and is still many years off from being implemented," said Philippe M. Gille, senior executive assistant to Mr. O'Rourke. "But at least at some point property taxes in this county will make sense."
Property in Westchester County is currently assessed by towns and cities, with assessors using different methods and assessing at different percentages of full value.
Proponents of the revaluation, who often call it "reval," say that many parcels have not been reassessed for years and that there are large disparities in taxes paid by owners of nearly identical parcels. The inequity of the tax-assessing system has led many owners of large commercial parcels as well as those of small residential ones to appeal successfully to officials or the courts for a tax reduction. This has led to an eroding of the tax base of the county as well as its local governments and school districts.
Westchester County annually pays out about $12 million in tax refunds; the local governments and school districts have had to make proportionately similar refunds.
Opponents of the revaluation fear the shift of the tax burden that the approved legislation will cause. The Builders Institute of Westchester and the County Chamber of Commerce were among a number of businesses that unsuccessfully lobbied the County Board against the plan, contending primarily that it allows businesses to be taxed at a higher rate than homeowners.
"If adopted and implemented, we believe it will seriously impact the county's economic growth potential and further erode the county's existing employer base," said Harold E. Vogt, president of the Chamber, in a letter to the Board.
Others expressed concern that the proposal did not adequately protect owners of cooperatives and condominiums.
Asked about these concerns, Mr. Gille said: "To the extent business says it is an attempt to shift the burden away from homeowners, that's true. But the Westchester business community has got to realize that if we continue to tax homeowners out of Westchester County there will be no one here to work for them or to buy their products." He called the suggestion that condominium and cooperative owners were not protected a "scare tactic."
The proposal calls for the following:
*All property in the county would be reassessed at full value during a three-year period. The estimated cost of this reassessment, $12 million to $25 million, will be paid for by the county. No changes in assessment rolls will be made until the entire county is reassessed.
*Once the assessments are completed, the information will be delivered to each taxing jurisdiction. This includes the county, towns and school districts that do not fall in one community. These taxing districts have the option of establishing a classification system for taxation. Under classification, homeowners, including owners of condominiums and cooperatives, can be charged a lower tax rate than businesses. Commercial property owners can see their taxes go up 25 percent, while homeowners can come down 25 percent, Mr. Gille said.
*Tax increases due to reassessment will be phased in over five years.
*For the purpose of setting taxes, all homeowners are given a 30 percent reduction on their property value (up to $35,000 in value) to offset any tax shift.
*Eligibility for tax exemptions for the elderly are expanded by allowing Westchester to use a higher income threshold for qualification.
The bill in the Assembly was sponsored by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh. Mr. Brodsky last year opposed a similar proposal but supported the plan this year after he amended it to protect homeowners further.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST HARLEM;
Pathmark Delayed as New $1 Million Loan Is Sought

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON

 BODY:
A year ago the Pathmark supermarket proposed for 125th Street and Lexington Avenue was debated not just in East Harlem but all over the city, and the subsidies, including grants and low-interest loans, that the project would receive were a focus of opponents' anger.
Now, groundbreaking, originally set for this summer, has been delayed at least until fall and possibly next spring, while the developers, a consortium of nonprofit groups called the East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle, await approval on an additional $1 million low-interest loan from an Empire State Development Corporation fund to finance job-creating public and private partnerships in economically distressed areas. State officials say approval is expected. The project's developers say they need the money to cover construction costs. 
 The request for more money has refueled some bitterness that local supermarket owners harbor toward the project. It is part of a $12 million financing package, about half of which includes government and private grants, a $1.5 million city loan at 1 percent interest, and promised tax breaks.
"Why are they getting additional money?" asked Richard Lipsky, who represented independent store owners in their unsuccessful fight to block city approval of the Pathmark. "We want the state to come up with a low-interest fund to encourage local entrepreneurship and to refinance all supermarket debt at 3 percent."
Luis Salcedo, the owner of the Bravo supermarket at 126th Street and Fifth Avenue, asked, "Why subsidize a big company when big companies abandoned this neighborhood?"
"There is so much that we could do with $12 million," Mr. Salcedo said. "Everyone talks about how we need a supermarket. What about education and housing? The taxpayers subsidized this project. I don't blame Pathmark, I blame the government. What we want is a level playing field."
A year ago, Community Board 11 passed a resolution that any project it approved had to guarantee that 25 percent of jobs would be filled by people from the neighborhood, where unemployment is 16 percent. Pathmark has promised that its project will go further, bringing 75 percent of the 200 post-construction jobs to East Harlem.
But owners of small neighborhood supermarkets and bodegas point out that since at least some, if not many, of their businesses will be forced to close in the face of Pathmark's competitive advantage, the loss of jobs could cancel out that benefit. "If it opens up, we will be out of business," Mr. Salcedo said.
One of East Harlem's major supermarket owners, Alfredo Rodriguez, sold the larger of his two Associated Supermarkets, at 122d Street at Third Avenue, immediately after the Pathmark deal was approved because he feared the store would lose value once Pathmark opened. The market is still open, under a new owner, and in the wake of the Pathmark delay, Mr. Rodriguez is holding on to his other store at 116th and Lexington. "I'm hanging in there to see if it gets built," he said. JANET ALLON

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN;
Coliseum 'Shrinks' to Gasps

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The scene was like "Gulliver's Travels" meets "The Fountainhead." A giant architect looms over Manhattan and plucks the Coliseum, a legal, political and economic sore spot for nearly a decade, from Columbus Circle. He substitutes a sleeker and larger building complex.
In reality, the giant was a lanky architect, William Donohoe, working for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Coliseum. Last week, with the help of a three-dimensional cardboard model, Mr. Donohoe described the authority's latest guidelines for development of the Coliseum site. 
 The goal is to sell the building while avoiding the wrath of neighborhood advocates from the Upper West Side, Clinton and midtown, who had argued that earlier proposals cut off light and air and increased traffic congestion in Columbus Circle and surrounding blocks.
To Mr. Donohoe and other M.T.A. officials, the cardboard model represented how far the agency had come. But to the skeptical advocates, whose protracted lawsuit had helped to scuttle earlier development plans, the model was a map of how much farther the agency has to go.
When Mr. Donohoe removed the model of the million-square-foot Coliseum and inserted a mock-up of the first proposed replacement, a 925-foot-tall, 2.7-million-square-foot complex, the audience of community groups and others gasped at its size. They also shook their heads at what appeared to be only slightly smaller versions -- an 850-foot-tall complex and one at 752 feet. All three proposals, by Mortimer Zuckerman's Boston Properties, foundered in 1994, when Mr. Zuckerman and the city could not agree on a sales price.
The M.T.A's latest guidelines call for a complex no taller than 750 feet and no larger than 2.1 million square feet. And there are requirements intended to assuage community groups. Trucks, for example, would be unloaded away from Columbus Circle, to avoid slowing already sluggish traffic.
But Olive Freud, a neighborhood leader who was active in the 1989 lawsuit to stop the Coliseum project, was not satisfied. The complex, she said, would still be too tall and too big. "You think you've taught these people a lesson and they keep coming back," she said later. But she acknowledged that more litigation might be difficult to mount. "People get tired," she said.
Ross Graham, the head of a committee to review the Coliseum project for three community boards, said she has to "see how far the Mayor is supportive" of the M.T.A. proposal. As for the complex that could be built under the guidelines, "It's still awfully tall." ANTHONY RAMIREZ

Expectantly, York Awaits New Leader

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII

 BODY:
After a trying 14 months that saw the departures of one president and two acting presidents at York College, a student confrontation with the police and a significant budget cut, students and faculty members spoke optimistically last week about the impending arrival of their new president, Dr. Charles C. Kidd Sr.
"The morale is low on campus," said Andrea Jones, a sophomore majoring in social work at York, which is part of the City University. "We need someone to come in and give us a booster shot. He's done some creative things. You need somebody who can not only bring changes but also bring money." 
 Dr. Kidd, an environmental scientist, was most recently vice president of Florida A & M University. His academic specialty is a strong part of York's curriculum, and he has experience in community development. In a telephone interview from his home in Tallahassee, Fla., Dr. Kidd, 59, said he had accepted the presidency of York despite his knowledge of past troubles.
"We need to move beyond these problems very quickly," he said.
He said his priorities were to tap public funds for proposed expansion projects, to review plans for a joint program with the Food and Drug Administration and to improve communication between students, faculty and the administration.
Hubert Keen, the provost, said the college had suffered because of the lack of continuity during the transition. "We have suffered in gaining funds for planning," he said.
York College's troubles began in February 1995, when its president, Josephine D. Davis, was forced to resign amid allegations of financial improprieties. Last December, the acting president, Thomas K. Minter, resigned one month after a standoff between students, the police and college administrators over allowing Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former aide to Louis Farrakhan, to deliver an address. The college gave in to the wishes of black and Hispanic students, who make up 65 percent of the student body, and he spoke.
Dr. Minter's successor, Marcia V. Keizs, worked to improve relations with students and to help finalize a master development plan, but she alienated a part of the faculty with her retrenchment plans.
Dr. Kidd "was the first choice among the finalists we were presented with," said Dr. Alan Cooper, a professor of English who is the faculty caucus leader and one of three faculty representatives who served on the search committee.
Carlisle Towery, executive director of the Greater Jamaica Redevelopment Corporation, said Dr. Kidd's impact would extend beyond York into neighborhood redevelopment.
Despite severe budget cuts that have already whittled the full-time faculty from 167 members to 159 in the last five years and removed $2.1 million from the operating budget of $24 million in 1995, Dr. Kidd will have to implement an ambitious master development plan that calls for enrollment to increase to as much as 10,000 from 6,500 by the year 2002. The plan also provides for business development of the college's boundaries on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, a student center, expansion of the library and more parking.
"We have a number of strong departments and programs," he said. "We need to take advantage of the existing strengths and meet occupational needs obvious in urban areas such as Queens." JANE H. LII

HEADLINE>Small Group in Hamilton Keeps a Mega-Store Out of Town

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: HAMILTON

 BODY:
Until recently, the people of this sprawling suburb of Trenton had no reason to recognize Connie Silakoski. Then Mrs. Silakoski, a homemaker and mother of three, waged a battle against the nation's largest discount chain. These days, she is known as the woman who fought off Wal-Mart.
When Mrs. Silakoski, who lives on a cul-de-sac partly sheltered by woods and fields, learned that the retail giant was planning to build a store a half-mile from her house, she spun into action. In May, with the help of some neighbors, she circulated petitions and organized a rally that drew several hundred residents. On the eve of the local Memorial Day parade, she posted anti-Wal-Mart signs along the route. 
 "We were looking at the possibility of 90,000 cars a week passing through our residential neighborhood, where our children play," Mrs. Silakoski said, based on the results of a traffic study done by the town.. "It was too close to home for me to just sit back and let it happen."
Her efforts paid off: 10 days ago, the town planning board unanimously voted against rezoning two pieces of land on Yardville-Hamilton Square Road, just off Interstate 195, for commercial use. And Hamilton, population 87,000, became the latest of several towns that have fought Wal-Mart's efforts to establish a foothold in Central and North Jersey. Betsy Reithemeyer, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company still planned to build a store somewhere in the vicinity.
"There are many cases where someone is going to be opposed," Ms. Reithemeyer said. "But the majority is usually tickled. They want the additional tax revenue."
Wal-Mart has 14 stores in New Jersey, almost all are in the southern counties, where land is more available and less expensive. The northernmost stores are both on busy Route 1, in North Brunswick and Princeton. Although developers have tried to bring other Wal-Marts to North Jersey in recent years, the proposals keep falling through. Increasingly, the problem is opposition from homeowners like Mrs. Silakoski, who say a mega-store in their backyard would destroy their peace of mind, not to mention their property values.
In Raritan Township, Hunterdon County, plans for a Wal-Mart are on hold because of a disagreement between two property owners, said Robert Kren, the town planner. Meanwhile, a number of residents have expressed concern about the proposal, he said. In 1992, Paramus rejected plans for a Sam's Club warehouse store, part of a separate chain owned by Wal-Mart, because of local opposition.
"A lot of the suburban towns are going to be worried about traffic, congestion, perceived quality of life," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "Wal-Mart is going to have the most luck in towns that are desperately seeking ratables."
New Jersey is not the only Northeastern state Wal-Mart has set its sights on; it has focused on the entire region in recent years after several decades of expansion in the South and Midwest. (The company has more than 2,800 stores altogether, with annual sales of $93 billion last year.) It has opened 53 stores in Pennsylvania, 51 in New York and 6 in Connecticut, said a spokesman at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. While the stores have brought jobs and shoppers, they have also threatened the livelihood of small, local businesses, a factor that has brought citizens and business owners out in protest.
Resistance to Wal-Mart comes at a time when discount retailers are still thriving in New Jersey. Richard Brunelli, who owns a retail-leasing firm in Old Bridge, said the demand for "big box" retail stores, which take up more than 100,000 square feet, was stronger than ever. The financial struggles of smaller discount chains, like Jamesway and Caldor, have made room for more mega-stores, he said. But Wal-Mart cannot just take over the sites where these stores have closed, he said, because its stores are so much bigger. In most cases, he said, Wal-Mart would have to build from the ground up.
"Wal-Mart's success in North Jersey depends on its interest in dealing with very difficult planning boards and expensive real estate," Mr. Brunelli said. "They might not have the patience or the stomach to keep fighting it out."
In Hamilton, where only 18 percent of local tax revenues come from businesses, the Wal-Mart proposal was part of a larger plan to attract more retailers. (Developers had hoped to build a Home Depot down the street from the proposed Wal-Mart, but that plan was rejected, too.) The remaining 82 percent comes from residential property taxes, and municipal officials have warned that taxes will keep rising if the town does not attract more businesses.
John Bencivengo, executive director of the Hamilton Partnership, a nonprofit economic development group, said retailers had been "knocking down our door," and among other things, the town is considering a plan at the intersection of I-195 and Sloane Road for a 5,000-seat, 24-screen movie theater than could bring in $500,000 in ratables each year. The prospect of retail development still looms, since the town is rezoning two tracts of land along Route 130 (several miles from Mrs. Silakoski's house) from research-and-development to commercial use.
"Our town has been a bedroom community for years, and that has kept it clean and beautiful," Mr. Bencivengo said. "But if we don't bring in more businesses, the tax burden is going to make homeowners very unhappy."

Even in Slow-Motion, It's a Russian Revolution

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
WHEN the Soviet Union collapsed five years ago, many people not just Americans -- assumed that tomorrow had finally come to Russia. Just as Marxists view the withering of the state as a natural process of history, reformers regarded the end of Communist rule here as the final turn to the West.
They were wrong, of course, just as all those from Peter the Great on who would see Russia Westernized have always been wrong. But they weren't that wrong. Last week, despite fears of civil unrest, voter fraud and worse, 75 million citizens cast their ballots in independent Russia's first popular presidential election, which even fringe opposition groups acknowledge was free and fair. And on Thursday, under the kind of shadowy circumstances that have made the Kremlin an unparalleled touchstone of intrigue for hundreds of years, President Boris N. Yeltsin fired half of his top advisers at the insistence of the other half. 
 Only in Russia could a palace purge like that have democrats cheering in the streets.
 
 
 
Give It Time
 Watching the protracted and painful rebirth of this vast land is difficult for everybody. The place just doesn't fit any of the good-government notions of what a new democracy is supposed to look like. The media were totally rigged to support Mr. Yeltsin. It was nearly impossible to find on any wall in Moscow a poster of the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov. Television was shameless in its endless attacks on the Communist past. But 20 years ago ward heelers from New York to Chicago got paid good money to keep the faces of rival candidates out of view, too.
So Russia is not a textbook democracy yet. It won't be one next year either. It may never happen. But there is still a revolution going on here right now; it's just not the type that happens in a week or a year. You can't even televise it, because this revolution will last at least a generation some people feel the future course of the nation won't begin to be clear until the people born after 1991 are old enough to run it.
"When the Berlin Wall fell down and then the Soviet Union disappeared, we all felt that the world was changed forever in every possible way," said Anatoly I. Antonov, head of the department of family sociology at Moscow State University. "Then we caught our breath. What we saw was the theoretical opportunity to take advantage of great change. But for most people there was no real way to do it. Humans can't move that fast. It may sound cruel, but the old generation will have to die before we can look at what is before us. This country is going to be divided for quite a while."
That was apparent from the first round of presidential voting last week. Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Zyuganov came in practically tied, and will face each other in a runoff on July 3.
Old people, scared of change, disgusted by their new poverty and yearning for a return to stability, voted in huge numbers for Mr. Zyuganov, who promised that the past would carry his supporters to the future. In one of history's strange ironies, the very rural communities that once battled with mutinous fury to prevent the Bolsheviks from confiscating their private land have become the last redoubts of Communism.
In the past, the cities, with their mighty industries and large proletariats, were the primary focus of Communist ideology and organization. Cities offered a prospect of well-being and privilege that the countryside never could. It was on farms, throughout the country, where peasants starved to death in the fields during much of the forced transition to Communism earlier this century.
But cities voted heavily for Mr. Yeltsin this time around, an outcome brought about in part by new population shifts from farms to cities, now that people are allowed to move about freely. To this small but growing group of new migrants, Mr. Yeltsin has held out more hope than any leader in Russian history.
It may seem obvious, but it is worth noting that young people don't want much to do with the Communists. Three quarters of all people under the age of 35 (and a greater percentage in the cities) voted for one of the three main non-Communist candidates -- Mr. Yeltsin; former Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, the law-and-order candidate, or the economic reformer Grigory Yavlinsky. Most experts here assume that in the second round Mr. Yeltsin will win by attracting supporters of the other two, especially those of Mr. Lebed, the strong third-place finisher who after the voting threw his support to Mr. Yeltsin in return for the top national-security post in Mr. Yeltsin's Government.
 
 
 
The Actuarial Factor
 It may seem odd to write the Communists out of the future just after their standard-bearer received 32 percent of the vote, particularly when the first-place finisher, Mr. Yeltsin, received only 35 percent. But Russia is a country where old people are dying off rapidly. The average life expectancy here for men, 57, is the worst in the industrial world; for women it is 70 -- better, but still no match for the West. Twenty years from now, almost half of the people who voted for Mr. Zyuganov last week (and who will undoubtedly vote for him again in the second round of voting) will be dead.
 That means the future probably belongs to somebody other than the Communists.
But it does not necessarily belong to democrats.
 First of all, Mr. Yeltsin is still detested widely here -- and he has not exactly been a fabulous advertisement for democracy. Even those liberal and young people who opposed Mr. Zyuganov frequently embraced some parts of his program. Most people here are suspicious of private property, wonder what was so bad about a system that supplied health care at low cost from birth to death, and hope that prices are once again reined in by the government. Those are ideas of social democrats, and if Mr. Zyuganov had emphasized them instead of spending so much time explaining all of Stalin's achievements he would likely have fared better in the first round of voting.
"We all know the old Communists are going to be gone in 20 years," said Roman Artemiev, the political editor of Daily Kommersant, which has become here something like what The Wall Street Journal is in the United States: essential reading for aspiring entrepreneurs, youthful tycoons and savvy managers. "What we don't know is what will come after them," Mr. Artemiev added. "Although that is not overtly the point of this election, it is the bottom line. If the Communists do manage to win they can create something new for themselves. If they lose, the numbers say they will lose forever. Then we will just have to find a future for ourselves."

HEADLINE: All News, Almost All Profit, All the Time

BYLINE: By ROBIN D. SCHATZ 

 BODY:
Every morning, Edmond Garesche awakens in his Manhattan apartment to WCBS-AM, one of the city's three all-news radio stations, and listens for about two hours, as he lies in bed half-awake and then as he gets dressed for his job producing World Wide Web sites.
Mr. Garesche, 29, could surf the Internet to get the news he needs. He could turn to local news cable stations like New York 1 or national services like the Cable News Network and Headline News. Or, he could read a newspaper. 
 But Mr. Garesche, like millions of other Americans, remains a loyal listener of all-news radio, a staple of the nation's news diet since the 1960's.
Nothing satisfies the need for news as efficiently as an all-news radio station, said Mitchell Stephens, a New York University journalism professor, who has written about the history of broadcasting. "The radio niche is safe. As the baby boom ages and gets a little bored with hearing the same songs over and over again, these information formats become, for a while, even more attractive."
Fewer than four dozen stations in the country describe themselves as all-news, 11 of them owned by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, according to Arbitron, which provides ratings of radio broadcasters.
That is lower than in the 1970's and 80's; many stations have switched to what is known as a news-and-talk format, providing blocks of news in the morning and evening "drive times," with talk shows in the afternoon, evening and overnight.
While successful all-news stations thrive in virtually every major market, only a handful of cities support more than one. Washington once had three; now it has only WTOP-AM, owned by the Evergreen Media Corporation, and is struggling, ranking 15th in the market in the latest Arbitron ratings.
For many radio operators, the costs of all-news programming are just too high. Where a talk show pays its hosts and a music station its disk jockeys, a station providing 24 hours of news a day needs a team of journalists, a fleet of vehicles, a substantial amount of portable equipment and subscriptions to wire services.
Yet the all-news format remains attractive because it commands premium advertising rates, drawing a demographically attractive audience. Advertisers believe that listeners pay more attention to the content than they do to music stations, and all-news stations carry more advertising than music stations.
Generally, those who listen to all-news take that news in fairly small doses -- not surprising, given the repetitive nature of the format. Yet these stations have strong cumulative audiences, which Arbitron defines as the numbers of people who in the course of a week listen to a station for at least five minutes.
"This is the most stable and profitable format in radio," said Walter Sabo, a consultant in Manhattan.
In New York City, WINS-AM, which finished sixth in the latest ratings (WCBS-AM was seventh), reported advertising revenue last year of $29.3 million, making it the second-highest-grossing station in New York after the sports station WFAN-AM, and the third-highest-grossing station in the country, according to Duncan's Radio Market Guide. (The top-ranked station nationally is WGN-AM in Chicago.)
WINS abandoned rock-and-roll and switched to all-news in April 1965, and in November of that year made its mark as an important source of news when the Northeast was blacked out. Two years later, WCBS-AM converted to all-news.
Since last August, the two stations have been owned by Westinghouse, which paid $5.4 billion to acquire CBS Inc. (Last week, Westinghouse vastly increased its radio holdings, agreeing to pay $3.9 billion for Infinity Broadcasting, which has virtually no all-news programming.)
Westinghouse executives maintain that the merger with CBS has had no effect on program decisions at the all-news stations, which have competed vigorously for decades.
"Having two all-news stations in a market enables listeners to make choices," said Dan Mason, the CBS radio division president, "and that's the hallmark of local radio. We provide two types of services, similar to CNN and Headline News, if you will, and our audiences tell us there's room for and interest in both." Headline News reports the top news every 30 minutes; CNN adds in-depth coverage, features and commentary.
The CBS deal also left Westinghouse with the two major all-news stations in Los Angeles, KNX-AM and KFWB-AM. Roger Nadel, now vice president and general manager of KFWB, remembers the days when the station fought it out with CBS's KNX, which he ran from 1976 to 1989.
"With the change in ownership, I don't feel like that's who we're competing with anymore," he said. "My mission is to create new listeners, not compete for the same news listeners we've always had.
"If a million people are listening to KFWB and a million to KNX, that means nine million people aren't. My mission is to get those other nine million who aren't using news on the radio to understand the benefits of it."
In the New York metropolitan area, WINS is stronger in the five boroughs, nearby parts of New Jersey and Nassau County, where its signal is clearest, the general manager, Scott Herman, said; WCBS-AM does better in the rest of the area.
A third news station was established in New York three years ago, when Bloomberg L.P., which compiles business data and offers various news services, bought an AM station, renaming it WBBR.
The station has never done well in the ratings, and recently began cutting back on its stock market reports, increasing traffic and weather coverage. In the most recent Arbitron report, WBBR ranked 35th, with 342,000 listeners a week, compared with 2.4 million at WINS and 2 million at WCBS-AM.
Mr. Herman said he was not worried about Bloomberg as a competitor and had no plans to change a formula that has served well against WCBS for decades.
"We're quicker in our approach and very thematically consistent," he said. "We do the same thing every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week."

HEADLINE: Andreas Papandreou, Greek Leftist Who Admired and Annoyed U.S., Dies at 77

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

 BODY:
Andreas Papandreou, the former Prime Minister of Greece and a maverick who towered over Greek political life for more than two decades, died yesterday in Athens. He was 77.
His symptoms "were compatible with a heart attack, which finally caused his death at 2:30 A.M.," his doctors said in a statement. 
 Open heart surgery in 1988 had left Mr. Papandreou weakened, although it did not stop him from entering and winning elections for the third time in 1993.
But during 1995, his failing health prevented him from performing the normal duties of Government, leaving Greece flailing. He worked at home for just a few hours a day and rarely appeared in public. Yet even as his fiery voice, which could mesmerize the nation, had thinned to a near whisper and he walked with great difficulty, Mr. Papandreou refused to step aside or name a deputy to run the Government.
Finally, in January, his Socialist Party named Costas Simitis as Prime Minister, and Mr. Papandreou had not been seen in public since his release from a hospital on March 21 after a four-month stay.
Few other politicians in modern Greece have inspired as much love and loathing at home and as much bewilderment and irritation abroad. The tall figure with bushy eyebrows fascinated Greeks with his compelling oratory and his unpredictable and volatile ways, and even though he became as familiar as a close relative, he remained hard to fathom even for his friends.
He was successful at home because he appealed to Greece's thirst for change, and his nationalist polemics appealed to the Greeks' perennial feeling of being misunderstood and unappreciated.

Maverick Stances Angered His Allies
Abroad, Greece's Western allies were befuddled or exasperated as the undoctrinaire Socialist took positions diametrically opposed to theirs, on issues ranging from Serbian aggression in Bosnia to the role of NATO in the Mediterranean.
Above all, the United States loomed large in his life, for that was the country where he had served in the Navy, graduated from college, worked, married twice and had four children; it was his source of financing and the nation that he first admired and later railed against.
The core of his foreign policy was to end Greece's status as "a client state of the West." As a result, he refused to condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, campaigned against American military bases in Greece and variously threatened to pull out of NATO, the United Nations and the European Union, although he accepted the Union's generous funds.
He blocked European credits for Turkey, Greece's enemy. While others shunned Libya and Yugoslavia, he improved his ties there. In the Bosnian war he supported Serbia, a neighbor and longtime ally, and opposed international sanctions against Serbia. He was reluctant to condemn Serbian atrocities, even in the face of ample evidence.
Mr. Papandreou thrived on being contrary. He described this as "tightrope diplomacy." Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was especially skillful at profiting and extracting funds from fearful Western governments that wanted to strengthen Greece's capitalist system and protect Europe's southeastern flank in the Communist Balkans. Despite his polemics, he remained pro-Western.

A Family Tradition Of Populist Politics
The only son of Sophia and George Papandreou, Andreas George Papandreou was born on Feb. 5, 1919, on Chios, while his father served at the time as governor general of the Aegean Islands.
When Andreas was 5, his parents were divorced, and he and his mother moved to Athens. But he stayed in touch with his father, who rose in politics and became a powerful and popular leader, eventually becoming Prime Minister.
In 1937, when Andreas entered Athens University Law School, Greece was ruled by a right-wing dictator, Gen. Ioannis Metaxas, and his father and other liberals were banished to the island of Andros. Andreas, by then a Trotskyite, joined a resistance group that distributed underground newspapers and pamphlets, for which he was arrested and tortured.
Shortly before Mussolini's troops entered Greece, Andreas Papandreou left for New York, where he arrived in May 1940 with $14 in his pocket. He enrolled at Columbia University and took odd jobs to support himself. He married a Greek-American, Christine Rassias, in 1941 and earned a doctorate in economics at Harvard University in 1943. The marriage ended in divorce a decade later.
After becoming an American citizen, Mr. Papandreou joined the Navy for two years of wartime service, much of which he spent as a clerk in the Bethesda Naval Hospital. When World War II ended, he started his career as a lecturer in economics, first at Harvard then at the University of Minnesota and Northwestern University. He eventually became a professor and the chairman of the department of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, until he resigned in 1963.
Meanwhile he had met Margaret Chant, of Elmhurst, Ill., a former journalism student. After both obtained divorces, they were married in Nevada in 1951. They settled down in Berkeley, raised three sons and a daughter and became actively involved in liberal American politics.
It was with the help of American funds that Mr. Papandreou returned to Greece. Supported by Guggenheim and Fulbright grants, he spent 1959 studying the Greek economy. He went to Athens again in 1961 to set up the new Center for Economic Research, this time with financing from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. He handed back his American citizenship in 1964 to run for Parliament under the auspices of his father, the Prime Minister. Later that year his father named him Deputy Minister of Economics.
But King Constantine, who distrusted both Papandreous, dismissed the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The period of instability that followed led to a right-wing military coup in 1967, and both Papandreous were arrested. The younger Papandreou was kept in solitary confinement for eight months.
Again the United States loomed large. Pressure from influential Americans, including the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, led the military junta to release Andreas Papandreou and other political prisoners in 1967. But from exile, first in Sweden, then in Canada, Mr. Papandreou organized a coalition of opposition groups and denounced the American Government for "complicity" in the coup. He remained convinced that Washington quietly supported the 1968-74 military dictatorship.
In a 1972 article in The New York Times, he wrote that the United States approved prime ministers, interfered in elections and in military promotions and "controlled the Greek Intelligence Service."
In 1974, when Greece was traumatized by Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus, he and many others were convinced once again that Washington knew about the Turkish military plans and could have stopped them. The belief that in general Washington favored Turkey over Greece in their perennial squabbling fed more anti-Americanism.

Party Transformed Greece's Landscape
The party he founded in 1974, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, changed Greece's political landscape. It brought him -- and the left -- to power in 1981. Describing himself as a "nondogmatic Marxist" he quickly introduced social reforms that benefited low-income groups, promoted workers' councils and farmers' cooperatives, abolished censorship, lowered the voting age to 18; prompted by his American wife, he brought legal equality for women.
As soon as he took office after the 1981 elections, Mr. Papandreou tweaked the West by opening a Greek Embassy in Cuba and granting diplomatic status to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Behind his neutralist gestures, Mr. Papandreou's foreign policy was cautious, almost conservative. He kept Greece in NATO, but refused to take part in some exercises. He preserved Greece's membership in the European Union, thus obtaining important agricultural subsidies that helped ensure his re-election in 1985. He also gave Washington what it had not been able to obtain from his right-wing predecessor: a five-year renewable agreement to retain four military bases and a number of smaller installations on Greek soil.
At home, many Greeks applauded him because he established civil marriage and legalized divorce and abortion. But his economic policy remained full of contradictions, and critics said that he squandered power, opportunities and money.
For all his calls for change and generous financial support of the European Union, Greece remains the Union's poorest nation. Of the $12 billion the Community lent Mr. Papandreou in the 1980's to modernize, diplomats in Brussels said 80 percent was spent on consumption and salaries for political featherbedding.
As opposition leader and as Prime Minister, he lashed out against the corruption of his predecessors, but his own government unraveled in the late 1980's in a series of scandals involving fraud and telephone-tapping.
His prestige also suffered because he publicly flaunted his affair with Dimitra Liani, a flight attendant half his age, while he was still married to his wife of 38 years. After humiliating publicity, Margaret Papandreou, the mother of his four adult children, agreed to a divorce in 1989.
By late 1989, he could no longer withstand the cascade of scandals and he lost the elections. Parliament indicted Mr. Papandreou and ordered him and four of his former ministers to stand trial on charges including bribery and embezzlement. He repeatedly protested his innocence, saying that American agents were trying to "destabilize" Greece and that his opponents were out to destroy him politically.
Mr. Papandreou was narrowly acquitted in 1992, but two of his ministers were convicted.
Yet on Oct. 10, 1993, Mr. Papandreou made an astonishing comeback. Though he had recently had a heart operation, taken Ms. Liani as his third wife, built a mansion costing more than $1 million and never quite shaken off corruption charges, he won election for the third time.
This was perhaps his most remarkable trait, the ability to change position and survive scandal and indictment without losing popularity.
"He was an amazing politician," said Nicholas Gage, author of several books on Greece and a former New York Times correspondent there. "He made ordinary people feel they mattered. Above all he was a master at tapping the mood of the moment and at adapting his views to that."

Progress Overtaken By Host of Scandals
During his 10 years in office, he modernized Greece, but not enough to pull it from the doldrums. Rather than cutting back the country's enormous and rigid bureaucracy, he bloated it further to capture votes. Although Mr. Papandreou inherited a patronage system where a politician is expected to provide a job for every supporter, many economists agree that he did little to change this; some say he expanded it.
Some of Mr. Papandreou's supporters believe that his successes and his strong leadership in balancing an unruly society have been unfairly overshadowed by his governments' financial scandals and by troubles involving his wives.
Although extramarital affairs are common in Greek politics, Mr. Papandreou broke the rules by publicly displaying his liaison with Ms. Liani. Greek women, in particular, did not pardon this affront to his wife, a strong voice for social reform and women's rights.
In 1995, he was criticized by supporters and opponents for naming his new wife director of his office and giving her much power over access to him. He caused further outcry by saying he would support her if she had political ambitions.
The fallout was intense. One result was that his longtime ally, George Kouris, publisher of the newspaper Avriani, regularly published nude pictures of a young Ms. Liani, hoping to undermine the Prime Minister and to block her political career.
Last year, friends said, even as his health was waning, Mr. Papandreou aspired to become President -- a largely ceremonial post -- when Constantine Karamanlis's term expired in May. But the struggle to succeed Mr. Papandreou as party and Government leader was so fierce that he reportedly feared a breakup of the party and renounced his aspiration.
Over the years, he published a number of articles and books on economic and political themes, including the successful "Democracy at Gunpoint" and "Paternalistic Capitalism."
In addition to his wife, Ms. Liani, he is survived by his four children from his second marriage, to Margaret Chant: George, who is Greece's Minister of Education, Sophia, Nicholas and Andreas.

In Canada, concerns about consolidation.

BYLINE: By Clyde H. Farnsworth 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
IN his 1993 memoir "A Life in Progress," the publisher Conrad M. Black describes his efforts to clean up a local lake when he was the co-proprietor of his first weekly newspaper east of Montreal.
"Like Orson Welles in 'Citizen Kane' saying, 'People will think what I tell them to think,' " he wrote, "I launched a violent campaign against the 'mismanagers of the dying lake.' " The lake was cleaned up. 
 A quarter-century later, Mr. Black, 51, who now controls 58 of Canada's 104 daily newspapers and 40 percent of the nationwide circulation, insists that Charles Foster Kane is no longer his role model.
"The only way to build and maintain a great newspaper franchise is to earn and maintain a reputation for fairness, liveliness and insight," he said in a brief interview after the annual meeting of Hollinger Inc., his publishing group, earlier this month.
Hollinger has grown into the western world's third-largest newspaper chain after the Gannett Company and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and with its latest deal to acquire the Southam chain's 20 Canadian dailies, Mr. Black has been pointedly criticized by some Canadians for his domination of the newspaper industry and his shedding of jobs.
 Although Canada's antitrust watchdogs have given Mr. Black a green light, some public officials and union officers express worry.
"There's absolutely no printed voice in my region that doesn't track back to Conrad Black," said John Bryden, a Liberal Member of Parliament from the southern Ontario district of Hamilton-Wentworth, where Hollinger owns the daily and four weeklies.
Tom Kent, a former federal official who headed a royal commission on newspapers in 1981, says, "What we're going to get, I'm afraid, is editors all in the image of how Conrad Black sees how the newspaper business should be."
Mr. Black is a man of strong, conservative views, about, for example, the benefits of free enterprise and the dangers of big government, and is not at all bashful about expressing them. For many in a country that is traditionally more interventionist in economic and social policy than the United States, his views cut the wrong way.
As The Globe and Mail, a Toronto paper owned by the Thomson Corporation, noted editorially, "Much of the gnashing of teeth and rending of garments has, of course, not been about concentration at all: it has been about Conrad Black proper."
At the Hollinger annual meeting, Mr. Black denounced what he called a "cabal" of the old guard management at Southam.
"It has been our impression that Southam management long accepted inadequate returns for the shareholders, published generally undistinguished products for readers and received exaggerated laudations from the working press for the lack of financial and editorial rigor," he said.
In almost the same breath he chastised journalists, saying they "could stand a good solid elementary course in reporting, fairness, objectivity, giving people the benefit of the doubt, occasionally emphasizing the positive, not exciting the endemic Canadian spirit of envy."
Yet Mr. Black insists that he's the best friend of Canadian journalists. "In nearly 30 years of newspaper ownership, we have rarely sold and never closed a daily newspaper." No one else, he notes, is buying newspapers in Canada.
But some journalists are wary nonetheless. They fear that to pay for his takeovers he will "slash and burn the operations of these papers to get a quick profit," Peter Murdoch, a representative of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union, said at the Hollinger meeting.
Mr. Black responded that he had no plans to cut more staff. "There is pressure to get an adequate return, and an adequate return can be achieved chiefly by improving the quality of the product."
In addition to his Canadian holdings, Mr. Black controls The Chicago Sun-Times, 109 other American dailies, the Telegraph group in London, The Jerusalem Post and The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, as well as the leading papers in Vancouver, Edmonton, Ottawa and Calgary, and all the dailies in Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.
The Government has said it sees no threat to business competition in the newspaper industry, because, as Industry Minister John Manley told the House of Commons, Canadians are "surrounded by newspapers and other media and means of exchanging information."
Concentration is in part blamed on 1965 income tax legislation that bars Canadian advertisers from getting tax deductions from ads in foreign-owned publications. Foreign ownership is defined in the law as anything more than 25 percent, so the legislation has had the effect of keeping Canadian media in Canadian hands.
"That's something that the Government would want to take into account once we've had an adequate opportunity to look at whether that would in fact create additional sources of news and information," Mr. Manley said.
After the Hollinger annual meeting, Mr. Black asked, "If we're the only people buying, where am I a menace to the public interest?"

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Superstores Set Stage For the Political Sell

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New Yorkers want it all when it comes to shopping, says the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger. They want superstores with big selections and low prices, but they also want the cozy shops that give neighborhoods texture. They want all the possible economic blessings from New York City's plan to allow giant superstores into underused manufacturing zones, but none of the pinch if smaller stores get hurt by the competition.
And they should have it, according to a report to be issued today by Ms. Messinger's office. That, she says, means something of the rezoning plan should change. 
 But with officials in the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani united behind the rezoning plan, which is scheduled to come up for a vote before the Planning Commission this fall, Ms. Messinger's critique -- however minimal -- was creating a tempest in a shopping cart even before its official release.
Administration officials said that Ms. Messinger, like the shoppers she describes, is trying to have it all -- trying to increase her popularity in preparation for a mayoral run by hopping on the megastore bandwagon, and at the same time trying to pretend that she and Mr. Giuliani are not both moderates on the issue.
Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for economic development and planning, even mentioned having seen Ms. Messinger at the Fairway Market in Harlem, a mega-grocery store that serves as a symbol for both sides of the rezoning debate.
"I do find it a little ironic that Ruth likes to shop at Fairway," Ms. Reiter said. "She loves to shop at Fairway and I have run into her there. I would suggest that she may be making an issue where there isn't an issue."
Ms. Messinger, who maintains that big new supermarkets are not the kind of stores she has a problem with, says her report pinpoints real flaws in the rezoning plan.
"What's wrong is to stage this as the Oklahoma land rush," Ms. Messinger said. "The Mayor is devoting all his policy effort to make it possible for superstores to locate all over the city with no guidance -- as of right," she added. "We need to encourage superstore development, but not where it will hurt existing uses."
Ms. Messinger's report, based on a survey of shoppers and stores, concludes something that would be hard to dispute: that many smaller retailers feel threatened by the prospect of big store competition and that poorer New Yorkers are more dependent on those smaller stores.
It also says that the rezoning plan -- or the next Mayor of New York if it turns out to be her -- must shore up and protect that important base of small-store assets. The report offers many proposals for protecting smaller retailers but premises the need for that help on the storeowners' fears.
Ms. Reiter said that, while she has not seen the report, basing conclusions on what people believe or fear might happen because of rezoning is flawed methodology.
She said the studies by the administration had shown that despite small merchant's fears, there is evidence to the contrary -- that retailing expansion creates new opportunities for all sorts of companies. And she rejected the land-rush analogy, saying the Mayor's rezoning plan is moderate and targeted, limited only to certain kinds of manufacturing areas.
One of the central open questions of rezoning is whether more superstores would level the playing field between New York City and the suburbs or simply cannibalize the existing urban market.
Ms. Messinger's report concludes that small merchants believe that city superstores would directly compete with other city retailers, but it also concedes that perceptions by merchants in New York are a bit fuzzy when it comes to identifying their own problems.
For instance, of the retailers surveyed in Manhattan, for example, 62 percent said they believed they would lose business to stores in the suburbs. But only 37 percent of their customers say they actually ever go to the suburbs to shop. In Brooklyn, by contrast, only 27 percent of the retailers said the suburban stores were a threat, but 50 percent of their customers say they go beyond the city to shop.
"This is not drawing sides with the administration," Ms. Messinger said. "But we ought to focus on all the kinds of shopping that exist here, not just the kind that could have some potential for expansion -- customers say we need both."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: CAMPAIGN FINANCE;
Senate to Debate Bill to Ban 'Soft Money' From Elections

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
While President Clinton and Bob Dole shake the corporate and union trees for campaign money in New York on Monday, the Senate will begin debating legislation that would ban the practice and create voluntary limits on Congressional campaign spending.
For more than 70 years, corporations and unions have been barred from contributing to Federal elections -- at least in theory. But in recent years those entities, along with rich individuals, have gotten around the restrictions by giving vast sums to the political parties, which spend it for purposes other than winning Federal elections -- at least in theory. 
 Eliminating this kind of campaign cash, known as "soft money," is a major objective of the bill sponsored by Senators John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, and Russell Feingold, a Democrat of Wisconsin. The Republican National Committee strongly opposes this provision.
Mr. Feingold said last week that the soft-money provision was among the more popular in the bill and provoked a strong spirit of compromise. Other provisions, like the spending limits and the free broadcast time awarded by several networks to candidates who abide by them, are likely to meet opposition.
The Senate will debate the bill on Monday, and then vote on blocking a threatened filibuster on Tuesday. Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky who leads the opposition, says the measure is an unconstitutional abrogation of the public's right to "participate in the political process." He said he was confident the move to end debate would fail and the bill would die. Mr. Feingold disagreed, contending "we've got a chance" to get the 60 votes required, and Mr. McCain said their odds were improving.
House action is even less certain, with no debate scheduled before mid-July, which could move the debate into a time perilously close Election Day for such an intensely political measure.
In the meantime, both Mr. Clinton, who has endorsed the McCain-Feingold bill, and Mr. Dole, who has taken no position, are raising soft money as if reform were only a day away.
Each hopes to raise as much as $3 million on Monday, sums that could then be spent on vaguely defined party-building activities, which range from administrative costs at headquarters to registration drives.
Such soft-money contributions are skyrocketing, up by 103 percent from our years ago.
The corporate donors describe their motivations simply. Peggy Carter, director of legal, regulatory and science issues for RJR Nabisco, said, "Contributions are an ageless part of the democratic process in this country."
RJR Nabisco, the tobacco and food products conglomerate, gave $831,053 to the two parties in the 15 months ending March 31, 84 percent of it to Republicans. Ms. Carter refuted what she called a public "assumption all of a sudden someone is for sale" when corporations give such large sums to the parties. She contended that contributions "allow us to get our toe in the door" and "present our side of the issue."
At first, the post-Watergate election law of 1974 seemed to halt this kind of giving. Under that law, reporting requirements for donors, parties and candidates became stricter. Corporations and unions created political action committees that could accept no more than $5,000 from each donor.
But in 1988 Robert Farmer, treasurer of the Dukakis presidential campaign, figured out that there was no prohibition on raising money for "party-building." Using that logic, the Democrats were the first to raise "soft money," most of which was funneled to states that did not prohibit accepting union or corporate money.
When Republicans saw what Mr. Farmer was doing, they quickly followed suit, and the theoretical ban on corporate and union money began to fade away. Soft money clearly "comes from sources that the law sought to foreclose," said Anthony Corrado, a professor of political science at Colby College.
"This is the purest form of corruption," said Fred Wertheimer, the longtime advocate of campaign law change and former president of Common Cause. Pointing to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, as well as House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Vice President Gore, he said, "The most powerful players are out raising Watergate-size and Watergate-style contributions."
The McCain-Feingold bill would prohibit the national parties from touching contributions in excess of the Federal limits, meaning no corporate or union money whatsoever and no more than $20,000 from an individual.
In this election season, donations are up. Philip Morris Companies have contributed $1,687,478 to political parties during the 15 months ending March 31.
George Knox, a vice president at Philip Morris, said the conglomerate had given so much because "we hope to get good government out of participating in the process."
Mr. Knox said that while he could not say whether the threat of Food and Drug Administration action against cigarettes had influenced the size of the political contributions, Philip Morris did seek to "encourage those who are in general philosophical agreement with us, to sort of keep them going."
Mr. Knox said that 88 percent of its party money went to Republicans because "the Republican Party is generally more oriented toward business."
Arco, the oil, gas and chemical company, has given the parties $653,175 in the 15-month period, with 62 percent of it going to Republicans. Albert Greenstein, its director of media relations, said the donations helped Arco directly "in several ways. They let individuals know that Arco has an ongoing interest in the political process, a desire to participate and be consulted in major issues."
He said the donations gave Arco access to politicians "the same way that all contributors can get access." He said, "We're a very politically active committee. We're quite proud of that."
Alone as a bipartisan donor among the biggest givers is AT&T, which gave only 53 percent of its $705,684 to Republican party groups. Mike Brown, vice president for Federal legislation, said the company contributed in part because it wanted to sell long-distance service and computers to the parties.
"We're very ecumenical," he said. "We like to be seen as a good corporate citizen. We fund a great deal of activities, whether it's the Olympics or county fairs in Bergen, N.J."
Mr. Brown said the contributions were not a device to advance the company's interests in legislation. "I'm the chief legislative officer," he said, and "we have not to my knowledge been talking legislative issues with officers of the parties."
One of the few heavy donors to give more money to Democrats is Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. The liquor, beer and wine company gave 62 percent of its $460,000 in party gifts to Democrats. Amy Goldberger, media relations director for the company, refused to discuss contributions.
But even some critics of the system doubt the bill is the best solution. Professor Corrado, for example, said that he believed corporate campaign donations could never be suppressed. If it cannot, he said, "I'd rather see it all coming in to Washington" where it could be regulated.
Senator McConnell said that if the contribution limits were raised and then indexed to inflation, he might be able to support a soft-money ban. The current limits have been unchanged since 1974, even though inflation has reduced their value by at least two-thirds. Senator McConnell said he would insist that any limit on how much parties may spend to help candidates be eliminated by this bill.

HEADLINE: A Factory Is Losing Its Name. Workers Ask What's Left.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The New York Yankees never talked about the Boston Red Sox with the same venom that the 700 workers at the Farberware factory -- another Bronx fixture -- reserve for a Boston-based entrepreneur named Leonard Florence.
"He's an exterminator," said Jorge Rodriguez, a packaging worker who fears that the cookware plant, the borough's largest factory, will soon close forever. "He doesn't care about the people here. He just cares about money." 
 "He is a liquidator," added Ben Camadeco, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' local representing Farberware workers. "He is the worst individual I have ever come across."
This vitriol is aimed at the rags-to-riches entrepreneur who Farberware workers say has all but signed their factory's death warrant. Mr. Florence, who purchased Farberware's name and assets in April, says he is stunned and wounded by all the nastiness emanating from the Bronx.
After all, he has grown accustomed to acclaim, not disdain, as his reputation grows as a Boston philanthropist. Tufts University has named a lecture hall after him, he runs an annual fund raiser for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, and Pope John Paul II has named him a Knight of St. Gregory for his fund-raising for Catholic institutions.
To Mr. Florence, the Farberware situation is a horrible misunderstanding. Eager to save his reputation, he insists he is the workers' friend and sincere about cooperating with them to keep the plant open.
"I've spent years building my reputation -- someone didn't give it to me on a silver spoon," said Mr. Florence, chairman of the Syratech Corporation, which manufactures and markets silver goods. "And now I've really been beaten up."
Many workers say he deserves the thrashing because his decision to license the Farberware name to another cookware company means that the Bronx plant, the country's only Farberware factory, has scant chance of survival. They may still have the expertise and equipment to make pots and pans, but stripped of the Farberware name, they are convinced that stores will not stock their wares, shoppers will not buy them, and Mr. Florence will ultimately close the plant.
Many workers have a hard time holding back tears when they discuss their uncertain future. Carlos Rivera, a worker on the polishing line, talks of the factory as a "second home" and "second family." Khaleel Desaque, who has worked at Farberware for half his 48 years, fears he will no longer be able to afford college for his son if he loses his $25,000-a-year job. And Michael Filippou, a mechanic, is alarmed that he might lose his medical insurance before his wife gives birth this fall.
There is another potential victim, the South Bronx. Losing the squat, brick factory on Bruckner Boulevard and its $30 million annual payroll would be a stinging setback to a neighborhood that is beginning to climb back from the bottom.
When Syratech acquired Farberware's name and machinery, many workers looked to Mr. Florence as a savior for the struggling factory. At meetings with state, city and union officials, he proposed transforming the factory into an employee-owned plant that would supply Syratech with cookware to market.
"We were very upbeat," said George Miranda, a teamsters' official. "He said all the right things."
New York State tapped a financial expert, Eugene Keilin, to flesh out an employee-ownership plan that proposed ways to cut the plant's costs by more than $5 million each year to make it solidly profitable.
But when government and union officials met with Mr. Florence on May 31 to discuss the plan, he dropped the bombshell. He announced that Syratech had licensed the Farberware name for 200 years to another cookware company. He declined to disclose details, but word around the industry is he licensed the name to a Hong Kong manufacturer for a large profit.
The workers felt betrayed, that their company's soul had been sold. Many view his talk of making the factory employee-owned -- a plan he still stands behind -- as a hollow offer now that the cookware is shorn of its Farberware name.
"If he had said, 'I'm going to buy Farberware and do with it whatever I want to make the most money,' we wouldn't have been happy but we would have understood somewhat," said Harry Kokkinis, an economic adviser to the teamsters. "But, no, he approached us and said, 'Let's investigate this employee-ownership idea.' He carried on a cruel charade. He lied to us."
Mr. Florence's licensing move largely severs Farberware's ties to the city where an immigrant Russian peddler, Simon Farber, founded the company 99 years ago.
"If the poor man came back from his grave, he'd be ashamed about what's happening," said Pierre Zimmerli, who runs the factory's welding operations. "Someone could make good money with this factory, but without the Farberware name, we're kaput."
Government and union officials say that if the plant's previous owner, U.S. Industries, had only contacted them before selling Farberware's assets to Syratech, they could have come up with the money to buy the plant and guarantee its future.
"The message that everybody should take from this is, 'Please come to talk to us before these things happen,' " said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "There is a lot the city can do. It's a lot easier for us to do them before things reach the precipice."
City officials fear the workers' vituperative words will make Mr. Florence less willing to work with them to keep the plant alive. Indeed, he said in an interview, "If they continue to beat me up, I'll just take my machinery and go away."
An affable man known for his marketing expertise, he insists the workers can still make a go of it if they persuade a celebrity like Martha Stewart to put her name on the factory's cookware.
Mr. Florence loves to talk about how he started out shining shoes at age 12. A businessman was so impressed on meeting him that he paid his way through college and hired him afterward to turn around an ailing silver goods company. When he did, his boss awarded him with a half-stake in the company. By age 29, Mr. Florence was a millionaire.
He expanded that silver company by merging it with Towle, a silversmith dating from 1690. But in 1985, Towle stumbled badly, and he was fired as chairman. The next year, Mr. Florence founded Syratech, building it up to a $170 million company with 40 percent of the nation's silverware market. In 1990, he got his revenge against Towle by acquiring it for $20 million.
Mr. Florence said his decision to license the Farberware name was a smarter move for Syratech shareholders "than egotistically betting the company's entire Farberware investment on the self-confident assumption" that it could run the factory at a strong profit when previous owners were unable to.
As evidence that he is sincere about helping the workers, Mr. Florence points to his offer to lease the factory's machinery to them for three years rent-free so they can continue production. He says Syratech is willing to market the cookware, under whatever name.
The workers are perplexed by his assertions that they can salvage the plant when he had bad-mouthed it as a money-loser with uncompetitive costs. He said the factory's $15,000-a-week security bill and $12,000-a-week trash removal costs were exorbitant, and New York's electricity rates triple those of many other communities. Another problem was the lack of a warehouse nearby.
"The problem is they have not been competitive, nor have they been making money," he said.
Last year the factory barely broke even, although it sold a record $100 million worth of cookware. But Mr. Keilin said the plant can become profitable through his cost-cutting proposals, which include cutting the cost of trash removal by 40 percent, electricity by 25 percent, labor by 20 percent and security by 15 percent.
City, state and Federal officials have proposed another way to bolster profits by $1 million yearly. The Federal empowerment zone that covers parts of Manhattan and the Bronx could be redrawn to include the factory, a move that would provide a $4,000 yearly tax credit for each employee living in the zone.
"The big picture is you can operate this plant profitably," Mr. Keilin said. "Why weren't costs reduced in the past? It's because no one asked."
"New York will never be the manufacturing center it was in the first half of this century," he continued. "But there are a lot of things we can do here. We make up in skills, market access and transportation what we give up in costs."
City and state leaders are beseeching celebrities to lend their names to the factory's cookware and asking department stores to hire it to produce their cookware lines. So far, they have had only a few nibbles of interest.
"We're trying everything possible to keep it going," said Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official. "We've made an appeal to the business community to look into investing here. We're asking celebrities to step up to the plate. It is a dire situation. There are 700 good jobs on the line."

HEADLINE: An Ad Accuses Companies Of Overcharging for Drugs

BYLINE: By MARGARET ISA 

 BODY:
The wealthy Omaha industrialist Phil Sokolof, whose full-page newspaper advertisements in 1988 accused food marketers of poisoning Americans with saturated fats, is at it again. In a fresh round of ads that he said cost him more than $550,000, Mr. Sokolof is accusing Merck & Company of charging too much for cholesterol-lowering medications.
The new advertisement, with the headline "The Gouging of America," appears today in The New York Times on page A16, and is scheduled to appear in about 40 other major newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Sokolof said. 
 The advertisement chides Merck, whose cholesterol-lowering drugs Zocor and Mevacor generated $3.2 billion in sales in 1995, for raising prices again this year. "Merck, how greedy can you get?" the ad says.
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, also mentioned in the ad, makes the drug Pravachol. Telephone calls to the company seeking comment were not returned.
Mr. Sokolof, 73, said he has put more than $8 million into the National Heart Savers Association, which he founded in 1985, to wage a fight against cholesterol, after a 10-year Government study linked high cholesterol to heart attacks in 1984.
A spokesman for Merck, John Doorley, characterized Mr. Sokolof's latest campaign as "silly." He said the daily cost for an average dose of Zocor was about $2.50.
Mr. Doorley said his company wants more people to benefit from its medicines but prefers to attract customers through more conventional publicity. In response to Mr. Sokolof's ad, the company's written statement said that it takes a lot of time and money to develop medications and said Merck works with insurance programs to maximize patient access to its drugs.
"In 1990 Merck committed to hold price increases on our entire product line to within the overall rate of inflation. We have maintained that commitment," the company's written statement said.
Mr. Sokolof's earlier ads, about he health risks of high cholesterol, led some food makers to reduce the saturated fats in their products, analysts said, but they predicted that the new campaign was unlikely to lead to lower drug prices.
"I don't think anyone's going to lower the price," said Hemant K. Shah, an independent health care analyst. Mr. Shah said the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs was already very competitive.

HEADLINE: Can Xerox Auction Off Hot Air?

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., June 23

 BODY:
A software-based system that holds digital mini-auctions to distribute hot and cold air throughout a laboratory has been developed by scientists at the Xerox Corporation, marrying the laws of markets with those of electronics.
The system, which has lowered energy costs in the building by more than 10 percent, is based on software "agents" that represent individual room temperature controllers that bid to buy or sell cool or warm air. An agent that loses an auction might suffer a brief reduction in heating, which would encourage it to increase its bid in the next auction to be more certain of winning. The system holds about 1,500 auctions a day, more than one a minute. 
 The system uses a powerful computer that acquires sensor data and distributes control information over a network throughout the building.
The researchers believe the auction system has wide application wherever scarce resources need to be allocated efficiently, and is an example of growing interest in using market mechanisms for managing and selling network resources.
A recent project by researchers at Sun Microsystems Inc. and Agorics Inc. explored the use of software auctions to manage digital traffic jams in a computer network designed to carry video data.
The idea of building automated market-based systems for control purposes is not new. But only in the last two years have scientists been able to build systems based on modern computer networks.
"Originally people thought this was science fiction," said Bernardo Huberman, a Xerox physicist and a pioneer in the emerging field of computational ecology. "However, it has turned out that using the market mechanism for controlling systems is a wonderful tool."
The auction-based approach is a useful tool for controlling large systems because it can operate without a hierarchical authority.
"Centralized approaches toward managing networks are doomed to failure," said Michael Rothschild, president of the Bionomics Institute, an economics research organization in San Francisco.
The Xerox researchers believe that decentralization becomes increasingly attractive as systems that require the interaction of large networks of computers grow in size.
"Systems that are based on market mechanisms scale up very gracefully," Mr. Huberman said. "Their real advantage comes as they increase in size."
During the 1970's the Xerox laboratory created the first practical office networks and scientists as the laboratory began experimenting with ways to harness the power of multiple computers in a network. In the late 1980's Mr. Huberman began research on using auction systems to share more efficiently a network's computer time. The research project, known as Spawn, was an early attempt to organize a computer network without a centralized control facility.
Mr. Huberman developed the thermal auction system with Scott Clearwater and several other researchers at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. During the day, as the sun shines on various sides of the building, the double-blind auctions take place electronically, a system in which neither buyer nor seller knows the amount of any bid except its own. As software buyers purchase warm and cool air, air control vents in each office in the system are adjusted accordingly.
The researchers designed the system with several notable differences from conventional auction systems. For example, they dealt with the tendency of the network to permit a single agent to accumulate large sums of "money" -- if, say, one office was on a shady side of the building and needed less air conditioning -- by simply erasing excess amounts from the agent's accounts.
While the auction-based thermal cooling system does not use real money, the researchers believe the technology can provide significant energy savings. They are holding discussions with companies including Honeywell about licensing the system for commercial use.
Many executives predict that the Internet will become an ideal media for automating commercial transactions. A number of entrepreneurs and industry researchers share the vision of creating software agents that will "shop" on behalf of computer users, keeping an eye out for particular items or bargains in Internet shopping malls.
"Markets like this are likely," said Hal Varian, an economist who is dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. "The barrier is consumer acceptance."
Indeed, Xerox executives believe that the auction technology may have a commercial application that falls much closer to the heart of Xerox's business: printing services.
Mr. Huberman has designed a system called Docubid that would permit companies to choose a printing company by placing the job up for bid on a national network that Xerox would run. Once a buyer and seller were matched, the job would be submitted electronically and then shipped to the customer upon completion.
Yet the system could present Xerox with some problems, its executives acknowledge: some of its best customers for printing equipment are not interested in seeing more open markets.
And there are other barriers.
"The main thing that has been slowing up the larger-scale electronic commerce is the emergence of electronic money or a simple credit card scheme," said Mark Manasse, a researcher at the Digital Equipment Corporation. "There are a lot of regulatory and social issues that still need to be solved."
Another significant problem is the absence of workable systems that permit small-scale financial transactions -- as small as a nickel or a dime, or even a fraction of a penny in the future.
Mr. Manasse has designed an electronic money system known as Millicent to support financial systems that require large numbers of small transactions. Such a system might conceivably work well with an auction-based system, or one in which writers might desire to sell their work at a lower cost than is required by the current paper-based publishing economy in order to do multiple transactions quickly and benefit from the volume.

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "Bidding for Degrees"
Xerox has developed a computer system that not only monitors the temperature in the rooms of an office building, but also allows "agents" to bid for the warmer or cooler air depending on what is needed to keep the room comfortable. The value of the Xerox auction system is that it does a better job of distributing cool and warm air equally among a large number of offices. The air flowing through cannot simply be moved like blocks to the place where it is needed, so this system allows for the continual auctioning of air in the ducts. (Source: Xerox)

HEADLINE: Santa Fe Journal;
Texas Sashays Into Santa Fe -- and Pays Its Way

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., June 23

 BODY:
It was as if the Texas border had taken a sudden, 152-mile bend to the northwest, across mesas, arroyos and barbed-wire fences, to enfold a patch of what most maps still call New Mexico.
At a ranch just south of here on Saturday night, with country and western bands blaring, barbecued ribs smoking and flaring, a towering party tent practically visible from adjoining states and an auction offering livestock including ostriches and a baby llama, was a genuine, $600-a-ticket, sorry-we-sold-out-months-ago Texas charity ball. 
 "That's all it is, a transplanted Cattle Baron's Ball," said Mike Schmidt, a Dallas lawyer and Santa Fe homeowner, referring to annual revels where Dallasites practice living up to their stereotype. In cowboy boots, tails, wing collar and bolo tie, Mr. Schmidt stood on the dusty, crowded main road through a movie set that had turned part of the ranch into a frontier town.
The Buckaroo Ball, in its third year, has institutionalized the foreign presence. It is the grandest effort yet to teach New Mexicans how to behave more like wealthy Texans.
In this city's high-stakes social rivalry, the ball also represents a challenge to the formal dinners and premieres of the Santa Fe Opera. There, benefactors must make do without beaded, fringed and feathered leather gowns, staged gunfights or steel guitars. "It's just dinner; that's it," said Jane Smith, chairwoman of the first Buckaroo Ball two years ago, speaking of one of the opera's main fund-raisers. "But," she said with slow emphasis, "they're an older crowd."
Not every Santa Fe-an wants to learn how to be part of the Texas crowd. Many here blame outsiders in general, Texans in particular, for chronic water shortages, cultural erosion and soaring housing costs that have only recently leveled off. Among some of them, Texas is known as Baja Oklahoma.
Gazing across a wide income gap between most New Mexicans and their Texan visitors, Gloria Mendoza, a fourth-generation native, does not like the view. "They move into a traditional neighborhood with rutted dirt roads and build $500,000 homes with 10-foot walls," she said. "Then they get bored and look around the neighborhood. They don't like the way their neighbors pile wood out front, or the old refrigerator, or a little old car. They don't want to assimilate with the people here."
For years, Ms. Mendoza has failed to win passage of a state law taxing all real estate transfers of more than $250,000. But she plans other counter-measures, like remedial classes in Santa Fe-ness. "When people move to Santa Fe they should go through a workshop that educates them on our way of life and how they can fit into our community," she said.
The Texans, however, have two things going for them. First, they give hundreds of thousands of Buckaroo Bucks each year to charities, especially for children, in a city where causes other than the opera and the art museums, the ball's organizers say, have attracted scant support. "Because of you, there is a brand new children's intensive care unit at St. Vincent Hospital," a master of ceremonies told the cheering, whistling crowd.
Connie Trujillo, executive director of the Esperanza Shelter for Battered Families, recalled last week how $75,000 from an earlier ball allowed her to buy two vans and hire a children's therapist. "If any non-profit in Santa Fe gets money, you're looking at three or five thousand. Not 75," she said. "The Buckaroos were the first people who produced that much money, and my hat goes off to them."
Second, the Texans are not Californians -- later, flashier arrivals. Natives, especially shopowners, know who their real friends are, said Stanley Marcus, the fabled Dallas retailer and Santa Fe homeowner who has been taking vacations here since the 1930's. "Texans bought and the Californians just look," he said.
Texans, fleeing their Saharan summers to enjoy nature's own air conditioning at 7,000 feet, have been heading in this direction since the 1840's. Then, in the days of the Texas Republic, a ragged band of Texas Rangers trying to capture Santa Fe from the Mexicans met the first local resistance.
Although both states have roots in Spanish colonial and Mexican culture, Hispanics and Native Americans remain far more influential here than in Texas. Some quarrel with the latest invaders, saying that schools and other public services remain poor despite tourism and charity. Feuds over race, real estate development and the future of a city whose economy has faltered have helped a citizens' group circulating petitions to force an August vote on replacing the mayor and City Council with a new form of government.
The Texan impulse to lend a hand and kick up the heels of their hand-made Lucchese boots converged a few years ago. Elizabeth Smith, one of the founders in 1974 of the Dallas Cattle Baron's Balls, persuaded friends including Jane Smith (no relation) to plan the same sort of frolic here in 1994. Wondering whether they could clear even $100,000, after expenses, they raised $300,000. Last year, they took in more than $400,000, and this year they appear likely to shoot past $600,000.
Although a few tickets cost $200 -- "We're not trying to be elitist," one of the organizers said -- 75 percent of the thousand or so tickets are priced at $600 or more. These tickets include a Friday night cocktail party, Saturday tours of local homes, gardens and artists' studios and a Sunday brunch. For $250 more, golfers can enter a tournament at a gated community financed by Texas investors.
The Buckaroo upstarts have won polite admiration from the opera's backers. "Certainly there is competition," said Abe Silver Jr., a Santa Fe Opera Foundation board member and treasurer of the Santa Fe Boys & Girls Club, a recipient of Buckaroo donations. "Those ladies have done a tremendous job of creating new sources of funding."
Depending on whom you ask, the Santa Fe Opera backers still raise more than the Buckaroos. "They've been around for 20 years," said Jane Smith, her eyes narrowing in determination. "But we're catching up."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICANS;
Chaotic Message to Dole Over the Abortion Issue

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, June 23

 BODY:
Out of the screaming and hissing that echoed through the Alamodome, the Texas Republican Party delivered an unmistakable message to Bob Dole this weekend: taming rebellious factions within his party may be far trickier than even he imagined.
The clashes over abortion that dominated the state party's convention demonstrated that divisions among Republicans are no longer as stark as traditional economic conservatives on one side and religious and social conservatives on the other. But the politics have become far more complicated as the bickering goes on among Republicans who are steadfast in opposing abortion but who disagree about whether to press their position at all costs or choose for a more pragmatic approach. 
 The convention underscored something that Democrats and moderate Republicans tend to forget. Religious conservatives are by no means a monolith. While the state party is controlled by religious conservatives, the delegates in a close vote put down a move to deny Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison a seat at the national convention.
While the ferment here pitted Texan against Texan, it offered a preview of what could unfold at the national convention in San Diego in August and what the Dole campaign wants to avoid on the national level at all costs: a bitter floor fight over abortion; adoption of a tougher anti-abortion platform than even the Christian Coalition proposed, and high-profile roles for conservatives who are considered too fervent by many party leaders.
Bill Price, the executive director of Texans United for Life, who whipped up the Texas Republicans in the almost successful drive to keep Senator Hutchison off the national convention delegation because of her abortion-rights stance, warned that he and other anti-abortion leaders were not about to be squelched.
"There's a rogue elephant on the way from Texas that means business," declared Mr. Price, who was elected a delegate.
As a measure of the new conflicts roiling the Republican Party, consider how the battle lines have changed since this state's party convention two years ago. In 1994, the issue was over how Tom Pauken, who was backed by the Christian Coalition, wrested control of the party from mainstream Republicans.
But this past weekend, Mr. Pauken emerged as a figure of relative moderation as he sought to keep Mr. Price and his allies from overshadowing the proceedings. And Fred Meyer, the longtime party chairman whom Mr. Pauken had replaced, has become such a political relic that he lost his bid to go to the San Diego convention as a Dole delegate.
Mrs. Hutchison's ability to stave off defeat was mainly a victory for Mr. Dole, who is close to the Senator. But the all-but-assured Republican nominee had little else to cheer. Dozens of other Dole supporters, including Representative Henry Bonilla, were scorned in their bids to join the state's delegation to the national convention. And most of those who won spots on the delegation signed pledges vowing to vote against Mr. Dole's choice of a running mate if he or she does not oppose abortion.
Anti-abortion advocates at the convention hardly represent the Republican Party as a whole. But at the convention, there were more stickers here for Alan Keyes, who ran for President on a strict anti-abortion agenda, than for Mr. Dole. And Mr. Keyes and Patrick J. Buchanan drew far more cheers than Gov. George W. Bush and Senator Phil Gramm, two leading Texas Republicans who oppose abortion but who have warned the party against being preoccupied over the issue.
Though they may be a vociferous minority, these abortion opponents made clear this weekend that they are a force to be reckoned with. Mrs. Hutchison, for one, had dismissed Mr. Price and others who moved against her as a small minority on a "kamikaze mission." But nearly half of the 16,000 delegates here shouted "No!" on the question of whether Mrs. Hutchison and other proposed members of the Dole delegation should be sent to the convention.
Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, sought to navigate through these factions within the anti-abortion camp. He believes that the pragmatic course for anti-abortion groups is to align with Mr. Dole, even if is not as conservative as some would like. In that vein, Mr. Reed pressed behind the scenes for Mrs. Hutchison to win a slot at the convention. Yet, not wanting to offend the anti-abortion advocates that are vital to his coalition, Mr. Reed refused to condemn the effort to defeat dozens of Dole delegates to the national convention.
Mr. Dole has an even more complicated dilemma. In addition to trying to satisfy the anti-abortion factions, he also needs to assure the abortion-rights elements of his party that there is, indeed, a big tent. The risks are significant: he could lose the support of anti-abortion forces, who are among the most active members of the party, or the more moderate voters that he would also need to defeat President Clinton.
Trying to calm all sides of this fragile coalition, Mr. Dole is seeking to find a compromise for the party's anti-abortion plank that would call for a "declaration of tolerance."
But it was clear at the convention here that foes of abortion would probably not abide any weakening of the platform. The platform adopted by the convention here takes an even harder line on abortion than the Texas party did two years ago: delegates removed an exception that permitted abortion to save the mother's life. That language is at odds not only with Mrs. Hutchison, but also with Governor Bush and Senator Gramm.
Becky Farrar, 60, a delegate from Hico in central Texas, said she opposed abortion but voted to send Mrs. Hutchison to the convention because she believed that the party ought to show at least a smidgen of diversity.
"Part of the delegation wanted to elect all delegates who were visibly pro life; the rest of the delegations wanted a more diverse slate," she said. The question was never whether the delegates would be mostly against abortion, but whether anti-abortion forces get "the entire pie or three-quarters of the pie."
 Thus, as the feuding over abortion moves on to San Diego, it is clear that no matter how Bob Dole divides up the pie, some part of the Republican coalition will be left hungry.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE HOUSE;
Defying Odds in Mississippi, Black Carries G.O.P. Torch

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., June 21

 BODY:
The poverty runs longer and deeper through Mississippi's Second Congressional District than anywhere else in America. From the three-room shanties of Jackson to the skinny blacktop of the Delta, this is a postcard of failed dreams. Women still tote water in plastic buckets to bathe their babies, and the first of the month remains a time of great expectation because so many people exist on welfare, food stamps and Government peanut butter.
The Republican Party -- the party of Newt Gingrich, Patrick J. Buchanan, welfare reform and the Contract with America -- wants their votes. 
 Danny Covington, a 40-year-old black man seeking office for the first time, could deliver this desperately poor district to the Republicans, if he can persuade 12 to 15 percent of black voters to join with the overwhelming white support he is expected to get to unseat Bennie Thompson, the liberal black incumbent.
The obvious question: Why would that ever happen? To many black people in this traditionally Democratic district, voting for a Republican, even if that Republican is a black man, would be like a possum snuggling up to a speeding car.
"African-Americans and minorities in general are conservative in nature, and we believe in the family," reasoned Mr. Covington, a former parole officer and civil servant from Vicksburg who served in the 1980's as a Congressional aide to another Mississippi Republican, Webb Franklin.
"We don't have to have a constitutional amendment to support prayer. We believe that a 4-year-old child should not be in a position to raise Momma and Daddy," he said, referring to Aid for Dependent Children checks, on which whole families subsist. "We also believe that life is good, life is precious, and life begins at conception."
Mr. Covington is one of 24 black Republicans who are running for Congress, in addition to 2 who are already serving in the House. He is one of few of them given a realistic chance of winning. Although black Republicans, especially in the South, remain an oddity -- just 2 percent of the party -- their numbers are climbing as blacks grow increasingly dissatisfied with their place in the Democratic Party. Charles Barkley, the Phoenix Suns basketball star from Auburn University who earned the nickname The Round Mound of Rebound in college because of his pudginess, has said he would like to run for Governor of Alabama as a Republican.
"Republicans are making some effort to be more inclusive, and some African-Americans are feeling comfortable inside the party," said Stephen Schaffer, a professor of political science at Mississippi State University. "Probably, on moral issues, African-Americans are more conservative, but it's a problem in general on economic issues."
But Mr. Covington believes otherwise. He said he was not trying to take milk from babies or food from old people, "but some guy who can bench-press 300 pounds, has all 10 fingers and can see real good, he should work," Mr. Covington said. "And if he commits a crime, we'll build more prisons" and put him in jail.
What was once unthinkable is shaping up in Mississippi as, at least, a real contest, political experts and Republican Party officials say. Some black voters laughed out loud when asked if they would vote for a Republican, of any color, but others said they would consider it. The reason: Years of Democratic leadership has done little to lift the weight of poverty here.
The district includes the whole Delta, an area where outhouses are still a common sight in back of ragged houses that lean between vast fields.
"I'm a lifelong Democrat, but I'm beginning to wonder," said 73-year-old Bennie Evans, who came to hear Mr. Covington speak at the Mount Zion Youth Center outside Jackson. "We want somebody who can change things."
But Democratic leaders said that as bad as life in the Delta and other poverty-stricken districts might be, it could get worse if the Republican proposals on welfare and other social programs were passed.
Mr. Thompson, in Congress since 1993, sees it as just one more case of political opportunism, and betrayal.
"It just appears to be a shortcut to what they think is the head of the line," said the 50-year-old Congressman, who lives in tiny Bolton, near Jackson. A former alderman, he has been a politician all his adult life, an uncompromising proponent of government programs for the poor.
"For any self-respecting African-American to run on an anti-affirmative-action plank, wanting to cut Medicare and Medicaid, reduce educational funding, is suicide. You can't represent a district like mine and not make sure that basic services are available to the people," he said.
But that, Mr. Covington said, is the whole reason why he believes he can unseat the incumbent: He said the district was stagnating, as Mr. Evans said, held fast in never-ending poverty and dependence on welfare.
Mr. Covington said Mr. Thompson could stay in power only if his district remained poor, remained chained to welfare checks.
"He wants people to be downtrodden," Mr. Covington said. "That's his platform. It's like he feasts on poverty."
Mr. Covington lives in a house in the country with a Jacuzzi in the back and campaigns in perfectly fitting suits and ties that did not come from Kmart. But he was born in rural Mississippi, in Columbus, to a woman who had three sons by three different men, who each abandoned her.
She made their living by taking in ironing and washing, and working as a maid. They lived in a two-room house. Mr. Covington took his first indoor shower at the University of Mississippi, where he went on a band scholarship. He played the tuba.
If his mother could survive without welfare, he said, so can others. If he could climb out of poverty, so can they.
While others look at the Delta and see only hopelessness, he said, he sees people who are struggling to make house and car payments and raise their children properly, but also many people who do not try at all. Mr. Thompson told them he would take care of them, Mr. Covington said, so there is no reason to find a job. "He's a poverty pimp," he said of Mr. Thompson.
Mr. Thompson responded: "I know almost 900 African-American elected officials in Mississippi, and I don't know one that's had to run on the Republican ticket to win. We need to have that kind of representation rather than the Republicans' finding somebody at the last minute to run for office."
It is not expected to be a gentlemanly campaign.
Mr. Covington, a tall, thin, ebullient, rapid-walking man who worked in several campaigns, including those for Mississippi's stridently conservative Gov. Kirk Fordice and Senators Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, has not tried to pass himself off as a toned-down conservative who would be palatable to black voters. He does not try to justify his place in a party that many blacks view as threatening. He simply denies the threat.
"I don't think there's a Republican anywhere in America who wants to see people starve, see people homeless, see people go without medical treatment," he said.
When pressed, he conceded that, yes, there are some Republicans who would drastically cut social welfare programs without apology. But while he is loyal to his party, he said he would be his own man.
Mr. Thompson has been here before. He defended his seat against Bill Jordan, a black Republican, in 1994. Mr. Jordan, whom some Republicans criticized for failing to run a hard race, still won 41 percent of the vote in a district that is 63 percent black, but where the voting-age population is just 58 percent.
Mr. Covington disdains any comparison between this race and that one. He ignored his Republican opponents, whom he easily defeated in a primary, and focused on Mr. Thompson. He drives hundreds of miles every day, stopping at community centers, churches, stores.
He works the crowd at the Church's Fried Chicken and the barber shop at the Edison Walthall Hotel in Jackson. On Wednesday, he crisscrossed the Delta with his campaign manager, Linda Brombach, putting 500 miles on his car.
"Covington is doing a different sort of campaign: going out and meeting people," said Mr. Schaffer, the political science professor.
"It'll be an uphill race for Covington," he said, "but he does have lots of political experience."
What he must do, some voters here said, is convince them that he is not a lap dog for Mr. Gingrich and other Republican leaders. Mr. Covington, who has been in the party since he joined the Young Republicans Club at Ole Miss 20 years ago, said he could better represent people here because "I can take things to the table" and deal with Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Lott and others.
But there is little disagreement among them. He is against abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. He supports Republican tax cuts and opposes gun control.
"I'm a conservative," he said.

HEADLINE: In Slow-Paced Vermont, the Dirt Road Reigns

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Vt., June 19

 BODY:
You would think that everyone would want a better road. But in Vermont people fight to keep roads that freeze in winter, that turn into muddy sinkholes in spring, that kick up clouds of dust in summer, that gobble up shocks, mufflers and the occasional whole car.
When the state proposed paving a scant half-mile stretch of road in bucolic Brookfield some years back, there was a citizens' uprising. Jackie Wilder, a retired teacher, threatened to lie down in front of the bulldozers with her grandchildren. "And I had two grandchildren then," Mrs. Wilder recalled, adding that she would take the same stand today with her five grandchildren. 
 The road was not paved.
"It was a great victory," said Ed Koren, the cartoonist, who relocated to his dirt road in Brookfield (population 1,080) from the Upper West Side of Manhattan (population about 250,000), where all the roads are paved and many are potholed.
Vermont has about 8,000 miles of unpaved roads -- just 6,000 miles are paved -- and only 600,000 people. When small-town Vermonters give directions to their homes, there is always this part: "And then the pavement ends."
To a lot of Vermonters, an unpaved road is a better road. People go more slowly on a dirt road. In rural Vermont, slower is better.
Francis Howrigan, a 79-year-old dairy farmer, was meandering along the dirt roads of Fairfield the other afternoon, admiring the fields of buttercups and the views of the Green Mountains. He slowed down for birds. At one bend in the road, he stopped his car. Mr. Howrigan, a big man in work boots, got out, walked over to the side of the road and picked a bunch of wild pink roses, thorns and all.
"Nothing smells like wild roses," he said.
There is no rush hour on a dirt road. There is not much traffic, period. "Paved roads are for cars, not people," said Naomi Flanders, a performance artist who lives on a dirt road in Calais, where the residents rallied last year against a suggestion that eight-tenths of County Road be paved. "Dirt roads are for people."
Dirt roads go nicely with that other Vermont symbol, the covered bridge. Tourists love them, though they don't seem to come around much during mud season.
Dirt roads are a lot more interesting than highways. On summer evenings, Gregory Sanford, the state archivist, likes to walk barefoot with his two small daughters down their dirt road.
"We look at different colored rocks," Mr. Sanford said. "When we come back, I have 30 or 40 rocks du jour in my pockets. We're re-creating our dirt road in our house."
One reason the state still has so many dirt roads is the famous thriftiness of Vermonters. In addition to their pastoral charms, dirt roads are a lot cheaper to maintain than pavement. "It's economics," Mr. Koren said. "No one has the money to pave the damn thing."
Among New York City apartment dwellers, the building superintendent is all powerful. The Vermont equivalent is the local road commissioner, who maintains the town roads by grading, sanding and plowing. The road commissioner decides whose road is plowed first.
New Yorkers bestow Christmas tips upon their supers. The grateful residents of Brookfield rewarded their Road Commissioner, John Sprague, and his crew with a standing ovation at town meeting a year ago.
Oxford has its Rhodes Scholars. Vermont is proud of its Roads Scholars -- graduates of a 10-day workshop, sponsored by the Vermont transportation agency, that covers things like road drainage, signing and winter maintenance.
Braintree's Road Commissioner, Loren Bent, was recently named a Roads Scholar and given a $50 cash award by the town selectmen.
"One thing they did teach us," Mr. Bent said. "When somebody starts complaining, you say, 'I didn't make these roads, I inherited them.' "
There are 251 towns in Vermont, and most of the small ones have an appointed road commissioner.
Mr. Howrigan has being doing the job for 50 years in Fairfield. He is paid $150 a year. The town honored him by putting his picture on the cover of the annual town report one year.
The job can be demanding.
"A fellow moved to town one year and came to the selectmen's meeting," said Mr. Howrigan, who is also chairman of the Board of Selectmen. "He said, 'I'm so and so, I work in Burlington, and I want my road plowed first.' "
The man worked at I.B.M. and lived on the outskirts of town, Mr. Howrigan recalled: "I looked him right in the eye. I said, 'No way are you going to be first.' "
Many of the more-traveled dirt roads are actually dirt and gravel. One secret to a good dirt road is the gravel, Mr. Howrigan said. Ever frugal, he said he could buy a truckload for $9.
Plenty of Vermonters want their roads paved. Paving -- to pave, or not to pave -- is always controversial in small-town Vermont. In Brookfield, Mrs. Wilder, the retired teacher, said one woman who favored paving had not spoken to her since her side lost, 10 years ago.
While there are no statistics available, the pavement is slowly encroaching. Joe Sherman, a Vermont writer and the author of a book called "Fast Lane on a Dirt Road" (Countrymen Press, 1991), a contemporary history of Vermont, said many of the urban dwellers who moved to the state's back roads 20 and 30 years ago were now fighting to have their roads paved.
"Dirt roads are the quintessential paradox of our time," Mr. Sherman said. "Everybody wants to live in the wild and yet be ultra-civilized. It's kind of like backpacking with your espresso machine, or wanting to be on the fast lane on the dirt road. You can't do both."

HEADLINE: BEYOND THE BOARDWALK -- A special report.;
With Cash Rolling In, Atlantic City Raises Stakes

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
Many people have written epitaphs for this storied old town. The version a few years ago went like this: Atlantic City was about to be surrounded with state-licensed casinos that would open in Pennsylvania and Connecticut and probably in New York. Losing its exclusivity as the center of East Coast gambling, the city would rapidly sink, dragged down by problems of urban decay and poverty that would never be solved.
That was a very bad bet. 
 Today Atlantic City is beginning its biggest expansion since gambling was legalized in 1978. Casino revenues have soared, hotel occupancy is up and the competition that seemed so threatening has retreated, leaving the field open. The city that wrote the book on resort development when Orlando was still a swamp and Las Vegas an unmarked spot in the desert has begun a new chapter.
All together, more than $4 billion in new casino and hotel projects have been announced or are now under construction, including four new casinos on property owned by Mirage Resorts, and a fifth to be built or bought by MGM Grand, which is shopping for a site. In the entire first 17 years of the city's gambling era, developers spent only $5.6 billion.
"We're bursting at the seams," said Donald Trump, who owns four of the city's 13 casinos and who this month announced another $75 million expansion, including the creation of what he said would be the world's largest gambling yacht.
The construction has also reached out into long-neglected areas of the city beyond the boardwalk. A $254 million convention center will open early next year with a single-level exhibition space bigger than any other on the East Coast, including the Jacob Javits Center in New York, to compete for the trade-show business that has been a Las Vegas windfall.
The convention center will be connected to a 500-room hotel, the largest non-casino hotel project here in at least half a century, anchoring a nine-square-block revitalization.
Much of the development is different from the past as well. The growth in overnight visitors and the anticipation of an expanded convention business are pushing casinos to look for new temptations -- stores, restaurants and theaters -- to keep people in town and spending. The Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood have arrived. Harrah's has said it will spend $7 million building just one new restaurant. Mr. Trump, never to be outdone, announced that he would spend $20 million each on two new restaurants.
"It won't be the old Atlantic City," said Mark Juliano, the president and chief operating officer of Caesars, which is expanding by 624 rooms and acting as development partner for the convention center hotel. "Life has a more hectic pace now and that will be true here. But I definitely see a wider variety of product being offered."
Casino officials and industry analysts say that while the reduced threat of out-of-state competition may have sparked Atlantic City's sudden surge, various related forces have compounded and channeled it.
*The state of New Jersey got friendlier. Under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, gambling regulations were significantly eased last year, allowing casinos to market and advertise more aggressively, cut their labor costs by reducing some previously mandated functions, and offer new games. That increased profits and sent casino stocks soaring. Atlantic City casinos earned a record $3.7 billion in gross revenues last year, edging out the Las Vegas strip, which earned $3.6 billion.
*The state also changed strategy. Money from a 1.25 percent casino gross revenue tax that had been used exclusively to build low- and moderate-income housing was partly shifted to economic development, with a specific goal of creating jobs for local residents. The Atlantic City airport was refurbished and doubled in size. A $120 million project to beautify the entrance to the city, with park space and a laser-shooting lighthouse, was begun.
*Stephen A. Wynn came to town. Mr. Wynn, the chief executive of Mirage Resorts, which has been credited by many industry officials with helping to change Las Vegas's image from gambling city to entertainment resort with a mix of spectacle and family-style fun, said he would do the same here. That hastened the scramble to build and expand and improve properties.
But this new Atlantic City is also a place of new strains. Some residents say they fear that, just as many of the earlier casino jobs went to people from nearby towns and suburbs, the economic opportunities from the new restaurants and retail jobs may prove just as illusive to the city's mostly poor and minority inhabitants, who could see only the downside of growth.
Traffic, already bad, flirts with gridlock from the construction obstacles. Housing shortages and higher rents are expected.
And there are new political pressures. Mr. Wynn has said his development group, which includes Circus Circus Enterprises and Boyd Gaming, will not come unless the state builds a $330 million road and tunnel project to his property, which is several miles from the Boardwalk. Mr. Trump, currently the largest casino operator, has complained that the tunnel would be an unfair giveaway by the state that would favor one part of Atlantic City over another.
Mrs. Whitman has been left in the middle and has said she will issue a decision on the road project by the end of the month. So her words now move markets. When gambling industry analysts from around the nation gathered here recently, they sat rapt with their cell phones ready on their tables as she opened their conference. She smiled and stayed firmly noncommittal.
Pinky Kravitz, a local booster and radio personality who broadcasts his show every afternoon from a lounge at the Trump Plaza, said that all the new attention has its own effect: renewed confidence. "For the first time I feel optimism," he said. "That light at the end of the tunnel is what we were promised when the casinos came in."
Mr. Kravitz, who has lived 62 of his 68 years here, is a repository of his city's small and large humiliations. He remembers the low-tide moments -- the mid-1960's, when one of the once-elegant old hotels began giving paper towels to its guests for their showers, and the early 1970's, when casino legalization looked politically impossible.
Now the talk centers on who will win, who will lose, and whether the small downtown merchants will survive the years of disrupted parking and traffic during construction.
 
The New Success
How It Happened; What It Means
Former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut figures prominently in the new success of Atlantic City, believe it or not. And so do Connecticut's Mashantucket Pequot Indians, owners of Foxwoods Casino, and Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. All of them influenced the growth of gambling in the region in various ways, and the result, casino industry officials and analysts say, was the solidification of Atlantic City's position as the gambling capital of the east.
Mr. Wynn had originally wanted to build a Mirage Resort in Bridgeport. He promised to create 20,000 new jobs, and his accountants calculated that such a mammoth resort just 60 minutes from midtown Manhattan would swallow up in one gulp 30 percent of Atlantic City's business.
It was not to be.
Mr. Weicker, who opposed the expansion of casino gambling in his state, made a pact with the Pequots in 1993, giving them exclusive rights to gambling in exchange for 25 percent of slot-machine profits. Mr. Wynn spent more than $10 million trying to get the law changed before giving up. His next stop, somewhat reluctantly, was Atlantic City.
"In the short run, it would have been better in Bridgeport," said Richard D. Bronson, Mirage's head of development. "It would have been a killer." But in the long run, because of tourist concentrations, "we'll probably be better off in Atlantic City."
Meanwhile, Mr. Ridge of Pennsylvania, who was elected in 1994, announced that he would oppose new gambling casinos unless approved by voters in a referendum. Mrs. Whitman at the same time was taking the opposite tack, saying that New Jersey was open for business and that gambling was an important part of the mix.
A third force was a change in perspective that is as simple as it is profound: visitors who stay longer, especially overnight, spend more money in the casinos, and more people are staying overnight. The 6,345 hotel rooms in the city in 1986, for example, were empty about 20 percent of the time. Last year, the city had a 92 percent occupancy rate with more than 9,400 rooms.
But getting people to stay longer means, paradoxically, giving them more things to do that are not about gambling. That is where the state has exerted its leverage. New Jersey created a $100 million fund -- with a proposed expansion to $170 million now before the legislature -- to encourage non-casino hotel growth, all financed by the tax on casinos' gross revenues. At Caesars, for example, the new rooms to be set aside for use by conventiongoers will net the casino as much as a $20 million to $25 million rebate on the taxes it paid.
The idea, Governor Whitman said, is partly to change psychology and get the casinos to think beyond their own front doors. The old Atlantic City economy, in the days of vaudeville and straw hats for men, had always looked outward, treating commerce as a carnival. The casinos in their first phase faced in, drawing customers to a windowless world where a view or the smell of salt air was treated as a distraction from the business at hand.
Giving the casinos an interest in the success of the convention center is one part of the strategy. Another more subtle and symbolic but perhaps equally far-reaching effort -- the creation of a new park-lined boulevard leading from the convention center toward the Boardwalk -- is aimed essentially at getting the casinos to think of the city as their front door, not simply a parking lot.
"The gaming part is important and it's big and and it's going to continue to expand, but what we really need to do if we're going to get this place back to a sound footing is to get it back to being a vacation land," Mrs. Whitman said. "All the casinos are beginning to recognize that they need to be more than just slot machines for gamblers."
 
Plus Ca Change . . .
Revision And Consolidation
The walls of the Greater Exodus Baptist Church shake with a deep, sonorous rumbling from the earthmovers pawing the ground outside. It is the sound of condemnation and rebirth, of destruction and deliverance all in one. The church, a converted bingo hall, is to be leveled to make way for the new grand entry to the city, and the state's compensation package, financed by parking taxes, is making possible a brand new $3.5 million structure nearby: Greater Exodus's first permanent home.
"Monetarily, we have been blessed," said the founder and pastor, Bishop-elect Sherman R. Mosley. "We feel blessed that we have to leave."
Change and changelessness sit side by side in Atlantic City these days. On the Boardwalk, where french fries and sea rot still form the signature aroma, new places like the Warner Brothers Studio Store and Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum sit hard by the pizza joints and T-shirt shops that developers say are marked for extinction.
The question on everyone's mind is how it will fit together in the end, and who will be left. The casinos themselves are consolidating. Hilton Hotels bought Bally earlier this month, and the running joke at an industry conference a short time later was that next year there would be one casino left and one chief executive talking to a roomful of listeners. Each C.E.O. repeating the joke vowed to be the one left standing.
Some local business people say they fear that the same kind of consolidation could happen to them. The city has lost about 200 restaurants over the last 17 years of casino gambling, city officials say. Many that are left, like Dock's Oyster House, which has been serving up sea food dinners since 1897, are watching with trepidation as glitzy new places like the California Pizza Kitchen and the Rainforest Cafe open on the Boardwalk.
Joseph R. Dougherty, the third generation of Doughertys to run Dock's, said that while the convention center is likely to help his business, almost all of the big new restaurants have a relationship with a casino or are under a casino's roof.
"The casinos give free food, free drinks," he said. "It's tough to compete. But there'll always be people who want to get out of the casinos," he added. "At least a little."
 
In Abeyance
Waiting for Steve And the Roadway
Mr. Wynn of the Mirage is unquestionably the biggest businessman not in Atlantic City. His company, associated with dolphins, exploding volcanos and pirate-ship battles -- and especially with Las Vegas's dramatic resurgence -- hangs over all, making his every move or perceived change of posture the question of every development conversation. The scale of his proposal dwarfs any previous Atlantic City project: as many as 7,000 hotel rooms, four new casinos and more than $2.5 billion in new investment.
His spokesmen are adamant that the roadway to the Mirage site, a 168-acre former landfill that was given to Mr. Wynn by the city last year, is the quid pro quo. Without a way to bypass the narrow, congested local streets, Mirage officials say, the project is unworkable. Mr. Trump -- the biggest business man in Atlantic City -- thunders, meanwhile, that building a $330 million funnel to one business's door at taxpayer expense would be unconscionable.
Their public debate pushes all of Atlantic City's hot buttons: the role of the state, the threat of transportation paralysis, the fallout from heightened competition, the future of the Boardwalk. But it just as starkly illustrates the fever-pitch pace of change: Real life is charging ahead, shifting both Mr. Trump's and Mr. Wynn's positions even as they holler.
After Mirage said last year that it would seek a place at the Atlantic City table, announcements about casino expansions came like a string of firecrackers -- a fact for which Mirage takes credit. Mr. Bronson, the Mirage development official, said that several casino executives told him privately they were grateful for the Mirage news because it pushed their boards or parent companies to move ahead on expansion plans that had been stalled for months and in some cases years.
But every new expansion also fuels Mr. Trump's argument that the Atlantic City market is so hot that state subsidies and property improvements are not needed.
For Mr. Wynn, the new activity, and the transportation concerns it has set off as construction scaffolds rise, support his argument that Atlantic City's street system is near capacity. At the same time, the growth in gambling revenues and the new convention center make the city more attractive for his investment, and presumably increases the incentive for him to compromise.
Most analysts seem convinced that Mr. Wynn will come because, on the East Coast at least, there really is no place else for him to go, and that some kind of roadway will be built because the property is worthless without it and because the potential economic payoff for the state in jobs and taxes is huge. The compromise is expected in the fine print of the financing.
All this leaves Governor Whitman, who has been central to Atlantic City's economic first act, equally central to its political second act. She said in an interview that the new strength of the market meant that the marina site would unquestionably be developed, whether by Mr. Wynn or someone else; that the state's priorities were to improve transportation within the city and balance the competing interests, and that she would not be bullied.
"I don't accept any ultimatums," Mrs. Whitman said. "We're trying to look at what makes the most sense for Atlantic City as a whole."
Atlantic City's Mayor, James Whelan, said he, too, must juggle the various pieces of a city very much in motion, making sure that residents benefit from the growth but also that developers are not thwarted by stubborn property owners who will not sell out. He said that the motion itself is the measure of health, and that the singular lesson of his city's history is that it is better in the midst of change, more confident of its place and its roots. Resort rhythms are in the blood, Mr. Whelan added.
"We invented this stuff," he said.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on June 24 about plans to tear down Greater Exodus Baptist Church in Atlantic City to make room for a road project misstated the financing plan for a replacement. The church is to be built with donations from parishioners and money raised by New Jersey through parking taxes. It is not being built solely with state money.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Teen-Agers Scavenging For a Vestige of Hope

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR 

 BODY:
This is the relatively slow time of year when prime time makes room among its overwhelmingly middle-class images to slip in a glimpse of the nation's poor and often troubled youth, the kind who do not fit easily into television's preferred happy endings.
Two such documentaries are being broadcast tonight. On PBS, the "P.O.V." series, an indispensable forum for independent nonfiction films, offers "a k a Don Bonus," a video diary compiled by an 18-year-old Cambodian youth completing his senior year in a San Francisco high school. On CBS, "One Last Chance," part of a sporadic series called "Before Your Eyes," shows what a CBS News crew recorded over a year and a half while following Juan Carlos Castro, a juvenile delinquent in Tampa, Fla. 
 Don Bonus is the American name assumed by Sokly Ny, who fled from the Khmer Rouge with his family at age 3 in 1979 to find a better life in the United States. The American dream turned out to be pocked with nightmares.
Still, at a community center for at-risk teen-agers, he met a film maker, Spencer Nakasako, who was teaching a class on video techniques. With Mr. Nakasako's encouragement and assistance, he began keeping a video diary, which with his family's reticence was not easy. "We're from Cambodia and we're pretty traditional," he notes. "Talking about issues, about family secrets, to the public, we don't do that."
The soft-spoken Don plunges in with persistent nerve and candor. The family is seen initially in a miserable housing project where it is dangerous to look out the barred windows because of gun violence on the street. In one burglary, a family is wiped out as the thieves, Don observes wryly, take even the soy sauce. At school Don is sinking into D's and F's, and graduation will depend on his passing a reading proficiency exam.
Don is most troubled by the disintegration of his family. His mother is living with a man whom the children dislike; his older brother, Chandara, who had replaced the father left behind in Cambodia, is now caring for his own family and is busy advancing economically. Taping his brother from a distance at a party, Don suddenly begins crying.
In the end Don gets his diploma but the family is not able to witness the ceremony. They are at a court hearing for Don's younger brother who, arrested for attempted murder at school, is being packed off to reform school. Everything is far from fine, obviously, but the completion of this diary is an optimistic signpost on the way to Don's future.
In CBS News's more polished production, including narration by the actor Laurence Fishburne and a music track by Digable Planets, the story of Tampa's Juan Carlos Castro is far less encouraging. We meet Juan as he is arrested for a series of car thefts. At 14 he is already a father, with a second child on the way. His mother, a former prostitute, is a crack addict; his father, who lives in Newark, is just out of prison and on parole for drug dealing. Juan has been in 35 foster homes. With a record of three felonies already, he is given one last chance by Detective Carlos Sommellan, who enrolls the youth in an experimental program that closely tracks teen-age offenders.
At Manatee County Boot Camp in Tampa, Juan encounters a kind of "tough love" in the rigorous discipline administered by the commander, Lee Vallier. Juan thrives in the militarylike atmosphere, learning to read at college level and eventually being chosen as graduation speaker. When he is taken in by the family of Bill Clyburn, a sociologist who is an expert on dysfunctional teens, Juan seems like a poster boy for the rehabilitation program. But his transformation is short-lived.
Within weeks he is having trouble in school and sneaking off at night from the Clyburn home. The Clyburn family takes him to visit his father in Newark, but his yearning for a reunion with his own family ("They gotta accept me, I'm their blood") is cruelly snuffed. Mr. Clyburn finally decides he has had enough when Juan takes a family car for a joy ride. Formal charges are pressed, and Juan faces trial in adult court and the possibility of five years in state prison. Detective Sommellan pleads for parole and community service. Juan's future is left looking grim.
The documentary can be annoyingly sketchy. Near the end, it is mentioned that Mr. Vallier had to resign his boot camp post because of charges of abuse. But instead of details, we get only Mr. Vallier's response: "It was not abuse, it was discipline." The portrait of Juan needs all the clarity it can muster. As it stands, the hopelessness it discovers is shattering.

HEADLINE: Pulp Mill Legislation Raises No Conflict

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A June 18 news article on my bill to extend an Alaskan pulp mill's contract for cutting timber from Tongass National Forest confuses representing one's constituents with the mystical "appearance" of a conflict of interest.
My legislation would extend for 15 years a contract to the sole surviving pulp mill in southeast Alaska so the mill could have some assurance of wood to justify the investment to keep operating. Extending the contract is intended only to keep some 4,000 Alaskans working; it will have no impact on the environment. 
 A contract extension also will permit the pulp mill to pioneer a chlorine-free production process. And the mill has no other source of timber since there is no state or private timber in the region.
The contract extension is not coming at the the forest's expense. More than 60 percent of the forest's old-growth has been protected from harvest, leaving only 10 percent potentially open to timber development.
I have owned stock in two Alaska banks since it was given to me when my father died in 1952. I have declared those investments publicly since I have been in the Senate. I held the stock when I voted in 1990 for the Tongass Timber Reform Act, which took a million additional acres out of the timber base and ended a $40 million subsidy to the timber industry. If there was a conflict of interest, it existed then.
From the standpoint of personal gain, I could have invested my holdings outside Alaska and generated higher appreciation in blue-chip stocks, but I believe that one of the best ways to represent my constituents is to participate in my state's economy.
There is no conflict of interest here since by this legislation I am trying to save the third-largest element of southeast Alaska's economy.

HEADLINE: Jacob's Pillow Is Opening, but a Trauma Lingers

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: BECKET, Mass.

 BODY:
Visitors returning to the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires this summer won't notice the change. The white clapboard houses and weathered barns nestled in the overgrown remnants of an 18th-century farm are still home to myriad flora, fauna and lithe young bodies in leotards. The season, which officially begins June 25, will again mix the familiar and the exotic, everything from the Mark Morris Dance Group to Malavika Sarukkai performing Bharata Natyam, the classic dance of South India.
But something is very different: Jacob's Pillow narrowly escaped bankruptcy and foreclosure last winter, when it was unable to meet interest payments on $4.8 million borrowed in the early 1990's to renovate a deteriorating facility. And while the 64-year-old institution survived, its near-death experience is a sign of just how much the economics of dance have deteriorated in the last decade and how dependent dance has become on the kindness of its relatively few friends. 
 The Pillow, as it is called, is not the only icon of the dance world to have a brush with financial disaster in recent years. In 1992, American Ballet Theater required a multimillion-dollar infusion from private donors to pay off its accumulated debt. Last year the Joffrey Ballet slashed expenses and moved to Chicago to stay afloat. "All the operating assumptions of the 1970's and 1980's are out the window," concludes Robert Crane, executive director of the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which rescued the festival with a loan last December.
Jacob's Pillow has come a long way since 1931, when Ted Shawn, the modern dance pioneer, bought the worn-out farm as a retreat for his all-male company and staged "lecture-tea demonstrations" to pay the kerosene bills. Mr. Shawn opened a dance school in 1940 and with help from benefactors, a 500-seat theater in 1942 to anchor an annual summer dance festival.
It grew modestly with the tourism economy of the Berkshires through the 1950's and 60's. By Mr. Shawn's death in 1972, it had evolved into a summer refuge for dozens of dance companies, a place to develop and showcase new work. "The Pillow had become a core institution in the dance world," said Sali Ann Kriegsman, former head of dance at the National Endowment for the Arts, who was appointed executive director of the festival in May 1995.
But by the standard of, say, Tanglewood, the facilities were primitive. The parking lot, which abutted the theater, spoiled the bucolic ambiance; the restrooms would have seemed more in place in a World War II Army barracks. And by the 1980's, deferred maintenance had taken a serious toll. "Dance groups were telling us that it used to be romantic to come, but now it's not safe to use the stage," recalled Sam Miller, a former director of Jacob's Pillow.
The Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency offered to help find a lender to underwrite a major facelift. Two issues totaling $4.8 million were sold in 1989 and 1991 to the Fidelity Massachusetts Tax-Free Fund, one of dozens of mutual funds run by the giant Boston-based Fidelity group. "The idea was to complete the renovation quickly and then pay off the debt from our capital funding campaign," Mr. Miller explained.
By all signs, the festival spent the money wisely. The parking lot was moved and expanded in time for the 1993 season, leaving space for a cafe on a handsome, tree-shaded lawn. The original Shawn theater was brought up to snuff, and a smaller studio theater was opened for avant-garde productions. Unglamorous projects -- roof repairs, sewerage and the like -- were also completed.
The catch was that the debt to Fidelity carried a $432,000 annual interest charge, one-fifth of the Pillow's annual budget. Mr. Miller hoped to cover half from operating surpluses and the rest from Government grants and private donations. But his timing could hardly have been worse, coming just as Congressional Republicans were gearing up to slash Federal money for the arts, and almost all nonprofit arts groups were feeling the pinch from the 1990-91 recession.
Donations stagnated, and the Pillow failed to meet its semiannual interest payments in December 1994 and June 1995. Fidelity responded by requiring the festival to commission a business review from a management consultant and by reminding the stunned board that the bonds were backed by a mortgage on the festival's land and buildings.
The consultant reportedly offered no insights into how the Pillow could dig its way out of the financial hole. Operations were already lean. And asking donors to cough up more cash to feather the nests of mutual fund shareholders was not appealing.
There was an ace in the hole, though: the Pillow was effectively judgment-proof. Foreclosure was a hollow threat, as The resale value of the property was only about $600,000, and Fidelity would have been legally obliged to pay off the festival's $250,000 credit line from the First National Bank of the Berkshires before it could realize a penny. After protracted negotiations with Neil Chrisman, a former banker at Morgan Guaranty who had become board chairman in January 1995, Paul Engler, the Pillow's new managing director, and Ms. Kriegsman, Fidelity agreed to settle for $1.25 million, provided the check was written by Dec. 31, 1995.
In fact, Jacob's Pillow was obliged to raise $1.5 million in a matter of six weeks because the bank had to be paid off before Fidelity. A chunk came as emergency grants from board members and an anonymous donor. But the bulk came from the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which lent the Pillow $1.25 million from its $50 million endowment. "It's rare when you have the opportunity to make such a difference in an institution this important," explained Mr. Crane, the foundation's director.
Looking on the bright side, Jacob's Pillow has, however inadvertently, been able to finance needed maintenance and worthy capital improvements for roughly two bits on the dollar. But lenders lacking effective means of enforcing their claims don't come along every day. And like almost every other institution connected to dance, the Pillow now faces an economic future in which it must run ever faster just to stay in place.
Revenues from ticket sales are expected to reach $953,000 this year, up slightly from 1995 but barely enough to cover 39 percent of the Pillow's operating budget. Raising ticket prices would be no panacea: with seats already running $27 to $43 for performances in the main theater. Nor would a strategy of filling more seats with aggressive marketing: the current budget already assumes the theaters will run at 93 percent of capacity.
Sales of T-shirts, chardonnay and melon with prosciutto should generate about $260,000 this summer. But the offsetting cost of running the shop, cafe and canteen will leave a profit of just a few thousand dollars.
Cutting expenses significantly also seems like a nonstarter. The marketing, fund-raising and administrative overhead are modest for an organization of this size and ambition. It might be possible to pare fees paid to dance groups, but the Pillow is not eager to impoverish hard-pressed artists, most of whom already accept less than their going rates as concessions to the festival.
That implies the festival must raise $1.1 million from individuals, corporations, foundations and government agencies simply to break even in 1996. And starting next year, it must find new revenues to pay the 6 percent interest on its debt to the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, not to mention new money to begin paying off the $1.25 million principal.
Mr. Engler, a former business consultant to nonprofit groups, thinks the Pillow can earn a bit more on food and is exploring higher prices for the very best seats for the most popular performances. But he thinks the best hope for a firmer financial footing lies in increasing corporate giving and expanding the ranks of individual donors.
Trouble is, so does everyone raising money for nonprofit groups who, in a pinch, used to be able to turn to a favorite foundation, a particularly devoted angel or the nice folks in Washington. The question now, suggests Neil Chrisman, is, "How do you find water in a desert?"

HEADLINE: Let's Add 4 To the G-7

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser in the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Group of Seven industrial nations has to be reformed, or its annual summit meeting should be scrapped.
The meetings, like the one that begins on Thursday in Lyons, France, were originally intended as get-togethers of the leaders of the principal democracies, the largest free-market economies and the most advanced societies. But today the group's membership is no longer representative of power or of principle, and it needs to be expanded. Russia, admitted as the Soviet Union in 1991 on a limited basis, cannot now be excluded. For that reason alone, China, India and Brazil are as entitled to participation as Russia, and in some respects much more so. 
 A timely initiative in 1974, the summit meeting was an outgrowth of Western Europe's and Japan's postwar recovery. The gathering responded to the need for greater global coordination among the main economic centers. It also enhanced American-European dialogue at a time when Western Europe was becoming more serious about political unity and when the United States was trying to recover its moorings after the Vietnam War. And Japan, growing in economic importance, was engaged in a wider political relationship.
After bickering about who should be included, the seven states were effectively self-selected: the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The discrepancies in gross domestic product and population were as marked then as today. Nonetheless, the seven met the membership requirements.
But 22 years later, the annual meeting no longer upholds them. Leaving aside that the informal get-together has turned into a circus dominated by pomp and circumstance and is attended by hundreds of officials, the very concept of the Group of Seven not only has become compromised but distorts global realities.
The first breach of principle was the admission of the Soviet Union in 1991. Mikhail Gorbachev, the nonelected President and head of the ruling Communist Party, was invited to take part only in the talks about Western aid for his ailing economy. As a sop to his pride, he was promised he would be invited to the 1992 meeting in Munich. But a political coup forced him from office and the Soviet Union was dissolved.
Boris Yeltsin took his place in the years since, also participating on a limited basis. (He won't attend this week's meeting because of the runoff election in Russia.) The Group of Seven calculated that including him would bolster his political position at home and thus enhance the chances of democratic reform.
For the Russians, President Yeltsin's presence satisfies their craving for continued status as a world power, and Moscow officials have begun calling the meeting the "P-8" -- for Political Eight.
But this ambiguity, to which the other leaders have acquiesced in their eagerness to help Mr. Yeltsin, poses several problems. First, a Government that has killed more than 40,000 people in Chechnya who wanted to secede does not quite meet democratic standards. When Mr. Gorbachev was admitted, the Soviet Union could not even pretend to be a democracy. The membership criterion of democracy yielded to political expediency. But now such elasticity should apply to other countries as well.
Second, Russia is not even in the forefront of free-market economies or of any other type of economy. It is a developing country, though armed with nuclear weapons. If its military status justifies its inclusion, what about other states with nuclear ambitions?
Lest the annual meeting become totally meaningless, however, only four new members, including Russia, should be added. Though the criterion of democracy has been compromised, it should be retained, though redefined to mean that some progress toward significant political or economic pluralism is required. The size of the country's economy and existence of significant free-market sectors should be taken into account.
China is a genuine economic success and a major military power. It galls Chinese leaders to be excluded while Russia's leaders boast of their role in the "P-8."
India is the world's largest democracy, with yet another successful election under its belt. Although India is weaker economically than China, its economy is growing rapidly. Without India, the Group of Seven cannot pretend to be inclusively democratic. Brazil's successful democratic presidential election last year, as well as its effective financial and economic reforms -- not to speak of its size and population -- similarly justify membership.
Perhaps in five years or so, South Korea and Mexico might be considered, too. For now, only when the Group of Seven becomes the Group of 11 can the world's central political and economic problems be properly addressed.

HEADLINE: Iraq Agrees to Ease Way for U.N. Monitors

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 24

 BODY:
In a move that officials here regard as a significant concession by President Saddam Hussein, Iraq has signed an agreement with the United Nations that is intended to speed the process of eliminating all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction so that economic sanctions can finally be lifted.
Weapons monitors believe that arms or components are still being concealed by Iraq nearly six years after its invasion of Kuwait and the imposition of economic sanctions that have crippled the Iraqi economy. The monitors will soon test the accord with an inspection that may involve politically sensitive sites. 
 In a separate agreement with the United Nations, Iraq agreed on May 20 to supervised oil sales to raise up to $2 billion in six months to pay for urgent civilian needs. But details are still being negotiated, and a Security Council sanctions committee has not yet approved a final plan.
The new agreement was signed on Saturday by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who is chairman of the commission charged with monitoring Iraqi compliance. The agreement includes an unequivocal pledge by Iraq to allow United Nations inspectors "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access" to all suspect sites.
It sets up a regular system of meetings between Mr. Ekeus and Mr. Aziz to review the process, and it establishes a schedule for turning over long-requested Iraqi documentation by the end of this month.
The accord was made public today by Mr. Ekeus, who went to Iraq last week armed with Security Council demands for cooperation that stopped short of the American desire to include a threat of force. His visit followed Iraqi refusals the week before to allow an inspection team to enter buildings controlled by President Hussein's Republican Guard.
American diplomats here, who have taken the strongest position against the lifting of sanctions, said today that they were pleased that Mr. Ekeus had achieved a pledge of unconditional access. But given their experience with Iraq, they said, they would wait to see what happened next. One American official said that it was likely to be a long time before any relaxation of sanctions could be up for discussion.
Mr. Ekeus said at a news conference today that a decision made by the Iraqi leadership to open even sensitive sites controlled by the same forces that protect the President and his innermost circle was important.
"I don't underestimate the concessions Iraq has made," said Mr. Ekeus, who in the past has heard promises of Iraqi compliance that were not fulfilled. He said his request for written agreement produced some "heartburn" in Iraq.
"I told them a 'no' to this would mean serious repercussions for Iraq," Mr. Ekeus said. In return, the United Nations gave a vague pledge to respect Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity.
One underlying message in this pledge is that given access to very sensitive sites, inspectors will not poke around in material they may find that does not relate to weapons. Mr. Ekeus said that access to computers has been a delicate issue for this reason, even though inspectors have been instructed to search for terms relevant only to their task.
Mr. Ekeus reiterated today, however, that there is still much to be accomplished in Iraq because the Government continues to conceal what he called "some important components of weapons and telltale documents."
He said that Iraq insists it has destroyed some arms or equipment that the inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission, as it is formally called, want to account for. But the Iraqis have not produced the necessary documentary proof. Iraq also uses a range of concealment techniques, Mr. Ekeus said.
"Iraq is not concealing things only by static means," he said. "We are also concerned about moving things on trucks or other forms of transportation. They have highly dynamic methods of storing things."
Mr. Ekeus, whom Iraqi newspapers had called a "liar" and a "cowboy" before his arrival in Baghdad last week, said his discussions with the Iraqis were somber but more cordial than the Government's public posturing. He said that on Friday, after a series of meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, the United Nations delegation handed Mr. Aziz a draft agreement. On Saturday morning Mr. Ekeus was informed that the Iraqi leadership had accepted the document, which was signed later in the day.
Inspectors from the Special Commission are responsible for finding and destroying biological and chemical weapons and missiles deemed offensive rather than defensive. Another team, from the International Atomic Energy Commission, looks for evidence of nuclear weapons or programs to produce them.
The new agreement with Iraq covers both monitoring processes. In addition to destroying its weapons, Iraq must account for missing prisoners of war and return property stolen from Kuwait.

As Summit Talks Near, A Defense

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
A few days before a meeting of top leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations, a senior United States Treasury official defended their stewardship of the world economy yesterday, saying they had corrected exchange-rate misalignments, reduced currency volatility and promoted fiscal discipline, while strengthening the international monetary system against shocks.
Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers, addressing the Emerging Market Traders Association in New York, said that by seeking a consensus on prudent domestic policies rather than by direct intervention in the markets, the major economic nations had carried out an "orderly reversal" of exchange-rate movements. They called for such a shift in April 1995, when the dollar was considered undervalued. 
 Mr. Summers said that policies by the Group of Seven -- which will convene starting Thursday in Lyons, France -- had reduced currency volatility to the lowest level in a decade. At the same time, he said, a concentration on sound domestic policies had brought average inflation down to the lowest rates in a generation. Mr. Summers also cited progress in reducing budget deficits and in narrowing trade imbalances, with Japan's current account surplus falling from 3.5 percent of output three years ago to less than 2 percent now.
But he disagreed with those who want the Group of Seven to translate the notion of more stable currencies into fixed exchange rates. Not only does the size of today's globalized capital market rule this out, he said, but such a system could have undesirable consequences if it forced leaders to use domestic policy to achieve an exchange-rate objectives.
"Would it have made sense, for example, to have forced the Fed to ease in late 1994 to contain the dollar's rise, despite the inflation risks still evident then?" he asked with regard to American interest rates.
He said the Group of Seven had strengthened the international monetary system against the risk of another currency crisis like Mexico's. The group, he noted, had created a financial safety net, tightened surveillance over suspect economies by the International Monetary Fund, and encouraged countries to publish timely economic data.
Mr. Summers said the leaders would lend some impetus to efforts to lighten the debt burdens of the poorest countries. Officials confirmed yesterday that prospects for a debt-relief plan remained uncertain, with three members of the Group of Seven -- Germany, Japan and Italy -- still resisting pressure from the four others -- the United States, Britain, France and Canada -- to order the I.M.F. to sell gold to finance it.
Mr. Summers said the seven national leaders would endorse a review of the World Bank and of regional development banks. Against a backdrop of declines in conventional foreign aid and increasingly global capital markets, he said, those agencies would be urged to help developing nations attract foreign investment by promoting healthy and educated work forces and protecting investors against political risks.
The Group of Seven, underscoring its interest in strengthening the development institutions, has for the first time invited to the talks the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn; the head of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, and Renato Ruggiero, who directs the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Summers's defense of Group of Seven policies came as the imminence of the summit meeting, and the attendant hullabaloo, was causing some to renew questions about the usefulness of such exercises.
The latest skeptics are C. Fred Bergsten, a former Assistant Treasury Secretary, who runs the Institute for International Economics in Washington, and C. Randall Henning, a visiting fellow there.
In a book published this month titled "Global Economic Leadership and the Group of Seven," they say the economic powers are becoming increasingly ineffective and are failing to counter low growth, with the members practicing a "nonaggression pact" in which they refrain from criticizing each other's policies.

This Is No Picnic: In Southeast Asia, Respect Rides on a Shuttlecock

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
Nobody knows precisely how many Indonesians were lining the streets of this massive, sprawling city when Susi Susanti and Alan Budi Kusuma came home in August 1992. Some estimates put the crowd at 500,000; others at more than a million.
But this much is certain. As Susanti and Budi Kusuma stood in an open car with leis and Olympic gold medals around their necks and inched toward the national monument in Merdeka square, they had a new appreciation for the power of the very subtle game of badminton. 
 "On Sudirman, our main street, we could hardly move; it was jammed with people all shouting congratulations," Budi Kusuma said. "For five or six hours, we just kept going and going. It was like in Europe for the soccer championship or Brazil for the World Cup."
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with an estimated 190 million inhabitants, does not produce renowned athletes in major professional sports like soccer and basketball or in glamorous Olympic sports like gymnastics or track and field. But badminton, known here as "bulutangkis," is a very different matter. And when all of the players on its national team are swatting shuttlecocks at the country's training facility, it is the greatest collection of badminton talent under one roof on the planet.
There is Susanti, the intensely competitive 25-year-old considered one of the finest female players in history. She has the muscular legs of a beach volleyball star and the flexibility of a ballerina (she lunges for drop shots by doing splits). There are Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, the reigning men's doubles world champions and Olympic favorites this summer. There are also Budi Kusuma, who happens to be Susanti's fiance, and Hariyanto Arbi, the baby-faced powerhouse who won the last men's world title, and three other men ranked in the top 10 in the world.
Nearly four years after Budi Kusuma and Susanti won the first Olympic medals in the 50-year history of Indonesia, the throngs of people were missing on a trip to the training center in the southern Jakarta suburb of Cipayung. Instead, stray chickens and stray garbage lined the narrow unpaved streets that led into a large, landscaped compound with barbed wire on its high walls.
"You would never know this was here unless you were looking for it," Budi Kusuma said.
The Indonesians chose this unlikely spot for the training center in November 1992 because they wanted more space and privacy than was available in congested central Jakarta.
"The players are better here," said Indra Gunawan, the head coach of the Indonesian badminton team. "Before, they go to the movies or go out and maybe not concentrate. When it's far from the city, they do nothing but badminton."
 
Training Is Life; Life Is Training
Sunday, even in a largely Muslim nation, is the only day of rest for the approximately 80 elite players and 18 coaches who are based here. When they are not competing in tournaments, the players train six days a week for as much as eight hours a day in an enormous hall that resembles a converted airplane hangar. They sleep in two air-conditioned dormitories -- one for women and one for men -- behind the training hall and eat in a cafeteria equipped with video games, giant-screen satellite television and a pool table.
It is, in essence, a gilded cage. Players must train here if they wish to compete internationally for Indonesia and only a few players, normally those who are married, are permitted to live outside the compound.
"This is our home," said Susanti, who comes from a small town in West Java and is one of the rare players not required to share her dorm room. "I go back to see my parents only twice a year."
She does not express doubts about this arrangement, however.
"Badminton is the only sport right now that can bring Indonesia's name to the world," Susanti said. "When Alan and I got gold medals in singles in Barcelona, the world knew Indonesia better. I am very proud about that."
Still, much of the world took virtually no notice. Badminton is a major sport throughout southeast and east Asia. But, outside of Denmark, the rest of the west has yet to wake up to it.
The sport has not always been so disconnected. The modern version of badminton is based on the Indian game poona, refined and codified in England in the late 19th century. The sport got its name because it was a popular activity at the Duke of Beaufort's country seat: Badminton House.
It soon became fashionable in the United States and in the 1950's and 1960's, Americans made a habit of winning world titles. Joe Alston was considered an intriguing enough player for a new magazine called Sports Illustrated to put him on its cover in March 1955. But with the rise of network television and the major team sports, badminton receded far into the shadows, and by 1995 the United States had only about 3,000 registered players. Susanti, like others in her sport, is optimistic that badminton's inclusion in the Olympics in 1992 will ultimately broaden its reach.
"After Atlanta, maybe America will know badminton better," Susanti said.
But for America to know badminton better, it will have to get the opportunity to watch it on television, and that is certainly not part of NBC's master plan this summer. What viewers will miss is a remarkably fast and often spectacular indoor game that has little to do with the summer variant lazily played in backyards and loosely associated with straw boaters and unmuscular men.
"I always maintain that top-level badminton makes top tennis players look pretty wimpish," said the International Badminton Federation's executive director David Shaw.
The Indonesians' rigorous training regimen includes an exercise called "shadow badminton" in which they go through the motions of their sport in a sand pit. "Our bodies are not as big as the Europeans," Budi Kusuma said, "so we have to be faster and stronger."
 
The Search for Talent Is an Unending Pursuit
The Indonesians' advantage is that their omnipresent national federation, known by its Indonesian abbreviation of PBSI, covers all their expenses and, with help from corporate sponsors, operates 37 regional training centers in this far-flung archipelago. Talented youths are identified early by scouts, and the most promising end up in Cipayung in their late teens, although some, like Susanti and the latest female phenom, Mia Audina, arrive as early as age 15. Rich and powerful clubs like Jaya Raya in Jakarta also recruit young players and pay stars like Susanti handsomely to represent them.
Despite Indonesia's regional emphasis, elite badminton is almost exclusively played in Java, which, with 110 million people, is easily the most populous of the country's 13,677 islands. The top players, including Susanti and Budi Kusuma, are almost all ethnic Chinese, a minority group that has often faced discrimination in Indonesia but has considerable economic clout.
"If you ask me why, I'd say it's because badminton is a sport that not every family can afford to play," said Rudy Hartono, the greatest men's player in Indonesian history. "Playing outdoors costs little, but indoors can be expensive."
Resentment occasionally surfaces. But the players are quick to play down the significance of their ethnic origins and point to Joko Suprianto, a male player of Javan descent currently ranked No. 1 in the world, as evidence that the sport's base is broadening.
Badminton arrived here in the 1930's while Indonesia was still a Dutch colony, supposedly after Chinese traders brought the game to the island of Sumatra. But the sport did not really take flight until 13 years after independence in 1958, when Ferry Sonneville and Tan Joe Hock led Indonesia to victory in the Thomas Cup, badminton's version of the Davis Cup. It was the first major international sporting success for the new nation.
Indonesia would go on to produce many top players, the best being Hartono, who would win the prestigious All-England singles title a record eight times before retiring as a national hero in 1982. After a long slump, during which the Chinese were dominant, the Indonesians came roaring back in the early 1990's under the energetic leadership of Gen. Try Sutrisno, the former PBSI president. Sutrisno, with his powerful connections in a country dominated by the military, proved particularly adept at encouraging sponsorship. He is now vice president of Indonesia, which certainly should not hurt sponsorship in the future.
 
Success and Prosperity Heighten Expectations
Susanti and Budi Kusuma, a longtime couple who plan to be married in a Catholic ceremony next February, are among those who have benefited most. They each reportedly received more than $500,000 from sponsors and government sources for their Barcelona victories: a huge payday in a nation where the average income is less than $1,000. The players' parking lot at Cipayung is filled with new Toyotas, Hondas and Opels. But Indonesia's best still cannot approach the earnings of other top international athletes. Arbi, ranked No. 1 in the world in 1995, probably earned no more than $200,000 from all sources last year. That is less than tennis stars Andre Agassi and Boris Becker can make in a week.
Will it remain so in the future? Or will Asia's burgeoning affluence do for badminton in the 21st century what the West's affluence did for tennis in the 20th?
There are signs of movement. In June 1994, the International Badminton Federation signed a 10-year deal with Star Television, the Asian satellite broadcaster, which guarantees increased exposure and prize money. The Indonesian players are excited, but they know, too, that greater rewards mean greater competition. The South Koreans, Danes and, in particular, the Chinese are very strong, and even Susanti is hardly a sure bet to defend her title in Atlanta.
Even so, the Indonesian people are already anticipating another celebration and, above all, another opportunity to remind the world that their huge, oft-ignored nation exists.
"Badminton is getting tougher and tougher," Budi Kusuma said, "but my country has become used to gold."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Day Flat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday as market participants braced for new supply this week and a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers next week.
With virtually no data to give direction, trading was sluggish yesterday, with volume for the day among the lowest of the year. 
 The highlight of the session was the Government's regular weekly bill auction, in which bill rates were mixed. Retail interest was just a little short of expectations, but over all, the auction results met expectations. The rates for the three-months averaged 5.10 percent, up from 5.08 percent last week, and the rates for the six-month bill averaged 5.23 percent, down from 5.27 percent. The price of the 30-year bond gained 5/32, to 86 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 7.08 percent, from 7.09 percent on Friday.
Prices of intermediate-term issues are expected to come under pressure over the next few days as dealers and investors sell some holdings to make room for today's sale of new two-year notes and tomorrow's sale of new five-year notes.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note being sold today was offered at price to yield 6.30 percent, while the five-year note was being offered at 6.71 percent.
Economic reports his week are not expected to provide clues on the next Federal Reserve move. The Fed's policy making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, starts a two-day meeting next Tuesday.
Some analysts say they do not expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates until it sees evidence that inflation is accelerating.
"The latest beige book, prepared for the July 2 and 3 F.O.M.C. meeting, characterized the U.S. economy as growing at a moderate pace," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company, referring to the Fed's survey of regional conditions, known as the beige book.
Even if the Fed holds steady on interest rates at the July meeting, Mr. Steinberg said, many analysts will then expect the Fed to raise rates at the Aug. 20 meeting.
Still, many participants are convinced that the Fed will soon raise rates amid signs that the economy is growing faster than expected.
But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of the Norwest Corportion, argues that a strong second quarter has already been factored into stock and bond prices.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.711	97.356	Discounted Rate	5.10%	5.23%	Coupon Yield	5.24%	5.45%	High Price	98.716	97.366	Discounted Rate	5.08%	5.21%	Coupon Yield	5.22%	5.43%	Low Price	98.711	97.356	Discounted Rate	5.10%	5.23%	Coupon Yield	5.24%	5.45%	Accepted at low price	26%	26%	Total applied for	$58,271,744	$50,760,274	Accepted	$13,079,752	$13,125,977	Noncompetitive	$1,391,997	$1,109,592

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Labor Costs for Parts Exceed Rivals', Study Says

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TROY, Mich., June 24

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation's labor costs for auto parts are $440 higher a vehicle than the Ford Motor Company's costs and $600 higher a vehicle than the Chrysler Corporation's because G.M. buys fewer parts from low-cost outside suppliers, according to a study issued here today.
The study, by an independent consulting firm in this northern suburb of Detroit, bolsters G.M.'s position in this summer's labor negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union. G.M. has been seeking extra concessions this year from the U.A.W. to offset the disadvantage the company has from manufacturing so many of its own parts using highly paid union workers. 
 Stephen P. Yokich, the president of the U.A.W., sharply criticized the study. He said Harbour & Associates, the consulting firm that produced the study, had looked only at labor costs and had not included the lower quality and lower productivity at many outside suppliers.
"This study adds nothing to the ongoing efforts of the U.A.W. or the companies to balance the requirements of high-quality, efficient production with the need to sustain the good jobs that drive our economy," he said.
But Linda Cook, a spokeswoman for G.M., saw some merit in the study. "It does point out, right now, a cost advantage" for G.M.'s domestic rivals, she said.
The figures, which do not include Japanese-owned factories in the United States and elsewhere, underline the enormous changes that have taken place over the last three decades in the way auto companies are organized. During the 1950's and 1960's, G.M.'s vast empire of parts factories was widely viewed as one of the company's biggest competitive advantages, providing enormous savings from the large-scale production of everything from car seats to brakes.
But a combination of underinvestment, poor management and numerous wage and benefit concessions to the U.A.W has turned the parts factories into a liability for G.M. The company estimates its hourly cost of labor at $43, including benefits for retirees, while suppliers' costs are half as much for some parts.
Jim Harbour, the founder of Harbour & Associates, said G.M.'s labor costs were too high for it to continue producing labor-intensive parts like seat covers. "Anything that's labor intensive, you're not going to compete in at $43 an hour," Mr. Harbour said.
To the irritation of the U.A.W., G.M. has said that it is looking for ways to make its parts operations more competitive and is in the process of selling or merging five parts factories.
Mr. Harbour said his firm had prepared today's report in response to numerous questions from various news organizations, and the report was not paid for by any auto maker.
Daniel Luria, a former U.A.W. economist who is now an analyst at the Industrial Technology Institute, a research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., said that the Harbour figures might overstate G.M.'s cost disadvantage. Up to $12 an hour of G.M.'s hourly labor costs comes from pension benefits, retiree health care and other expenses that G.M. would have to continue paying even if it transfers work to outside suppliers, he said.
Mr. Harbour said that only $7 or $8 an hour of G.M.'s costs reflected retirement benefits that would have to be paid in any case. G.M. pays its U.A.W. workers an average wage of $19.27 an hour and does not give a detailed breakdown of its other labor costs. Overtime pay and taxes like employer-paid Social Security premiums make up the rest of the $43 an hour.
General Motors produces its own car lighting systems, brakes and hardware like seat tracks, while Chrysler and Ford do not produce any. But while G.M. generally produces the most parts itself, the world's largest auto maker does not make its own car and truck windows, while Ford makes all of its windows and Chrysler manufactures 65 percent of its windows, Mr. Harbour said.
The common wisdom in Detroit is that General Motors makes 70 percent of its own parts, Ford makes 50 percent and Chrysler 30 percent. But Mr. Harbour said that parts production at G.M. accounted for less than half of its total costs.
Mr. Luria has estimated that the work done in General Motors factories accounts for only 45 percent of the cost of one of its cars. For Ford, the percentage is 38 percent and for Chrysler it is 34 percent, he calculates.
Chrysler, which has the highest profits for a vehicle of any auto maker in the world and is trying to persuade the U.A.W. not to insist on too large a share of those profits this year, said that having the lowest auto parts costs of any American auto maker was not enough.
"G.M. is not the benchmark, the Japanese producers are," Nicole Solomon, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said.


GRAPHIC: A new study found that G.M. had higher costs than Ford or Chrysler because it produced more auto parts itself instead of buying them from outside suppliers.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley And Merrill Set To Add Money Managers

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
The money management industry continued its rapid consolidation yesterday as Morgan Stanley confirmed it would pay $745 million to acquire Van Kampen American Capital Inc., a mutual fund company, and Merrill Lynch & Company agreed to pay $200 million to acquire Hotchkis & Wiley, an institutional money manager in Los Angeles.
A third deal may be in the works. CNBC, a business-news cable channel, and several news services reported yesterday that Franklin Resources Inc., a mutual fund company based in San Mateo, Calif., was close to buying Mutual Series Inc., a mutual fund group, for more than $500 million. 
 Lisa Gallegos, a spokeswoman for Franklin, declined to comment on the reports.
Mutual Series, whose flagship fund is Mutual Shares, has $17 billion in assets. The group is managed by Michael Price, a well-known portfolio manager who also runs Heine Securities. An assistant at Mr. Price's office in Short Hills, N.J., declined to comment yesterday.
Big Wall Street firms, like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, are aggressively building their money management businesses, believing them to be a good source of fee income. The acquisition of Van Kampen, which has $57 billion under management and is predominantly a retail business, also gives Morgan Stanley the equivalent of a big retail brokerage, a useful consumer for many of its financial products, and an entree into the retail business.
Clayton Dubilier & Rice, the investment firm that is selling its controlling 80 percent stake in Van Kampen to Morgan Stanley, stands to make a handsome profit from the transaction. Clayton invested a total of $272 million in Van Kampen, but is now selling the company for an aggregate value of $1.175 billion. That is because Morgan Stanley agreed to buy Van Kampen for $720 million in cash, and $25 million of exchangeable preferred securities and will assume about $430 million of Van Kampen's long-term debt.
But Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it had agreed that "in no circumstances will the sum of the equity purchase price and the remaining long-term debt exceed $1.175 billion." The parties expect to complete the purchase by Nov. 30, the end of Morgan Stanley's fiscal year.
"I think it's a very good transaction," said Joan S. Solotar, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, commenting on the Morgan Stanley purchase. "It augments Morgan Stanley's growth in the asset management sector, particularly as it relates to retail distribution. It also gives them added bulk and economies of scale."
And, she added, at a purchase price that is equivalent to 14.1 times Van Kampen's earnings, Morgan Stanley "has not paid an absurd price." Nevertheless, she added, "because good will is significant, Morgan Stanley's return on equity will likely decline some."
Morgan Stanley officials told securities analysts yesterday that the prospective internal rate of return from the investment in Van Kampen was 18 to 20 percent, and therefore offered better prospective returns than those offered by Morgan Stanley's own stock, Ms. Solotar said. Morgan Stanley has recently used its resources to buy back its stock.
Analysts see the pattern of acquisition and consolidation among asset managers as inevitable.
"It seems to be the thing to do," said L. Hunter Hallowell, an analyst at Dresdner Securities (USA). "You've got to have that distribution, distribution, distribution." Morgan Stanley's acquisition of Van Kampen, he noted, effectively gives Morgan Stanley a big retail distribution network for its many financial products. It also swells Morgan Stanley's funds under management to close to $160 billion from about $100 billion.
"They have often claimed that if you don't have $100 billion or more" under management, Mr. Hallowell said, "you're not a serious player."
Van Kampen, which employs 1,200 people, was formed by the 1994 merger of Van Kampen Merritt in Chicago and American Capital Management and Research, based in Houston. It is the fourth-largest mutual fund company in the United States, with more than $57 billion under management.
With more than two million investors, Van Kampen represents a departure for Morgan Stanley, which has until now concentrated on selling its asset management services to institutions.
The Wall Street firm is clearly seeking to increase its ability to sell investment products that it currently sells to institutions. "This acquisition is consistent with our stated goal of accumulating assets and gives Morgan Stanley a strong U.S. distribution capability through which we can offer to individual investors some products traditionally sold primarily to major institutions," Richard B. Fisher, chairman, and John J. Mack, president, said in a joint statement.
Morgan Stanley believes that it is following an important trend by improving its access to retail investors. "Individual investors control a growing percentage of the world's capital," said Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, "Van Kampen American Capital is an important strategic acquisition that will enhance Morgan Stanley's ability to benefit from this long term trend."
Hotchkis & Wiley, which will be acquired by Merrill Lynch, has more than $10 billion under management.
Hotchkis, founded in 1980, will remain in Los Angeles and retain its name as it becomes a unit of Merrill Lynch Capital Management Group. That Merrill Lynch unit currently manages about $23 billion of client assets, including $10.6 billion in institutional mutual funds. Altogether, Merrill has more than $730 billion of client assets.

'Birthplace of Speed' Has Adversary: Yes, a Turtle

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
In this city famous for fast cars and wide beaches, driving on the hard-packed sand is about as old as the automobile itself. The allure is not just the convenience, swimsuit-clad drivers explain, but also the tradition -- of slow cruising along miles of surf, of tailgate parties by the dunes, of sunbathing in the back of a pickup truck.
Auto racing, already a fixture here on Volusia County beaches in the early 1900's, may have since moved to the speedway, but beach parking and driving, even if only at the legal limit of 10 miles an hour, remain a cultural icon and tourist attraction. 
 "Parking, having access to the beach, you can't take that away," said Alan Rosecrans, a 51-year-old retiree from Orlando. "You'd take away my childhood, what I've done since I was a kid."
But now the home of the Daytona 500 is caught up in a dispute over cars, and the reason is the loggerhead turtle, a lumbering visitor to "the birthplace of speed."
The loggerhead, a large sea turtle, is on the Federal threatened-species list, and its nesting season runs from May to October, corresponding to a season when 26 miles of the county's Atlantic coastline, in Daytona Beach, New Smyrna Beach and Ormond Beach, are crowded with people and wheels.
Local environmentalists sued the county last year under the Endangered Species Act, arguing that cars all too often ran over turtle nests, in the dunes, and that turtle hatchlings were hit by cars, got stuck in tire ruts or became disoriented by headlights and lights from beachfront property as they tried to cross from their nests to the ocean at night. The plaintiffs seek a ban on beach driving during the nesting months.
That prospect enrages many beachgoers, who threaten to stay home if beach driving is outlawed -- no small worry for an area where beach-related businesses account for about half the economy. As many as five million vehicles use the beach each year, Volusia County officials say, bringing about $3 million annually in beach access fees alone.
Only a few beaches in the entire country still allow driving, and none of the others are so well known as those here. On a recent weekend, vehicles ranging from trucks to golf carts stretched as far as the eye could see along the shoreline, either parked by the dunes or rolling slowly on two marked lanes. More people were sitting in open car trunks next to their coolers than lying on towels near the water.
The beach can be up to 500 feet wide at low tide, and the footing is solid. It is big enough, and sufficiently hard-packed, that not only stock car racing but even plane rides were once found there.
But it is also one of the places where the 300-pound adult female loggerheads -- and to a lesser extent green turtles, on the Government's endangered-species list -- crawl ashore at night, looking for the soft sand of the dunes to lay their eggs.
Once the eggs are laid, the adults depart. Then, on a night two months later, the hatchlings emerge from the eggs, and their survival depends largely on escaping predators like raccoons by making it quickly to the ocean, which they find by orienting themselves with the water's reflection of the nighttime sky. Because of the dangers that cars and artificial lights add to those from predators, the survival rate among the hatchlings can be as low as 1 in 10,000, experts say.
Only about 3 percent of all the loggerhead's annual nesting activity in Florida, the species' primary nesting area in the United States, occurs along the 49 miles of Volusia County beaches, county officials say. And the number of nests reported along the 26 miles where driving is allowed totals only a few hundred, out of thousands in the county as a whole.
But those suing the county say all nesting beaches are crucial to preservation of a threatened species. They also say their efforts would have a beneficial side effect, helping to prevent the occasional accident in which a beachgoer is run over by a stray car.
"In 1968, when my husband and I moved here, you didn't see 500 cars a day on the beach," said one plaintiff, Shirley Reynolds, a 59-year-old resident of New Smyrna Beach. "Now there are millions a season. It's a zoo."
Last summer a Federal court where the suit had been filed issued an order that forced the county to prohibit beach driving at night and to erect markers to keep cars from parking over nests. Now, in an effort to avert a trial that could lead to a total ban on beach driving from the beginning of May through October, the county has proposed to close nine miles of the most sensitive beach to vehicles while keeping the rest open with restrictions.
"We think we have come up with a good balance," said Joe Wooden, deputy chief of beach operations for the Volusia County Beach Department.
But losing any stretch of the beach to a few turtles offends some, especially those whose livelihoods are at stake. Concessionaries say they lose as much as 85 percent of their business on days when, under another curb imposed by last year's court order, the beach opens to cars late -- or not at all -- to protect the turtle conservation zone at high tide.
"Who's more important, us or the turtles?" said Richard Mason, who sells food and rents chairs in New Smyrna Beach.
And many drivers do not want to give up the convenience of not having to carry chairs and coolers any distance, of people-watching at cruising speed, of experiencing nature from the comfort of their machines.
"You take driving away, and Daytona will go down," said Jeff Wagner, 22, a landscaper from Orlando.
Others, meanwhile, seem to have caught on to the environmental concern. Indeed, the battle over the loggerhead has prompted an interest among county officials in using the turtles to attract ecotourists.
Still, turtle-cheering is one thing, car-bashing another. Were beach driving banned, said Adam Lovell, an 18-year-old lifeguard, "you'd probably have a riot."

But it will be a thing of the past, at least from May through October, if a Federal court fight over the loggerhead turtle, a threatened species, is resolved in the favor of environmentalists.

HEADLINE: In Times Square, Keepers of the Glitz;
3 Women Overseeing Block's Rebirth Promise to Return Its Splendor

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Not long ago, Gretchen Dykstra took a phone call from a merchant looking for business space. The merchant was no Michael Eisner or Richard Branson; he represented a small, very small, business. But Ms. Dykstra, the president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, was enthusiastic about his proposal.
"This is a guy who has a 20-foot long, 10-foot-high fiberglass hot dog from which he sells hot dogs," Ms. Dykstra said. "It's called 'Between the Buns.' I said to him: 'You know, that's a name that might work in Times Square.' " 
 Listening to her recount this story recently, Rebecca Robertson and Cora Cahan reacted with delight, for they share Ms. Dykstra's enthusiasm for what she calls "the gestalt of Times Square" and which she defines as "eclectic, vital, colorful and sort of in your face, a certain esthetic chaos."
Together, they also happen to be in charge of it.
"The three witches of Times Square," Ms. Dykstra said.
"The three good witches," said Ms. Cahan, the president of the New 42d Street, a nonprofit organization responsible for restoring use to eight once-grand but outmoded theaters on the block. (The first, the New Victory, reopened as the city's first children's theater in December.)
"Oh, please," said Ms. Robertson, the president of the 42d Street Development Project, the state agency in charge of the transformation of 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and which, among other things, established the New 42d Street.
There are, of course, dozens if not hundreds of people who have been involved in the plans to reconfigure and reinvigorate Times Square, but by now the three women, admiring acquaintances if not friends, collegial and cooperative if not officially allied, have become the primary overseers of the rebirth of perhaps the world's most famous neighborhood.
Avowed fans of the neon, overwrought commercialism that made Times Square a notorious cavern of garishness and excess, they promise that as time goes on, it will be the same only more so, though without the squalor and danger that, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, seemed to swallow whatever glamour the area once possessed.
"We used to have what we called the D-word era," Ms. Robertson said. "Whenever there was an article about us, there were all these D-words: dead, desolate, dismal, dreary."
"And S-words," Ms. Dykstra said. "Seamy, seedy, slimy, scuzzy. It's extraordinary how hard it is to change the mindset of the public and the press."
Ms. Cahan noted that, in contrast, recent articles about the refurbishing and moving of the Empire Theater to have it serve as an entrance to a 26-screen movie complex, were lacking in disparagement altogether, and filled, instead, with wonder.
"This is a place that has good bones," Ms. Robertson said. "One of the things we did was look at what made people love this street, the legendary place with fables and stories. And one of the things we all want to do is make sure the magic continues."
 
Defining the Soul Of a Fabled Block
 On their watch, crime in the neighborhood is down, rents are up. It is a noticeably cleaner place. Bertelsman, Disney, the Virgin Megastore, Live Entertainment of Toronto, A.M.C. Entertainment Inc., Conde Nast and Madame Tussaud's have all arrived on Times Square or committed to it; where once there were dozens of adult bookstores and peep shows, under new zoning laws supported by the three women and scheduled to take effect in November, there may be as few as six.
All of which puts them, of course, at the fulcrum of the debate over the soul of the place. Is a giant hot dog suitable for Times Square? Is that part of the magic? There are differing opinions, though certainly among those with an economic interest in Times Square, the three women have created a substantial fan base. In the cajoling, lobbying, negotiating and marketing involved in the high-powered real estate world generally ruled by men, being women probably has not hurt.
"Women are more direct, I think," Ms. Robertson said. "Probably more gossipy, but really more direct."
Douglas Durst, the developer who is to build an office tower on the northwest corner of 42d Street and Broadway, agreed, sort of. "It makes a difference, women versus men," he said, "though now I'm trying to think of how."
Jeffrey Gural, the president of Newmark & Company, which manages three of the most famous buildings in the area -- 1501 Broadway, which once housed the Paramount Theater, 1560 Broadway (a k a the Actors Equity building) and the old McGraw-Hill building at 330 West 42d Street -- was among many Times Square business executives who were unstinting in their praise. "They've all done a terrific job, frankly," he said.
 
Managing Egos In an Artful Way
 Since 1992, with the establishment of the Times Square Business Improvement District, the alliance of businesses and property owners in the area stretching from 40th Street to 53d Street and from just west of the Avenue of the Americas to just west of Eighth Avenue, plus Restaurant Row on 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth, Ms. Dykstra, 47, has used the B.I.D.'s $6 million in annual assessments on local merchants to make the neighborhood cleaner and safer, and to market it to attract new tenants.
"Gretchen is the Mayor of Times Square," said Jeffrey Katz, the president of Sherwood Equities, which owns the buildings at 1 and 2 Times Square. "She's at the vortex of a very powerful, very big, very dynamic community with lots of money, lots of political clout and lots of egos and she manages it in an astoundingly artful way. I know I couldn't do that job."
Ms. Robertson, 45, a former city planner, joined the 42d Street project in 1987; since then, she has survived a political shift in both City Hall and Albany, which many read as a testament to the progress she has made on 42d Street. Among other things, she has overseen the state's takeover of 13 acres on the block and the relocation of some 280 occupants.
Since 1992, after plans to develop office towers on the four corners of Times Square were scotched because the real estate market had soured, she led the development of a replacement plan, now being put into effect, that would put an indefinite hold on office development (most likely until the developers decide the market has turned) and focus instead on supplementing the tourist attractions and entertainment venues with retailers and restaurants.
The next wave of these will open this summer; it began yesterday with Hansen's Times Square Brewery Restaurant.
"With Rebecca, it depends whether you're on her side or the other side," said Mr. Durst, who opposed Ms. Robertson for years when his competitors were given tax breaks to develop office buildings on Times Square but who is now taking advantage of those breaks to build an office tower of his own. "I much prefer being on her side. We litigated against her for a good many years, and it was a difficult time. But now working with her, it's terrific."
Ms. Cahan ("I'm older than they are," she said.) is a former dancer who for 16 years was the executive director of Feld Ballets/NY. She shares with Ms. Dykstra and Ms. Robertson an articulate outspokenness, though in demeanor she is a bit more high-strung.
Charged with making The New 42d Street self-supporting, through tenant rent, by the year 2000, she is now awaiting Disney's renovation of the New Amsterdam, which is scheduled to open in 1997, and concluding contract negotiations with Livent, which plans to combine the Lyric and the Apollo into one musical house. Madame Tussaud's and A.M.C. -- which are together to occupy the old Empire, Harris and Liberty Theaters -- will be her tenants as well; so, perhaps, will Jujamcyn Theaters, the Broadway theater owners, who have expressed interest in the Selwyn Theater, the only venue not yet spoken for.
"Cora will never, never, never give up," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the lower Manhattan BID, who was also Ms. Robertson's predecessor -- the two of them recruited Ms. Cahan for the organization they created in 1990. "There are few people who could've done what she has already done with these theaters."
Indeed, you do not hear anybody arguing that well enough should have been left alone. The blighted Times Square of the 1980's -- the porn shops and prostitutes, the odors of garbage and urine, the criminal element and general atmosphere of threat -- renders few people nostalgic. But is the emerging Times Square -- with two new musical theaters, a wax museum, movie complexes, chain retailers and a huge new tourist hotel -- going to salvage any of the trashy, glitzy raffishness, the Runyonesque quality, that characterizes the memories of those who cherish it? Or will it turn into a sanitized place for the mass consumer, a glorified theme park or mall?
According to a recent survey conducted at the behest of the BID by Clark, Martire & Bartolmeo, a New Jersey market research firm, 20 percent of property owners, merchants and community leaders in Times Square, believe that as conditions have improved, something of the old flavor of the place has been lost.
And some outside critics are less reserved.
"They're apparatchiks carving up one of the prime locuses of New York City culture," said Bill Dobbs, a lawyer and a founder of the advocate group, New Yorkers for Free Expression, referring to the three women. "There's got to be both glamour and sleaze in a world-class city, and those three people are intent on cutting out the underbelly of New York City. If you do that, you will kill what makes New York so wonderful and turn it into suburbia."
 
No Theme Parks In Their Blueprint
Little irritates the three women more than this kind of criticism.
"That's so easy," Ms. Cahan said. "You cannot find a mall with stores cheek by jowl with theaters like this."
On the one hand, Ms. Dykstra said, what's being eliminated will not be missed.
"This is just romanticizing the gutter, and it makes me nuts," she said. And on the other hand, Ms. Robertson added, what is being erected is nothing like a mall; a mall, she said, is a place where one developer enforces his vision on a whole venue.
"When we're done, we'll have 60 different tenants on 42d Street, arguing, fighting for product and advertising space," she said. "There are going to be conflicts and people who like each other or don't. The idea is not to make it themelike, but make it a place of stories, which comes from all that crass commercialism."
Commercialism is also at the heart of a yet-to-be-resolved legal issue, namely whether the new zoning laws that would restrict the number of adult businesses in Times Square are constitutional or merely economically convenient.
Lawsuits have, in fact, been filed on behalf of adult bookstore owners and their customers, arguing that the new laws -- scheduled to take effect on Nov. 1 -- would force owners out of business and would also restrict the customers' access to those businesses and thus violate their right to free expression. A decision is not yet pending because whether the case will be heard in Federal or state court is still in dispute.
"There is no doubt that if the neighborhood had struck a not-in-my-backyard posture, you never would've seen the porn proposals passed," Ms. Dykstra said. "But in fact, Times Square will keep 6 to 10 porn shops, different levels of them, from the 25-cent peep shows to upscale bars. The question is: When do you tip the scale? It seems to me that in 32 square blocks, 10 porn shops is the right number. People who want to use them will be able to find them."
Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said, however, that restricting businesses on the basis of their merchandise is against the law, and that the case against the porn shops is based on a smoke screen, that the concentration of porn shops in the area created secondary effects like increased crime and a decrease in property values.
The problem, he said, is that a study that the city made of this in 1994, is inconclusive.
"In our opinion, it does not meet the burden of proof," said Mr. Siegel, whose office is on West 43d Street, near Times Square.
"I'm not denying there were problems in the neighborhood," Mr. Siegel said. "And I don't condone illegal activity. But the rhetoric of the people who are handling all this gives you the impression that there is a certain kind of person that is O.K. on 42d Street, and a certain climate that can be controlled. That troubles me."
Baloney, say the three witches of Times Square.
"I'm not sure you'll ever get people from Fifth Avenue penthouses on 42d Street," Ms. Robertson said. "It's always been a place for the masses, and I think it should stay that way."
But Ms. Cahan did not agree.
"Times Square belongs to everybody," she said. "That's the whole point."

HEADLINE: Speaker Insists on Hearings On Bill to Lift Insurance Rules

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 24

 BODY:
The Speaker of the Democratic-controlled State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, said today that he would block passage of a bill advocated by the life insurance industry that would change a decades-old consumer-protection statute.
Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said he wanted time to examine the legislation and hold hearings so supporters and opponents could air their views. Consumer advocates had criticized the Legislature for considering the bill late in its session without giving them a chance to comment on it. 
 The bill would have lifted many of the regulations that restrict how much life insurance companies can pay in commissions to their agents, particularly commissions in the first year of a policy.
The rules are intended to discourage an illegal practice called churning, under which life insurance agents pressure customers to replace their policies with new ones so the agents can repeatedly reap high first-year commissions.
The industry wrote the bill with Gov. George E. Pataki's Insurance Superintendent, Edward J. Muhl. Mr. Pataki supported it.
John Calagna, a spokesman for Mr. Muhl, said the department would like to take part in the hearings. "The Superintendent felt that the bill was ready to go," Mr. Calagna said. "In our opinion, it should be passed, but if they need more time, we will be more than willing to participate."
Earlier this month, the State Senate and Assembly were preparing to vote on the bill without hearings. But after The New York Times asked why there were no hearings, the Assembly said it might hold them.
Today, Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, said he had scheduled a hearing on the bill for Oct. 10 in New York City.
Even some consumer advocates said the statute was outdated and should be changed. But they said the process should be more open. Mr. Silver now agrees, Ms. Lynch said.
"We need time to digest it," she said. "It's very technical."
The Republican-led State Senate has not said whether it will approve the legislation, but there are only two weeks left in this session, so that seems increasingly unlikely. The Senate has not said whether it will hold hearings.
Peter J. Flanagan, president of the Life Insurance Council of New York, said he was not disappointed.
"We saw this as a very strong possibility, since we were late in getting the bill in," Mr. Flanagan said. "We are looking forward to presenting our views on why this bill is good for consumers, for the insurance companies and for the economic vitality of the State of New York."

HEADLINE: Is the U.S. Souring on Free Trade?

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Ian W. Delaney, chairman of the Sherritt International Corporation, a Canadian metals company with mining interests in Cuba, has just been warned by the State Department that he, his wife and his children may never be allowed to enter the United States again.
At the same time, Congress is rattling sabers in Europe's direction, vowing -- with President Clinton's support -- that Total S.A., the big French oil concern, and other European companies that supply Iran's oil industry may not be able to get American bank loans or export their goods to the United States. 
 What's going on here?
Just two years ago, more than 100 nations completed the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. After seven arduous years, they thought they had established the basis for a freer, stronger and less discriminatory system under a powerful new World Trade Organization that would keep international commerce expanding rapidly for decades.
But now, further trade liberalization -- this time in services -- has run into a wall. With skirmishes breaking out all over, the giddiness that followed the Uruguay Round has largely been replaced by the kind of reality that experts say explains why the world has never enjoyed truly unfettered trade.
"We have sunlight, but we have shadows, too," said Renato Ruggiero, the former Italian trade minister who now heads the World Trade Organization, in a recent interview.
The United States is blamed by many for casting some of the bigger shadows -- a surprising state of affairs for the Clinton Administration, which came into office championing free trade and the opportunities it offered to American exporters. But Washington now shows scant enthusiasm for a new round of global talks.
It is taking on foreign companies, like Mr. Delaney's, that it suspects of "trafficking" in private property expropriated by the Government of Fidel Castro, and is poised to impose broad sanctions against companies investing in Iran and Libya.
It has also been battling with China over copyright piracy, a fight it settled last week, and with Japan over barriers to the sale of Kodak film. That dispute is going to the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, where the United States has 12 other complaints pending and is itself the target of complaints filed by Costa Rica, India and the European Union, among others, which accuse Washington of failing to play by the rules it champions.
At the same time, Britain has been jousting with its partners in the European Union over sanctions against its beef; Canada has floated the possibility of enacting its own legislation in response to the American law penalizing Cuba trade, and European ministers over the weekend threatened to retaliate against any American moves against Cuba's, Iran's or Libya's trading partners.
President Clinton is expected to hear about all this over the weekend at the annual meeting of government chiefs of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Lyons, France.
The reasons for the fractiousness, the experts say, are both temporary and systemic. In the short term, they range from election-year jitters, which tends to make American politicians more truculent, to the bad luck of mad cow disease in Britain.
Deeper down, the tensions reflect the hard work that still needs to be done to accommodate different business practices among countries whose approaches to environmental protection and restrictions on child labor, say, are sharply at odds.
Beyond that, not every developing country sees itself as a winner that will benefit by opening its borders, and its fledgling service industries, to an onslaught of foreign bankers and other service providers.
Finally, there is the mixed blessing in regional trading blocs, like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the European Union, which pave the way for their own trade but also act as barriers to outsiders.
The prospects for global free trade looked promising not so long ago. After wrapping up the Uruguay Round, the Clinton Administration pushed the North American trade pact through a skeptical Congress, talked of a hemispheric free trade agreement in the next century, set 2020 as the target for Pacific-wide free trade under the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation agreement and showed interest in a trans-Atlantic trade area linking Nafta and the Europeans.
What followed seemed spectacular. As Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, told the House Appropriations Committee last month, American merchandise exports have grown 31 percent since Mr. Clinton took office, expanding faster than imports in 1995 and creating a million jobs.
What isn't clear is whether the Administration's new, harder line on trade mainly reflects fears and passions unleashed by the Presidential campaign or a permanent shift in emphasis stemming from the end of the cold war.
To be sure, the United States is spreading some light. Last week it agreed, in a case brought against it in the World Trade Organization by Venezuela and Brazil, to change the way it applies environmental regulations to imported gasoline. Washington's reaction was closely watched since the case was the first to go before the trade group.
The shadows are coming from the United States' inability or unwillingness to meet the deadlines set under the Uruguay Round for new accords liberalizing trade in financial services, telecommunications and maritime transport.
In the first two areas, it walked away from limited accords, saying the offers by its partners were inadequate and did not match its own. In maritime transport, it declined to make an offer after seeing what other nations had put on the table.
Ms. Barshefsky says American negotiators must demand full reciprocity these days or see Congress throw up insuperable roadblocks to liberalized trade. "With the cold war over," she said, "trade agreements must stand or fall on their merits. They no longer have a security component. If we do not get reciprocity, we will not get freer trade."
But while American banks and phone companies may desire better access to fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets, many of those nations see little gain for themselves in such deals as long as they lack financial and telecommunications industries that can compete.
This is why European banks, brokers and insurance companies accepted the limited financial-services agreement that Washington rejected, arguing that something is better than nothing and that as developing countries grow they will see the advantages of more openness.
"American trade policy is driven by an unhealthy obsession with reciprocity," said Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economics professor. "It becomes its own enemy."
Sylvia Ostry, former chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris who is now at the University of Toronto, added: "The conventional wisdom is that America is just suffering election jitters. But I think there has been a secular trend toward regionalism and reciprocity."
Some argue that single-area negotiations, like those on financial services, are inherently risky because trade-offs are more limited than in a global negotiation when other issues are on the table -- making the power of protectionist lobbies greater.
But Jeffrey M. Lang, the chief deputy trade representative, disagrees, arguing that "we couldn't even do services during the Uruguay Round, when everything was on the table."
Yet the telecommunications talks collapsed after a lobbying campaign led by Motorola forced the Administration to reverse an offer to open the American satellite telephone market to foreign competition.
Another big shadow now is being cast by the growth of free trade areas throughout the world. More than 100 regional agreements have been registered with the W.T.O., covering about 60 percent of international trade.
The regional arrangements have proved particularly attractive to the Clinton Administration because they allow it to win concessions, especially on environmental issues and labor standards, that it might not obtain so easily in a global negotiation.
But a growing number of trade officials want to set a target date for merging all the regional blocs to create a global free trade zone with common regulations administered by the World Trade Organization. The chief European negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, has called for members of the W.T.O. to consider steps toward such a merger at a ministerial meeting in Singapore in December.
"Unless we agree to act," Mr. Ruggiero warned, "the world will become divided in 20 years into two or three intercontinental blocs, each with its own rules and internal free trade, but with external barriers against the world."
Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Lang, though, appear reluctant to embrace ambitious new goals and grand designs, preferring to concentrate on limited aims, including completing the stalled talks on services.
"We don't need rhetorical goals; we need practical results," Mr. Lang said, adding, "If we call for ambitious new negotiations, countries may take back what they are offering for the final grand bargain, and we will all be worse off."
For that reason, he said, the Administration preferred a more modest agenda for the Singapore talks. He hopes for an agreement with the European Union on freeing trade in information technology, and also that the world organization will lend impetus to the negotiations on services.
And he wants to start talks on preventing differences in environmental and labor standards from distorting trade. He insists, though, that the United States does not object to other countries' paying their workers less than Americans but only to practices like child and convict labor.
Finally, he wants agreement on a new code banning bribery and corruption in winning foreign orders, and another governing the rights of foreign investors.
"I'm not sure the W.T.O. needs glamorous, big negotiating rounds," Mr. Lang said. "We should aim for steady, small steps every year."
All the same, it is not clear that a major trade negotiation sometime soon can be avoided. The rules adopted in the Uruguay Round required W.T.O. members to open talks by the end of the decade on freeing agricultural trade and protecting intellectual-property rights.
"Call it a new round or what you will," Mr. Ruggiero said, "but there will be a lot on the table."
In the meantime, it is unclear just when Mr. Delaney, the Canadian executive, will be allowed to take his children to Disneyland again.


GRAPHIC: Just two years ago, the world seemed headed toward a global system of free trade that would take in ever more countries, products and services. Now, that vision seems increasingly elusive, as nagging trade disputes drag on.
 
Financial Services
Chart: "Precarious Balance"
 The United States has back away from talks on liberalizing trade in banking, insurance and securities, calling offers from the developing world inadequate. Other big industrial nations were ready to accept the dceal as better than nothing.
 
Telecommunications
 After the United States withdrew an offer to open its satellite phone market to foreign competition, negotiators failed to meet a May 31 deadline for a global agreement. America complained that other countries, especially in Asia, were not opening their markets sufficiently.
 
Maritime Trade
 The United States has refused to negotiate at all after dismissing other countries' offers as inadequate.
 
Disputes Between Nations
The United States has cases pending at the new World Trade Organization against South Korea, Japan, the European Union, Australia, Canada, Hungary, Portugal and Pakistan. And others -- Venezuela, Brazil, Costa Rica, India and the European Union -- have filed cases charging that the United States has not played by the rules it championed.
 
China
 The United States and China averted tit-for-tat snactions by reaching an agreement on combating piracy of CD-Rom's and recorded music. But a new battle immediately arose over China's efforts to regulate economic news carried by Western agencies. And Washington continues to oppose Chinese membership in the W.T.O.

HEADLINE: Virtual University Will Offer Authentic Degrees by E-Mail

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: OMAHA, June 24

 BODY:
Without so much as a ritual shovel to break the ground or a granite slab to mark the spot, the governors of 10 Western states today laid an intangible cornerstone for a new "virtual university" that they promised would soon allow students to take courses by computer and earn degrees on line.
At a meeting here, the governors pledged to raise the money and lower the bureaucratic barriers to the plan, which has been more than a year in the making. While details are still uncertain, the governors say the first students will be working in electronic classrooms next year. 
 Although there are already many examples of students learning at long distances from their teachers and colleagues, ranging from courses taught by mail or on television to those using the Internet, the Western Governors' University is the most ambitious yet.
The university would be an accredited regional institution, in the form of an independent nonprofit corporation, with power to grant certificates of proficiency that would be recognized by employers, course credits that would be recognized by traditional colleges and universities and full degrees.
At first, credentials would be offered in a limited number of specialties, but they could eventually be earned across the full spectrum of disciplines and at every level of accomplishment.
"This is not a replacement for the existing system of higher education," said Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, who, along with Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, has led the effort. "It is a new element. It is a supplement. It is a way of creating new choices and new opportunities. But while this is not a replacement, it is an important part of a quality education for everyone. Because this is the way the world is going to work in the future."
Terry Hartle, vice president of the American Council on Education, an association representing 1,800 colleges and universities, said the governors were being driven largely by a rising population and an expected boom in enrollment in their region, which they could not realistically hope to meet by adding to traditional colleges and universities.
"Technology is already having a profound effect on all sorts of education," Mr. Hartle said. "The question is whether you can deliver quality higher education on a massive scale using existing technology. High quality higher education is hard enough to do when you have people on campuses and in classrooms. Whether or not you can do it successfully at distances and at a large scale we do not know. "
The governors envision a university in which teachers and students will obtain reading materials not just from libraries, but also from databases; where term papers will be handed in by E-mail, and where classes will meet in on-line collaborative sessions, perhaps using video and voice links as well as keyboards. The governors say the whole arrangement will not only spread opportunities across the region's vast distances, but will also make education cheaper.
At the same time, the university would be integrated with traditional educational settings -- libraries, high schools, community colleges and state university systems, along with training programs in the private sector and even county agriculture extension agents.
Neither the teachers nor the students would need to be in the Western states, but the agreement of so many states -- and of their education communities -- to support the project would add to its credibility, the governors say.
The main questions center on whether an education obtained at a keyboard and a cathode ray tube can be as good as one earned amid the ivied halls, sporting fields, and laboratories of the traditional system. Other difficult questions are where the money will come from, whether the on-line university will compete for students and resources with traditional schools, and how a corps of teachers skilled in the new communications technologies can be recruited and trained.
Another question is whether electronic learning will deliver education to the disadvantaged, or whether the differences between computer haves and have-nots will only widen an education gap when computer skills are a prerequisite for schooling.
The governors' agreement called for each of the states to contribute $100,000 to continue the planning process. The full start-up costs have been estimated at $6 million to $10 million.
Conspicuous by its lack of involvement is California, whose population, economy and university system dwarf those of the other Western states and which has not been as active as the others in the early planning.
Among the existing models of nontraditional schools that suggest the direction the governors' university could take are the Maricopa Community Colleges, a consortium in Arizona that is about to offer an associate of arts degree entirely over the Internet.
At a more experimental level, there are virtual-reality campuses on the Internet like Diversity University and Athena University, which are trying out novel educational programs of their own.
But enthusiasts say that what is available now is just a rough prototype of what visionaries in the field say is coming.
At a practical level, businesses are interested in employees with programming skills and the ability to run computer networks, subjects natural to learn on line. Several big computer companies are supporting the governors, as is Simon & Schuster, the big educational publisher.
The planning documents for the venture are available on the World Wide Web, at:

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
An Olympic Moment For the Apple

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
MAYOR Rudolph W. Giuliani has offered a compelling gambit. Last weekend he announced the formation of a committee to study the feasibility of making a bid to bring the 2008 Olympics to New York City.
Initially I dismissed the idea as totally out of the realm -- or part of some hidden agenda.
With the Games in Atlanta this summer, how likely is it that they will return to America so soon? Was this all a slick public-relations maneuver? Or maybe part of a plan to build George Steinbrenner a stadium, a means of yanking him out the Bronx without having the Yankees leave New York?
In any event, New York made a bid for the 1984 Games in 1977, at a time when the city was crippled by financial woes. We lost the Games to Los Angeles, which turned a neat $215 million surplus.
But the city is better now, more enlightened. New York put on the Gay Games two years ago and will host the Goodwill Games in 1998. The city is in better financial shape but still in need of the sort of transfusion a huge event can bring. Not just in money or jobs, but a transformation of spirit.
"The Olympics epitomize peace and harmony, unity, honesty and excellence," said Canon Frederick B. Williams, rector of the Church of the Intercession in Harlem. "To bring that dynamic to this city, which is probably the most complex city in the world, to have that as a focus of our common life, would be akin to the week that Nelson Mandela and his wife came to visit. There was a four-day party. Crime went down. People spoke to one another. The mood was wonderful. Translate that into the Olympic arena, you get an opportunity to focus the city, to give the city a higher ideal, a higher view of what is possible."
That all sounds fine, but who will foot the bill?
Without blinking, he answered: "Jesus said that where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
The dream has different dimensions.
Otha Brown is primarily a businessman, the owner of K & B Cleaners. For 25 years, he has sat at his sewing machine and watched the ebb and flow of daily life at the point where Harlem meets Washington Heights.
From a business angle, the idea of a New York Olympics is intriguing.
"It'll make money for the city to the community: hotels, restaurants, everything," he said. "It'll create jobs. They won't last long. But it creates jobs. If it doesn't help my business, it'll help people who live in the neighborhood to get a day's work or two or a month."
When I mentioned what Canon Williams said about the Olympics bringing New Yorkers together across racial lines, Brown, who is 69, frowned.
"It ain't going to help the racial thing," he said with finality. "That racial thing is there to stay. Once the Games are over, everybody goes their separate ways."
Brown was 9 years old, growing up in Greenville, Miss., when Jesse Owens turned in his brilliant performance at the Berlin Games in 1936 and became a national hero.
"He came back here and couldn't get a glass of water," he said. "If he had come to Mississippi and tried to get a drink, they would have lynched him. It's gotten a little better; but now they are burning down black churches. You think an Olympics is going to stop that?"
Jaibe Sivadel, age 47, teaches video production at Junior High School 45 in Harlem. On Monday afternoons, he's at St. Nicholas Park playing chess. The idea of a New York Olympics is exciting to him. He agrees that the city needs a spiritual boost, by any means necessary.
"If anything could revitalize the spirit of this city, with all the negativity we've had, racially, economically and socially, the Olympics might be something that could galvanize us," he said.
I recalled what Brown had said, about America being too infected by bigotry to be saved by an Olympic dream.
Sivadel wasn't so sure. "There's polarization, but there's also a group of people called New Yorkers who will get beyond that," he said. "They'll live beyond that, act beyond that and treat each other beyond that.
"I play chess here in the park with people of all races, Asian, European, Latinos, African Americans. We all play chess together.
"I don't think New York is beyond redemption. If New York is beyond redemption, America is beyond redemption."
So. Let the Games begin.

HEADLINE: Germany's Concerns Over Rights in Tibet Clash With Trade Ties to China

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, June 24

 BODY:
A diplomatic confrontation raising Bonn's worst fears of trade reprisals has broken out between Germany and China, leaving the Government here to face the same balancing of powerful economic interests against human rights concerns that confronts Washington.
The dispute boiled over on Sunday when China abruptly canceled a planned visit to Beijing next month by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, citing a German parliamentary resolution last week that condemned China's human rights record in Tibet. 
 China called the resolution an "open, flagrant violation of international law and a serious case of interference in China's internal affairs."
Today, a second German Cabinet minister, Construction Minister Klaus Topfer, canceled a planned trip to China next week, calling the journey "inappropriate given the current situation."
German officials said the action was intended to ease tensions, but the cancellation also seemed to illuminate the gravity of the confrontation, which represents a marked turn for the worse in a relationship that Bonn had hoped to nurture.
Only a few months ago, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was courting Beijing. Germany is China's fourth-largest trading partner, after Britain, Japan and the United States.
During a visit here last July by President Jiang Zemin, Chancellor Kohl played down human rights concerns as German industrialists negotiated billion-dollar contracts, squeezing out American competitors. Such activity has irked American officials, and the State Department's top official for Asian affairs, Winston Lord, recently accused China's other major trading partners of standing by while the United States forces Chinese compliance with copyright treaties.
But the issue then was trade, not human rights. The United States says it has ended the practice of threatening economic sanctions over human rights in China.
German politicians have long been anxious to accommodate Chinese wishes wherever possible, and this month they withdrew official financing from a privately organized conference in Bonn on Tibet that was addressed by the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan exile leader.
Germany, however, rejected a Chinese demand that the gathering be canceled. And, last Thursday, the lower house of Germany's Parliament passed a resolution condemning a series of what it called human rights abuses in Tibet.
Mr. Kohl said through a spokesman today that he viewed the cancellation of Mr. Kinkel's visit with "regret and incomprehension."
At stake in the dispute is trade that doubled between 1990 and 1995 to a value of $18 billion at a time when Germany's export-driven economy is in the doldrums.
The strains in the relationship have thrown Germany's political establishment into turmoil with Mr. Kinkel, backed by German industrialists, seeking to mend fences while other politicians protest loudly at China's action.
Mr. Kinkel went out of his way today to say Bonn did not support demands for Tibetan independence. "We'd like to see cultural autonomy there," he said. "We'd like talks to be held with the Dalai Lama." But he added: "That is in no way recognition of Tibet. We want Tibet to continue to belong to China."
"I appeal to both sides to to do everything possible to make sure this does not become a serious burden in our relations," he said. "They are too important for that."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CHURCHES;
Public Supports Political Voice For Churches

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
In evidence of a striking change in Americans' attitudes about religion and politics, a majority of the public now believes that churches should be allowed to express political opinions, a reversal from what a majority believed a generation ago, according to a new nationwide survey of religious identity and political opinion.
Support for churches' expressing political opinions runs highest among white evangelical, or born-again, Protestants, a group that has grown enough over the past decade that it accounts for a quarter of the American electorate, roughly on a par with white Roman Catholics and members of mainline Protestant churches, like Episcopalians and Presbyterians. 
 The survey also shows that with the growth in their numbers, white evangelicals have emerged as a cohesive force shaping American political debate and holding more conservative views than other groups on issues including gay marriage, immigration policy and gun control as well as abortion. They are the group least enthusiastic about President Clinton, but they are divided about the Republicans' record in Congress, making it difficult to predict how they will behave at the ballot box this fall.
But, the survey also found that although Americans say they regularly hear clergy members speak out on a wide variety of political and social issues -- especially hunger, poverty, abortion and school prayer -- only about 1 of every 15 churchgoers reported being told how to vote. About twice that many, or 1 in 7, reported finding candidates' campaign literature in church before the 1994 mid-term elections.
The survey will be made public today by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, an independent research entity in Washington, formerly known as the Times Mirror Center, which is now financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia. The report, "The Diminishing Divide. . . American Churches, American Politics," derived its findings from telephone interviews with 1,975 adults nationwide from May 31 to June 9. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for smaller groups was greater, plus or minus five percentage points for white evangelical Protestants, for instance.
The survey, which also used supplemental information taken from telephone interviews from July 1994 to October 1995, portrayed a nation in which 65 percent of the population can be characterized by one of three religious identities -- white evangelical Protestant, 23 percent; white mainline Protestant, 22 percent, or white Catholic, 20 percent.
Of the remaining 35 percent, 9 percent are black Christians, including those within evangelical, mainline Protestant and Catholic traditions. Eleven percent who identify with no religious tradition. Hispanic Catholics, other religious Hispanic people, Jews and Mormons account for 2 percent each, while smaller affiliations make up the balance of 7 percent.
One question the survey posed was whether churches should keep out of political matters, or whether they should express their views on day-to-day social and political questions. When this question was asked by the Gallup organization in 1968, 53 percent said churches should keep out of politics, while 40 percent said they should express their views.
But in the three decades since, according to the Pew survey, the public's views on this matter have reversed, with 54 percent saying churches should express their views, while 43 percent say they should keep out of politics.
Among religious groups, 70 percent of white evangelicals said they favored churches' expressing political views, while 68 percent of black Christians did also.
But the survey also showed that a majority of the public still did not want clergy members to become overtly partisan. Yet, even here a shift may be evident.
In 1965, when Gallup asked if it was ever right for clergy members to discuss candidates or issues from the pulpit, 22 percent said yes. In the three decades since, resistance to politicking from the pulpit has eroded, and 29 percent are now willing to allow clergy members to discuss candidates from the pulpit, the Pew survey found. Still, two-thirds of respondents opposed this idea.
The Pew report found that among the groups it surveyed, white evangelical Protestants had been the most politically dynamic. Citing previous surveys, the survey said they had increased their strength to 23 percent of the electorate, up from 19 percent of registered voters who identified themselves as evangelicals in 1987.
Even in 1987, the number of people who identified themselves as evangelicals had risen from the decade before. In 1978, a New York Times/ CBS News poll found that only 16 percent of the population identified themselves as white evangelicals.
Commenting on the new poll, Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center said, "The conservatism of white evangelicals is the most powerful political force in the country."
The survey showed that white evangelical Protestants took more conservative positions than other religious groups, both on moral issues and some secular issues.
For instance, white evangelical Protestants were the least likely to approve of gay marriage or to favor allowing public schools to provide birth control information. And 63 percent of this group say immigrants are a burden on the country, while 55 percent or fewer of the other major religious groups express that view.
In addition, 44 percent of white evangelical Protestants support handgun control, while over 50 percent of the other major religious groups do. And 34 percent of evangelical Protestants favor Mr. Clinton's decision to send troops to Bosnia as part of an international peacekeeping force, while more than 40 percent of the other major religious groups favor this decision.
James L. Guth, a professor of political science at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., said members of conservative Protestant groups, like the 15.6 million Southern Baptists, show a growing tendency to adopt the evangelical label, as a means of identifying both their theological and political beliefs.
"Evangelical Protestants are becoming an increasingly politically cohesive force," Professor Guth said. In addition, he said, political activity by conservative, Southern Baptist ministers, including discussing issues and candidates, is on the rise and is increasingly accepted by their congregations. "It's becoming almost routine or conventional activity of many evangelical churches and pastors in election years," he said.
Nancy Ammerman, a professor of the sociology of religion at Hartford Seminary, said evangelicals were gaining in numbers nationally because an ever-greater number of people, many within mainline Protestant denominations, are calling themselves evangelicals as a means of making a statement about their religious beliefs.
"People will identify themselves as evangelical in spite of what denomination they're in," she said. "I think it's another of the many signs of the weakening of denominational identity, and the growth of new ways of people talking about themselves and organizing themselves."
But Professor Ammerman also said the evangelical label should not always be taken to imply conservative politics by those who claim it. "We have something that's going to help us understand people's voting behavior, but it's not a perfect predictor," she said, adding that political choices are often influenced by local issues and the economy.
Also analyzing how much religious teachings influence public policy debates, the Pew survey found doctrine had its greatest effect on moral and sexual issues, especially on matters like abortion and homosexual marriage.
For example, a plurality of 37 percent said religion was most influential in forming their views on the question of whether homosexuals should be allowed to marry. Over all, the survey found that the idea of legalizing such marriages remained highly unpopular, opposed by 65 percent of those surveyed. The survey said conservative religious beliefs heavily contributed to that view.
But, in a finding that may prove unsettling to church authorities, the survey also said that religious teachings have remarkably little influence in shaping people's attitudes on broad social issues like welfare and the role of women in the workplace.
Although Catholic bishops in the United States and the National Council of Churches have criticized recent political efforts to restrict state and Federal welfare benefits, only 6 percent of those surveyed cited religion as having the greatest influence on what they thought about this issue. Most people said they formed opinions based on personal experience, education or news reports.
The Rev. Robert Friday, professor of moral theology at Catholic University, said that although the Catholic Church had issued many pronouncements about social justice over the past century, tradition caused people to associate the concept of sin with personal or sexual issues.
"You don't see cartoons of people in hell because they didn't pay a just wage," Father Friday said. "It's usually for adultery and all that."
Still, it is in the area of religion and politics that the Pew survey provides some of its most interesting data.
Majorities of Catholics, black Christians and mainline Protestants, according to the Pew survey, said they approved of the job that Mr. Clinton has been doing. But 56 percent of white evangelicals said they disapproved. An even larger evangelical majority, 59 percent, said they had an unfavorable view of the First Lady. Among social issues, the survey found that some of the strongest agreement on the issue of environmental protection. Majorities in every religious group said environmental regulations were "worth the cost," although support was markedly lower among white evangelicals and Mormons.

HEADLINE: In Search for Campaign Fuel, Dole and Clinton Cross Paths

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Racing their way through hotel ballrooms across midtown Manhattan, Bob Dole and President Clinton came to New York in search of money last night, using the burst of attention that attended the dueling appearances to advance their candidacies and assault each other's credentials.
"I know President Clinton's in town tonight," Mr. Dole said, opening the crosstown exchange with a spirited speech at one of four fund-raisers he packed into a 22-hour trip here. "I know he's probably making promises right now. He's probably telling people he wants welfare reform. He told us that in 1992. Don't believe him. He probably is going to tell them we're going to have tax cuts. Don't believe it." 
 Continuing what he called a litany of promises the President had broken, Mr. Dole said: "We haven't forgotten. We're not going to let the American people forget."
While Mr. Dole was finishing his speech at the Sheraton New York by joining the crowd in a round of Happy Birthday to one of his first supporters, Gov. George E. Pataki, who turned 51 yesterday, Mr. Clinton mounted the stage at the Waldorf-Astoria six blocks away. The coincidence in timing produced one of the more unusual moments in the Presidential campaign thus far.
Presenting a far different view of the choice at hand, Mr. Clinton declared that the election offered a contrast between Republicans who believe that "government is the problem and if you get just get it out of the way, everything will be fine," and Democrats, like himself. "I believe no great nation has ever done well without giving more and more people the opportunity to succeed."
"They passed their program once," Mr. Clinton said of Mr. Dole's former Republican colleagues in Congress. "And we stopped them. If there is no veto pen, and they can keep the Congress and have the White House, you don't have to guess what they'll do."
It was money, and not votes, that brought Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole to town last night. And by the end of the night, aides to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole reported collecting nearly $6 million in contributions for their parties.
Still, the evening was a striking moment in Presidential political theater, as the two candidates brushed within four blocks of each other, though their motorcades never met. And it was potentially, if not certainly, a last for New York, because both campaigns consider the state solidly Democratic and out of contention.
For all the activity attending the parallel campaign swings last night -- the receptions, hotel shuttling, motorcades, police barricades -- the streets of midtown Manhattan were surprisingly calm. Even at the worst of moments, as Mr. Clinton went from the Waldorf-Astoria to the Plaza, and Mr. Dole from the Sheraton New York to the St. Regis, traffic did not approach such high-gridlock marks as the Friday after Thanksgiving. And the sidewalks were surprisingly empty considering the show on display.
Although Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton were in town mainly in search of money -- Mr. Dole put a campaign stop on his schedule as a last-minute afterthought, while Mr. Clinton did not even go through the motions -- their appearances nonetheless provided a snapshot of the state of their debate right now. The two men presented what they have been saying in different venues on the road, though their remarks were arguably more pointed given their proximity.
Mr. Dole repeatedly hit Mr. Clinton on his veracity, tying it to campaign promises that he asserted the President had broken.
"I'll tell you one thing," Mr. Dole said. "I'll keep my word. I won't tell you one thing in an election year and then break every promise I made to the people I made it to last year, and the year and the year and the year before. We will keep our word to the American people. They deserve the truth."
Mr. Dole went so far as to adopt, apparently unknowingly, one of Mr. Clinton's most successful campaign themes of 1992, tapping into a fear discovered by pollsters and researchers that children today will not do as well economically as their parents.
"I did not risk my life for this country and spend years in public service only to see young Americans in the 1990's become the first generation in our history not to live better than our parents did," Mr. Dole said. "This must never happen in America, and if you elect me Ppresident it will not happen In America.""
And in one moment of regional self-awareness, Mr. Dole took a bow to a matter of traditional interest to New Yorkers, suggesting that he would stand by the new Israeli Government, and its Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the face of pressure from Arab leaders about concessions for peace.
"We will back him, and we will back his people as they make the decisions about their peace and their security," Mr. Dole said.
Speaking six blocks away and 30 minutes later, Mr. Clinton asserted that his Administration had turned around problems left by 12 years of Republican rule when he became President in 1993, and had turned back current Republican initiatives in Congress. When he took office, Mr. Clinton said, the country was mired in economic stagnation and high unemployment, and "we seemed to be coming apart as a people."
"We are better off then we were four years ago, but we can't say that our problems are solved -- that we still don't have challenges," Mr. Clinton said. He called the transition to the next century "a work in progress and we need to do much more."
Mr. Clinton's aides said he raised $3 million in his visit, from a $1,000-a-person reception at the Waldorf-Astoria, followed by a $5,000-a-plate private dinner at the Plaza Hotel. Mr. Dole raised about $2.5 million, according to his aides, with some people paying as much as $10,000-a-head at the St. Regis Hotel, according to one Republican who attended.
At 6 P.M., before the first fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton posed for pictures at the Waldorf-Astoria with Lionel Hampton, the band leader and Republican supporter who endorsed the Democratic President for re-election.
Still, neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Dole made much of an effort to pretend that their visit to New York was aimed at campaigning. Mr. Dole came the closer. Between the trip to the airport and his arrival at his hotel, Mr. Dole squeezed in a quick and time-honored New York campaign moment -- a pastrami sandwich at a New York delicatessen. In this case, he spent 23 minutes at the Stage Delicatessen, a restaurant popular with tourists and politicians, which was a short block from his hotel. (Mr. Clinton stopped by for lunch there in 1992.)
The restaurant owners were given 10 minutes notice of the visit, so everything was ready when he showed up. There was half a pre-cut sandwich's worth of pastrami ("a real heart-stopper," as Mr. Dole's waiter described it), along with a giant slab of cheesecake and a Diet Coke resting on the counter. What was supposed to be a simple campaign stop did not go entirely smoothly, however.
"Senator Dole," inquired Donna Besteiro, a lawyer from Yonkers who suddenly found herself breaking pastrami with the all-but-certain Republican candidate for President, "where are you standing currently on abortion rights?"
Mr. Dole stopped short in mid-cheesecake. Glancing up from his plate, Mr. Dole took note that his questioner was surrounded by reporters, who the candidate has said are far more interested than the public-at-large in his struggle to reconcile his party over the issue of abortion rights.
"What are you -- working for the press now?" Mr. Dole responded. "I know they put you up to it. Yeah. Right. We're going to work it all out, and the press is going to be very disappointed because they won't be able to come to the convention and beat us up."
In fact, Ms. Besteiro had volunteered to a reporter that she was concerned about Mr. Dole's opposition to abortion rights. But Mr. Dole was correct one point: it was another reporter who prodded Ms. Besteiro to query the candidate on the issue.
"The press loves it," Mr. Dole continued. "What we like is where the Democrats are on abortion. They have different views, too. But they're never printed anywhere that I know of. But we're going to work it out. we're an inclusive party. I want to broaden the base of the party. I want to win the election. And I, you know, that's what it's all about."
Throughout the day, there was a quiet subtext of competition between the two visiting teams. Aides to both candidates asserted that the other side was exaggerating their fundraising take. Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, went so far as to argue that the President's motorcade presentation, from his helicopter arrival on Wall Street to his motorcade into midtown, was more formidable Mr. Dole could muster as an ordinary citizen running for President, notwithstanding his own Secret Service contingent.
"I think ours is still a more impressive one then theirs," Mr. McCurry said.
There was one element of truth last night. Mr. Dole had an escort of six New York City motorcycle officers outside his hotel. Mr. Clinton had 36.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
High-Technology Theater for Tourists

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
The Plaza Theater on 58th Street just east of Madison Avenue, originally a stable for Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d, is entering the high-technology age.
The 500-seat theater, at 42-44 East 58th Street, has been leased and is being renovated for the opening in mid-October of "Show Me New York," a high-definition television travelogue, created especially for tourists, of life in New York City. The 20-year lease was valued at about $15 million. 
 David Niles, president and chief executive of Nileshow, the producer and owner of the travelogue, said the theater's capacity was being cut to 250 seats as part of creating a "total immersion environment." The theater's name will also be changed, to "Show Me New York."
"The lobby will be modeled after the New York of 100-150 years ago, with brownstone buildings," said Mr. Niles, who experimented with high-definition television -- which creates images as sharp and panoramic as those on film -- at the old Ed Sullivan Theater at Broadway and 53d Street in the pre-Letterman era. "There will be scenes in the windows and live actors in the lobby dressed as police officers, shoeshine men, grocery sellers. Then, on the way into the theater, audiences will pass a large diorama of New York in an imagined future."
The presentation itself will begin with a light show, followed by a 22-minute high-definition television travelogue in five parts. "There'll be a helicopter ride above the city, then a look at specific sections: Greenwich Village, SoHo, Central Park, Chelsea, the financial district. The third part will be like a thrill ride, taking tourists places they can't go: to the top of the Chrysler Building, on stage at Radio City Music Hall looking at the audience, in the driver's seat of a fire engine rushing through New York traffic."
The fourth part, which is to be updated every three or four weeks, will be a look at the city at that moment, he said: "The Thanksgiving parade when it's November, for instance, and there'll be samples of the current shows on Broadway, and a look at who's playing in the clubs."
The finale, Mr. Niles said, will feature "picture-postcard views of New York -- with the audience seeing themselves as giant people walking across the Brooklyn Bridge or Times Square; television cameras will be hidden in the diorama of the future and will take the audience's pictures for projection at the end of the show."
Mr. Niles said there would be as many as 20 shows a day -- every half-hour -- with audiences provided "by tour operators and the travel business, as well as walk-ins." He declined to disclose the cost of the production, but said that "it was a very expensive proposition -- the hardware alone cost from $8 million to $10 million."
The building that contains the theater was put up by Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d as a French Renaissance-style stable in 1879; it was easily accessible to the mansion he put up on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. The building housed not only carriages and horses but also sleighs that were used in winter in Central Park. Vanderbilt died in 1899, and in 1916 his heirs converted the stable to a dance hall.
In 1928, the Fifth Avenue house was replaced by the Bergdorf Goodman department store, and the next year the former stable was leased to a theater operator, who renovated it for a movie house. The Plaza Theater building is now owned by the heirs of Jules Stein, the founder of the Music Corporation of America; the most recent tenant was the Cineplex Odeon group of Toronto, which left early this year.
E. William Judson of Judson Realty, the agent for the property, said its re-leasing as a regular movie theater had been questionable because most movie operations now involve multiplexes, making a one-screen theater economically unfeasible. Mr. Judson said that he had received inquiries from retailers and restaurant operators -- including fast-food establishments.
Charles Cohen and Steve Fredericks of the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation represented the tenant.
 
Around Manhattan
 Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, a San Francisco-based law firm, has leased 56,000 square feet at 1633 Broadway, a 48-story, 2.4-million-square-foot office building at 50th Street. The law firm will be moving and expanding its New York office from 1301 Avenue of the Americas, at 53d Street. The 15-year lease was valued in excess of $30 million. Dale Schlather of the Cushman Realty Corporation's New York office represented the tenant.
Dow Jones & Company has leased an additional 45,187 square feet at the Harborside Financial Center, a nearly two-million-square-foot complex next to the Exchange Place PATH station in Jersey City. Dow Jones already occupies about 324,000 square feet at the center; the new space will be used by its financial news services division. James P. Quinn of Cushman & Wakefield, who represented Dow Jones, said the 10-year deal was valued at about $10 million.

HEADLINE: Good for Financial Market, Bad for Workers?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Stop Inflation Before It Starts" (Op-Ed, June 21), Stephen S. Roach, Morgan Stanley's chief economist, makes a fascinating argument:
(1) "Workers have long been underpaid," and they deserve a raise. 
 (2) Because a raise would cause inflation, it must be prevented.
(3) The Federal Reserve should raise interest rates to slow down the economy and increase unemployment.
(4) If more people are out of work, they will be able to perform the public service of threatening to replace workers who ask for raises they deserve.
(5) What is good for financial markets is bad for workers.

Dollar Gains and Then Dips In Trading Dominated by Lira

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower against the German mark yesterday after briefly rising when the German currency dipped to a 22-month low against the Italian lira.
The mark touched 999.00 lire in Europe, its lowest level against the Italian currency since August 1994, after Italy's Finance Minister, Vincenzo Visco, reaffirmed his country's intention to rejoin the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. 
 The mark's decline against the lira briefly helped push up the dollar against the German currency, as market participants sold marks for dollars in order to buy lire, currency traders said.
Mr. Visco also reiterated Italy's intention to meet fiscal and economic criteria for joining Europe's planned single currency for the start on Jan. 1, 1999.
The rate mechanism sets linked trading ranges for the currencies of 10 of the 15 European Union member countries and is a precursor to creating a single European currency in 1999. Italy withdrew from the mechanism in 1992.
But the dollar fell later in profit taking. Talk that the Bank of Italy was in the currency market in an effort to stem the Italian currency's rise also helped the mark rebound off its lows, pushing the dollar lower against the German currency, traders said.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5292 marks, down from 1.5303 marks on Monday. The dollar was unchanged at 108.95 Japanese yen. The dollar fell to 1,536 Italian lire from 1,543 lire. The British pound slipped to $1.5393 from $1.5405.
But trading was thin yesterday, with interest to trade the dollar muted before tomorrow's gathering of world leaders from the Group of Seven major industrial nations.
Analysts said few if any surprises were expected from the meeting, where the focus was likely to be how to relieve high unemployment and other issues.
They noted out that the dollar had appreciated some 37 percent against the yen and 15 percent against the mark since last year, when Group of Seven finance ministers called for an orderly reversal in the direction of the dollar.
"The G-7 meeting is likely to be a disappointment vis-a-vis the dollar because they're unlikely to say anything that will take the dollar higher," said Ben Strauss, assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer.

HEADLINE: 6 Colleges With Bit of Genius Are Given $750,000 Rewards

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, best known for its "genius" grants to creative individuals, is putting its stamp on six small, innovative liberal arts colleges that it says show a certain genius in how they educate students.
The foundation is to announce today that it is giving each of the six a one-time, no-strings-attached grant of $750,000. MacArthur hopes the $4.5 million in awards will call attention to the colleges and shore them up financially. 
 The colleges -- Alverno College in Milwaukee; Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio; College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me.; Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass.; Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, N.C., and Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vt., -- occupy a small but precarious niche in higher education. In a society that increasingly questions the value of a liberal arts education, these colleges have hewed to the liberal arts model, but in highly original ways.
But as with many maverick ventures, they draw a self-selective following, which gives them limited tuition revenues, small alumni groups for fund-raising and few economies of scale. Their enrollments range from 209 students at College of the Atlantic to 2,400 at Alverno.
"Parents are increasingly asking whether this kind of education is worth it," said Woodward A. Wickham, director of MacArthur's general grants program. "With these grants we wanted to say that it is absolutely worth it, and to help insure that liberal arts and these innovative colleges and others like them flourish."
Arthur Levine, president of Columbia University Teachers College, called the colleges "path blazers."
"This is a set of institutions that are under pressure to give up their missions," Mr. Levine said. "These schools haven't done that. Instead, each one has been an innovator and given new vitality to liberal arts at a time when it is crucial."
Alverno, a Roman Catholic college for women, began its innovation in the late 1960's when it grew concerned about how it could attract more and better students. In addition to traditional subjects like history, mathematics and English, Alverno emphasizes eight areas for each student, like communications, analysis, problem solving and social interaction, using written and visual means like videotapes to record a student's progress.
"This place prides itself on teaching like other schools pride themselves on research," said Sister Joel Read, Alverno's president. "We do research, too, but on teaching and learning."
Antioch melds students' work experiences with classroom learning. Where many colleges encourage student internships, Antioch students are required to work off campus during 5 of their 12 trimesters.
At College of the Atlantic, which opened in 1972, students are required to take courses in the arts, sciences and humanities, and to demonstrate competence in writing, math and other skills. But they also have substantial freedom to make their own programs, and must complete internships and conduct final research projects that weave together the approaches of many disciplines.
Hampshire College also encourages interdisciplinary work along with entrepreneurial spirit, as it seeks to teach students skills like critical thinking, communication and how to act wisely and humanely.
"Our education is very process oriented," said Gregory S. Prince Jr., Hampshire's president. "We try to teach students how to frame questions and to develop strategies for answering them. We are not as content-oriented as traditional liberal arts education. Our students do miss important bodies of work. But in the end, they keep learning."
Interdisciplinary work is also central to Marlboro College, where most classes are small seminars, seniors take individual tutorials rather than classes, and college policies are decided in New England-style town meetings that include students as well as faculty and administrators.
Johnson C. Smith, a historically black institution, also pushes its students beyond campus, requiring that all do some kind of "service learning" in the community. It also emphasizes joint student-faculty research and faculty development.
Dorothy Cowser Yancy, the president of Johnson C. Smith, called the award "Christmas in June," and talked of enhancing academic programs and of the desperate need for more scholarships to help her university compete for students.
Besides the grants to the six colleges, MacArthur is giving $1 million to the American Council of Learned Societies in New York, to make smaller grants for specific innovative projects at poorly endowed liberal arts colleges.

HEADLINE: A Voice With Heart

BYLINE: By Stephen Jay Gould; Stephen Jay Gould is a professor of zoology at Harvard.

 BODY:
When Mel Allen, the Voice of the Yankees, died last week at 83, I lost the man who ranked second only to my father for the sheer volume of attention during my childhood. (My dad, by the way, was a Dodger fan and Red Barber devotee.)
As I considered the surprising depth of my sadness, I realized I was mourning the extinction of a philosophy as much as the loss of a dear man. And I felt that most of the warm press commentary had missed the essence of Allen's strength. The eulogies focused on his signature phrases: his invariable opening line, "Hello there, everybody"; his perennial exclamation of astonishment, "How about that!"; and his home run mantra, "It's going . . . going . . . gone!" 
 But I would characterize his immense appeal by two statements I heard him make during a distant childhood. They have stayed with me, one for its integrity, the other for its antic humor. One exemplifies the high road, the other an abyss, however charming.
The comments could not be more different, but they embody, when taken together, something precious, something fragile and invariably lost when institutions become so large that the generic blandness of commercial immensity chokes off spontaneity and originality.
The phenomenon is not confined to broadcasting. In my academic world, textbooks have become longer, duller and entirely interchangeable for the same reason. Idiosyncratic works cannot sell sufficiently, for curriculums have been standardized (partly by conventional textbooks), and originality guarantees oblivion. The great texts of the past defined fields for generations because they promulgated the views of brilliant authors -- Charles Lyell's geology, Alfred Marshall's economics -- but modern writers are faceless servants of a commercial machine that shuns anything unique.
One day in 1952, as Mickey Mantle struggled in center field the year after Joe DiMaggio's retirement, fans started booing after Mickey struck out for the second time in a row. In the midst of his play-by-play broadcast, an infuriated Allen shouted at a particularly raucous fan, "Why are you booing him?" The fan shot back, "Because he is not as good as DiMaggio." Allen busted a gut, delivering a ferocious dressing-down to the fan for his indecency in razzing an enormously talented but unformed 20-year-old just because he could not yet replace the greatest player of the age.
The Yankees were sponsored by Ballantine beer and White Owl cigars. Mel never lost an opportunity for endorsements. Home runs became "Ballantine Blasts." When a potential home run passed just to the wrong side of the foul pole, he would exclaim, "Why, that ball was just foul by a bottle of Ballantine beer."
One day, Mickey hit one that seemed destined for success, and Allen began his mantra, "It's going . . . going . . ." He stopped as the ball went foul by no more than an inch or two. "Folks, that ball was foul by no more than a bottle of Bal--." Then he stopped, thought for a fraction of a moment and exclaimed, "No, that ball was foul by the ash on a White Owl cigar!"
A man of grace and integrity, a shameless huckster of charming originality. But above all a man who could only be his wonderful cornball self -- Mel Allen, the inimitable human Voice of the Yankees. So join my two stories, and let us share Shakespeare's judgment in "Julius Caesar": "The elements so mixed in him that Nature might stand up and say to the world, 'This was a man!' "

Treasury Prices Increase New York City Prices Debt Offering

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday after reports suggested that economic growth would soon slow, allowing the Federal Reserve to delay an expected increase in short-term interest rates. Strong demand at a Treasury auction of new two-year notes eased concerns about supply, further bolstering the market.
The Treasury was not alone yesterday in offering new securities. New York City was the focus of attention in the municipal market as it priced a $1.2 billion offering in three parts. One part featured the first securities sold by an American municipality on the European market. 
 The Treasury and municipal markets were bolstered by data on consumer confidence.
The Conference Board, a business research group, said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence fell nearly 6 points, to 97.6, the lowest reading since January, indicating that Americans were becoming less optimistic about the direction of the economy. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected a reading of 102.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the Conference Board's confidence numbers surprised the market.
A report on existing-home sales by the National Association of Realtors showed some strength. But Mr. Chan said, "Since existing-home sales represent mostly contract closings rather than contract signings, some market players were willing to excuse the strength on the belief that it would just be a matter of time before these numbers would reflect the weakness seen in housing starts."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32 , to 873/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.04 percent from 7.08 percent.
Treasury prices were bolstered after the auction of new two-year notes came in strong, with a high yield of 6.30 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.56, much stronger than expected. The bid-to-cover ratio represents the dollar amount of bids received divided by the securities sold.
The Treasury will auction $12.5 billion of new five-year notes today.
In the New York City debt offering, the largest portion consisted of $820 million in general obligation bonds. Yields ranged from 4.50 percent for a bond due in 1998 to 6.550 percent in 2017. Another part consisted of $150 million of one-month taxable notes.
The third part consisted of a $180 million dollar-denominated offering in Europe. The issue was priced to yield from 6.58 percent for a bond due in 1997 to 7.48 percent for one due in 2000.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.908
High Yield . . . 6.300%
Low Yield . . . 6.240%
Median Yield . . . 6.280%

A Weighty Decision: All of Draft's Riches Can't Sway Utah's Van Horn

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
He is in his fire-red Nissan pickup truck (101,000 miles on it) when he sees his Lexus in the showroom window (zero miles on it). After he is done drooling, he drops his fiancee at the Italian restaurant where she works, drops his 1-year-old at his future in-laws and drops himself at the weight room.
He looks in the mirror there and does not like what he sees; there are not enough muscles on top of his muscles. Marcus Camby is scrawnier than he is, Stephon Marbury is shorter than he is and Kobe Bryant is more naive than he is -- but they must not be looking in the same mirror. He will be returning to sociology class in the fall; they will be the subject of sociology class in the fall. He will be playing for the Utah Utes; they will be playing against the Utah Jazz. But he is not melancholy. 
 Last one to the pros is a rotten egg, and the foul odor emanating from Keith Van Horn's stucco apartment comes from the wheat germ in the shake he drinks to gain weight. He could have been a lottery pick, he could have bought his daughter, Sabrina, a sturdier stroller, and he could have put the fire-red Nissan to sleep, but Van Horn is going to see how the other half lives. Or the other one-third.
A total of 33 underclassmen -- plus three high school students -- have declared themselves eligible for tonight's National Basketball Association draft, while the 6-foot-9-inch Van Horn has declared himself eligible for his senior year. The Toronto Raptors tempted him, attempting to alert him through an emissary that he would have been theirs at No. 2 over all, and the Vancouver Grizzlies whispered he would have been theirs at No. 3. But he lay on his futon at night, dollars and sense spinning in his head, and just said no. Final score: College 3 (Van Horn, Tim Duncan of Wake Forest and Jacque Vaughn of Kansas), N.B.A. 36.
So, not everybody has caught the epidemic. His 5-7 roommate told him, "I'd leave if $8 million was staring me in the face," and his cherubic coach -- at least initially -- seconded that, but Van Horn is still an amateur today because of a promise, because of an impending marriage, because of a baby and because of that mirror.
"I'm not going to get any worse, am I?" he said.
His season ended with a Kentucky triple-team -- Van Horn had 23 points and 8 rebounds in Utah's 101-70 loss during a regional semifinal of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament -- and he and his coach, Rick Majerus, agreed to meet the following week at their secret hiding place: the Bagelry.
Majerus needed another bagel like a hole in the head, but, over the last three years, Majerus had taken his star for sesame bagels during nearly every crisis.
The time Majerus yelled at him for never setting a pick, they made up over a bagel. The time Majerus said he could not guard a sixth grader, they made up over a bagel.
But, on this particular March day, they talked about Van Horn being able to afford plenty of bagels. The odd couple (the rotund coach, the skinny player) sat down at a corner table, and Majerus brought a steno pad so they could talk economics.
The coach estimated Van Horn's first contract would be worth $6 million over three years and began a gaudy line of questioning. He asked Van Horn what kind of car he wanted, and in a split second, Van Horn said: "Lexus. An SC 400." He asked him what kind of home he wanted, and Van Horn said, "One with a swimming pool." He asked him what his fiancee wanted, and Van Horn said, "Nursing school." He asked what his daughter needed, and Van Horn said, "A stroller she can't escape from."
Majerus drew up a budget and came to the conclusion that Van Horn should be on the next bus out of town. But then he remembered a night they had not gone for a bagel; he remembered a night Van Horn when had no appetite at all.
It was Van Horn's freshman year, in the middle of the season, and Majerus had fielded a 3 A.M. phone call from Van Horn's mother, May. She told Majerus that Van Horn's 6-8, 280-pound father, Ken, had died of a heart attack, and she asked the coach "to explain it to him and to stay with him."
Majerus pounded on Van Horn's dormitory door, and Van Horn woke up thinking: "I'm in trouble. Is it my defense?"
Majerus, meanwhile, had lost his father to a heart attack five years earlier, so he was stuttering as he broke the news.
They went to a "greasy spoon" restaurant at 4 A.M. -- the Bagelry was closed -- and Van Horn, then 18, spent the night flashing back. He remembered the time he ruined the transmission on his father's favorite boat, and that his father still kept calm. And the time his father implored him to graduate from college. "I promised him," said Van Horn, who has a 3.0 grade point average and an addiction to summer school.
Of course, there were other reasons to fatten his wallet right now. His mother -- the woman who dropped him at every basketball camp -- had sold her deceased husband's business, had turned in her Mercedes and had moved from a tailored home in Chino, Calif., to a modest residence in Reno. And his girlfriend, Amy Sida, had become pregnant during his sophomore season.
"None of us believe in abortion," Van Horn said.
So, she gave birth to Sabrina, on May 30, 1995 -- a night when Van Horn wrote a Health Education term paper in the delivery room -- and just the other month, as he and Amy sat on a shaded park bench, he kneeled on his right knee and proposed marriage. Van Horn now had three women to support.
"If anyone had a reason to go hardship, it was him," Majerus said.
He registered all right -- for Advanced Sociology 301. To the apparent dismay of Toronto General Manager Isiah Thomas (who, according to the N.B.A. senior vice president Rod Thorn, has been absolved of tampering because the Raptors never spoke directly to Van Horn), the surprise baby and the coming August marriage inspired Van Horn to wait. He wanted a year of changing diapers under his belt. His basketball scholarship would pay him $560 a month; his Christmas bonus would be $230; his financial aid was $3,000 a year; Amy's job as a waitress paid minimum wage, and his apartment was only $600 a month. He did not need an A in accounting to know that he could break even.
"It's not like we're in a high tax bracket or anything," he said. "Besides, I've seen a lot of dirt-poor people happier than rich people."
So, while the professional scouts were calling him a pale Detlef Schrempf, he did the unfashionable -- he stayed in school.
"Every time I heard someone leave, I kind of clapped to myself," Van Horn said. "Don't know if this sounds selfish, but with all these people leaving, it gave me more incentive to stay."
That, and the day he stepped on the scale and saw he still weighed 240 pounds. The way he figured it, Shaquille O'Neal's left leg weighs 240.
"One more year of these awful-smelling weight-gain drinks, and he'll be ready," his fiancee said. "But, yuck, I don't know how anyone could drink them. Yuck."

HEADLINE: Indian Point 3 Again on List Of Worst A-Plants in U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
For the sixth time in three years, the state-owned Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant in Buchanan, N.Y., was listed yesterday by Federal regulators as one of the nation's worst nuclear plants, provoking new calls by critics for the New York Power Authority to close it permanently.
Since it stopped generating power in February 1993 for a 29-month overhaul of equipment and management, Indian Point 3 has produced less than $100 million worth of electricity while costing some $500 million, according to energy analysts. 
 Power Authority officials say the plant can still be turned around, but a variety of environmental groups, energy experts and some politicians say the plant is so inefficient that while it may not be an imminent hazard, the slight risk it poses can no longer be justified.
With electricity abundant and rates in New York likely to fall as the state's utility industry is opened to free-flowing competition late next year, keeping Indian Point 3 running makes less sense than ever, said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group.
"Given the energy glut and the problems at Indian Point 3," he said, "if there is a plant one could shut down, it would be this one."
Mr. Gupta said that the council had generally supported the Power Authority's recent efforts to improve the plant, but that its poor performance had continued for too long.
In its semiannual listing of the most worrisome of the nation's 109 licensed plants, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission included Indian Point 3, the three reactors at the Millstone nuclear power station in Waterford, Conn., and two reactors near Morris, Ill.
Indian Point 3 provides electricity not to individuals, but to a variety of muncipalities and other customers of the New York Power Authority, including New York City's commuter and subway rail systems and its housing authority. On the east bank of the Hudson 35 miles north of Manhattan, it sits next to Indian Point 2, a nearly identical plant run much more successfully by the Consolidated Edison Company.
Also on the site is Indian Point 1, a plant mothballed in 1974 when its design became outdated. Many critics would like to see Indian Point 3 go the way of its dormant neighbor.
When Indian Point 3 was restarted last summer after the overhaul, Power Authority officials said they were confident the reactor would generate electricity close to 80 percent of the time, the level deemed necessary to make it competitive with other sources of power.
But new problems identified by Federal inspectors forced the reactor to be turned off again from Sept. 14 until April 9. Other recent problems included a two-day shutdown in May to fix several valves and a small explosion on June 9 in a non-nuclear part of the plant, when hydrogen gas from a cooling system leaked into a box housing electrical wiring.
"It's like the last days of the Vietnam War," said Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant based in Manhattan, comparing the Power Authority's efforts to keep the ailing plant running to the Nixon Administration's efforts to portray the war as being at a turning point.
Power Authority officials insisted yesterday that the plant could still be made efficient and remain safe. The reactor has been generating electricity steadily for two and a half months, with one two-day break.
"We've invested a lot of money in that plant, and it deserves three or four years to prove itself," said Robert G. Schoenberger, president and chief operating officer of the Power Authority. He said many plants on the Federal watch list in the past -- prodded by increased scrutiny -- had risen to become top performers.
Moreover, he said, Power Authority customers have not had to bear any costs associated with the plant's problems. The $500 million spent on changes over the last three years came from a "rainy day fund" for such contingencies, he said.
Some critics say the cost is still being borne by New Yorkers. Richard L. Brodsky, the chairman of the State Assembly's environmental conservation committee and a Democrat of Westchester, said that using such money to fix Indian Point 3 amounted to a "public subsidy of a failed facility." That money could just as easily have been spent improving energy efficiency in New York City schools or returned to customers as rate cuts, he said.
Mr. Brodsky, whose committee held hearings in May on Indian Point 3, said the Power Authority's board, controlled by Gov. George E. Pataki, must face the facts and consider other options. "Viewing the plant through two independent prisms -- safety first and then economics -- it's more and more clear that it's failing on both counts," he said.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said yesterday that Mr. Pataki had previously asked Power Authority officials "to explore alternatives to the present management of the facility" but that no decision on its fate had been made.
In the past, the Power Authority has explored the idea of turning over management of Indian Point 3 to Con Ed or another private company as an alternative to closing it.

HEADLINE: Consumers Feel Less Confident, Survey Shows

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Consumers felt markedly less confident about the economy this month, displaying a pessimism that could herald a slowdown in economic growth during the second half of the year, the Conference Board's monthly sampling of households showed today.
The business research group said its overall index of confidence skidded nearly 6 points, to 97.6, the lowest since January, and the second consecutive decline since reaching a six-year high of 104.8 in April. The rating was lower in seven of the nine geographic regions, with New England and the Southwest showing improvement. 
 A separate report found that resales of homes climbed 1.4 percent in May, stronger than expected. The rates on conventional mortgages have risen a full percentage point since the beginning of the year, and analysts said the May resales reflected commitments made earlier.
Neither set of figures was seen as significantly affecting the Federal Reserve's decision on whether to raise short-term interest rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Still, with no major indicators to be issued before then -- and with the Fed's decision considered an unusually close call -- analysts gleaned what they could.
"There is enough mixed data about the economy looking ahead to keep the Fed on hold through next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting," said Joseph Liro, economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York.
Mr. Liro said that the confidence findings themselves were hard to fathom in light of buoyant readings from the latest surveys by the University of Michigan and by ABC/Money magazine.
The Conference Board, which described its index as "choppy" recently, said it "slumped" this month, and found consumers less positive about current and future economic conditions, with weakness more pronounced about the present. At the same time, both components remain somewhat above the levels of 12 months ago.
"The decline in confidence is not alarming," said Edgar R. Fiedler, economic counselor to the board. Over all, he said, the index "continues to suggest economic growth for the months ahead, though not robust growth."
Confidence in the present situation dropped to 111.4, from 120.2 in May, while the expectations index fell to 88.4, from 92.4. Both components were revised slightly upward for May, lifting the overall index to 103.5, from the originally reported 101.2. A year ago, the present-situation index was 109.7 and the expectations index was 84.5
"I don't see this as a major deterioration," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, pointing to a reading that still hovered at a fairly high level.
New England, however, posted a confidence level of just 78.7, despite its 14.5-point June advance. And the Middle Atlantic states sank further into last place among the nine regions, dropping to 44.7, from 50.5, mainly reflecting lower expectations over the next six months.
Mr. Liro of CIBC Wood Gundy suggested that confidence tended to wane in election periods because negative campaigning depresses consumers. According to historic data provided by the Conference Board, this may have been the case in 1992, when confidence averaged 61.6, about seven points below the 1991 average, but confidence rose by double-digit percentages in 1988, 1984, 1976 and 1972 and rose slightly in 1968. The only other election-year decline within the last 30 years was in 1980, when Ronald Reagan was first elected President.
The board said that since its current survey program was begun a little over two decades ago, the incumbent party had remained in office whenever the index was 100 or more but lost when confidence fell significantly below 100.
As for sales of existing homes, the National Association of Realtors reported turnover climbed once again despite rising mortgage rates, reaching a robust annual rate last month of 4.26 million. The April pace was 4.20 million, slightly less than initially reported.
Sales rose in the Midwest and South but fell in the West and were virtually unchanged in the Northeast, the most sluggish of the four regions.
"May homes sales probably reflect mortgage commitments from a couple of months earlier," economists at Merrill Lynch told clients. Last week's report that builders broke ground on fewer new homes in May, it added, "may give a more current view of housing activity."
The median price of a resold home in May was $117,400, up eight-tenths of 1 percent for the month and 7.6 percent over the last year, the realtors association also reported.
The chief economist at Fannie Mae, David Berson, predicted today that the housing market would remain strong for the balance of the year despite moderately higher mortgage rates that ultimately should decline a bit as the economy slows.
He estimated mortgage originations at about $750 billion, 18 percent above the 1995 level and the first rise in three years. One result of this year's higher rates is that applications for refinancing have dropped about 80 percent, to the lowest level since May 1995.

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds Oldest Ally Is Renewing Friendship

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 25

 BODY:
For most of the postwar era, France and the United States have been quarrelsome allies, often differing over basic issues during the cold war like America's strategic role in Europe and how to deal with Russia and China.
Most of that ended with Jacques Chirac's election as President of France in May 1995. Relations are now so good that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will be in Lyons, France, later this week for the economic summit meeting, are extending their stay by a day so that they can spend Saturday night with President Chirac and his wife, Bernadette, in Paris. 
 The American Ambassador, Pamela Harriman, a close political friend of the Clintons to whom French officials give much credit for the improved relations between the countries, said that the personal relationship the two men have struck in seven meetings over the last year explained some of the it, but that most of the improvement was due to Mr. Chirac himself.
"Although Chirac carries the banner of the Gaullist party, he is very pro-United States," she said. That is in direct contrast to the frictions and sensitivites that have marked French-American relations since the time of Charles De Gaulle.
Madeleine K. Albright, the American envoy to the United Nations, said during a recent visit, "I think that life changed a lot when Mr. Chirac became President."
That view could soon be put to the test over Mr. Clinton's decision to oppose the re-election of Boutros Boutros-Ghali as United Nations Secretary General when his term expires at the end of this year. Mr. Chirac supports Mr. Boutros-Ghali him and told Mr. Clinton so.
Mr. Chirac wants a Secretary General who speaks French, and Mr. Boutros-Ghali studied at the Sorbonne. France also insisted last year on finding a new NATO Secretary General who spoke French and held out against Washington's preferred candidate, former Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen of Denmark, because he could not speak the language as well as Javier Solana of Spain, who finally got the job.
That disagreement was quickly forgotten when Mr. Chirac announced at the end of the year that France would gradually reverse De Gaulle's decision 30 years ago to pull France out of NATO's military structures. France will rejoin all of them, Mr. Chirac said this month, if the United States continues to support changes in the alliance that will encourage a stronger European defense identity within it.
"When the chips are down, this French Government is very, very good to work with, despite the inevitable frictions and misunderstandings," said former Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, who had frictions of his own with French diplomats during the Bosnia peace negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, last year.
The lack of defensiveness in his relationship with the United States has helped make foreign affairs Mr. Chirac's strongest suit. He has been unpopular at home since he set France on a deficit-cutting economic course late last year to prepare for possible monetary union with Germany by the end of the century.
Mr. Chirac's decision to conduct a series of French nuclear tests in the South Pacific was unpopular abroad, if not at home, and the Clinton Administration's expressions of disappointment over the tests were not appreciated in Elysee Palace.
But Mr. Chirac ended testing early this year and came out with French support for a comprehensive test ban treaty with no loopholes for small or "peaceful" nuclear explosions even before President Clinton did.
This spring, he reasserted a French and European diplomatic role in the Middle East in a way that might have caused a crisis in Washington had De Gaulle done it.
After Israel launched a strike against guerrillas in southern Lebanon that drove hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians from their homes only a few weeks after Mr. Chirac had visited Beirut, he sent Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on a diplomatic mission around the Middle East.
Mr. de Charette continued his efforts even when Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived to take over, irritating some American officials as well as Mr. Christopher, people close to the Secretary said.
Mr. Chirac conceded the leading role to the United States, but asserted that France had helped the Americans achieve peace.
The French know that their President has had a soft spot for Americans since he spent a summer at Harvard in 1953. Surprisingly, even from the hardest-shelled Gaullists in his Rally for the Republic party, there has been little criticism of his reconciliation with Washington.
But differences with the United States over legislation that would punish European companies that do business with Cuba or Iran may give him many opportunities to reassert French independence.

HEADLINE: ITT Will Expand 2 Caesars World Casinos

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The ITT Corporation said yesterday that it would expand its Caesars World casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Nev., in a move that adds new construction to an expansion strategy dominated by acquisitions.
In Atlantic City, ITT plans to build a 20-story hotel tower and to increase its Caesars Atlantic City casino by almost 43 percent, to 100,000 square feet, according to documents filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. 
 Financing for the Atlantic City project is expected to include "borrowing between $150 million and $200 million from Desert Palace Inc., with the balance coming from operating cash flow," ITT said in the filing.
At the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas, ITT plans to build a 30-story, 1,142-room hotel tower and to add 378,000 square feet of casino, retail and restaurant space, according to documents filed with the Planning Commission of Clark County, Nev.
Both plans were approved by regulators. Officials at ITT, the New York-based entertainment group that also owns Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers, declined to comment.
The plans indicated that for now, ITT is more interested in building a casino than buying one, Jason Ader, a casino analyst at Bear Stearns & Company, said. "ITT views the economics of building as more attractive than buying," he said.
The expansion programs followed months of speculation that ITT would buy a casino operator to complement its Caesars World and Sheraton casinos. In April, ITT ended talks to acquire Bally Entertainment after balking at paying $30 a share for Bally, according to people familiar with the talks.
The Hilton Hotels Corporation bought Bally earlier this month for $29.29 a share, or $3 billion in stock and assumed debt.

Excerpts From Prepared Dole Speech on Clinton Foreign Policy

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech that Bob Dole delivered today to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.
America's interests in Europe are as compelling and as urgent as they were before the Berlin Wall was breached by the stronger forces of human yearning. Yet President Clinton has persistently deferred to our allies and to the Russians, subordinating American interests to the interests of a dubious or ineffective consensus. 
 That's not leadership. And that has harmed the interests of all of us, Russian, European and American alike.
Let me be absolutely clear. With the end of the cold war, we should be building firm foundations for a century of peace, fulfilling the promise of a new future for Europe. Instead, Bill Clinton's policy of indecision, vacillation and weakness is making the world a more dangerous place. And we are missing an opportunity that may never come again.
As President I will restore decisiveness and purpose to America's foreign policy.
Today's great tragedy is that this Administration is squandering the inheritance that America -- through 45 years of struggle and sacrifice -- won for free peoples everywhere when we won the cold war.
In an era of tectonic shifts in world affairs, we must not continue to entrust American leadership to would-be statesmen still suffering from a post-Vietnam syndrome. This historic moment will not wait upon Administration officials who believe that our cold war mission was mistaken, not principled and noble, and who are still suffering from the illusion that communism merely fell instead of being pushed.
Nothing better illustrates President Clinton's failure of leadership than his uncertain and vacillating policies toward Bosnia.
After three years of opposing Congressional efforts to enable Bosnia to defend itself -- arguing that lifting the arms embargo would involve America in a Balkan quagmire -- President Clinton committed American military forces on the ground in Bosnia. Although I believe this commitment would not have been necessary if we had done what I recommended from the start, I made the decision to support our troops. It was not popular, but I learned a long time ago that young Americans risking their lives should never doubt the support of their Government and the American people.
After haphazardly getting America into Bosnia, President Clinton now has no idea how to get Americans out or how to accomplish the mission they went to fulfill.
President Clinton promised to lift the arms embargo, and then changed his mind. He allowed NATO to act as a subcontractor to the whims of United Nations bureaucrats and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He refused to allow the Bosnian people the fundamental right to defend themselves, and instead gave a green light for the terrorists of Teheran to establish a beachhead in Europe.
And, at long last, under Congressional pressure, he committed the United States to the arming and training of Bosnia -- 'I give you my word' he wrote. Yet six months after the Dayton accords, not a single bullet has been delivered, and Bosnia remains outgunned.
Unless we vigorously move to train and equip the Bosnians, the U.S. and NATO will face a 'stay or fail' dilemma in Bosnia: either pull out and ignore the resulting disaster, or become involved in an open-ended commitment with no clear purpose, no achievable mission, and no realistic exit strategy. . . .
Let me turn now to Russia.
President Clinton's misguided romanticism towards Russia has led him and his advisers to try to fine-tune the intrigues of Russian domestic politics instead of guarding against the nationalist turn in Russian foreign policy that has already occurred. Post-Soviet Russia has proved all too willing to repeat old patterns, challenging the interests of America and the West. And many of those challenges were excused, ignored and even encouraged by the Clinton Administration.
Make no mistake. I want the Russian people to succeed in their quest for enduring liberty and democracy. As President, my foreign policy will strive to consolidate our cold war victory in Europe. . . .
My policy will reinforce the independence of all the states of the former Soviet Union, will support the new democracies of Europe, will lead to the enlargement of the North Atlantic alliance and will advance effective counter-proliferation measures. In doing so, I will deal with the Russia that exists today, not the Russia we all hope to see.
Let's look at the reality.
Russian hard-line security services have regained much of their previous power. Too often, the privatization of state-owned enterprises has served to enrich pervasive organized criminal networks. The Jewish agency, laboring mightily to aid emigration from Russia, has been shut down, and ominous signs of anti-Semitism are reappearing.
Since December 1994, the world has witnessed the specter of a Russian democrat, Yeltsin, permitting the bombing of cities in Chechnya to appease Russian nationalists. More than 30,000 people have been killed, the vast majority innocent bystanders.
By remaining passive in the face of these and other troubling developments, President Clinton has given a green light to the most dangerous tendencies in the new Russia.
Forces in Russia have waged a campaign of subversion, intimidation and economic blackmail against other independent states of the former Soviet Union. I will make clear that Russian economic blackmail or military meddling in their former empire will carry costs in relations with the United States. . . .
Russian officials have conducted a campaign of threats against NATO expansion, and President Clinton got the message. He deferred and delayed, placing the threats of Russian nationalists before the aspirations of democrats in countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. . . .
I will stand firmly with the champions of democracy. I will not grant Russia a veto power over NATO enlargement.
While the threat of immediate nuclear holocaust has receded, the risk of accidental launch has increased. This makes missile defense more feasible and more necessary. Yet President Clinton is unwilling to have the United States defend itself against even a single incoming nuclear missile.
At the same time, President Clinton has been silent about Russian violations of arms control treaties such as START I and the Biological Weapons Convention. He has ignored the Russian decision to abandon the Bilateral Destruction Accord on chemical weapons. He rewarded Russian violations of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty by giving Russia a better deal.
As President, I will link Russian adherence to existing arms control treaties to the provision of U.S. assistance.
As President, I will engage the Russians in a direct discussion about the mutual benefits of missile defense and urge them to cooperate with us on this critical issue.
But one thing will be certain in my Administration: the American people will no longer be left vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. When I am President, we will deploy an effective national missile defense. We can afford it. We can do it. We should begin now. . . .
The hope of the world still rests, as it has throughout this century, on American leadership. There is no escaping the fact that only America can lead -- others cannot, or will not, or should not.
How firmly we grasp the remarkable opportunities before us in Europe will determine whether the next century repeats the violence and tragedy of the last or opens up a new era of peace, freedom, and security.

HEADLINE: Revamping Is Approved For Mesa

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 25

 BODY:
Shareholders of Mesa Inc. approved a refinancing today that turns over control from T. Boone Pickens, the company's founder, to Richard Rainwater, a Fort Worth financier. But they did not go along peacefully
In substantial numbers, shareholders voted against the refinancing, which greatly dilutes their own holdings. In addition, shareholders refused to approve a 1-for-4 reverse stock split that management had recommended. Rarely do shareholders at any company vote down management proposals. 
 Mr. Rainwater will invest as much as $265 million on preferential terms that include control of the company. His money and his presence are enabling Mesa to reduce its billion-dollar debt load and lower interest rates on the rest. Mr. Rainwater has asked Mr. Pickens to step aside as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Pickens will remain until Mr. Rainwater finds a replacement and will continue as a director and significant shareholder.
 The loudest opposition to Mr. Rainwater's plans came from hostile investors led by David Batchelder, Mesa's former president and a Pickens protege. While Mr. Batchelder and his billionaire confederates, Marvin Davis and Dennis Washington, were certainly not seen or heard at today's meeting, their influence was clear. In the Mesa proxy statement for today's voting, they said that Mesa was harming its shareholders by letting Mr. Rainwater invest too cheaply. The company has said that no alternative offer was as good.
Although the Batchelder group never reported holding as much as 10 percent of Mesa's shares, 19 percent of the shares voted today went against the terms of the Rainwater investment. More than 71 percent went against the reverse stock split.
On a low shareholder turnout of less than 68 percent, the refinancing narrowly won the required majority with just 54 percent of the total shares approving, 13 percent against and the rest abstaining. The reverse stock split failed with 48 percent in favor and 17 percent opposed.
Management had recommended the split to make the shares more attractive to investors and brokers, many of whom avoid stocks priced as low as Mesa, which has traded between $2.625 and $5.50 the last 52 weeks. Mesa, based in the Dallas suburbs, closed today at $5.375, up 12.5 cents on the Big Board in busy trading. Mr. Batchelder, who now only represents Mr. Washington, noted in a brief phone interview that he was glad Mr. Washington's shares had risen back above his $5 purchase price.
No shareholders spoke against the reverse split, but it apparently became a vehicle for protesting the broader plan. Only one holder publicly attacked Mr. Rainwater's terms.
Otherwise, the meeting, held at a hotel banquet room here that was crowded with shareholders, investment bankers, lawyers and Mr. Pickens's friends, gave Mr. Rainwater a chance to introduce himself and his investment strategy.
Having decided that natural gas prices were ready to rebound, Mr. Rainwater said, he saw long ago that Mesa's prime properties and operations made the company a winning investment. "The tide has changed in the oil and gas industry," he said. "This company is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the opportunities."

Western Resources Plans A Hostile Bid for Utility
Kansas City Power and Light rejected a sweetened takeover bid of $1.9 billion from Western Resources, and the spurned utility immediately countered that it would take its $31-a-share bid directly to Kansas City Power shareholders.
A hostile takeover would be a first in the electric utility industry, but some analysts have said that Western Resources stands a good chance. [Page D4.]
 
$525 Million for Trump's Castle

HEADLINE: Nursing Homes And Hospitals Hit by Strike

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In another sign of financial struggles in New York's health-care industry, 6,000 workers went on strike late Monday against Brooklyn Hospital Center, Jamaica Hospital and 11 other hospitals and nursing homes after rejecting management's demands for cuts in wages and benefits for new workers.
Hospital managers said they needed the concessions to cope with budgetary strains created by Federal and state cutbacks in aid and the cost-cutting pressures from health-maintenance organizations. 
 "The basic problem here is these institutions' revenues are declining as a result of the changes going on in health care," said Bruce McIver, president of the League of Voluntary Hospitals, which handles bargaining for the affected institutions. "We're seeking some concessions, and that's the sticking point."
The strike involves maintenance, food and technical workers, and hospital executives said yesterday that they were able to continue those services because managers and dozens of newly hired replacement workers filled in for the strikers. Nonetheless, hospital officials said that the strike might take its toll on maintenance and cleaning after a few days, but they added that it would in no way damage health care.
The strike, by Local 144 of the Service Employees International Union, has affected seven hospitals with 2,097 acute-care beds and six nursing homes with 2,199 beds. Noisy pickets marched in front of the institutions yesterday, but hospital officials said the police made sure the strikers did not block any entrances.
Eager to squeeze down costs, management is demanding a two-tier wage structure in which new workers would be paid 15 percent less than their experienced counterparts, with their pay rising to 10 percent less, and staying there, after two years. At present, new employees are paid 7 percent less than experienced workers, but their wages rise to the level of experienced workers after one year.
The strikers include not only unskilled workers who do laundry and housekeeping and receive about $25,000 a year, but also skilled workers, like electricians and X-ray technicians, who often get more than $40,000 a year.
The hospitals and nursing homes are also demanding cuts in the number of sick days, now 15 days a year for all workers, to 12 days for experienced workers and 10 days for new workers. Management also wants to end the practice of paying workers for sick leave not taken.
The hospitals proposed a pay freeze for the first year and a 2 percent bonus in the second and third years of the contract -- but no permanent wage increase to be built into base pay.
"We didn't want to go on strike," said Frank Russo, president of Local 144. "What they want is givebacks and to create a two-tier, which doesn't make any sense."
The union's contract expired last Nov. 30. Frustrated by a lack of progress, Mr. Russo told the hospitals two weeks ago that his union would walk out unless an agreement were reached last weekend.
Mr. Russo said management had rejected the union's proposal, which he said would raise labor costs by 1.7 percent, well below the current inflation rate of about 3 percent. He declined to give further details of the union's demands.
Among the affected institutions are North Shore University Hospital at Forest Hills (formerly La Guardia Hospital), Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, and Catholic Medical Center, which runs St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn and St. Joseph's Hospital, Mary Immaculate Hospital and Monsignor Fitzpatrick Pavilion in Queens.
The strike does not affect many large nonprofit hospitals, like Mount Sinai and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Centers, because their maintenance, food and technical workers are represented by a different and far larger union, 1199, National Health and Human Services Employees Union. Their contract expires in 1998, and several health-care experts said yesterday that the current strike could be a sign of what is to come when other nonprofit hospitals bargain with 1199.
Gregory Tarpinian, director of the Labor Research Association, a union-supported group based in New York, said, "This is the first contract that the league has negotiated in this new era of enormous cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid and the now-dominant role of the managed care organizations in setting rates. There's no question that employers are rethinking their bargaining relationships."
Mr. McIver said the hospitals needed concessions on the ground that Local 144's members receive better wages and benefits than members of 1199 -- an assertion that many members of both unions disputed.
David Rosen, president of Jamaica Hospital, said, "Unfortunately, the health-care industry is hurtling into a new competitive environment, and this is causing a tremendous amount of pressure on pricing, which in turn requires us to take all the necessary steps to reduce our costs, including labor costs."
The financial situation is so bad that some hospitals have missed payments to their pension funds while the city's nonprofit hospitals have announced that they plan more than 500 layoffs next month.
At Brooklyn Hospital, where 150 workers picketed yesterday afternoon, Frederick Alley, the hospital's president, said its revenues were down 3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. The hospital has just one week of cash on hand, he said, and is deliberately delaying payments to its vendors.
Those pleas won little sympathy from the strikers. Rickey Kellman, a 40-year-old striker who works in the hospital's medical records office, said, "If you don't give us anything more, fine, but we don't want to give anything back. You never recover from that."
Nathan Lambert, a driver at Brooklyn Hospital, was also angry about the demands for concessions. "I feel sad," he said. "We earned it, and now they want to cut us back."
Health-care experts said Mr. McIver was under pressure to deliver at the bargaining table because of criticisms that he had been too soft when he negotiated with 1199 two years ago and promised most of its workers job security.
Similarly, several experts said Mr. Russo also needed to deliver, saying that since he is part of his union's old guard he needs to show the service employees' new president, Andrew Stern, that he can stand up for his workers.
Both sides declined to predict the length of the strike.
"I bargain a lot of contracts," said Mr. McIver, who was New York City's Labor Commissioner for four years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. "Usually, I try to give as little as I can. Now I'm asking for concessions, and that changes the dynamic."

HEADLINE: Adolph S. Ochs of The Times, in the First Person Singular

BYLINE: By JEAN STROUSE; Jean Strouse, author of "Alice James: A Biography," is working on a life of J. Pierpont Morgan.

 BODY:
In August 1896, the head of a major New York life insurance company gave some advice to a young newspaperman from Chattanooga, Tenn.: "Don't do yourself anything you can get others to do as well. Confine your efforts to the impossible things." The younger man, Adolph Simon Ochs, was making a career of doing things other people thought impossible. At age 20, in 1878, he had bought the failing Chattanooga Times with borrowed money -- his father had had to sign the papers since Adolph was legally underage -- and within a decade had turned it into one of the most successful newspapers in the South. And in August 1896, the 38-year-old greenhorn was about to acquire a controlling interest in what he called "one of the greatest newspapers in the world": The New York Times.
An exhibition opening today at the Pierpont Morgan Library, "Documenting The Times: Adolph S. Ochs and the Early Years of The New York Times," tells this extraordinary story through letters, manuscripts, photographs, and cartoons from private Times archives. Artfully organized by the Morgan's associate curator of autograph manuscripts, Christine Nelson, the materials frame the events of 1896. There are thoughts by de Tocqueville and Thoreau on America's romance with the news, and a photograph of the first Times building, on Printing House Square. Only once, in 1883, did The Times use color on its front page, shown here, a stripe down one side announcing that the price would be cut. The paper hyphenated "New-York" on its nameplate until Ochs changed the adjective to a statement at the end of 1896. 
 Who was he? Ochs was born in Cincinnati to German-Jewish immigrants who moved to Knoxville when he was 7. He took his first newspaper job at 11, as a paper carrier for The Knoxville Chronicle. He left school at 15 to work as a printer's "devil" (gofer/apprentice) in The Chronicle's composing room, and over the next five years learned all aspects of the trade. Not much of a writer, he proved to be a gifted business manager and entrepreneur: he worked 18 hours a day to revive The Chattanooga Times, adding correspondents, upgrading equipment and establishing editorial independence at a time when journalistic opinions were for sale.
By the mid-1880's Ochs had married the daughter of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, founder of Hebrew Union College, and he was a prominent Democrat on the greeting committee when President Grover Cleveland came to town. Ten years later, with the country in a depression, Ochs was looking to expand his publishing operations.
When he learned in March 1896 that The New York Times might be for sale, he rushed to Manhattan to make a bid. You can follow his progress, at the Morgan, in exhilarated letters he sent home almost daily to his wife, Effie, and 4-year-old daughter, Iphigene. "My darling wife and baby," he wrote in a neat hand on the stationery of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. "Here I am in New York arriving 24 hours ago," in negotiations for "the leading and most influential paper in America." New York ran on a different schedule from Chattanooga's -- "You can't see anybody here before 10 o'clock in the morning," he complained -- and since everybody he needed to see that summer left at 4 P.M. for the country, "I can't get as much done as I like." Still, one day in June he had 8 meetings before lunch, 11 after.
The Times, founded in 1851, had been the country's leading -- staunchly Republican -- paper during and after the Civil War. When it backed a reformist Democrat, Cleveland, against a corruption-tainted James G. Blaine in 1884, however, Republican readers and advertisers deserted it in droves. Cleveland won the election. Ownership of The Times passed into Democratic hands. Poor management expedited its decline. By 1896 it was $350,000 in debt and losing $2,500 a week. Paid circulation stood at 9,000 while its rivals sold hundreds of thousands of copies a day. Its stock could be had for 25 cents on the dollar.
"I have got the chance that occurs only once in a century," Ochs exulted to Effie. He obtained a letter of endorsement from President Cleveland (elected again in 1892, the only President to serve nonconsecutive terms), and managed to persuade The Times's chief stock and bond holders that he could resuscitate the paper, eliminate its debt and make it turn a profit without sacrificing quality or standards.
In trepidation he went down to Wall Street to ask one creditor, J. Pierpont Morgan, to exchange his old bonds for new ones. To Ochs's astonishment, the formidable banker rose to greet him, shook his hand, and said warmly: "So you're the young man I have heard about. Now, where do I sign the papers?" Ochs crowed to his wife in August, "The deed is did." She wrote back, "This is a great day for the little boy who tramped the streets of Knoxville selling papers."
It was not only Ochs's energy, self-confidence and track record with The Chattanooga Times that won him the confidence of high-powered men in New York. He saw an opening in a competitive market in which scandal-mongering "yellow" papers -- Joseph Pulitzer's World and William Randolph Hearst's Journal -- were in ascendancy. An 1898 caricature of Hearst, pasted into a scrapbook Ochs kept, shows a horse-faced rival dressed in yellow painting the town in slogans about "de Joynal." The Sun had well-written copy but little hard news; the Tribune was dull, the Herald preoccupied with society gossip. Ochs promised his backers he would create a "high standard daily journal, a model for fairness, cleanliness, independence and enterprise."
Furthermore, his political and economic views largely coincided with theirs in a crucial election year. It is hard to imagine, 100 years later, how bitterly the country was divided during the 1890's depression over the politics of money: whether to stay on a stringent gold standard, or try to ease the depression (and erode the value of the dollar) by coining silver. Populist silverites in the Democratic South and West accused Eastern plutocrats of prolonging the depression for private gain. Defenders of the gold standard warned that "cheap" money meant anarchy and the country's descent to the status of banana republic.
Ochs, like Cleveland, was a fervent "gold Democrat": his Chattanooga paper had come out for "sound" money when most of the South was for silver. While he negotiated for The Times in June 1896, the Republicans nominated the Governor of Ohio, William McKinley, on a platform committed to gold. In July, the Democrats rejected Cleveland in favor of the oratorical genius and devout silverite William Jennings Bryan. Bryan delivered his famous "cross of gold" speech to this cheering convention. Gold Democrats bolted the party in disgust. The day after the convention, Ochs told Effie, 150 Democratic members of the New York Stock Exchange carried American flags to the rostrum and put on McKinley buttons, crying, "Down with the red flag" -- symbol of anarchy -- "and up with the Stars and Stripes!"
In his first issue as publisher of The Times on Aug. 19, 1896, Ochs printed a statement of his journalistic credo. The words have since become famous, and it is fascinating to see the handwritten rough drafts, on hotel stationery and telegraph forms, as Ochs formulated his thoughts. He had a little domestic editorial help: "You will observe I trimmed it down considerably from what I showed you last Sunday," he told Effie, "leaving out the pyrotechnics as you suggested." It was his "earnest aim," he announced in the published statement, to give the news concisely, clearly, promptly and "impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved." He would invite intelligent discussion on all questions of public importance. And he would not depart from the policies that had distinguished The Times as a "nonpartisan newspaper -- unless it be, if possible, to intensify its devotion to the cause of sound money and tariff reform, opposition to wastefulness and speculation in administering public affairs, and in its advocacy of the lowest tax consistent with good Government, and no more Government than is absolutely necessary." It was a measure of this moment's moral absolution that, with no trace of cynicism, an honest proponent of sound money and small Government could proclaim them nonpartisan issues.
With McKinley in the White House, Ochs put his principles into practice. He refused to let reporters use free railroad passes, a "favor" that had been standard newspaper procedure for years. When Spencer Trask, a banker and chairman of The Times Publishing Company, objected to an editorial, Ochs wrote back: "I do not understand that you have any control whatsoever of the editorial conduct of The New-York Times."
Ochs himself coined the slogan, "All the news that's fit to print," stressing news and fit to distinguish the paper from its sensationalist rivals. Not convinced that the phrase entirely worked, he held a contest for a better one, an astute public relations move that focused national attention on the image of The Times. "Realizing that the sewer and morgue fields were fully occupied by The World and The Journal," noted a San Francisco paper, "Ochs determined to issue a clean paper for a change." Two thousand responses poured in. An independent judge found none preferable to the original. First prize went to "All the World's News, But Not a School for Scandal."
With his high ideals and hands-on knowledge of the business, Ochs turned The Times into the best daily paper in the United States -- the newspaper of record. He cut costs, increased advertising volume, jettisoned the fiction that was appearing on the front page, widened the space between lines of type, improved the quality of typeface, newsprint and ink, introduced rotogravure printing, expanded business coverage and demanded first-class news reporting. Within a month of taking over, he added an illustrated Sunday supplement and a Saturday book review section. Circulation rose from 9,000 in 1896 to 465,000 by the time Ochs died in 1935. The paper has been owned and run by his descendants ever since.
Among the many pleasures of the Morgan Library exhibition are responses to the new regime. One reader professed "shock" that the Sunday magazine was "filled with a lot of fashion plates," and six months later relayed a gripe about insufficient coverage of college sports. The head of the Shubert Theater was outraged when The Times gave Sunday space to a freelance piece critical of a current Shubert play after the daily paper had praised it: why couldn't the editors leave well enough alone?
When a 1901 book about the vices, ignorance and lack of ambition of the American Negro -- written by an American Negro, William H. Thomas -- got a favorable Times review, the paper published a strong letter of protest by a white Alabama preacher, and the editor sent both review and letter to Booker T. Washington, inviting him to reply. Washington thought the preacher's letter sufficed, but answered in private: "I think this book is one of the most despicable and indefensible publication[s] that has ever come before the public and all the more so as having come from a member of the race at which it is a direct blow."
Visual highlights of the show include an early photograph of printers operating linotype machines, and another of a paper-strewn newsroom with mustached reporters in three-piece suits and high-laced boots. There is a pencil sketch of "A. Smarty Ochs," drawn by his irreverent fiancee a year before they married. And in a poignant photograph of Ochs at 16 (going on 35), wearing a tall bowler, white waistcoat and neatly fitting jacket, he looks off into the high distance as if setting his sights on difficult things.
 
A Guide to the Exhibitions
 Exhibitions drawn from the archives of The New York Times commemorating the 100th anniversary of the purchase of the newspaper by Adolph S. Ochs are opening this week at four New York City cultural institutions.

 Because of a transcription error, the subsequent sentence in the article was rendered incorrectly. It should have read: "It was a measure of this moment's moral absolutism that, with no trace of cynicism, an honest proponent of sound money and small government could consider them nonpartisan issues."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 27, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about an exhibition of Adolph S. Ochs's correspondence, at the Pierpont Morgan Library, misquoted a word of his journalistic credo for The Times on his takeover as publisher in 1896. The passage should have read: "He would not depart from the policies that had distinguished The Times as a 'nonpartisan newspaper -- unless it be, if possible, to intensify its devotion to the cause of sound money and tariff reform, opposition to wastefulness and peculation in administering public affairs, and in its advocacy of the lowest tax consistent with good Government, and no more Government than is absolutely necessary.' " (He did not say "speculation.")

GRAPHIC: Photo: WRITING HOME In a letter to his wife and daughter in June 1896, Adolph S. Ochs recounted how he had won over a crucial Wall Street creditor, J. Pierpont Morgan, in his quest to buy The New York Times. "Well, it took me just fifteen minutes to secure Mr. Morgan's signature for $25,000; and I walked out on air with his signature in my inside pocket." The purchase and what it wrought is chronicled in correspondence, manuscripts, photographs and cartoons in an exhibition opening today at the Pierpont Morgan Library.

HEADLINE: Responsible Water Use

 BODY:
To The Home Section:
The real nightmare in the June 13 article "Trickle-Down Showerheads:A Real Nightmare" was its glib argument that responsible water use is something to be paid lip service to but circumvented whenever possible. New Yorkers who remove showerhead water restrictors are not only breaking the law but thwarting one of their city's most important environmental protection efforts. 
 In the past, New York's water supply has been cheap and plentiful. As the city grew, increased consumer demand threatened to exceed the amount of water the city could reliably deliver to its customers and process through its waste-water treatment plants.
The city answered this challenge with the nation's most innovative water-conservation programs, including initiatives that promote low-flow showerheads. These programs save 150 million gallons a day, hardly a drop in the bucket. As a result, the city has avoided the need for new water sources and expanded waste-water treatment capacity, undertakings that would involve significant economic and environmental costs.
The article also misreported basic facts. Low-flow showerheads vary in performance; some are virtually indistinguishable from older, high-flow models. Tenants who don't like one model may choose another.
New York has one of the world's finest water supplies. Maintaining that legacy is a serious business that deserves more thoughtful coverage.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against the Yen But Weakens Later in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday in reaction to a bomb blast in Saudi Arabia but weakened against European currencies as optimism faded for interest rate cuts in Germany and Italy.
Currency traders feared the repercussions of the Saudi blast could destabilize the Persian Gulf and hurt Japan, which depends on Saudi oil. 
 Trading was light ahead of today's meeting of officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations in France. Traders were reluctant to make any major moves because of the possibility that the summit meeting might produce news that would affect exchange rates.
"When you have all those officials in one place for a couple of days, there are bound to be some statements coming out," said Elena Shperling, chief dealer at the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 109.42 yen, up from 108.95 on Tuesday. The dollar traded at 1.5257 marks, down from 1.5292 marks. The British pound was quoted at $1.5407, up from $1.5393.
The dollar rallied in Asian dealings on the news of the deadly truck bombing at a United States military housing complex in Saudi Arabia, a leading oil exporter. But the dollar weakened later in Europe after the governor of the Bank of Italy, Antonio Fazio, doused hopes for lower Italian interest rates, telling a meeting of Italian bankers he wanted to see more evidence that inflation had fallen below 4 percent, as preliminary data indicated last week. Final figures are due July 5.
Mr. Fazio's remarks weakened the Italian bond market and dragged down the lira against the mark and other European currencies. The strength of the mark indirectly weakened the dollar.
The mark derived further strength against the dollar from the likelihood that the Bundesbank would not reduce German interest rates at the regular meeting of its policy-making council today.
That view was reinforced after Reimut Jochimsen, a senior Bundesbank policy maker and head of the regional central bank based in Dusseldorf, told a German news agency that the central bank had already taken bold steps in April to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates.
Nonetheless, there was a minority view that the Bundesbank might make a small reduction in its securities repurchase rate.

HEADLINE: Despite U.S. Hope and Help, Ukraine's Star Fades

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: DONETSK, Ukraine

 BODY:
Three summers ago, Ludmilla and Aleksander Kozlov welcomed some foreign visitors into their modest home with wine served in long-stemmed glasses, a table laden with cold meats and salads and plenty of zest for the future.
Today, embarrassingly, there is no food for a guest, and the living room cabinet hides the glasses that have been stashed away, along with, it seems, their hopes. 
 Like millions of workers in Ukraine, from police officers to teachers, from doctors to civil servants, Mr. Kozlov, a 43-year-old coal miner, has not been paid in six months. His back pay, he said, amounts to the equivalent of nearly $1,000.
"We go down to the mine headquarters to demand bread, not what we are owed," Mrs. Kozlov said as she offered the only luxury on hand, instant coffee. "People are so angry they are ready to eat each other."
The image is far from the prosperous, independent Ukraine that Washington has bet on to dampen the dreams of Russian nationalists who want to re-create an empire.
Still, American policymakers describe the stability of Ukraine -- sandwiched and swayed by Russia to the east and by Poland to the west -- as a vital security interest. Toward that end, they have plied Ukraine with nearly a billion dollars in aid in the last four years, making it the third largest recipient of American assistance, ahead of even Russia and behind only Israel and Egypt.
Despite this, Ukraine, a place once big, rich and nuclear armed -- second only to Russia among the Soviet republics -- is today only big. Many of the citizens of this independent country of 52 million people now look with envy at the comparative economic success of their former Soviet neighbors, who are still struggling themselves.
But the Ukrainian Government has pleased Washington by managing, despite the country's almost total reliance on Russian oil and gas, to keep Moscow at bay. It has also given up its huge nuclear arsenal, a process that, helped by $400 million from the United States and many visits by Defense Secretary William J. Perry, was completed in June.
The President, Leonid Kuchma, the former boss of Ukraine's biggest rocket factory who was elected two years ago, has projected Ukraine toward the West by having the army take part in military exercises with the United States and Europe.
Mr. Kuchma, who visited Poland twice in June, has become more enthusiastic in recent months about an expanded NATO, part of a further tilt to the West and away from Moscow. And Ukraine, like Russia, joined the Council of Europe last year.
But these benchmarks of Ukraine's new place in the world have made little impression on ordinary Ukrainians, who have suffered sharp drops in their standard of living since independence in 1991.
Ukraine remains bedeviled by a corrupt and backward-looking political elite dominated by former Communists and socialists. The Government has prefered collectivization to privatization and snail-paced reforms that make Russia's middling efforts look revolutionary. Whether they look east or west, Ukrainians see people, once part of the same Communist system, who are now far better off.
The difference seems to be especially galling to them since Ukraine, with some of the world's best black soil, was once the breadbasket of the Soviet Union. Even today it retains an industrial base -- antiquated but vast -- of nuclear power plants, steel works, armament factories, engine plants and satellite research sites.
The Kozlovs, in the mineral-rich Donets Basin region in eastern Ukraine, once a center of industrial strength, look with envy at the comparative richness of their Russian neighbors.
The Kozlovs' 17-year-old son, Vanya, dropped out of school this year and went to Moscow to work at a construction site. The $500 he brought home was critical to the family's survival and allowed for a few frills, like toy cars for his 7-year-old brother, Maxim.
When he is not in Moscow, Vanya works as a car-park attendant, washing and guarding the cars of the mine bosses. "It's demeaning, but at least he is bringing in money," Mrs. Kozlov said.
In the city of Zhitomir, 100 miles west of Kiev, people like Viktor Gumankov, the director of a machine-making factory, talk about neighboring Poland and wonder why the economic turnaround there cannot be replicated at home.
Mr. Gumankov, the son of a landowner who was arrested and sent to the Siberian gulag by Stalin, has privatized the state factory he manages and kept the 152 employees from the Communist period working.
"But every day it's a struggle, and we are all very tired," Mr. Gumankov said. "We can't make enough from our machinery products, so I've had to do a joint venture with a Polish firm to sell potato crisps."
In a recent speech in Kiev that shook a room full of top Ukrainian officials and Western diplomats, who had just finished congratulating themselves on an improved economic picture, Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist, warned that the Ukrainian economy was "worsening in many ways."
It was not good enough, he told the experts, that inflation had dropped sharply to 0.7 percent in May from triple digits two years ago. Or that a $900 million loan program with the International Monetary Fund, which was suspended in January because the Ukrainians had printed too much money, was back on track.
Ukraine's economy was so shaky that the monetary fund believed it was less of a risk to lend Russia $10.2 billion over three years, as it did earlier this year, than to lend Ukraine $900 million over one year, a Western diplomat said.
Production fell 11.8 percent in the first quarter this year, the biggest slump among the nations of the former Soviet Union. About 50 percent of the economy is in the black market, largely because of efforts to evade huge taxes. The total taxes on some businesses imposed by Parliament often amounts to 89 percent.
But perhaps the biggest restraint on economic growth, Mr. Sachs suggested, was the pervasive corruption. President Kuchma has been disappointingly weak in cleaning up corruption, an American official said.
"This country is still hostile to small business: people have to pay bribe after bribe after bribe" for even seemingly basic things like opening a bank account, he said.
Others have suggested that one of the reasons for the meager foreign investment in Ukraine -- $700 million, compared with $13 billion for Hungary, a country with one-fifth the population -- are the under-the-table payments required for entry into the market.
Another reason for Ukraine's dismal foreign investment is the hostility to the idea of property rights. Western businesses have balked at investing because they cannot secure company ownership of land or property from the state. A draft constitution now under discussion in Parliament to replace the Soviet Constitution was watered down in May so that property ownership is excluded as a basic right.
Washington's biggest fear in Ukraine is the potential for chaos, and that is the underlying reason for continuing high levels of assistance, including 52 programs financed by the United States Agency for International Development.
"The country won't make it without the support of the West," an American official said. "They don't have the self-confidence to do it without the feeling of having friends."

HEADLINE: How a Sure Summer Hit Missed

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, June 26

 BODY:
Sometime in early 1995, Lou Holtz Jr., a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, completed his first screenplay, a comedy called "The Cable Guy," and sent it to some friends who are producers. They introduced him to two agents, Tom Strickler and Ari Emanuel, at the fledgling Endeavor Agency.
Within days the agents had received an enthusiastic phone call from Bernie Brillstein, a top talent manager. He said the script was a perfect vehicle for one of his clients, Chris Farley, the former "Saturday Night Live" comedian whose movie career had taken off with the teen-age comedy "Tommy Boy." 
 The agents, with Mr. Brillstein and an associate, Mark Gurvitz, promptly took the script to Columbia Pictures. Desperate for a comedy to release in the summer of 1996, Columbia bought the script for $750,000, plus an additional $250,000 that would be paid to Mr. Holtz if the movie was made. Mr. Holtz took a leave of absence from his job, flew to New York and began meeting with Mr. Farley to discuss his potential role as a lonely cable repairman who makes a house call on a yuppie customer and then tries desperately to befriend him.
"It was a comedy about a needy cable guy you can't get rid of," Mr. Holtz said in an interview.
From this relatively modest start, "The Cable Guy" grew into a monster, though not, unfortunately for Columbia, one of the box-office kind. The final version, released two weeks ago, cost $60 million to make and market. Of that, $20 million went to the star, who was not Mr. Farley after all but the biggest and most-sought-after comic in the movies, Jim Carrey. By then Mr. Holtz was long gone, replaced by friends of Mr. Carrey, and the screenplay had been rewritten many times. Along the way, the quintessential Carrey character -- silly, sophomoric but essentially winning -- was lost. In the final version, the repairman is a violent, maniacal and generally unfunny person who almost destroys the life of the customer, a young architect played by Matthew Broderick.
The movie was greeted with scathing reviews (Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that it offered "the shocking sight of a volatile comic talent in free fall") and disappointing attendance. It took in $19.8 million in its all-important first weekend, an amount that does not seem puny until it is compared with receipts for Mr. Carrey's last film, "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls," which grossed $37.8 million in its opening weekend.
So far "The Cable Guy" has brought in gross revenue of more than $40 million. Its makers insist that it will eventually make a profit, and they are probably right. But that would not diminish the sense that this movie -- one of the most eagerly awaited and, because of Mr. Carrey's enormous salary, closely watched releases of the summer -- is one of its biggest letdowns, raising serious questions about decisions on both the creative and financial sides.
"The original script was basically a silly buddy comedy," Ben Stiller, who directed the movie, said in an interview. "What I wanted to do was make a comedy that satirized the psycho thrillers like 'Cape Fear' and 'Hand that Rocks the Cradle' and 'Fatal Attraction.' "
According to executives and others involved in the project, the deal to sign Mr. Farley ground to a halt almost as soon as Mr. Carrey expressed interest in the role. Mark Canton, chairman of Columbia-TriStar, quickly came up with the offer of $20 million, a figure that stunned the movie industry.
As is common practice among film stars, Mr. Carrey brought friends into the project. One was Judd Apatow, a comedy writer who had worked for HBO's successful "Larry Sanders Show" but whose films, "Celtic Pride," and "Heavyweights," had been box-office failures. Another was Mr. Stiller, an actor who had directed the Generation X film "Reality Bites."
Mr. Holtz, who is the son of the well-known comedian, not the football coach, was bounced as screenwriter.
"Carrey did not want to meet with me, did not want to give me any notes," Mr. Holtz said. "I was told I was out as soon as the studio could make a deal with Apatow."
At Mr. Carrey's request, Mr. Apatow revised the buddy script to make it bleaker. "There were four drafts, each with a completely different ending," Mr. Apatow said. "We were going for a funny version of the classic stalker films. That's what we wanted.
"Jim said: 'I can't keep repeating myself. My audience is going to get bored. I can't keep making Ace Ventura. If I don't progess as a creative person, I'm going to go stale and the audience won't come anyway.' "
At least one of the drafts called for ending the movie with Mr. Carrey's impalement on a cable dish. A more benign ending was finally written, but many critics denounced the film nonetheless for what they saw as mean-spiritedness and, worse, a lack of humor.
Before the movie's release, Mr. Apatow and Mr. Holtz also battled before the Writers Guild for screenplay credit, with Mr. Holtz winning. Mr. Apatow is listed as a producer.
Mr. Stiller maintains that "we made the movie we wanted to make." But executives at rival studios said that Mr. Carrey and his team seriously misgauged the star's audience. By all accounts, Mr. Carrey -- who refused to be interviewed for this article -- wants to model his career after that of Robin Williams, who moved from brash comedy roles to more dramatic parts in such films as "Dead Poets Society" and "Awakenings." Mr. Williams kept his audience, but many in the industry say that was because those roles and others he chose were essentially humane and gentle parts.
Top movie stars like Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford rarely deviate from certain roles. Mr. Cruise has played more or less the same character since he attained stardom in the 1983 comedy "Risky Business": that of the brash, ambitious and, ultimately winning hero, like his role in his current hit, "Mission Impossible."
"The audiences don't fall in love with Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks," said a top studio executive, speaking on condition that he not be named. "They fall in love with the characters they play. It's not about the stars. It's what they become on screen. That's where Jim Carrey didn't get it. It's not about him."
People involved in "The Cable Guy" said that Columbia Pictures and some of the film's producers had been dismayed when the first preview of the film was screened in Sacramento three months ago. But Columbia had locked itself into an opening date in June and refused to delay the release. Hasty efforts were made to revise the film.
Mr. Holtz saw it in a studio conference room in May. It was not exactly what he had in mind, he said, but he did not want to criticize it. "It's fair to say it's darker than I imagined it would be," he said.
The decision by Mr. Canton to pay Mr. Carrey $20 million, a record sum, brought a storm of criticism from rival executives, who said the deal would lead to a dizzying round of inflation in stars' salaries.
In an interview, Mr. Canton said that despite all the criticisms, the movie would turn a profit once overseas box office and video sales were counted.
"This is the most overscrutinized business success in recent memory," Mr. Canton said. "We're going to have a very profitable film."
"Would we have liked to have done better? Of course," he added. "But at the end of the day we're going to make money on this."

HEADLINE: Greece Gives a Last Sad Farewell to Papandreou

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ATHENS, June 26

 BODY:
As jet fighters flew low overhead, hundreds of thousands of Greeks bid farewell today to Andreas Papandreou, the charismatic former Prime Minister who dominated Greek politics for more than a decade.
Mr. Papandreou died on Sunday of a heart attack at 77. In the following days, huge crowds have passed by his flag-draped coffin at the central Greek Orthodox cathedral in Athens. 
 Today, about 200,000 mourners from all over Greece braved 102-degree temperatures to line the route from the cathedral to the First Cemetery as Mr. Papandreou's coffin passed on a gun carriage.
His wife, Dimitra, 41, sobbed quietly as the coffin was lowered into a grave several yards from that of Mr. Papandreou's father, George, a centrist Prime Minister who influenced his son's entry into politics. Mr. Papandreou's former wife of 38 years, Margaret, and their four children hugged one another.
Greece's Orthodox Primate, Archbishop Seraphim, presided over the service at the cathedral, where air conditioning was installed specially for the funeral.
In his eulogy, Prime Minister Costas Simitis called Mr. Papandreou's entry into Greek politics in 1964 "a new period" in the country's leadership. He said that Mr. Papandreou had given up a successful career as dean of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, because he believed "in the humanization of society, in Greece's renewal."
Mr. Papandreou was active in the fight against a right-wing military junta from 1967 to 1974, founding a resistance group that was the precursor to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement he formed in 1974.
Elected Greece's first Socialist Prime Minister in 1981, Mr. Papandreou's first eight-year administration changed the country with social welfare policies that liberally distributed funds among the lower classes. He brought the Socialists back to power in 1993, but stepped down in January because of ill health.
Flags flew at half-staff today, which had been declared a day of national mourning. Representatives from about 80 countries attended the funeral, including Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin of the United States.

HEADLINE: Latest Offer For Utility Is $1 Billion

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
A subsidiary of the Southern Company said yesterday that it would offer $1.04 billion in cash for the nonnuclear power plants of the Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, a Louisiana electric utility.
The bid by the Atlanta-based Southern, which is the parent of five electric utilities and also one of the nation's most profitable utilities, is lower than some made this year. 
 Cajun, which serves about one million customers in Louisiana, is being reorganized under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but outsiders are attracted to the company, which has 1,700 megawatts of mostly coal-generating capacity and sells power to 12 rural electric cooperatives.
William Tilles, the utility analyst for Smith Barney, said that Cajun's bankruptcy status provided a rare opportunity for other utilities and companies to buy regulated assets without having to deal with management, which currently has little say.
Cajun Electric has accumulated debt of $4 billion partly because of its investment in the River Bend nuclear power plant. A Federal agency, the Rural Utilities Service, urged the cooperative to invest in the River Bend plant in the 1980's as an economical way to increase capacity -- and offered Federal financing.
After Cajun bought a 30 percent stake in River Bend, the demand for electricity began to stagnate and construction delays and cost overruns made the plant more expensive.
The cooperative began to increase its rates to cover the servicing of its debt, but the Louisiana Public Service Commission ordered Cajun to lower rates, which put the cooperative in default on its debt to the Rural Utilities Service. Cajun filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 21, 1994.
The Rural Utilities Service and the Louisiana Public Service Commission are still battling in bankruptcy court over who has the right to set rates for Cajun Electric.
Mr. Tilles said a final decision on a reorganization plan would be made by Ralph R. Mabey, the court-appointed trustee, Frank J. Polozola, the bankruptcy judge, and Cajun's creditors. Cajun has until Aug. 24 to present its plan.
Bidders believe that they can get the assets at a good price and then run them better, Mr. Tilles said. "It extends your reach and your ability to move bulk power," he said.
Under Southern's plan, its subsidiary, Southern Electric International, would agree to 25-year contracts to provide all the electricity to the Louisiana cooperatives. Rates would be about one-fifth less than the current wholesale rate of 4.88 cents a kilowatt-hour, the company said.
Mr. Mabey has backed a $1.11 billion bid by the Ziegler Coal Holding Company and the Northern States Power Company. A $1.2 billion bid has been filed by Entergy Inc. and the Central and South West Corporation. There is also a $1 billion offer from the Enron Corporation, a natural gas company based in Houston.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods In Strong 3.3% Rise in May

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Strong demand for new commercial aircraft drove up durable goods orders for May at the sharpest rate in nine months, the Commerce Department said today, in the latest sign that American manufacturing was reviving.
New orders for goods from airplanes to refrigerators jumped 3.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $171.83 billion, triple the gain that had been forecast. 
 It was the biggest monthly rise in orders since August last year, when they increased 5.1 percent, and came after a decline of 1.8 percent in April.
Most of the May increase was accounted for by aircraft and parts, though the department did not separately value aircraft orders since the data are given confidentially by a few key producers like Boeing.
"Manufacturing hasn't died yet," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist with MCM Moneywatch Inc. in New York. "We get Boeing orders daily and auto production has been on the increase to catch up with demand."
But excluding the transportation goods category, which covers aircraft as well as cars and parts and other items like ships and military tanks, orders were up just seven-tenths of 1 percent in May after a 1.8 percent April gain.
Shipments of finished products picked up in May and order backlogs kept fattening, an indication that factories have business ahead that will bolster employment and income growth.
Transportation orders climbed 12.2 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted $42.9 billion after a drop of 12.1 percent in April.
The surprisingly robust report came as the National Manufacturers Association urged the Federal Reserve not to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
"A growth rate of 2.8 percent is possible if monetary policy, which has been restrictive throughout the early 1990's, is loosened," said a study issued by the Manufacturing Institute, which does research for the association.
The economy is widely expected to grow at an annual rate as high as 4 percent in the second quarter before slowing in the second half.
There were several signs of manufacturing-sector vigor in the durable goods report, buttressing other recent indicators including last week's survey by the Federal Reserve of business conditions around the country that said activity was improving in many regions.
Industrial machinery orders increased 2.5 percent, to $33.5 billion, after a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in April, and primary metals orders posted a 1.4 percent rise, to $15.1 billion, after a 7.6 percent April increase.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, an indication of business investment in new equipment, rose 9.6 percent last month to $46.7 billion after falling 12.6 percent in April.
Shipments of durable goods, an indication of current demand, increased 1.9 percent in May to $170.5 billion after a 2.1 percent increase in April.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Post Mild Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, displaying resiliency in the face of an economic report showing unexpected strength and a disappointing auction of new five-year notes.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 3/32 , to 876/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 7.03 percent, from 7.04 percent on Tuesday. 
 Bond prices dropped early in the session after the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods rose 3.3 percent in May, the biggest monthly rise since August 1995.
The market has been very sensitive to signs that the economy is growing at a faster pace, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon.
But prices soon recovered as analysts noted that orders for aircraft and parts accounted for most of the increase. Still, Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, warned against dismissing the importance of the durable-goods reports.
"Even excluding civilian aircraft, durable goods orders rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in May on the heels of a 1.1 percent gain in April and eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in March, figures that should hardly be dismissed and clearly reinforce the continued forward momentum of the durable goods sector," Mr. Fine said.
In any case, the durable goods report did not change the market's expectations that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise short-term interest rates this summer, if not at next week's meeting of Fed policy makers than at the August meeting.
Many market participants expect the Fed's first tightening will be an increase of 25 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point. The Fed's policy making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday.
In addition to worries over inflation picking up and the Fed raising interest rates, traders and analysts have recently been concerned about the ability of dealers to absorb new securities coming to market.
But market participants largely shrugged off a mediocre Treasury auction of new five-year notes yesterday.
At the auction, the high yield was awarded at 6.674 percent. A high between 6.67 percent and 6.675 percent had been expected.
But the bid-to-cover ratio, which measures demand, was a bit weak, traders said, although small investors showed strong interest.
The only economic data facing the market today is the Labor Department's weekly report on the number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits. Analysts expect a small decline of 2,000, to 355,000, which would keep intact the trend in the claims numbers since effects of a strike against the General Motors Corporation ended this spring.
In the municipal market, the New York State Housing Finance Agency tentatively priced $489.7 million in mortgage revenue bonds through underwriters led by Paine Webber Inc.
The New York agency's securities, whose interest and principal payments are secured by insurance issued by Financial Security Assurance, are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Yields range from 4.35 percent for an issue due in 1998 to 6.05 percnet in 2011, with a long maturity of 2015 priced to yield 6.20 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Lyons Talks May Prove Unpleasant For the U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: LYONS, France, June 26

 BODY:
When the United States once again failed to send a check this spring to the World Bank fund that provides aid to the world's poorest nations, the other contributors -- chiefly Europe and Japan -- decided to teach a deadbeat a lesson.
They barred American companies from bidding on a range of projects financed by the fund, which brings agricultural science, food and health programs to villages in Africa and India. The United States Treasury estimates the sanctions will probably cost American companies $250 million to $300 million. 
 As economic sanctions go these days, it was relatively small punishment. But the testiness behind the message was clear, and it explains why the summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies, which opens here on Thursday, was shaping up as an uncomfortable one for President Clinton.
Tonight, the exact agenda of the summit meeting was uncertain. President Clinton, who arrived here late tonight, said earlier in the day that the fight against terrorism should be the "first order of business" at the conference. He was speaking in the wake of a bomb attack on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 United States military personnel.
Before that attack, the White House had hoped to use the meeting to underscore America's economic success compared to its biggest rivals to an election-year audience back home: Nearly 10 million new jobs, far ahead of the field, and the group's lowest budget deficit, at least when measured as a percentage of national output.
But the host of the meeting, President Jacques Chirac of France, has made it clear that he plans to put foreign aid at the top of the agenda.
In the French Parliament on Tuesday, Mr. Chirac's Foreign Minister, Herve de Charette, cited statistics showing that the United States was falling to the bottom of the heap of major donors to needy countries.
"The American share is in constant decline, year after year," Mr. de Charette said. "That is the selfishness which is unacceptable. That is why President Chirac decided to put aid to the third world on the agenda of the G-7."
The Administration is arguing that the best way to help the world economy is to create jobs. "We have not met our own goals in terms of aid," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin acknowledged. "On the other hand, this economy has created 9.7 million new jobs, compared to roughly zero elsewhere," he said, a reference to the stagnation that has gripped Germany, Italy, Japan and France, and the relatively modest job growth for Canada and Britain, the other two members of group.
The struggle to define America's performance as the world's unchallenged economic leader or as an increasingly miserly one will not, of course, be the only subject of conversation as the leaders meet and dine, and dine again, in this city awash in Beaujolais. The reconstruction of Bosnia, along with the Russian election next week, which is keeping President Boris N. Yeltsin from attending as an unofficial eighth member, are bound to dominate many of the political meetings.
So will the American effort to prevent Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations, from winning a second five-year term. Mr. Boutros-Ghali will appear here on Saturday as a "special guest" of Mr. Chirac, along with the leaders of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. They will all be meeting with the leaders to discuss development and trade issues, in a session that will be Mr. Boutros-Ghali's first encounter with Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher since they announced their effort to oust him, and he announced his intention to fight back.
"I'm sure there will be smiles all around," one of Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy advisers said the other day.
Anti-terrorism was on the agenda even before the truck-bomb attack on Tuesday. But today Mr. Clinton's advisers were wondering aloud how the attack may alter the discussion over another tense division between Europe and Washington: The expanding movement in Congress, with the Administration's support, to punish foreign corporations that invest in Iran, Libya and Cuba.
Mr. Clinton's advisers say that despite these disputes, the President will not be on the defensive. Secretary Rubin, the President's chief economic strategist, said in Washington the other day that Mr. Clinton will "clearly be asserting economic leadership."
"In past years, we were viewed by many as an economy that was waning, and that hurt American Presidents at summit meetings," Mr. Rubin said. "Today, and whenever I go to an economic summit meeting, we are seen as the leader of the economic world."

HEADLINE: Auto Plant Closes And Developers See Opportunity;
North Tarrytown Focuses On Its Future Instead of the Past

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
After 11 years as an electrician at the old, smoke-stained General Motors plant that rises over the bank of the Hudson River here, Nancy McCague might be expected to be saddened, perhaps even angry, as the plant fades into the history of American manufacturing.
The plant, to be closed on Friday, began assembling steam-powered cars in 1900 and has been making Chevys since 1915. And Ms. McCague's father, brother and sister all worked there. 
 But now, as one of 2,100 workers here who will be transferred, laid off, given early retirement or simply dismissed, Ms. McCague said she had accepted what had been inevitable for years.
"There just isn't a life for me here anymore," said Ms. McCague, 34, who spends more than two hours a day commuting from Wappingers Falls because she cannot afford to live closer. She will report in August to a G.M. plant in Doraville, Ga., just outside Atlanta, retaining almost all her Tarrytown salary in an area where housing costs are far less. "Sure, it's sad to see this old plant close," Ms. McCague said, "but I think it's for the best."
Not all of North Tarrytown's displaced auto workers are so sanguine, but Ms. McCague's sentiments are widely shared by business people, urban planners and government officials in Westchester County and across the New York region, who consider the plant here an economic anomaly at a time when heavy manufacturing and assembly-line production have become close to extinct in New York City and its suburbs.
And there are many in this fashionable suburb 25 miles north of Manhattan who are almost gleeful about the opportunity that will be created when G.M. cleans up the polluted 97-acre site and this prime parcel of riverfront property becomes available for development.
The land is coveted by developers. Unlike most of Westchester County's Hudson River waterfront, it is not separated from the river by Metro-North's train tracks because much of it was created as landfill between the tracks and the river during the 1930's.
"People at the plant may consider this the end of an American dream, but it is the beginning of a dream for the people of North Tarrytown," said Sean Treacy, the village's Mayor. He favors turning the G.M. property into expensive housing.
Other alternatives are being studied by a committee appointed last year by Gov. George E. Pataki. Although a final recommendation is not expected for at least a week, a summary of the committee's conclusions, obtained yesterday from state officials, proposed a combination of two alternatives: a "historic Hudson Valley village" of condominiums for young couples or retirees, and an industrial park for small high-technology companies.
Mayor Treacy said the prospects were exciting to most people in North Tarrytown, where the average selling price of a four-bedroom home last year was $341,000 and where residents were more likely to be investment bankers than auto workers. He said the plant was out of place. "Now we have the chance to recast our image," he said.
To many economists and business executives in the New York region, the only real surprise is that the plant survived as long as it did. In a region whose economy is now threatened more by layoffs of management workers at banks, insurance companies and other financial-service concerns, and by cuts at high-technology concerns like I.B.M. and AT&T, the experts say the demise of this plant simply underscores the forces that have been carving away at heavy manufacturing in the region for decades.
They also say the closing provides a cautionary tale to government officials, reflecting the waste that can result from government campaigns to prop up and retain declining businesses. In its last campaign to persuade G.M. not to close this plant, in 1987, New York State invested $25 million to raise rail overpasses between North Tarrytown and Albany, enabling the company to ship by rail instead of truck.
At the time, G.M. decided to refit its assembly line here for minivans, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said he expected the agreement to keep North Tarrytown in the auto making business well beyond the millennium. But in 1992, faced with disappointing demand for its minivans, G.M. said the plant would close after four more years of production.
"That plant is a mismatch," said Rae Rosen, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a former auto industry analyst for Merrill Lynch. Just as the costs of assembling cars here proved too high for G.M., she said the cost of living in or near North Tarrytown make it a bad location for the kind of workers who would most benefit from heavy manufacturing.
The closing does not eliminate auto manufacturing in the New York region, however. New Jersey has two assembly plants, a Ford plant in Edison that employs 1,717 and a G.M. plant in Linden that employs 2,780.
But some analysts say that any large assembly plant that has survived within 100 miles of New York is living on borrowed time. "The wage levels, the presence of unions, the cost of houses and commercial property, the tax and regulatory burden: they all work against this region," said David Hensley, a regional economist with Salamon Brothers.
Those pressures have not been lost on workers here, who make an average of $19.01 an hour and have known since 1993 that their jobs would be eliminated this week. Some said they saw the writing on the wall long before that. "This plant is too old to compete, particularly when states in the Midwest are happy to give you the land and build the plant for you," said Carl Thane, who has worked here for 12 years, commuting from Clifton, N.J.
Like Ms. McCague, he has accepted a transfer to the Doraville plant, to which the company plans to shift the minivan production it is eliminating here. "They've given us three years to plan our lives, and I don't see any hardship in that," he said.
G.M. said that 1,300 workers, or more than half of its North Tarrytown employees, had accepted transfers to other plants spread across the eastern half of the nation, from Louisiana to Ohio.
Most of them -- 900 -- have already reported to their new jobs, the company said, and have been replaced by temporary workers here. Those workers were told that as a condition of being hired they would be dismissed without benefits when the plant closed.
Another large group of workers -- 660 -- accepted incentives to retire, including an offer of full pension benefits to anyone with 28 years of service, which is two years less than is normally required.
Still, the options offered workers here have not prevented sacrifices in many of their lives.
"I don't know what I will do," said Peter Katsaris, a carpenter here for 27 and a half years, not quite enough time to qualify for early retirement. Since his wife has recently had surgery and is undergoing physical therapy, and his son has just entered college in New Jersey, he said he had refused a transfer outside the New York region.
Instead, he said, he was hoping for a transfer to the plant in Linden, and will go on layoff until a carpenter position opens there. But he said he saw little hope of an opening in Linden any time soon. G.M. said 130 of its workers here had elected to go on layoff while awaiting jobs at plants of their choosing.
Given the plant's long history, plans for the final days at North Tarrytown plant may seem surprisingly low key. Sometime today, the last minivan will roll off the assembly line as workers stand by somberly, upholding a long tradition in the auto industry that looks something like a wake in honor of the last of a line of vehicles.
On Friday, G.M. said, workers will gather for brief exchanges of farewell comments inside the plant before it is padlocked for good. On both days, reporters and the public will be banned from the plant, the company said. Then, negotiations over what comes next for 97 acres of prime waterfront real estate under the Tappan Zee Bridge begin in earnest.
"General Motors wants to walk away as gracefully as it can, and our job is to bring the parties together," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and Governor Pataki's chief economic adviser, who will preside over discussions between the company and North Tarrytown.
"No one likes to see jobs lost, but this is a situation where we have a great piece of property and we will make the most of it," he said.

HEADLINE: Head of Carpenters' Union Is Dismissed in an Office Raid

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
In a raid on his office by national union officials and private guards, the head of the carpenters' union in the New York City area was abruptly dismissed yesterday from his $360,000-a-year job on charges of corruption and favoritism to mobsters.
The union leader, Frederick W. Devine, who in the last five years had withstood a battery of investigations by Federal officials and complaints of nepotism and lavish living by challengers, was dismissed along with his four top aides by the national union's new general president, Douglas J. McCarron. 
 As president of the 26,000-member union since 1991, Mr. Devine, 58, was one of the region's most powerful trade union leaders. His decisions in labor negotiations affected commercial and residential construction costs, and his endorsement and financial support was solicited by political candidates for local and national office.
Taking the unusual step of removing Mr. Devine without a hearing, Mr. McCarron said he had acted after reviewing testimony by cooperating prosecution witnesses in Federal criminal and civil cases that Mr. Devine had been linked to Mafia figures in the Colombo and Genovese crime families.
Mr. McCarron also rebuked Mr. Devine for sanctioning the hiring of mobsters for lucrative trade show jobs at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and in other sites at the expense of ordinary union members.
On Tuesday night, a group of national union officials accompanied by more than a dozen private guards took control of the headquarters of the region's union, the District Council of New York City and Vicinity of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, at 395 Hudson Street in lower Manhattan.
Mr. Devine was not in his plush-carpeted, wood-paneled office overlooking the Hudson River when the takeover occurred, and his secretary said yesterday that he was out of town on business and could not be reached immediately.
Douglas J. Banes, the first vice president of the national union, who was appointed by Mr. McCarron as the temporary supervisor of the district council, said Mr. Devine had been dropped from the payroll and all the office locks had been changed.
"The district council has been out of line for many, many years," Mr. Banes said in an interview. "We intend to clean this up once and for all for the benefit of thousands of rank and file members."
Mr. McCarron, who was elected in November as the general president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, said in a statement that he had the authority to remove Mr. Devine and his aides for actions "detrimental to the welfare and interests of the membership."
Mr. McCarron cited Mr. Devine's support of Anthony Fiorino to handle job assignments for union members at the Javits Center even after he learned that Mr. Fiorino was the brother-in-law of Liborio Bellomo, reputedly the acting boss of the Genovese crime family. Last year, after state officials at the center ousted all suspected mobsters, Mr. McCarron said Mr. Devine had continued a corrupt job referral system for the mob at trade shows in hotels that generated about $1 million a year in wages.
Mr. McCarron said that Federal prosecutors and Kenneth Conboy, a former Federal judge investigating abuses in the district council, supplied evidence that Mr. Devine had accepted payments from two contractors and that he had been influenced by Thomas Petrizzo, whom prosecutors have identified as a captain in the Colombo crime family.
Mr. McCarron also said Mr. Devine had mismanaged the district council's funds, hired unnecessary employees to administer the council, leased luxury cars, run up excessive legal bills, fired dissidents from union jobs and used union money for his re-election campaign last year.
Last year, Mr. Devine secretly raised his annual salary to $360,791, making him one of the nation's five highest paid union officials. About 40 percent of the district's members were unemployed.
Under Mr. Devine's stewardship, the union spent $100 million for its headquarters building, which includes a tree-lined atrium next to his office.
Also dismissed were William Reardon, first vice president; William Hanley, second vice president; Robert J. Cavanaugh, secretary-treasurer, and Raymond O'Kane, trustees chairman.

If the U.S. doesn't follow trade rules, why should others?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Cray Research, the Minneapolis-based maker of supercomputers, seems to have taken that homily to heart. After failing to convince the National Science Foundation that it could build a better machine to simulate global warming than the NEC Corporation of Japan, Cray is attempting to nullify the foundation's decision through the back door. Friends of Cray in Congress have slipped a provision into the foundation's proposed budget that would effectively bar completion of the deal with the Japanese.
More is at stake here than the $35 million contract announced last month. "Since the late 1970's, America has been pressuring Japan to play fair on government procurement," said Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan. By changing the rules when it suits American interests, Washington is risking hard-won progress in opening up the Japanese market. 
 Supercomputers -- machines that can crunch numbers at multiples of the speeds of the giant mainframes that dominated the computer market in the 1970's -- were once thought to be the key to the future of the data processing industry. It didn't work out that way, though. Supercomputers now dominate niches in electronic eavesdropping, nuclear weapons design, high-energy physics, weather forecasting and oil exploration -- important and prestigious uses, certainly, but ones unlikely to deliver a big technological or commercial payoff to the manufacturers.
That hasn't stopped NEC, Fujitsu or Hitachi, which all invested heavily in supercomputers in the 1980's, from fighting for sales. Indeed, Cray won equal consideration in bidding on Japanese Government contracts only after President George Bush threatened trade sanctions in 1989.
But the supercomputer market, long dominated by American brands, is now up for grabs. Hitachi currently owns bragging rights as the maker of the fastest supercomputer in the world. More important from Cray's perspective, recent sales in Canada and Europe suggest that NEC and Fujitsu machines are now highly competitive in weather forecasting. So it was no great shock to computer gurus when the Government's top science research agency chose a computer from NEC, despite Cray's none-too-subtle contentions that American jobs and security were at risk.
Ailing Cray, which was recently bought by Silicon Graphics after prodding from the Defense Department, has lots of friends in high places. Three days after the NEC award, the acting head of the Commerce Department's Import Administration wrote to the National Science Foundation to warn that the Japanese bid was "substantially" below the manufacturer's cost and thus potentially subject to antidumping penalties.
Greg Rushford, the publisher of the Rushford Report, a Washington-based newsletter on trade politics, said the warning was unusual for a variety of reasons. One Federal agency rarely interferes with procurements by another unless it is invited. More striking yet, the Commerce Department issued the warning before it had begun an independent inquiry or even given NEC a chance to defend itself.
But the surprises were just beginning. Two weeks ago, Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat with close ties to Cray, amended a draft of the science foundation's appropriations bill to deny funds for the salaries of personnel "who approve a contract for the purchase, lease or acquisition in any manner of supercomputing equipment" after a "preliminary determination" by the Commerce Department that the offering was "at any other than fair value."
This stealth attack was bipartisan: An effort by Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican, to scratch the Obey amendment was brushed aside by fellow committee members. That suggests it has a good chance of surviving in the 1997 appropriations bill, which is supposed to be completed by Oct. 1.
The White House has yet to take a position on the Obey amendment. And for the moment Tokyo is apparently hoping the conflict can be resolved privately before it becomes a high-profile political issue back home. So far, the only reaction -- from Hajime Ito, a senior trade official at the Japanese Embassy in Washington -- is a mild expression of "serious concern." But Mr. Ito suggests that the initiative violates World Trade Organization rules. If true, that could lead to another embarrassing defeat for America in the new trade body.
Mr. Kolbe remains publicly optimistic that Congress will discard the Obey amendment. "This is such a flagrant violation of the spirit of our laws that I think it will come out," he said. But he does not hide his frustration that it has gotten this far. "We make a big point of telling other nations they must live by the rule of law," he notes, "and then we turn around and pull this kind of stunt."
